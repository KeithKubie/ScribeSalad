00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.470
Every video until
now, we've been

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.110
working from the assumption
that the observable universe is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.360
smaller than the
entire universe.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.790
And if you go by the
cosmic inflation theory--

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.340
and it was founded by Alan Guth.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.890
And I have almost personal
connection to Alan Guth.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.660
When I was at MIT, I always
used to go to this Chinese food

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.160
truck.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.090
And I always used to show up at
the food truck like two seconds

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.000
before Alan Guth.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
Like he was always one or
two people behind me in line.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.260
But anyway, he was the founder
of the cosmic inflation theory,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.770
which is basically this idea
that in the very early moments

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.030
or the very early period
after the Big Bang,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.420
we went through
this major inflation

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.900
in the expansion of space.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.180
But anyway, based on the theory
of cosmic inflation, then

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.480
the observable universe is
on the order of-- or maybe

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.230
another way to say it,
the entire universe

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.240
is on the order of--
10 to the 23 times

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.370
the size of the
observable universe.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.010
So that would mean that this
is just a tiny, tiny fraction.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.970
I mean, this is an
unimaginable large number.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.840
In fact, it is unimaginable.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.790
So already everything
we've talked about,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.450
this itself is a huge--
this is an incomprehensible

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.210
amount of space.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.870
But this is an
incomprehensible multiple

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.920
of this incomprehensible
amount of space.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.800
And that's just
based on that theory.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.990
But it is possible-- we cannot
rule out even the idea--

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.550
that the actual universe is
smaller than the observable

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.050
universe.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.634
And that one is
in some ways even

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.800
more mind blowing than the
idea that the universe is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.970
this big, the fact that
what we're observing

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.995
is actually larger than
the actual universe.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.120
And so you might say, well,
Sal, that's impossible.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.867
But just think about
it a little bit.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:00.200
This is the observable universe.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.658
And the way we've
depicted it, it's

00:02:01.658 --> 00:02:03.820
based on how long the light
has taken to reach us.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.940
We've already covered before
that this point in space

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.800
is now 46 billion light
years away, not 13.7,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.420
the way it looks
right over here.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.300
It just took 13.7 billion
years to reach us.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.520
If there's any photon that
would take longer than 13.7

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.770
billion years to reach us,
it hasn't reached just yet.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.880
Because it could have only
started 13.7 billion years ago.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.560
So they're on their way.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.746
And they started at
some point outside

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.870
of our observable universe.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.270
So our observable universe
will grow over time.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.040
But with that
said, let's imagine

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.570
that the actual
universe is a subset

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.820
of this observable universe.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.950
Let's say it's roughly
half the diameter.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.610
So let's say it looks like this.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.980
Maybe I'll make it a
little bit of an oval.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.026
Maybe the actual
universe-- and this

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.650
is just to be a little
bit provocative.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.240
And it's not impossible.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.314
Let's say that this is
the actual universe.

00:02:57.314 --> 00:02:58.730
And the way I drew
it, it makes it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.584
look like Earth is the center.

00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:01.750
That we're the center of it.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.470
But remember, this is very
likely to be the surface--

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.670
or it is curved.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.860
It has a slight curvature.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.160
But it could very
well be the surface

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.760
of a four-dimensional object.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.410
And maybe the simplest
one to visualize

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.941
is four-dimensional sphere.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:18.440
So if you really
wanted to visualize

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.560
this right, this whole
volume-- and remember

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.790
this whole picture, it keeps
looking two-dimensional.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.940
But it has depth.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.280
It is a volume of space,
an incredibly vast volume

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.900
of space.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.460
And so what I've
done here is this

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.240
is an ellipsoid right here.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.820
It's elliptical volume
of space that I've

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.000
bubbled out right over here.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.210
But if this was really
the entire universe,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.700
and if the entire
universe really

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.590
were the surface of a
four-dimensional sphere,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.720
then the reality is
that this entire space

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.480
could be represented like this.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.920
It could be represented
as the surface.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.700
If this was a four-dimensional
sphere-- obviously,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.490
I can only draw
three-dimensional spheres.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.760
But let me show you that
it's not just a circle,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.120
that it actually has
some depth to it.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.370
And I can even shade
it right over here.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.240
And so you can imagine
that this point over here

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.173
is actually the same thing
as that point over there.

00:04:14.173 --> 00:04:16.089
That they have wrapped
around and that they're

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.714
connected right at
the back over here--

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:21.630
let me go behind-- that they're
connected right over there.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.740
And that this point
and this point

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.790
are actually the same point,
that they've wrapped around.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.020
Maybe they've wrapped around.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.811
Actually, the way I've
drawn it right here,

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:36.040
they would actually all
wrap around right back there

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.520
at that point, if I'm
visualizing properly.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.600
But if you go in
any one direction,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.540
you would come back on the
other side of the surface.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.070
Let's say that
Earth is right here.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.830
The way we depicted it,
Earth is the center.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.580
But we see that when
you look I like this,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.090
there is no center to the
surface of a sphere, even

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.850
a four-dimensional sphere.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.010
So in this sense, if you
go in any one direction,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.577
you'll come back
out the other side.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.910
So if you start from Earth
and you go in that direction,

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.784
once you get there,
you're really here again.

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.780
And then you would
come back to Earth.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.920
And so if this were the
case, if the actual volume

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.891
of the true universe was
smaller than what it looks like,

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.390
the observable
universe, then what's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.150
all this stuff on the outside?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.960
And to think about
it, think about what

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.920
would happen if 13.7
billion years ago, when

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.200
we were in that primitive
state, where that background

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.660
radiation, those
photons are being--

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.620
those electromagnetic
waves are being released,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.900
let's say they get released.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.230
And those photons on
their first pass--

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.330
and I think you know where this
is going-- on their first pass,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.110
they would get to us in about--
this looks like a distance

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.590
of about, I don't
know, this looks

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.830
like about 6 billion years.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.040
Then they would pass us up.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.890
And then they would
get back to this point

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.682
again in another
6 billion years.

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.140
And then they would
come back here.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.580
And so that very
first past photon

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.070
are going to be right over here.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.770
And from our point
of view, we're

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.196
not going to see them for
a couple of billion years.

00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:02.570
And so when we do
see them, we're

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.403
going to perceive them--
we're going to say,

00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:07.990
wow, it took 15, 16 billion
years for that photon

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.810
to get to me.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.770
That must be from
something out here.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.020
But the reality is it's
a photon from something

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.720
within a smaller physical
universe, within a smaller

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.770
actual universe, that's just
taken several passes by us.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.050
And we're just seeing a
pass after 14 billion years.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.259
We just think it's from
something further out.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.800
Now the other thing
is you say, well,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.740
if this was the case,
if we could just

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.539
go in one direction
of the universe

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.830
and then come out of the
other side, and if all of that

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.620
was within the
observable universe,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.980
wouldn't we be able to tell?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.390
Wouldn't we be able to
look in two directions

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.610
and see the same thing from
a different perspective?

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.420
And the answer there is to
think about what happens--

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.130
or actually, wouldn't we even
be able to see ourselves?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.402
Because we emit some light,
and it would take maybe--

00:06:55.402 --> 00:06:56.610
I don't know how far that is.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.430
Let's say that's 6 or
7 billion light years

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.315
to get right over here, which
would be right over there.

00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:03.690
And then it would take another
6 or 7 billion light years

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.820
to get over there.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.520
So maybe that background
radiation we're seeing

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.220
is actually background radiation
emitted from that exact point

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.660
in space that we are right now,
or from a very similar point

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.465
in space, to where
we are right now.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.060
Or part of the
background radiation

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.990
is from a similar point in
space that we are right now.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.760
So how come we can't
just see ourselves?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.400
Well, I kind of just
answered the question.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.570
That second pass, if you're
observing the same point

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.250
in space, if you're
observing light

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.160
from the same point in
space on a previous pass,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.440
that light was emitted a
long, long, long time ago,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.900
maybe 13 billion years ago.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.620
And so it would
be unrecognizable.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.740
This region of space,
the region of space

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.190
that we are in right now, if
we saw the same region of space

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.469
13 billion years ago, we
just wouldn't recognize it.

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:55.010
Now, there are some
people attempting

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.680
to see if there
are some patterns,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.200
see if you can model how
the universe would change

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200
and if you see patterns.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.544
And maybe the actual universe
is a subset of the observable.

00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:05.710
We just haven't seen it yet.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.472
But it's completely
a possibility.

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:09.805
Hopefully, I didn't confuse you.

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.510
I actually find this kind
of an interesting idea.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.550
That this light that
has taken 13-- let's

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.610
say the light that's taken us
8 billion years to reach us.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.387
We think it's from something,
based on this scale,

00:08:23.387 --> 00:08:24.470
8 billion light years out.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.200
It's actually further because
the universe is expanding.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.889
So it would have actually
traversed more space than that.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.680
But we think it's from
something like that.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.299
But it could've been
something further

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.630
in, if the actual
universe is smaller.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.220
And it's just on
its second pass.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.659
It's actually coming back again.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.932
And that's why it took 8
billion years to reach us.

00:08:40.932 --> 00:08:42.640
And we don't even
recognize it because it

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.360
looks very different than that
region of space right now.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.060
Or that region of space
after 4 billion years

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.880
looks completely different than
it did when it first released.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.880
Anyway, hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.800
But I think this is a
fascinating, fascinating topic.
