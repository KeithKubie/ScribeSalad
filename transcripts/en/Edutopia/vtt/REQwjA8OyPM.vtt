00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:05.196
&gt;&gt;Ariana: Hi.

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:05.876
My name is Ariana.

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:07.676
I'm in 8th grade, and I'm writing a book

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:09.696
about a corrupt government
that went too far.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.476
&gt;&gt;Wally: I'm Wally, and I'm
writing a book about a kid

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:15.766
with supernatural abilities.

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.136
&gt;&gt;Girl: I'm writing a novel
about a girl getting sucked

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:19.386
into an alternate universe.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:24.426
&gt;&gt;Girl: My book is about
trying to escape an island.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:28.646
&gt;&gt;Boy: People trying to figure out what
happened to their very healthy yet,

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:30.696
for some reason, dying father.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.006
&gt;&gt;Caitlyn: I'm Caitlyn, and I wrote
my first novel, "Neglected Heroes,"

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.416
when I was in the 8th grade.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:38.946
&gt;&gt;Wally: When I think of a novel, I
think about a pretty, a pretty fat book.

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:43.206
And writing that much
seems pretty impossible.

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:46.166
&gt;&gt;Ariana: Especially when my teacher
first said it, she was just like,

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:46.916
"You're going to write a book."

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:48.666
And I was like, what?

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:51.486
&gt;&gt;Boy: I also felt super-freaked-out,

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.756
because I had no idea
what I was going to do.

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.166
&gt;&gt;Caitlyn: I was convinced
that it was only something

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.476
that adults were allowed to do.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.396
&gt;&gt;Girl: The biggest challenge
was setting up all the characters

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:02.586
and then getting the setting.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:06.296
&gt;&gt;Girl: And to take that feedback
and to turn it into something better.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:10.106
&gt;&gt;Ariana: I think the most exciting part
about writing this novel in 30 days is

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:11.686
that I never thought I'd do it.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:15.246
&gt;&gt;Boy: It is possible to write
a book in just one month.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:19.016
&gt;&gt;Caitlyn: When I published
my novel, I felt invincible.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.806
&gt;&gt;Ariana: Well, now impossible
just seems so much more reachable.

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:22.696
&gt;&gt;Girl: Don't give up.

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:24.186
&gt;&gt;Wally: Everyone has a story.

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:26.076
&gt;&gt;Ariana: Well, the ending
of my story is going

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.566
to be the main character's friends die.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:28.686
Yeah.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.196
&gt;&gt;Wally: And then they're
going to defeat the bad guy.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:31.976
The End.
