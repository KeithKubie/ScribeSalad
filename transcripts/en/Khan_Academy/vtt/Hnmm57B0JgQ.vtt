00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:01.682
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.682 --> 00:00:02.515
Hello, Rosie.

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:03.696
- [Voiceover] Hi, Paige.

00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:04.605
- [Voiceover] So in this
video we're gonna talk

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.443
about compound-complex sentences.

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:10.565
- [Voiceover] So we just
covered complex sentences

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:13.817
in the last video which
is where you've got

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:17.875
a simple sentence or
one independent clause

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:19.857
and then that's accompanied

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:22.849
by at least one dependent clause.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.943
So, the compound-complex sentence
is a little bit different.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.035
In this one you have a compound sentence

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:32.535
which is more than one independent clause,

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.884
and also at least one dependent clause.

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:41.167
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
it's like there's compound

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.425
and there's complex

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.143
and this is a combination of both of them.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.332
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:48.560
- [Voiceover] Right, okay,
so, compound-complex takes

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.565
the more than one independent clause

00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:55.968
from a compound sentence
and the dependent clause

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:59.301
or more than one from a complex sentence

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:04.479
and puts them together
so you have at least

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.646
two independent clauses and
at least one dependent clause.

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.999
I say at least 'cause you
could have more than one

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.999
or more than two of either of those.

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:18.795
But, it has to be at least that.

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:21.811
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:23.265
- [Voiceover] So, Rosie, just to make sure

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.605
this all makes sense,
can we get an example

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:27.524
of a compound-complex sentence?

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.408
- [Voiceover] After the storm passed,

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:32.589
I went outside and I picked flowers.

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:33.644
- [Voiceover] That's lovely.

00:01:33.644 --> 00:01:35.447
- [Voiceover] Isn't that nice?

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:40.112
- [Voiceover] Okay, so I went
outside and I picked flowers

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:42.560
are both independent clauses.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.808
Ignoring after the storm passed,

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:47.767
if we just had I went
outside and I picked flowers,

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:51.279
that's a compound sentence,
that's two independent clauses.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.359
So then we add after the storm passed

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.475
which is a dependent clause

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:58.544
and that makes it compound-complex.

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:02.199
We have at least two independent clauses

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:05.762
and at least one dependent clause.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:09.244
So in this case exactly
two and exactly one.

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:13.166
Rosie, can you tell me
about your friend Alberto

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.575
in a compound-complex sentence, please.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:16.475
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.766
My friend Alberto, well, you'll see.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.566
Though he has a crippling walnut allergy,

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:25.883
Alberto bravely walked
through the walnut grove,

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:28.378
but he made sure to wear long sleeves.

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:29.542
- [Voiceover] That's a good call.

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:30.574
- [Voiceover] Yeah, he's smart.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:32.364
- [Voiceover] Yeah, smart kid.

00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:34.462
So, again, if we just say,

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:36.712
Alberto bravely walked
through the walnut grove,

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.347
but he made sure to make long sleeves,

00:02:38.347 --> 00:02:40.319
that's a compound sentence.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.890
There's two independent clauses,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.388
Alberto bravely walked through
the walnut grove is one,

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:47.906
and then the second one is

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:50.512
but he made sure to wear long sleeves.

00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:54.251
But then, again, we add a
dependent clause at the beginning,

00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:57.283
though he has a crippling walnut allergy.

00:02:57.283 --> 00:02:59.640
That is what makes it compound-complex,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.078
it has elements of compound,
the two independent clauses

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:06.801
and it has an element of
complex, the dependent clause,

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:11.352
but Rosie, these are
both the minimum number.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:14.412
These sentences both have
the minimum number of each

00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:16.286
independent and dependent clauses.

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:21.035
So, can we see something maybe
that has like more clauses?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.330
- [Voiceover] Yeah, sure.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.497
Well, let's take a look at
this first sentence we have,

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:31.374
I think we can add a
dependent clause to that.

00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:32.207
Let's give it a try.

00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:36.354
After the storm passed, I went
outside and I picked flowers

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:37.649
because they were beautiful.

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.580
- [Voiceover] Okay, I see.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.094
Right, so this is a case
where we see we can have

00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:47.839
more than one dependent
clause if we want to, right.

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.041
I know I keep saying this,
but two independent clauses

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.173
and one dependent clause are the minimum

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:54.673
for a compound-complex sentence.

00:03:54.673 --> 00:03:56.783
It can have more, and it still qualifies

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:59.274
as compound-complex.

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:01.850
So that's compound-complex sentences.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.719
They are like compound in that

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.582
they have more than
one independent clause,

00:04:05.582 --> 00:04:07.060
and they're like complex in that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.528
they also have dependent clauses.

00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:12.168
You can learn anything, Paige out.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.001
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
