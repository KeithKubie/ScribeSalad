[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:06.750
BRENT GLEESON: Thank you.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.800
Thank you very much.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.374
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:13.290
People, we're going to
do burpees and push-ups

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.786
until morale improves in here.

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:15.660
Let's try that again.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.650
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.190
AUDIENCE: Good!

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.390
BRENT GLEESON: You guys
fired up to be here?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.340
BRENT GLEESON: All right.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.881
I just want to make
sure you guys are

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.130
awake and energized, engaged.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.700
I want to make sure I don't get
the sleepy after-lunch crowd.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.790
You know how that
can go sometimes.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.410
And the reason I ask is
because in the early days

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.570
of SEAL training, you spend
a hell of a lot of time

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.650
in the classroom.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.380
You're basically getting
a PhD in Special Warfare.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.650
But of course, you do
so on very little sleep.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.590
So the instructors would keep
these large metal bathtubs

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.080
full of ice water in
the back of the room.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.779
Guess what those were for?

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:48.570
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.320
You know where I'm
going with this.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.920
If you got caught nodding
off, falling asleep,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.370
not paying attention,
you got to sit chest deep

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.250
in a bathtub full of ice
water for the rest of class.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.750
Yeah.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.620
Not a head dunk.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.450
Not for one or two minutes.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.310
For the rest of class.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.740
Let me tell you, it's really
hard to learn anything

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.780
when you're shivering
your ass off, reaching

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.065
hypothermic levels, in a
bathtub full of ice water.

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:16.310
Now, how the hell
do I know that?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.410
Yes, unfortunately, I spent
many, many days and hours

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.230
in those ice baths, clearly
not learning from my mistakes

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.007
the first time around.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.340
And in light of being fully
transparent with all of you,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.724
I did, in fact, request
ice baths for this event.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.140
Fortunately for
all of you, you're

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.120
overprotective human resources
department denied my request,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.480
so you're off the hook.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.950
But I'll be watching you.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.642
No, in all honesty, thank
you so much for having me.

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:44.100
It's really a pleasure and
honor to be here with all of you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770
this afternoon.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.580
So when a SEAL platoon is on
patrol in enemy territory,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.160
sneaking into an enemy
compound, the man in front

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.210
is the point man.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.800
He's taking point.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.220
Leading his team into what
we call VUCA environments.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.985
And yes, that's one
of the many hundreds

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.360
if not thousands of acronyms
we have in the United States

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.810
military, and it refers to the
volatile, uncertain, complex,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.210
and ambiguous environments
that we operate in.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.970
Sounds like life, right?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.460
And although Navy
SEALs are widely known

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.310
to be the most elite and
feared special operations

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.470
fighting force in
the entire world,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.020
we've been living in a
constant state of VUCA,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.810
of pain, of loss,
sacrifice and disruption,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.930
in our post-911 reality.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.450
Yet how have we continued
to persevere, adapt,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.220
and lean into that
pain and sacrifice,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.280
to fight and defeat a very
dangerous and decentralized

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.450
enemy?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.090
In large part, it's due to our
very well-defined and distinct

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.340
organizational
culture, a culture

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.340
where every single person
pushes the limits and boundaries

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.800
of their comfort zone
every single day.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.380
We get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.290
Or as we say in the SEAL
teams, we embrace the suck.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.050
And that's what we're going
to talk about today, how

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.470
to succeed by living a life
outside of your comfort zone.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.180
Because if you really
think about it,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.960
that's where the
magic really happens.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.630
It's not living in the
confines of your comfort zone.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.234
And when you can
push the boundaries

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:07.400
of your own personal comfort
zone just a little bit,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.865
every single day, the
wider that area becomes.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.240
And the things that
you used to fear,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.795
the things that
seemed uncomfortable,

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.045
or the things that seemed
almost seemingly impossible,

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:20.410
they become a part of
your everyday life.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.420
And that winning mindset of
persistence and determination

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.570
reminds me of a great
quote by Martin Luther King

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.620
Jr. That says, "if you
can't fly, you run.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.700
If you can't run, you walk.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.360
If you can't walk, you
crawl, but no matter

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.020
what, you keep moving forward."

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.150
In the SEAL teams, we have
an ethos, a creed that

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.480
embodies our culture
and our values,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.840
and a similar line from that
ethos says, I will not quit.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.310
I persevere and
thrive in adversity.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.890
And if knocked down, I will
get back up every time.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.454
I am never out of the fight.

00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:59.870
And that winning mindset is
how each and every one of you,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.650
all of us, can continue to
take point in our own lives,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.480
to push the confines
of our comfort zone,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.090
to push the limits, to take
calculated risks to succeed

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.728
and win, and to be
all in, all the time.

00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:12.644
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:15.632
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:04.360
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.860
All right.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.810
What do you think?

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.190
Does that remind you of
your workplace environments?

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.550
Maybe on Mondays, right?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.350
Being all in all the time is
one of the many philosophies

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.240
we hold dear in the SEAL teams.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.010
That phrase was
originally coined

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.430
by one of our fallen
SEAL Team 6 team leaders,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.140
his name was Tommy Valentine.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.600
And when he would indoctrinate
new guys into the team,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.058
he would sit them
down and ask them

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:28.860
about what they thought
their level of participation

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.000
on the team should be.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.340
Now, of course, there
was only one answer, that

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.200
is to be all in all the time.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.880
That is part of our
culture and mindset

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.490
and how we approach
our work, our lives.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.070
Simply put, it's about
persistence, determination,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.190
giving every single thing
we do everything we've got

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.200
and nothing less.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.890
We too, all of us, can
embody that winning mindset.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.500
And each and every one of
you can take away from this

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.900
how to embody that winning
mindset to get comfortable

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.070
being uncomfortable to win
and to be all in all the time.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.420
Well, it was December
of 1999 when I first

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.440
made my decision to be all in.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240
As sometimes happens in a
fit of youthful foolishness

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.300
and indiscretion, I quit
my corporate finance job

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.770
and joined the
United States Navy

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.987
with the dream of becoming
a SEAL, a decision,

00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:15.820
of course, that would
forever change my life

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.610
and set me on the path
that I'm on today.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.320
So this afternoon, I
would like to share

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.940
a little bit of that
journey with you,

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.460
share some stories from
training, from the battlefield,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.510
so to speak.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.430
But more importantly, I want
to share some experiences

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.730
from both literal and
figurative battlefields

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.860
about overcoming
adversity, about being

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.130
able to adapt your mindset
and approach to life, to work,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.980
and hopefully give you guys
some little bit of entertainment

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.815
and maybe even some
insights, key takeaways,

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.530
and God willing, maybe even
a little bit of inspiration

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.750
you can apply to your own
lives, both personally

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.500
and professionally.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.574
So let's dive in, shall we?

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.240
Do you guys want to
do burpees, or what?

00:07:52.412 --> 00:07:52.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.100
BRENT GLEESON: Let's
try that one more time.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.150
Let's dive in, shall we?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.900
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.941
BRENT GLEESON: All right.

00:07:56.941 --> 00:07:58.840
Now, as a bit of
background, I grew up

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.260
in the great nation of Texas.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.480
Do we have any
Texans in the room?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.040
Not one damn Texan
in the whole room.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.373
You guys have got to be kidding.

00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:09.000
I wore my boots for you guys.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.966
I'm wearing boots at Google.

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.520
A little fun fact for you guys.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.730
At any given time, about
one third of all SEALs

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.926
are from the great
state of Texas.

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:20.050
Now, I know you're a very
data-driven organization.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.915
Please don't go fact
checking that data.

00:08:21.915 --> 00:08:23.270
But I'm sure it's accurate.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.730
I just really, really
want to believe it.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.740
So I grew up in Dallas.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.920
I was a swimmer in high school,
played rugby in college.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.190
I attended Southern Methodist
University, Oxford University,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.909
ultimately, earning degrees
in finance and economics.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.770
So naturally, upon
graduation, I took a job

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.630
as an entry-level
financial analyst

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.357
with a big investment firm.

00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:44.440
And during that time, I
had a close friend of mine

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.270
in college who is
now a senior at SMU,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.130
and I was working out
in corporate America.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.190
Now he was, in fact, one of
these guys who had a vision.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.790
A lofty, and let's face it,
highly unrealistic vision

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.180
of becoming a SEAL.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.852
It was his passion, his purpose
in life, his reason for being.

00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:01.060
I thought it was a little
bit ridiculous at the time,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.200
but we started
training together.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.616
I wanted to find
a way to stay fit

00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:05.770
while I was working in
finance, prepare a friend

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.000
for an arduous journey.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.500
So we started spending a lot
of time together, and of course

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.340
having a lot of dialogue
about the history

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.280
of the SEAL teams, the Naval
Special Warfare community.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.760
I read one book, the I read
another book and another book.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.140
And I became, over time,
enthralled and fascinated

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.810
by their high-performance
culture and mindset

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.050
and approach to their work
and life, their core values.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.330
And over time, with all the
training and the studying

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.370
of the Naval Special
Warfare community,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.490
obviously, my close friends
and family and colleagues

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.170
started realizing
this growing passion

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.310
for my own possible rather
dynamic career path shift.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.170
So one day, I was
having a conversation

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.490
with my twin brother.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.680
I'll preface this by saying
we're fraternal twins.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.860
We are polar opposites in
just about every possible way.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.650
But I did want to run this
idea by him before I ran it

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.620
up the chain of
command to mom and dad,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.940
who would no doubt be a little
shocked by this dramatic shift.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.850
And you know what he was doing,
supportive brother that he

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.190
is, that's right.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.990
He was laughing his ass off.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.100
He's like, Brent, you've
got to be kidding me.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.600
SEALS?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.880
Like, you're not
being serious, right?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.240
I'll admit, I don't even
really know much about it,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.590
but I know one thing.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.130
There is no way in hell
you could ever do that.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.660
I mean, let's face it.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.690
Aren't these guys supposed to
be, I don't know, world-class

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.750
warriors or something?

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.370
Really tough guys?

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.814
You are not tough at all.

00:10:26.814 --> 00:10:28.230
I mean, let's break
it down, here.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.160
Well, yeah.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.610
Well, you have allergies.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.650
Really bad allergies.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.550
And asthma.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.380
You're literally
wheezing right now,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.796
and there's a
tissue on the floor.

00:10:36.796 --> 00:10:37.700
Is that yours?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.030
You wear those thick
contact lenses.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.240
You can't see shit.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.130
How is that going to work?

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.267
And remember last week?

00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:46.600
You forgot I thought about
this, but remember last week,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.334
when you cried a little bit
during that TV commercial?

00:10:50.334 --> 00:10:52.000
Again, don't know
much about it, but I'm

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.520
pretty certain SEALs
are nerdy, sniffly,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.600
emotional guys who cry during
a Clorox bleach commercial.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.750
So let's just forget we
had this conversation

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.190
and stick with your
nerdy finance job.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.230
Well, now I knew I
had to do it, right?

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.160
This is a true story.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.851
Literally a week
later, I quit my job,

00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:11.600
and my buddy, whom I'd
been training with,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.020
moved up here to Crested
Butte, Colorado, where

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.390
we trained for an additional
six months for five hours a day

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.910
at 10,000 feet altitude
to get into the best

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.730
physical condition
that we could.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.110
Then in early 2000,
joined the Navy,

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.135
and after a couple of
months of basic training,

00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:28.520
was on a plane, headed
out to sunny San Diego,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.760
California, where we
would begin our journey.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.130
And I can tell you with
exact certainty and clarity,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.890
like it was yesterday,
that I have never

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.400
been more nervous
in my entire life

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.350
than the day I stepped foot into
the lobby of the Naval Special

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.120
Warfare Training Center.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.450
Because it is a very scary and
depressing thing, my friends.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.830
Knowing for a fact--

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.140
for a fact, Matt--

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.050
that your life is going
to be pure hell and misery

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.050
for many months to come.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.210
But of course, at this point,
there was no turning back.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.560
I had to be all in.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.390
And let's put our talent
acquisition and employee

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.260
retention hats on for a minute.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.290
I'll tell you another
interesting fact.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.650
It takes 18 months and
costs about $3 million

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.872
to acquire one SEAL,
and that doesn't

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:14.330
count the millions of dollars
and years of arduous training

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.340
once you actually
make it to a team.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.600
That 18 months is broken
into various segments.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.114
The first segment is six
months long and called BUD/S,

00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:22.280
another one of our acronyms.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.700
It stands for Basic
Underwater Demolition SEAL.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.830
If any of you have
seen the SEAL movie,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.750
"Lone Survivor,"
it's unfortunately

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.370
based on a true story.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.830
The opening scenes are actually
from a Discovery Channel

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.070
documentary about
BUD/S class 234.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.320
We run six classes a year,
so every two months, I

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.432
follow them in class 235.

00:12:41.432 --> 00:12:42.890
I was present for
all this filming,

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.260
and this will give
you guys just a teeny,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.855
tiny taste of what
BUD/S is all about.

18!

00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:03.164
- Ooh!

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.280
- Ring the bell three times.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.790
Put your helmet on the ground.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.290
You're done.

00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:27.670
- Move it, you maggot!

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.833
You do it again!

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:31.021
- Have you been tested this
hard ever in your life?

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:31.520
- Never.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.895
- Winning here is a
conscious decision.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:45.696
Make up your mind whether you
want to pass or choose to fail.

00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:46.820
- All right now, gentlemen.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.680
I'm going to introduce you
all to something called

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.850
"not being able to breathe."

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.090
- Andrew!

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.440
Come back!

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.560
Come back to the light!

00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:05.670
- Take all this shaking and
all this cold, harness it.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.404
Turn it into aggression.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.876
You just proved to your
bodies through your mind

00:14:21.876 --> 00:14:23.480
that you can push
yourself further

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.563
than you thought possible.

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:36.560
- You'll get wet!

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.020
Run!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.575
- I met my limit, so that's it.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.330
- Are you sure you
want to be here?

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.140
- Yes, I do.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.223
- Are you absolutely sure?

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:50.888
- [INAUDIBLE]!

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.650
- Whatever you have to do!

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:08.140
- Just find an excuse to win!

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.990
Keep going!

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.910
- It pays to be a winner!

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.320
- I like having my buddies
that I can depend on,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.170
and I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.670

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.076
BRENT GLEESON:
Doesn't that look fun?

00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:48.870
Does anybody feel like they
missed their calling in life?

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.287
Anybody age 30 or younger,
come see me afterwards, please.

00:15:51.287 --> 00:15:53.870
Didn't think I was going to use
this as a recruiting platform,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.550
did you?

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.620
But now that I think
about it, that video

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.900
probably really damages my
recruiting possibility here

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.312
at Google.

00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:01.020
Now, the funny thing
is what you just saw

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.160
was a depiction of only the
first three weeks of BUD/S.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.080
BUD/S has a 90% failure rate
of highly capable candidates.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.960
None of us are extraordinary,
exceptional individuals.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.320
We're just common people with
an uncommon desire to succeed.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.890
So imagine those types of
activities going on for months

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.180
and months at a time.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.730
And then the irony, Wendy,
is that the training just

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.770
gets more difficult after that.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.700
That's the funny part.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.860
It's actually not that funny.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.087
If you think about that, that
mindset, that winning mindset,

00:16:32.087 --> 00:16:34.420
to highlight that, I want to
focus on some of the things

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.820
you heard the instructors
saying to the students

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.300
in those video clips.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.020
Where he said,
gentlemen, winning here

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.180
is a conscious decision.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.720
You will make up your mind
whether you want to pass,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.940
or you're going
to choose to fail.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.040
Keep moving no matter what.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.050
Find an excuse to win.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.660
You can push yourself further
than your mind or body ever

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.100
thought possible.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.680
BUD/S training is based
on the rule of seven.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.080
When your brain is telling
you that you can go no further

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.109
and take no more pain, you
can go seven times longer,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.369
seven times more, and push
yourself seven times harder.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.900
And again, that's why
very few people make it

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.256
through this selection process.

00:17:12.256 --> 00:17:14.089
And when we think about
that winning mindset

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.954
when we approach our
life and our goals,

00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:17.829
setting those lofty
goals, that lofty vision,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.740
we've all done that in
various aspects of our life.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.270
We set that lofty
goal, and we have

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.240
to work backwards to find
our own path to success.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.319
Elite athletes do this.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.289
Elite warriors do it.

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:29.830
Each and every one of you has
done it, whether you realize it

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.160
or not, at various stages of
your life, to achieve goals

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.380
academically, in
your personal life,

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.710
in athletics, to land a job here
at Google, which what I hear

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.100
is not an easy thing to do.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.980
That's a lofty
vision, a lofty goal.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.380
It took a lot of hard
work to get here.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.880
Same thing when I
made that decision

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.902
to transition from
corporate finance

00:17:47.902 --> 00:17:50.110
to start training and join
the Navy to become a SEAL.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.150
A total mindset transformation.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.180
I had to think about the
reality of the world around me

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.680
in a totally different way.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.990
Everything had to
change in order for me

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.470
to achieve that lofty goal of a
program that has a 90% failure

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.720
rate.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.442
Let's take public speaking,
for example, Steve.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:07.900
People always ask
me, well, how did

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.040
you get into this part
of your profession?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.300
The public speaking,
and do you enjoy it.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.730
I mean, who likes
public speaking?

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:13.510
Nobody.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.989
It's like the number
one fear of most people.

00:18:15.989 --> 00:18:17.280
And it's kind of a funny story.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.700
It started in graduate school.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.770
I actually started my
MBA program one week

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.690
after I got on the SEAL teams.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.820
And literally, a month
into this program,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.150
I was doing my very first
group class presentation,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.400
and I got up for my portion,
and I had some notes.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.990
My hands were shaking.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.580
I'm like-- and I was sweating.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.549
I'm like, I'm a Navy
SEAL combat veteran.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.590
I was standing in front
a classroom of 50 people,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.423
and my hands were
shaking, and I'm sweating.

00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:43.090
I'm terrified.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.840
But I kind of enjoyed
it at the same time.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.240
And several years later,
it was December of 2012,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.830
it was a Saturday morning,
and I opened my laptop.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.830
I was checking my email.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.480
And right there at
the top the Inbox

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.480
was an email, personally,
from the President

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.180
of Bank of America, Merrill
Lynch Asia-Pacific, one

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.900
of the top four executives in
the entire global organization.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.690
And he explained to me that he
had read the first article I'd

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.625
written for my Forbes column,
literally a month before this,

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.250
which was titled,
"From the Battlefield

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.260
to the Boardroom,
a Navy SEAL's Guide

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
to Business Leadership Success."

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.400
This guy is a highly
energetic banking prodigy,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.450
an Australian guy.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:18.320
Super into fitness.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.279
Super obsessed with
Special Operations culture.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.820
He's like, I really
love how you draw

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.410
these correlations, these
cultural values and principles,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.260
then you can apply those to
building winning cultures

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.750
and winning teams in
the business world.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.220
And he went on to
invite me to do

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.060
a series of keynote
presentations and workshops

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.380
at their Global Leadership
Conference in Hong Kong

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.850
the following month.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.470
He didn't ask if
I was a speaker.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.970
Didn't ask to see a website.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.200
Didn't ask to see any videos.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.887
Didn't ask for client
testimonials, nothing.

00:19:44.887 --> 00:19:47.220
As silly as this sounds, just
the fact that I was a SEAL

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.750
was enough for him.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.896
But of course, being
the entrepreneur that I

00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:52.020
am, I was like, hell, yeah.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.160
Of course I'll come
out there and speak

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.780
to all you people in Hong Kong.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.850
Sent the email back,
and I closed my laptop,

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.640
and I turned to my
office, like, oh, shit.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.560
What the hell did
I just commit to?

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.009
I don't know how
to be a speaker.

00:20:03.009 --> 00:20:04.050
But I had enough content.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.450
I built some presentations
based on various discovery

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.979
calls we had, and I
prepared relentlessly.

00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:11.520
Living outside your comfort zone
and pushing those boundaries

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.800
cannot succeed without
discipline and accountability.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.610
So I prepared and rehearsed
and rehearsed and rehearsed,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.281
practice, practice, practice,
and I went out there,

00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.780
went on stage for
the first keynote,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.130
knowing that I had
several other talks,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.420
and I was doing breakout
sessions throughout the day.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.585
It was exhausting.

00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:27.210
Go up on stage.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.660
Of course, once
again, I'm terrified.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.460
But again, I had
rehearsed and prepared so

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.080
relentlessly that
it went very well.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.350
They had me back to Singapore
and Sydney the following month.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.110
I've done that Asia-Pacific
tour every year since then,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.360
and I've doubled the frequency
of speaking engagements

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.100
every year over
the past six years.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.080
I speak about 75 times a year.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.380
Those early years, it
was always uncomfortable.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.670
I always had to get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.250
It was always terrifying
getting on stage.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.030
I was always nervous.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.613
My wife would always
say-- because she

00:20:55.613 --> 00:20:57.840
used to travel with me
before all of our children--

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.910
and she'd say, honey, I
like you so much better

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.232
after you're done talking.

00:21:01.232 --> 00:21:03.690
She'd be trying to talk to me,
and I'd just be in the zone.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.815
I wouldn't even answer her.

00:21:04.815 --> 00:21:07.270
I couldn't even
hear her talking.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.490
But I found a passion for it.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.864
Even though it
was uncomfortable,

00:21:09.864 --> 00:21:12.152
I pushed myself beyond
that comfort zone

00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:13.860
to do something that
I had a passion for,

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.450
that I had a desire
to continue to do.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.170
At any time in our life, when
we have that vision, that vision

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.030
and that lofty
goal, just like we

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.160
say in the SEAL teams
and other areas of life,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.040
we have to break that lofty
goal, that lofty vision,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.660
break it down.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.220
In the SEAL teams,
we say, you've

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.790
got to eat the elephant
one bite at a time.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.090
You break the big goals
into bite-sized chunks,

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.450
making them less daunting
and more achievable.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.990
Navy SEALs can only be
forged in adversity.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.610
Every single person
in this room has

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.460
and will continue to face
various aspects of adversity

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.625
throughout your entire life.

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:49.250
But again, as you
know, it's what we do

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.650
and how we react in the
face of adversity that

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.900
builds our character
and defines who we are.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.810
So the third week of
BUD/S, the third week

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:01.340
of this 18-month training
pipeline is called Hell Week.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.425
And I assure you, it's a
lot worse than that sounds.

00:22:04.425 --> 00:22:06.300
Actually, that sounds
pretty bad, doesn't it?

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.490
Hell Week?

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.410
It's designed to do one
thing, simply weed out

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.280
those not committed to the
vision of becoming a SEAL.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.280
You do not sleep
for an entire week.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.490
You run the equivalent
of multiple marathons

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.750
while wet and sandy,
inside and out.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.700
This is called getting
a sugar cookie.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.015
It sucks.

00:22:24.015 --> 00:22:26.390
Because the instructors make
a concerted effort to ensure

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.160
you get the sand on the
inside of your clothing,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.460
so that it strips the flesh
off your body as you run.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.751
It's like wearing
sandpaper inside out.

00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:34.250
It does.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.860
It's very effective.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.300
You swim dozens of miles
in the open, frigid ocean.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.720
You run with heavy logs,
heavy boats, heavy backpacks.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.315
You run the obstacle course
multiple times a day.

00:22:44.315 --> 00:22:45.710
Endless calisthenics.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.890
Brutal beatings.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.870
All while battling severe
bruising, cuts, lacerations,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.960
stress fractures, cellulitis,
broken bones, the most

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.810
severe chafing,
people, you could ever

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.270
imagine, in all of the
areas you would never,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.129
ever want to be severely chafed.

00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:07.170
In fact, calling it chafing
is not even accurate.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.130
You literally have--

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.921
I'm sorry, but I'm
going to say it anyways,

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:12.870
you have no skin left between
your legs, around your waist,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.740
in your armpits, and on
the top of your head.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.260
And then imagine
all the extra time

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.840
you spend in the saltwater.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.312
It really kicks it up a notch.

00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:22.270
Oh, and one more thing.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.840
And.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.440
pretty much constant
second-stage hypothermia.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.230
So bearing all that in mind,
let's do the math really quick.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.090
This is a picture of
my graduating class,

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.880
intentionally grainy to
preserve people's identities.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.490
But about 1,000 guys
applied for our BUD/S class.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.110
We run six classes a year.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.730
Of that 1,000, only 250 were
selected to begin training.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.670
Of that 250, only 23
graduated, earning the right

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.650
to wear the SEAL trident pin.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.630
Now, the interesting
thing about this pin

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.780
is that it's the only emblem
in the United States military

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.120
where the Eagle's
head is fully bowed.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.670
Bowed in memory of those that
forged the path ahead of us.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.310
Bye.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.608
Everybody say good bye.

00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:04.560
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.740
Another line from the SEAL
ethos says, my trident

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.920
is a symbol of honor and
heritage bestowed upon me

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.350
by the heroes that
have gone before.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.440
It embodies the trust of those
that I am bound to defend.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.505
It is a privilege we
must earn every day.

00:24:20.505 --> 00:24:22.930
Your roles, for
example, as members

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.890
of this team of this
amazing organization,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.560
is a privilege each of you
have to earn every single day,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.530
simply by asking yourself,
what will I do today

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.720
to be the best, most
valuable, and effective member

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.960
of this organization
that I can be.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.920
Which we say in
the SEAL teams, how

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.960
will I earn my trident today?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.590
So after several combat
tours, I left the SEAL teams,

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.450
went to graduate
school, and decided

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.891
to become an entrepreneur,
another very uncomfortable

00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:49.390
thing.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.170
I didn't have any money saved
after being in the Navy.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.920
It's like working
for free, people.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.940
I had student loans.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.470
We started a company.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.680
And basically, the first
company I started right out

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.480
of graduate school
was, essentially,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.130
an early version
of Trulia, Zillow,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.720
it was a home finding
search engine.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.020
The housing market was booming.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.040
The economy was booming.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.310
We knew this ride was
never going to end.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.470
This housing bubble was
never going to burst.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.270
We raised $2 million
with this business.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.500
We kept growing it.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.640
We probably spent
$200,000 a month

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.279
in Google AdWords, because
our SEO rankings sucked.

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:21.820
I had to learn how to become an
SEO expert, which we all know

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.340
is impossible, because you
change the algorithm every 30

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.222
seconds.

00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:26.430
Thanks a lot, guys-- oh, see?

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.221
I just blacked out.

00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:29.509
I went off on a tangent.

00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:30.550
All our rankings dropped.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.740
We had to spend $200,000
a month in AdWords.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.060
So you're welcome.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.650
You're welcome.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.520
And then 2008 came around.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.790
Anybody remember what
happened in 2008?

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.660
The global economy collapsed.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.870
The housing market
was destroyed.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.316
All of our advertisers
cut their--

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:46.690
you know, what's
the first budget

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.410
to go when there's
an economic downturn?

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.620
Marketing, of course.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.280
We got hammered.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.620
There was a lot of
pain, a lot of struggle,

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.290
a lot of adversity, a lot
of crying, mostly by me,

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.790
unfortunately, in
front of people.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.290
And it wasn't really until I
had to reflect back on and lean

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.660
into some of those
principles and that mindset

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.000
that got me through SEAL
training, that got me

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.220
through hundreds and
hundreds of combat missions

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.220
and the loss of many friends,
and really reflecting

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.920
on the culture and values
that forged SEAL culture

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.191
and how we could apply
those principles in building

00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:22.690
a winning organization that was
resilient, that would bounce

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.364
back from this adversity.

00:26:24.364 --> 00:26:25.780
We also leaned in
to the principle

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.690
that we hold dear in the
SEAL teams of adaptability.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.317
So we diversified ourselves.

00:26:30.317 --> 00:26:32.650
We had learned so much about
digital marketing and media

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.420
that we decided to start a
digital marketing agency.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.020
So we borrowed $100,000
from the first business

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.480
to start the second business,
gave those shareholders

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.880
equal common stock shares
in the new company,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.350
and that company
doubled in size--

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.510
using those principles
I just talked about--

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.790
doubled in size every year
until we sold it a year

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.584
and a half ago.

00:26:49.584 --> 00:26:51.250
But even that company
went through a lot

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.040
of change, a lot of
organizational transformation.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.890
You're talking about a
fast-growing company in an even

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.610
more rapidly changing industry,
mostly chasing your Google

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.412
algorithm, again, thank you.

00:27:03.412 --> 00:27:04.870
But again, all
those principles can

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.600
be applied to building winning
teams, winning organizations,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.119
and of course, succeeding
in life in general.

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:13.660
And that's kind of what I wanted
to talk about in more detail

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.990
today.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.310
I had a failing
company at that time.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.357
Starting a new business.

00:27:18.357 --> 00:27:20.440
All those things causing
a lot of pain, adversity.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.250
I was CEO of two companies,
not an easy thing to do.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.737
And then more
adversity came along.

00:27:25.737 --> 00:27:27.570
It usually comes in
threes, for some reason.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.104
Anybody know that about life?

00:27:29.104 --> 00:27:31.020
When something shitty
happens, two more things

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.910
are coming, so get ready.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.010
I'll spare you the details,
but during that time,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.635
I was trying to save
a failing business

00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:39.300
and start a new business and
make that business successful.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.720
I was literally transformed
into a full-time single parent

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.300
to a two-year-old overnight.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.150
Anybody in here have kids?

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.813
It sucks, man.

00:27:48.813 --> 00:27:51.780
[LAUGHS] I'm like, where
does Mommy keep your stuff?

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.080
[LAUGHS] I would drop them
off at school with no shoes.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.256
It was a disaster.

00:27:56.256 --> 00:27:57.630
But the point of
telling you this

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.910
is sometimes in life, when
we face adversity, we also

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.646
have to make very difficult
and humbling decisions

00:28:02.646 --> 00:28:04.020
to do what's best
for our family,

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.414
to do what's best for the
organizations we're a part of.

00:28:06.414 --> 00:28:07.830
So what I ended
up having to do is

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.760
making the decision to step down
as CEO of that second company.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.010
I knew I could not effectively
lead that organization,

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.850
even though I tried.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.580
I had to shift my
priorities to my son.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.890
But again, that was a
very uncomfortable thing.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.414
It was something that was
outside my comfort zone.

00:28:22.414 --> 00:28:23.580
But then the magic happened.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.800
I was able to place
myself in a role I

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.470
was very passionate about in the
organization as chief marketing

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.240
officer.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.280
And that company continued to
thrive, and things got better.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.250
And then something else
happened a few years later.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.350
I had an opportunity to
go to one of two weddings.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.960
One was a wedding in Houston
for one of my best friends

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.682
from college and
high school, another

00:28:41.682 --> 00:28:43.140
was a wedding in
Costa Rica for one

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.150
of my best SEAL team buddies.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.039
Wedding in Houston,
wedding in Costa Rica,

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.330
where do you guys think I went?

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.980
Costa Rica.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.830
The day I got to Costa Rica
was the day I met my wife.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.560
I literally told her two days
into that wedding weekend

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.740
that we were going
to get married.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.646
Taking a little
calculated risk, right?

00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:01.270
I knew that would do
one of two things,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.066
scare the crap out of her and
send her running for the hills,

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:05.690
or maybe marginally
intrigue her enough

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.730
to continue the conversation.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.030
A month later-- this is a true
story too-- a month later,

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.920
we got matching tattoos--
before the ring.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.647
We got matching tattoos.

00:29:14.647 --> 00:29:16.230
Two months after
that, we got engaged,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.705
and a after that,
we got married.

00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:19.790
And now we have two
more beautiful children

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.424
and are happy as can be.

00:29:22.424 --> 00:29:24.840
But again, it's about taking
that calculated risk in life,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.500
whether it's in our work,
in our personal lives,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.530
in our relationships, but
living outside your comfort zone

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:34.550
and finding any level of success
really cannot happen, ever,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.250
without extremely high levels
of discipline and accountability

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.280
and follow through.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.290
The concept of accountability
in SEAL training

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.000
starts on day one.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.504
And as we say, our
training is never complete.

00:29:46.504 --> 00:29:48.170
So from the very first
week of training,

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.500
throughout the entire
18-month training process,

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.769
we perform a weekly--

00:29:52.769 --> 00:29:54.560
what I refer to as an
accountability drill.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.230
We're essentially teaching
ourselves and our teammates

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.450
to hold each other to the
highest level of standard.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.030
The highest level
of accountability.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.550
It's a wonderful,
fascinating, weekly evolution

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.439
called The Top
Five, Bottom Five.

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:08.230
So every Friday afternoon,
before the class

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.229
is secured for the weekend,
they bring the class

00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:11.270
into the classroom.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.100
They sit you down,
and the instructors

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.190
pass out blank sheets of
paper, and on that paper

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.530
are five lines on the top
and five lines on the bottom.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.080
And you are instructed
to anonymously rank

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.910
who you believe the top five
performers are in the class

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.730
and who you believe
the bottom five

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.292
performers are in the class.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.750
I know you're thinking, from
a human resources perspective,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.124
wow, that's probably
pretty cool.

00:30:31.124 --> 00:30:31.670
No.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.980
They never tell you
who the top five are,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.350
because people, that would
be positive reinforcement.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.650
And we do not deal in positive
reinforcement in SEAL training.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.300
We deal only in
negative reinforcement.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.300
So what they do do
is they tally up

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.000
all the names in the bottom
five and post them right there

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.390
on the white board
next to the door.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.590
Not a great way to
start your weekend.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.700
The one name most frequently
listed in the bottom five

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.950
every Friday until
the end of training

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.260
is immediately
ejected from training,

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.370
based on peer evaluations.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.860
No ifs, ands, or buts, no
appealing to the empathies

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.410
of the human resources
department, because we do not

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.540
have a human resources
department in SEAL training.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.390
But we take this concept
of accountability

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.690
extremely seriously.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.690
We take it with us
to the battlefield.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.780
When you're on patrol in enemy
territory, each and every man

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.260
is accountable, for example,
for owning a field of fire.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.240
The area you are
responsible for protecting,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.300
should the enemy attack.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.300
And that's the great thing
about accountability,

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.510
especially in a team setting,
is because when everyone

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.000
is accountable, everybody
is executing their duties

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.530
to the best of
their ability, you

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.420
don't have to worry
about anything outside

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.840
of your own field of fire.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.260
Accountability is equally
as important in a team

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.910
setting as it is in
a personal setting.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.160
We're trying to achieve goals.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.760
As you can imagine, when I
decided to make that lofty leap

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.700
and take that risk to quit
my rather lucrative finance

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.880
job to join the Navy and try
out for the SEAL program,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.820
knowing that there was a high,
high, high likelihood that I

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.370
would never make it, again,
it was a total mindset

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.050
transformation with
that lofty vision.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.380
But again, like I've said,
you cannot achieve those lofty

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.210
goals, pushing outside
your comfort zone,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.330
without extremely high levels of
accountability and discipline.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:15.080
Every night I would come home
from the office about 6:30 PM,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.940
throw on a backpack,
running shoes,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.060
the backpack had fins
and goggles in it.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.370
I would run four miles to
the SMU pool, swim a mile,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.900
then run four miles home.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.450
On the weekends, we'd run
marathons, do various spring

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.800
training activities.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.590
I did this for an entire year
while I was working in finance,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.290
and then as you know, we moved
up to Crested Butte, Colorado,

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.660
and trained, again,
for five hours a day

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.460
at 10,000 feet altitude.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.370
But doing all that required
an extremely high level

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.530
of focus and discipline
and accountability,

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.870
because I had to
transform my entire life

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.790
to mold it around
achieving this vision.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.020
My social life had to change.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.940
My dietary habits had to change.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.746
My fitness regime had to change.

00:32:51.746 --> 00:32:53.120
I did it, of
course, responsibly.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.334
I wasn't shutting out
loved ones from my life,

00:32:55.334 --> 00:32:56.750
but I did shut out
a lot of people

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.610
that didn't need to
be in my life that

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.460
would stand in the way of
me achieving that goal.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.680
My social life
changed dramatically.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.380
But again, all these things,
accountability, discipline,

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.320
are critical for living a
life beyond your comfort zone

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.730
and achieving those lofty
goals we have set in our lives.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.480
Let these pictures
sink in for one second.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.070
Studies actually show that
interacting with animals

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.010
can actually improve human
social interaction in the areas

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.490
of trust and empathy.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.906
So I thought these pictures
were appropriate for the trust

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.140
slide.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.150
Yes, that is a
monkey on my head.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.390
My last tour was in Africa.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.730
His name is Iron Mike.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.120
I raised him from infancy.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.619
I found him on the
side of the road.

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:38.552
His mom was injured.

00:33:38.552 --> 00:33:40.510
And at night, he would
sleep in my cot with me,

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.210
either nestled in my
armpit or on my chest.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.330
And in the morning, he
would wake up and crawl up

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.745
onto my chin, grab my
eyelashes, and rip my eyes open.

00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:48.950
Like, hey, Dad!

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.330
It's time to eat!

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.830
You people in the
room who have kids

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.050
know that our children
basically do something similar

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.280
every frickin' morning.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.530
My two-year-old came in
the morning, 5 o'clock,

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.930
two days ago, with a hat
and sunglasses and a diaper

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.980
on, also demanding to eat.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.530
And yes, that is a dog
attached to my body

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.840
as I jump out of the
back of that plane.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.800
You know what he's
thinking right now?

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.130
Man's best friend, my ass.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.010
Not a happy--

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.040
I don't know what it is about
plummeting 130 miles an hour

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.810
towards the face of the Earth.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.250
It takes a little
getting used to.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.719
They don't particularly
care for it.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.219
I know there's a lot
of dog lovers in here.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:23.885
I'm a dog lover.

00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:25.350
I have three myself.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.750
Trust me, these dogs
get taken care of a lot

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.260
better than we do.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.070
They stay in their own
hotel rooms at the W

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.370
when we go on training trips.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.480
So don't worry about these dogs.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.965
They're fully taken care of.

00:34:35.965 --> 00:34:37.590
I wanted to tell you
guys a brief story

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:42.750
about trust from my BUD/S
class' Hell Week experience.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.400
Hell Week, again,
the brutal crucible

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.370
that all SEALs share
that few pass, Hell Week

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.190
starts on a Sunday and
ends on a Friday afternoon.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.507
And the beauty of that Sunday
is that the whole class

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:54.090
will report to the
classroom with only

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.460
a couple required items
in their possession.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.360
And the amazing thing
about this Sunday

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.020
is that the students
have no idea when

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.440
Hell Week will commence.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.324
The anxiety, the
anguish is literally

00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:07.365
eating away at your soul.

00:35:07.365 --> 00:35:10.350
You know it's probably going to
be the worst week of your life,

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.610
and you just want it to start.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.040
That's the weird
paradox of it all.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.930
And as a way to inspire us and
motivate us, our class leader,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.840
who is the highest ranking
officer in the class,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.780
he read to us the St. Crispin's
Day speech from William

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.230
Shakespeare's "Henry V."

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:32.370
And he read aloud those famed
lines that say, "we few,

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.630
we happy few, we
band of brothers.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.930
For he today that
sheds his blood with me

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.150
shall be my brother."

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.430
John died four days later.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.220
We were four and 1/2
days into Hell Week.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.160
There were only about 30
students left of the 250.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.010
We were in full gear, no fins,
in an Olympic-sized swimming

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.912
pool, doing relay races.

00:35:53.912 --> 00:35:55.370
And we were performing
an evolution

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.320
called The Caterpillar
Race, which

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.960
is not as cute as it sounds.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.350
Your boat crew of seven
guys is in the water,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.410
in a line, swimming
backwards, like this.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.910
Except I would have
my legs wrapped

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.070
around the waist of
the guy in front of me,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.444
his legs are wrapped around
the waist of the guy in front

00:36:09.444 --> 00:36:11.070
of him, and so on and so forth.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.970
Now, even fresh, this is
a very difficult evolution

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.980
to execute properly, much less
to beat the other boat crew

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.230
to the other side of the pool.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.245
Everything in Hell
Week is a race.

00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:21.620
Four and 1/2 days
into Hell Week,

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.590
you're hallucinating so
violently, your body is

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.990
so brutally beaten, it's
more of an evolution

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.760
in controlled drowning.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.100
Long story short, John suffered
a massive heart failure

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.090
and drowned in the
pool right next to us.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.020
But again, we were hallucinating
so violently and so exhausted

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.420
at that point, nobody had
any idea what was going on.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.970
So they ran us back
across the street

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.800
to the Special Warfare
Center, and they

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.050
put us in the classroom, where
we waited for a couple hours.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:46.730
After a couple of
hours, the door opens,

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.370
and the instructor staff
walked in, and with them was

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.739
the commanding officer
of BUD/S at the time.

00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:53.780
He walked to the front of
the room, turned around

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.370
to address the class.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.800
He said, gentlemen, listen up.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.780
Lieutenant John Skop was
pronounced dead at 1:00 AM.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.844
Lieutenant Barado,
you're taken over.

00:37:03.844 --> 00:37:06.010
And he said it with that
level of candor, I believe,

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.180
purposefully.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.850
He paused for a minute
to let that sink in.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.120
Then he said, gentlemen,
get used to this feeling

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.100
that you have right now.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.120
This is what it's going
to be like in the teams.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.300
And you will lose teammates.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.530
You have to learn to
control your emotions,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.940
stay focused on the mission,
and trust each other no matter

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.137
what, especially
amidst adversity.

00:37:27.137 --> 00:37:28.720
And it was a bit of
odd foreshadowing,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.050
because he really had no
idea how right he really was.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.547
Literally four months
later was 9/11, and that's

00:37:34.547 --> 00:37:36.130
when we all knew
we'd be going to war,

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.400
where trust would
be at a premium.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.050
When you think about the notion
of trust, like accountability

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.275
in a team setting, obviously
critically important,

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:44.650
the trust all of
you have for one

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.117
another as team members
of this organization,

00:37:47.117 --> 00:37:48.700
the trust you build
with the customer,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.920
the trust you build
with your friends,

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.130
your family, and
your relationships.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.700
As we all know,
trust is the bedrock

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.395
of any sound relationship.

00:37:56.395 --> 00:37:59.009
It takes a long time to
build and moments to break.

00:37:59.009 --> 00:38:01.300
And it's equally as important
in an individual setting,

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.050
especially when we're
talking about living

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.830
a life outside your comfort
zone and setting and achieving

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.240
those lofty goals.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.450
The trust you have in yourself
to fulfill the promises you

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.340
make to yourself to
achieve those goals,

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.410
to be disciplined
and accountable.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.390
And like
accountability, trust is

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:20.140
the bedrock of any successful
purpose-driven life.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.502
It's how you fuel the drive
to achieve those goals.

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.710
It's how you shut out the
noise and the naysayers who

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.418
want to stand in the
way of you achieving

00:38:28.418 --> 00:38:30.530
your goals and your dreams.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.480
It builds resilience,
and resilience

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.280
is the foundation of any life
lived outside your comfort

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.780
zone.

00:38:38.504 --> 00:38:42.770
In closing, I want to share
a short poem with you guys.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:46.160
There's a poem that's widely
shared in the Naval Special

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.540
Warfare community.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.720
It was authored
by Chief Tecumseh.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.621
He was a Shawnee chief
from the War of 1812.

00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.120
It's shared widely
in our community.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.370
It's part of our culture.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:59.480
It speaks to how we
approach our life, our work,

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.790
it's how we honor our fallen.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:06.120
And I've, of course,
seen many things in life.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.450
I've experienced the war-torn
countries around the world.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.030
I've been to more funerals
than I can remember.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.630
I've lost more friends
than I can remember.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.380
And I've taken life.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.450
And even though this poem
is called "Death Song,"

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:23.460
it's a metaphor for living
a purpose-driven life.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.580
"So live your life
so the fear of death

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.090
may never enter your heart.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.580
Trouble no one about
their religion.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.300
Respect others and their views,
and demand that they respect

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.860
yours.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.390
Love your life.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.360
Perfect your life.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.030
Unify all things in your life.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.890
Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.120
Prepare a noble death
song for the day

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.710
you go over the great divide.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:57.130
Show respect to all
people, but grovel to none.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.980
When you arise in the morning,
give thanks for the light,

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.430
for your life and strength.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.980
If you see no reason
for giving thanks,

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.010
the fault lies within yourself.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.530
When your time
comes to die, be not

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.440
like those whose hearts are
filled with the fear of death,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.780
so they weep.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.980
They pray for a little more time
to live their lives over again

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.660
in a different way.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.714
Sing your death song, and
die like a hero going home.

00:40:27.714 --> 00:40:29.880
Now, again, I know that
poem is titled "Death Song,"

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.460
but if you listen to those
words, it's not about death,

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.340
is it?

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.840
It's about life.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.660
Living our lives to
the fullest extent.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.880
Creating, seizing
every opportunity

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.240
we have to be better,
to achieve more, and not

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.870
for our own selfish desires,
for the organizations we're

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:50.336
a part of, for our teams, our
families, our communities,

00:40:50.336 --> 00:40:51.960
bettering the lives
of those around us,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.350
and hopefully one day making
this world a little bit better

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.130
place than we found it.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.520
So ladies and gentlemen,
as you step forth

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.560
onto your own
battlefield of life,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.690
setting and achieving
those lofty goals,

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.060
pushing the boundaries
of your comfort zone,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.380
and achieving
maximum performance,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.410
remember these three things.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.304
Get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.970
Push the boundaries
of your comfort zone

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.240
every single chance you get,
because the more you do,

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.360
the wider that area
becomes, and that is truly

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.130
where the magic happens.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.900
Next, remember, as we
say in the SEAL teams--

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.080
we have a hell of a lot
of sayings, people--

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.200
the only easy day was yesterday.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.070
There truly are no easy days
for high-performance teams

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.240
and driven
individuals to achieve

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.606
an existence of excellence.

00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:39.730
Life is full of challenges.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.970
We simply have to face those
challenges head on, controlling

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.211
what we can and
ignoring what we can't.

00:41:46.211 --> 00:41:47.960
The last thing, my
friends, I ask that you

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.740
be all in all the time.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.900
Ask yourself every
day, at what level

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.512
am I willing to participate
on this team and in this life.

00:41:57.512 --> 00:41:59.040
And no matter what
challenges life

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.560
throws your way,
whether they be at work,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.270
at home, your family, spouse,
kids, even things like divorce,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.120
illness, finances,
no matter what it is.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.370
Not if, but when you get knocked
down, get back up every time,

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.590
and never ever be
out of the fight.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.500
God bless you guys.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.874
Good luck in your
life's journey.

00:42:18.874 --> 00:42:20.770
Thank you.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.750
Thank you.

00:42:25.994 --> 00:42:26.660
Thank you, guys.

00:42:29.342 --> 00:42:34.580
AUDIENCE: The bottom-ranked
individuals that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.520
What characteristic [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.020
BRENT GLEESON: It's
a good question.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.901
Because typically, from
those peer reviews--

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:43.400
BUD/S is a very
level playing field.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.200
We have Olympic athletes
who quit in the first minute

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.100
of Hell Week.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.360
We have guys who look like
some accountant who crush you

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.770
at a 15-mile ruck run.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.930
But typically, the data
points that come out

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.110
of those anonymous
peer-to-peer surveys

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.670
are more character-driven.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.537
Your moral compass is off.

00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:03.620
You've got an ego problem.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.661
You're not a team player.

00:43:04.661 --> 00:43:05.990
You're not a collaborator.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.757
Basically, somebody who is
not a trustworthy person, who

00:43:08.757 --> 00:43:11.090
you would not want to be
standing next to in a gunfight.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.390
That's what gets those people
dropped out of BUD/S, more

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.460
frequently than
performance drops,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.900
more frequently than quitting.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.100
When it comes down to
performance evaluation,

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.486
if you're not the best
shooter on a shooting range,

00:43:22.486 --> 00:43:24.110
you're having trouble
with ocean swims,

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.910
they'll typically
work with you if you

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.597
have a sound moral
compass, and they

00:43:27.597 --> 00:43:29.180
believe that you'll
be a great culture

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.740
fit for our organization.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.320
But when those-- and
the instructors now,

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.730
they use iPads now.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.680
They had clipboards
back in my day.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.080
But they have this scale in
this algorithm they created,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.590
where one on one bar
of the scale, there

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:45.710
is your physical and tactical
abilities that are needed

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.790
as a SEAL, and the rest is
culture and moral values,

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.249
and that's what
gets people dropped

00:43:51.249 --> 00:43:52.789
is that they don't
think you're going

00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:54.500
to be a good fit for
our organization,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.335
or you're not a
trustworthy individual.

00:43:56.335 --> 00:43:57.210
It's a good question.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.650
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that BUD/S

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.859
is one of several different--

00:44:02.859 --> 00:44:03.650
BRENT GLEESON: Yes.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.530
So you'll go through
BUD/S for six months,

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.650
and then the 25 or 30 students
that will graduate from BUD/S

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.470
will then go on to SQT, or
SEAL Qualification Training,

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.727
which is another year
of advanced training.

00:44:14.727 --> 00:44:17.060
So you're doing less getting
your ass kicked, and you're

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.657
doing more of the learning
the technical skills

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:21.740
and tactical skills that
you need to be as a SEAL.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.470
So now they bake in
a lot more schools.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.605
They do language
schools, freefall school,

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:29.980
breacher school, some other
things you never used to get.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.320
You'd get those schools later
on, once you get to a team.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.290
But now the guys are coming in
more fit than we've ever seen

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.910
them and more qual'ed up.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.620
So they basically hit
the ground running.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.920
Because we have-- there's
only 2,000 active SEALs

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.350
in the world at any given
time, yet we have conflicts

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.260
all over the world.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.634
It's not just Iraq, Syria,
Afghanistan, it's everywhere.

00:44:49.634 --> 00:44:51.050
Places I can't
mention, of course,

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.770
but we have more conflicts
and more missions

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.180
than we have people.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.377
[LAUGHS] And again,
we're open for business

00:44:58.377 --> 00:44:59.210
for you ladies, too.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.960
Remember, three years ago, we
lifted the restriction on women

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.240
in the front lines of combat.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.760
I will say we haven't had one
single female applicant yet,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.400
but it will happen someday.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.240
They're out there.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.372
So thank you.

00:45:14.372 --> 00:45:15.979
Yes, sir.

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:18.395
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
ways you're making yourself

00:45:18.395 --> 00:45:19.880
uncomfortable in civilian life?

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.445
BRENT GLEESON: [LAUGHS]
A lot of way to do it--

00:45:22.445 --> 00:45:27.089
and this is kind of
also how I prepare.

00:45:27.089 --> 00:45:29.630
Because people always-- well,
is BUD/S and SEAL training more

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.040
mental, is it more physical.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.440
I believe if you're preparing
for something like this,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.565
my approach was it's
very difficult to prepare

00:45:35.565 --> 00:45:37.190
mentally, because
you really don't know

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:38.315
what it's going to be like.

00:45:38.315 --> 00:45:41.360
Everybody's journey through SEAL
training is totally different.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.090
But I prepared physically
as relentlessly as possible.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:47.520
Because when you push your
body as hard as you can,

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.930
it increases mental
fortitude and mental strength

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.470
and emotional intelligence.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.670
And so that's how I do that.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.465
So I still do that in
life, I approach fitness.

00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:58.190
I travel lots, and my
diet is not as good

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.700
as it possibly could be, so
I have to work out harder.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.840
And I have three kids,
so chasing those crazies

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.440
around is also a
good way to do it.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.120
But again, doing things
like public speaking,

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.390
that was something that took
years to really get comfortable

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.010
doing.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.160
Where I was always nervous.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.820
I was always fearful.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.740
But now I'm not.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.020
Now I can just focus more
on preparation as opposed

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.660
to combating the fear
and anxiety of getting up

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:25.300
in front of an audience, whether
it's 30 people or 3,000 people.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.000
And other things are just taking
calculated risk in business,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.204
in life, in those
personal goals.

00:46:32.204 --> 00:46:34.370
The transition to sell the
company a year and a half

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.100
ago was a bit of a
risky transition,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.512
to go all in on writing the
book and doing more speaking

00:46:39.512 --> 00:46:41.470
and building a consulting
practice around this.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.970
So now I don't have 200
amazing employees anymore.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.000
I have me and a
few other people.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.970
So it's kind of going back
to the drawing board, being

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.670
an entrepreneur again, where
it's all on my shoulders

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:53.430
to figure it out.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.930
So it's always taking not
just irresponsible risk,

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.960
but calculated risk, and
then working your ass off

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.083
to make sure that that
vision is fulfilled.

00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:05.190
Thank you.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.760
Who else?

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.456
Yes.

00:47:09.456 --> 00:47:13.060
AUDIENCE: So those 90% that
do get cut or quit [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.810
BRENT GLEESON: I always
joke that the SEAL

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:18.210
program is the best recruiting
tool the regular Navy ever had.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.830
You're not going home, people.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.830
You're stuck in the Navy
for four or five years,

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.570
doing any job they
want to give you.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.280
Before, in my day,
you had to choose

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.670
what's a rate, which is a job.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:29.000
So a sonar technician
or whatever.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.030
And because 90% those people
need a job and a career path,

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.170
and somewhere to place them
after they inevitably fail out

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.829
of BUD/S, now SEAL is a rate.

00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:40.370
So the problem with
that is it's good

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.890
because you're taking
advancement exams based

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.300
on the jobs you actually do.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.410
I was a sonar tech.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.050
That's like listening to
little pings in a submarine.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.167
So I took an advancement
test one time in Iraq--

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.000
this is going to be a
ding to my character--

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.635
but I was like, I don't
know anything about this.

00:47:54.635 --> 00:47:55.760
There's no study materials.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.260
I was like, somebody go find
me-- we were at a base in Iraq.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.142
I was like, somebody
find me a sonar tech.

00:48:00.142 --> 00:48:01.850
Luckily, there was
some sonar tech there.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.808
And I was like, can we
collaborate a little bit

00:48:03.808 --> 00:48:04.616
on this?

00:48:04.616 --> 00:48:05.240
I didn't cheat.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.239
He was my study partner.

00:48:09.867 --> 00:48:11.450
But the problem with
SEAL being a rate

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.520
now is that it's great
for advancement exams,

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.980
but now, you don't have a
job coming out of BUD/S,

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.330
so the Navy can do whatever they
want with you, which is also,

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.420
I would hope, a motivator for
those individuals not to quit,

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.960
because you don't know where
they're going to stick you.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.700
Did I answer the question?

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.200
Yes.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.700
OK.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.200
Yeah.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.640
Anything else?

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.224
Yes, sir.

00:48:34.224 --> 00:48:37.570
AUDIENCE: Saying all in, all
the time is a wonderful motto,

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.694
but it takes its toll.

00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:40.360
Can you speak to the
resiliency in that?

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.300
BRENT GLEESON: Yes.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.910
The concept of all
in, all the time,

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.430
is all about prioritization
and execution.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.625
I get that question a lot.

00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:49.000
And when I have time to explain,
it's usually in the Q&amp;A.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.410
But it's not about--

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.197
you can't go all
in on everything.

00:48:52.197 --> 00:48:54.280
And I don't even like the
concept of multitasking,

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.530
because then you're just
doing a whole bunch of things

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.810
really crappily.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.610
So it's really all
about prioritization.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.710
So if you can
prioritize those goals

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.187
you have in life or in work
or whatever it is, and invest

00:49:06.187 --> 00:49:08.020
the appropriate amount
of time and resources

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.380
or whatever is needed
into that prioritization,

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.700
then you can really go all in.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.930
But you can't say, well, I want
to be an expert guitar player,

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.129
and I want to have great
upward mobility at Google,

00:49:19.129 --> 00:49:21.420
and I also want to have all
this and all this and this.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.860
You're not going to able to do
all that all in, all the time,

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.359
all at once.

00:49:24.359 --> 00:49:26.699
It has to be a prioritized
list of the things that

00:49:26.699 --> 00:49:29.240
are most important to you, that
you're most passionate about,

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.070
or you have a passion
for those things.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:32.050
Then you're going
to be successful,

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.591
because you're going
to willingly put

00:49:33.591 --> 00:49:35.685
the work and the time
into being successful.

00:49:35.685 --> 00:49:37.810
And then once you've achieved
some level of success

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.840
in that field, then maybe
shift to another one

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.730
of those priorities.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:43.360
Good question.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.785
Thank you.

00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:49.240
Yes, sir.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.440
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about the role of mentors

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.578
and [INAUDIBLE] in your life,
in your experience in the Navy

00:49:58.578 --> 00:50:02.039
and otherwise [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:02.039 --> 00:50:03.330
BRENT GLEESON: Yes, absolutely.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.650
It's a great question
about mentorship.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:09.670
When I-- I had a lot of
mentors throughout my life

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.000
in high school and college.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.769
But when I told my
parents, hey, I'm

00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:15.310
trying for this SEAL
program, they're

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.634
like, oh, good luck with that.

00:50:17.634 --> 00:50:20.050
But ironically-- and I didn't
even know this at the time--

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.450
my dad's best friend in
college, who they swam together,

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.220
they also went to SMU--

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:28.580
was a Vietnam-era SEAL, and
he still lived in San Diego.

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.440
So he called his
friend Tom up and said,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.500
hey, Brent's joining the Navy.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.570
Can you kind of
talk him out of it?

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:35.140
No.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.190
He's joining the Navy.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.731
When he gets out
there, it'd be great

00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:39.600
if you could take
him under your wing,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.350
mentor him a little
bit, tell him

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.940
about the community,
the process.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.420
Obviously it changed vastly
since the Vietnam era guys.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.485
He was in BUD/S class 32,
I was in BUD/S class 235.

00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:52.810
So years later,
of course, but he

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.390
became a phenomenal
mentor for me, so much so

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:58.150
that he actually became
the first investor

00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:59.390
of my first business.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.864
So it was a great opportunity
to learn from him,

00:51:01.864 --> 00:51:03.280
not just about the
SEAL community,

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.470
but about business
and entrepreneurship.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.660
And the downside
was that he also

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.990
liked to swim the La Jolla
Cove every morning at 5:00 AM.

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.240
And he's my mentor and
investor and my first company,

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.738
so guess who also got to swim
the Cove at 5:00 AM every day?

00:51:16.738 --> 00:51:20.630
[SIGHS] Anyways.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.340
And then, of course,
in the SEAL teams,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.950
you informally have
other mentors, basically,

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.800
the older guys who've been there
longer and seen more stuff.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.890
And it was such a great
part of my experience

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.940
that I now mentor young
guys into the program.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.870
I have mentored
seven or eight guys,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.580
and I will say, I'm
seven for seven,

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.480
which of course I take
the full credit for.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.407
But it's really neat, because
it's a way of giving back.

00:51:45.407 --> 00:51:47.240
I had mentors throughout
my entire life that

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.410
really were phenomenal
building blocks for the goals

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:52.460
that I achieved.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.190
And so it's also a way
that I give back now.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.750
Because I get, through social
media and things like that,

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.890
I have high school kids
all the time saying, hey,

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:03.740
I want to go to BUD/S. And I'm
like, oh God, here we go again.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.720
Like, you're a freshman, I can't
do anything for you right now.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.624
However, it's a really
fascinating thing

00:52:08.624 --> 00:52:10.790
to see the drive in these
young kids and the respect

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.930
that I have for them now.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.521
This is the post-9/11 world.

00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:15.020
In the Special
Operations community,

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.580
you will be going to war.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.710
I joined selfishly as more of
a physical challenge, pre-9/11.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.160
I was like, well, I can do that.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.630
So it was a selfish thing.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:24.650
I thought I'd be
traveling the world

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.790
and getting tattoos and
drinking in the Philippines.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.790
And I did all the drinking,
got all the tattoos,

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.380
but I never went
to anywhere nice.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.620
I spent all my time in Iraq and
Afghanistan and other places.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.190
But I have such a respect
for these young kids

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.990
now, going in knowing
that if they make it,

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.830
they will go to war.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.680
They want to serve at
that highest capacity.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.920
I've only mentored officers,
except for this one guy who

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.060
was-- he reached out
first when he was--

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.900
I think he was a freshman
or sophomore in high school.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.530
He's a good Christian
boy from Texas.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:53.030
See?

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.570
Texas.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.920
Told you guys.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.859
And I was very polite,
and I was responsive.

00:52:56.859 --> 00:52:58.400
And my wife was
like, come on, honey.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.780
You don't have time to
respond to every high school

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.460
kid that reaches out,
wanting to be a SEAL.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.793
There's a lot of them out there.

00:53:02.793 --> 00:53:05.791
And I kept in touch, but I
was transparent with them.

00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:08.290
I was like, there's not a whole
lot I can really do for you.

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.914
You're in East Texas,
I'm in San Diego,

00:53:09.914 --> 00:53:12.171
and you're a sophomore
in high school.

00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:13.670
You've got a few
years to go, buddy,

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.320
especially if you're going to
go in right after high school

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.190
and not college.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.782
And he was so persistent,
so determined.

00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:20.240
He just kept training
and training.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.281
He kept in touch off and
on throughout the months

00:53:22.281 --> 00:53:22.970
and years.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.511
And then all of a sudden, I got
home from the office one day,

00:53:25.511 --> 00:53:27.690
and I got a text, and it
said, hey, it's Garrett.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.552
I just checked into BUD/S.
I was like, holy crap.

00:53:30.552 --> 00:53:31.760
I was like, honey, he's here.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.050
And I was like, come
on over to the house.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.726
He is by far the most
disciplined individual

00:53:37.726 --> 00:53:38.600
I have ever mentored.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.220
Far more disciplined
than the officers,

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.420
which was kind of scary, because
they're in a leadership role.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.930
But all he wants to do is
go to SEAL Team 6, which is

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.710
Naval Special Warfare
Development Group.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.024
So if you want to aspire
to go to SEAL Team 6,

00:53:49.024 --> 00:53:50.690
you have to be in the
regular SEAL teams

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:52.550
for at least four years,
have an immaculate record,

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.424
have all the qualifications
that you can only

00:53:54.424 --> 00:53:56.180
get if your top ranked
in your platoon.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.660
He's the lowest ranking--

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:01.910
he just turned 21, and he's
a sniper and a breacher

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:02.910
and a JTAC already.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.940
A JTAC is the
important radio guy

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.800
that talks to the F-22
pilots, telling them

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.030
where to drop ordinance.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.880
Kind of a big responsibility for
a 22-year-old or a 21-year-old.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.190
But he's so emotionally
mature and so disciplined

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:15.240
in his approach.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.120
He doesn't party.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.370
He just studies and works out.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.480
That's all he does.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.000
He's the lowest ranking
guy in his troop,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.460
yet he's the highest ranked,
as far as performance,

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.180
in his troop.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.530
Very well respected.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.410
And so he's a shoo-in for
going through the SEAL Team 6

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.160
selection process.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.590
But it's just a really--
again, I take all the credit

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.660
for his success.

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.200
But it's just fascinating
to see these kids go through

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.300
so-- because mentorship is
as rewarding for the mentor

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.097
as it is for the mentee, at
least I've found that so.

00:54:41.097 --> 00:54:41.680
Good question.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.390
Thank you.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.990
Yes.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.550
Do we have time?

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:43.800
I don't know.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.370
What time is it?

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:44.912
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:54:44.912 --> 00:54:45.661
BRENT GLEESON: OK.

00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:46.170
We're good.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.336
AUDIENCE: Would you allow
or encourage your own sons

00:54:48.336 --> 00:54:49.320
to Navy SEALs?

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.861
BRENT GLEESON: I
always get that one.

00:54:50.861 --> 00:54:52.979
[LAUGHS] I would
like my parents--

00:54:52.979 --> 00:54:54.520
my answer to this
is typically that I

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.606
would be cautiously optimistic.

00:54:56.606 --> 00:54:58.480
Obviously, when I told
my parents about this,

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.670
my mom was somewhat devastated.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.859
But then when 9/11 occurred,
she was very devastated.

00:55:03.859 --> 00:55:06.400
And then when we found that we
would-- my task unit from SEAL

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.580
Team 5, back in 2003, we
were the very first SEALs

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.410
deployed into Iraq.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:14.667
So she was also not super
thrilled about that.

00:55:14.667 --> 00:55:16.750
Because you can go to
what's called CENTCOM, which

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.040
is the Central Command
for Afghanistan, Iraq,

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.640
Syria, or you go to PACOM, where
nothing is really going on,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.620
Guam, Philippines,
Japan, you're just

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.070
doing training and exercises
and readiness drills.

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.920
But everybody wants to
go where the fight is.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.670
And she wanted me to go
where the fight was not.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:36.204
So I would be
cautiously optimistic.

00:55:36.204 --> 00:55:37.120
I would be supportive.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.142
I would never encourage it.

00:55:39.142 --> 00:55:40.600
My dad was a marine
during Vietnam.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.220
Never once did he ever encourage
me to go into the military.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.230
If anything he was--

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:46.060
he was happy I had
a job after college.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.050
So he was like, sweet.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:47.520
Stick with that.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.186
And I was like, I'm
going into the Navy.

00:55:49.186 --> 00:55:51.010
He was like, what?

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.857
You have a job.

00:55:51.857 --> 00:55:53.440
I just paid for four
years of college.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.490
What are you doing?

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:58.120
But again, if there was
passion there and drive,

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.770
I would be very supportive.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.360
I found this statistic
out recently,

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.100
because I do a lot of tours
of the training facility

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.380
to help raise money for
the SEAL Family Foundation

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.592
that I'm on the board of.

00:56:06.592 --> 00:56:08.800
And they giving this tour,
and that question came up.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.220
And they were like, well, how
often do the sons of SEALs

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.600
make it through training?

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.880
It's actually a funny statistic.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.790
The answer was, guys, we're
not a family business.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:21.530
Statistically, the sons of SEALs
are less likely to make it.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:22.790
I don't know why that is.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.310
I don't know if they go in
with a different approach

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:26.410
or some sort of an
entitled mindset thing.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:28.912
Well, clearly, I've got the
blood of a SEAL warrior running

00:56:28.912 --> 00:56:29.620
through my veins.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.578
Obviously, this is going
to be a piece of cake.

00:56:31.578 --> 00:56:32.820
And most of them quit.

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.820
Sometimes they get injured
and things like that.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.290
But it's just the same risk that
my parents were worried about

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:42.281
of having a good
job out of college

00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:44.530
and taking the risk to go
into the Navy for five years

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.750
and knowing that 90% will fail.

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.790
That their point
was, well, you're

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:51.790
kind of putting your life
on hold for five years

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:55.622
when you fail out of BUD/S.
So of course that gave me

00:56:55.622 --> 00:56:57.080
the drive not to
fail out of BUD/S.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.314
But I wouldn't encourage it,
but I would be supportive.

00:57:01.314 --> 00:57:02.600
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.680
What did you tell your
brother when you made it?

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.950
BRENT GLEESON: [LAUGHS]
He was at graduation.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.520
I was like, what's up, bro?

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.561
[LAUGHS] How are
you doing by that?

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.560
How's your career going?

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.687
[LAUGHS] He was--

00:57:15.687 --> 00:57:18.270
any of the people in your life
that are naysayers, being like,

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.860
oh, that's probably
not a good decision.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.710
I mean, again, once you
make it through Hell Week,

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:25.360
it's very unlikely
that you're not

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.960
going to make it all the way.

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:32.230
We weed 90% of the people
out in the first five weeks.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:35.985
So within five weeks of being
at BUD/S, whoever was saying

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.026
you couldn't do it is
going to know that you can

00:57:38.026 --> 00:57:39.900
or that you failed, like
they said you would.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.416
So.

00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:43.484
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:57:43.484 --> 00:57:46.490
AUDIENCE: So of the people
who stuck it out and made it

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.250
till the end, how did
they keep themselves

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.664
motivated in the moment?

00:57:50.664 --> 00:57:53.080
BRENT GLEESON: It's a good
question about keeping yourself

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.340
motivated in the moment.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.740
Another interesting
piece of that is you

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.989
could never predict
the people who

00:57:58.989 --> 00:58:00.280
will be standing at graduation.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.400
Out of the 250 people,
it's not necessarily

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.070
the big, tattoo-covered,
musclebound macho guy,

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.480
or someone who is an Olympic
athlete, or anything.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.199
You could never
hand-pick the people

00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:12.490
who are standing at graduation.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:16.370
It's going to be a total mix
of cognitively, mentally,

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:17.450
physically.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:20.790
And everybody's journey
is totally different.

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.040
Some people are better at
self-motivation than others.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.750
Some people lean on their boat
crew members or classmates

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:27.250
to help motivate them.

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:29.680
And everybody also has their
own specific challenges.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.230
Sometimes they're not
the strongest swimmer,

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.141
so they're worried
about their swim times.

00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:36.640
Or they're not the
strongest runner,

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.348
so they're worried
about their run times.

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.625
Because every phase
you go through BUD/S,

00:58:40.625 --> 00:58:42.500
every evolution gets
more and more difficult.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.190
Your run times have to get
increasingly dramatically

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.879
faster every two months.

00:58:46.879 --> 00:58:48.670
Swim times have to get
dramatically faster.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:52.390
So twice a week, you're always
doing a four-mile timed run

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:54.672
and a timed two-mile ocean swim.

00:58:54.672 --> 00:58:56.380
Not the easiest thing
in the world to do,

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.088
but you have to make
these certain times.

00:58:58.088 --> 00:59:00.642
So it's not just the physical
strain and the academic part

00:59:00.642 --> 00:59:03.100
of it, because you're working
and getting your butt kicked.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.590
Especially in the early days,
until 1 o'clock in the morning,

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.375
you've got to get up at 4:00
for your four-mile timed run,

00:59:07.375 --> 00:59:09.400
and you have homework to do
and studying for your exam

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:09.899
tomorrow.

00:59:09.899 --> 00:59:11.710
So you really get no
sleep, but then it's

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:15.375
also the stress and anxiety
of not just the academic side,

00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:17.500
but all that difficult
evolutions you have to pass.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.240
Because on most
of the evolutions

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.830
early on, whether it's
the drown-proofing or some

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:26.110
of these drills that
weed a lot of people

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:29.000
out because they're not
comfortable in the water,

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.010
it's the stress of not
passing those things.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.750
So it's not just
the physical strain,

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:36.290
but the mental stress that if
you fail, at once, you're done.

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:37.390
I mean, that's it.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.580
On most of these evolutions,
you get one chance.

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.530
So you can imagine
how stressful.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.640
Every single day you get
out of bed, you're like--

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.540
I remember the anxiety of just
every morning, I would get up--

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.480
and this benefited
me later in life,

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.866
because I can now manage stress
like you couldn't believe.

00:59:52.866 --> 00:59:55.240
If nobody's trying to blow me
up or shoot me in the face,

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.050
I'm good to go.

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.920
Any problem is a
problem that's solvable.

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.461
But I would get up
every morning at 4

00:59:59.461 --> 01:00:01.330
o'clock just literally
wrought with anxiety,

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.740
knowing that one, I'm
going to get my butt

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.580
kicked all day long.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.860
But two, what if I fail
one of these evolutions.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.330
It wasn't so much self-doubt,
but knowing that the numbers

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.420
speak for themselves.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.290
The statistics speak
for themselves.

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.190
And knowing that there was a
possible element of failure.

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:18.205
So the answer to your
question is that it's

01:00:18.205 --> 01:00:19.330
different for every person.

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.704
Everybody has a
different journey

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.240
and their own
different challenges.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.390
For me, it wasn't swimming or
running or specific evolutions.

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:27.600
I didn't have a lot of
problems with those.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.430
It was the entirety of the
whole thing, and the grind,

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:33.732
and the stress physically
and mentally that was just--

01:00:33.732 --> 01:00:36.190
it's just very hard to overcome
that level of stress, which

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:38.930
is also why oftentimes, the
guys out of high school,

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:41.920
the younger folks, don't make
it, because they haven't had,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.640
really, any life experience.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640
They haven't-- you know,
they're coming from mom

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.020
and dad's house.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.630
So oftentimes they don't
have the emotional maturity

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.830
or mental fortitude yet.

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.732
Not that being a
fraternity guy in college

01:00:53.732 --> 01:00:55.690
really gets you ready
for SEAL training either,

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.420
but it's oftentimes
too why they just

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.190
don't have the mental fortitude
to handle that anxiety.

01:01:03.919 --> 01:01:04.710
Well, thanks, guys.

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:05.680
I really appreciate it.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.570
Thanks for showing up.

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:07.278
Thank you, Wendy.

01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:08.370
Thanks, Steve.

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.310
Appreciate it, guys.
