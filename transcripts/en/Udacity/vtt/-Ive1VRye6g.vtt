00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, when we look back at Galileo's data, we had this pattern

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that we wanted to see emerging--this 1, 4, 9, 16.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
These seem to be squares, perfect squares.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, one thing I should mention is an assumption we're making.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The assumption we're making when we do this experiment or just about any experiment

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is that nature is repeatable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
By that I mean when we roll the ball for 1 unit of time,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if we actually role for 1 unit, the ball will go the exact same distance in all five of these trials.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The reason why these numbers aren't all identical

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is because we either miss-timed or miss-measured the distance.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's an error on our end.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's an error on our end, not on nature's end.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
To quantify the error on our end, how good we are at making these observations,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we've calculated this average deviation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What this average deviation tells us is that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for each of these trials, each of these four different experiments,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we believe the true distance to be, well, for example, 1 Â± 0.01 distance units--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
whatever those distances were.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That means the true value here could have been between 0.99 and 1.01.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That means we believe that the minimum distance this ball actually rolled was 0.99

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the max was 1.01.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is 1 - 0.01, and this is 1 + 0.01.

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What would be the minimum and maximum possible true distances for this example?
