[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:07.550
SHIH HUA LIONG:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.540
Thanks for coming.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.870
And welcome, David,
to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.040
DAVID ADJAYE: Thank you.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.498
SHIH HUA LIONG:
Just a quick intro.

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.810
David is one of the leading
architects of his generation.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.560
I'm sure you've heard a lot
about him in the news of late.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.850
One of the most
significant projects

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.190
I think that you've done to
date, at least in the US,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.940
is the Smithsonian's
National Museum

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.800
of African-American
History and Culture.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.770
And so would really love to
talk to you a little bit more

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.480
about that.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.380
I know you were
born in Tanzania,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.200
come from a family of diplomats,
you moved around a lot,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.800
lived in many different cities,
and sort of have your base

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.400
in London.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.730
Adjaye Associates
has offices in London

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.760
and New York, Berlin
and Accra, right?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.014
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.430
SHIH HUA LIONG:
And so we'd really

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
love to hear a little bit
more about your background

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.260
and how that's sort of shaped
you and your work today.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.656
DAVID ADJAYE: Well, I was born--

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:11.237
well, I'm not going to give
you a date, [LAUGHS] but--

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.320
well, that doesn't matter.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.450
That's OK.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.520
But I was born at a time when
Africa was really transforming

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.560
from a colonial
sort of continent

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.370
to a country of independent
sort of countries.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.490
And my father was part
of that first generation

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.670
of independence
diplomats and politicians

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.225
who were trying to
make the country.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:36.220
And so I was born on the
that soup of that change

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.140
and this kind of old
world, new world trying

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.000
to forge a new identity.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.760
And my father was really part
of that generation of diplomats

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.340
that was then sent to
Africa first, but then

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.400
the world, to learn how to
be diplomats of a state.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.850
And so my childhood was two
years in a different city,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.960
six months, three months.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.070
And we went from--

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.250
my parents are [INAUDIBLE],,
with just west Africa,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.130
but me and my brothers
were born in east Africa,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.970
so Uganda, Kenya.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.050
And then we migrated up to north
Africa, to the Middle East,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.460
and then to Europe.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.770
So by the time I was 13, I had
sort of lived in nearly 15,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.270
20 cities.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.460
SHIH HUA LIONG: And why
did you choose London

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.250
as your sort of home base?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.150
DAVID ADJAYE: I didn't choose
it, my father chose London.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.470
My youngest brother-- we're
all very different, competing.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380
We're four boys,
very competitive.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.463
But my youngest brother
is mentally and physically

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.700
handicapped.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.870
When he was five years old,
he had a fever in Africa

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.060
and it was incredibly
difficult to deal with it.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.360
The temperature sort of
flipped into sort of a really

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.570
unsustainable level and he
came out two weeks later

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.696
with brain damage.

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:54.070
So it happened when he was
five and it was very traumatic

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.330
for my family.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.040
And a way, it was
the time that sort of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.035
shifted the dynamic of traveling
in my family and my father.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:01.160
My father's career changed.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.820
He became local staff,
rather than carrying on

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.710
as a kind of career diplomat.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.710
And he chose London
because predominately, we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.010
had gone to Anglophone
schools, so English schools.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.400
So he decided that London
was the right place for us

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.940
to stay and to get the care
that he needed for my youngest

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.439
brother, the sort of best
medical care that he could.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.230
SHIH HUA LIONG: And I
feel like that really

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.470
speaks to the core of who
you are as an architect,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.040
right, in terms of the social
responsibility of architecture

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.180
and how it can transform
our societies So talk

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.520
to us a little bit about that.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.228
DAVID ADJAYE: No.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:38.650
I mean, in a way, that's
the grounding which

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.580
started my interest in the
nature of space and space

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.400
and society, space and citizens,
space and freedom, space

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.240
and accessibility.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.500
And it just came
from a young child

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.010
pushing a disabled
brother around everywhere.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.800
And in the late '80, early '90s,
disability were not around.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.230
So we would always
be the family that

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.860
were kind of pushing our brother
to the back of a building

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.610
and sort of yanking him up and
getting people to sort of hold

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.929
him to get him up into buildings
because ramps weren't around.

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:16.720
Very simple things like
ramps and elevators

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.945
that make level access for
people, all these things

00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:19.570
weren't around.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.790
And it really got me incensed.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.850
And things like come respite
centers for disabled people,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.030
places to have good
care would be given,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.220
those are very ad hoc
and horrible places

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.280
with just sort of infrastructure
that really slightly

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.560
de-humanized the
experience that was already

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.800
a kind of traumatic experience
for people without ability.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.020
And for some strange
reason, architecture,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.140
I became very sensitized to it.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.240
And I decided that it wasn't
just for me about aesthetics

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.870
or monuments or
anything like that,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.620
but it was also principally
an approach problem-solving,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.440
but it's also about a kind of
democratizing this knowledge

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.920
to create the greatest
opportunity for everyone

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.730
so that architectural design
is not just for an elite

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.610
or for people who
can afford things.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.240
It's not about the value of
it, it's about the intellect.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.070
And if the intellect
is what's being sold,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.540
then that should be able
kind of be for everyone.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.820
We like to say in
our office, we really

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.930
believe that luxury
should be for everyone.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.900
And we don't mean luxury
as in gold, but luxury

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.260
as the capacity to think should
be for a project which is maybe

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.850
making a cafe for a truck
stop in the middle of nowhere

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.850
as much as maybe
working for you guys.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.830
It's the same.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.490
SHIH HUA LIONG: Absolutely.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.800
I think that's a really good
segue to some of the work

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.490
that you're doing here in
New York with the Sugar Hill

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.600
Housing Program in
Harlem, which I'm

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.660
quite familiar with because
it's right down the road for me.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.439
So 125 units of
affordable housing.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.230
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.040
SHIH HUA LIONG:
Tell us a little bit

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.140
about how you got
that project and what

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.480
it meant to you and
you and even the motifs

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.470
that you see at the
front of the building.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.261
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:05:59.261 --> 00:06:01.970
That was my first big
competition in the city.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.790
And I really was
very excited about it

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.100
because essentially, the
principal tenant of it

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.550
was to deal with homeless
housing in New York

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.761
and to use design to really talk
about how do you integrate--

00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:18.260
homeless housing usually is
seen as a blight on communities,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.134
people don't want to
have it near their homes

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:22.184
because they think it
devalues their property,

00:06:22.184 --> 00:06:24.350
there's all this kind of
stigma with the communities

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.620
that are around it.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.430
And we said this was a
very important project

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.610
because it deals with a
key and clear social issue

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.730
and that actually, design can
be used to coordinate, solve

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.892
the problem of the sort
of flow and movement

00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:39.850
that happens around these
institutions in terms

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.350
of different types
of people, but also

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.870
that we can also make an
architecture that gives dignity

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.760
to this community
but is not expensive.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.650
It's also in that sort
of low cost budget.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.110
And it was a big signature
project for DeBlasio.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.347
It started at the end
of Bloomberg's sort

00:06:57.347 --> 00:06:59.180
of administration and
became DeBlasio's kind

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.420
of signature project to talk
about the importance of housing

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.870
for all.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.080
So in a way, the architectural
discussion at the time

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.842
was about luxury buildings and
ever more fantastical shapes,

00:07:09.842 --> 00:07:12.050
but actually the kind of
more meaningful conversation

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.660
was happening about,
well, how do we

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.480
get good design right to the
people that need it most?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.870
Of the building really
speaks to the history

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.850
of its place in
the sense that it

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.740
talks about the
fact that actually,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.980
that part of East Harlem
was only 100 years ago

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.020
seen as the countryside.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.880
It's very funny.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.900
It was farmland.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.200
SHIH HUA LIONG: Right.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.890
It was upstate.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.098
DAVID ADJAYE: It was upstate.

00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:37.080
That's where you got
to get away from it all

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.400
and now it's very much
the island and the city.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.270
And so we wanted to
kind of reference that.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.180
So we were referencing
the great bucolic idea

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.897
of kind of flower gardens.

00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:48.230
and there were many flower
gardens up there at that time

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.200
because Harlem is a Dutch word,
it was a Dutch colony actually,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.970
that sort of formed
that Upper Harlem.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.550
So I was very
fascinated by that,

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.834
this idea of a kind of Dutch
farming sort of flowering

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:03.500
kind of culture.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.170
So that's kind of embossed
in the architecture.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.710
But it's also where Duke
Ellington parked his car,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.900
it used to be a car
park there all the time.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:18.470
And the building has
about a 30% intake

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.900
of musicians who, for
some strange reason,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.810
are probably the largest
group that become homeless.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.390
Because we see these kind
of successful musicians,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.470
but there are so many
that dedicate their lives

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.210
and don't make it and sort of
don't have family, fall out

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.789
of the social structure,
and end up on the street.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.620
And they're these incredibly
talented people who have just

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.100
fallen off the edge of society.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.422
So it sort of was interesting
that the building is sort of

00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:46.130
filled with those
characters so we wanted

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.939
to make spaces where they
could teach and support,

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:50.480
that's part of the
buildings program,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.680
that they can mentor young
kids or do rich programs.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.260
There's a storytelling museum
that we put in because we also

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.620
wanted to not have a
building like this not

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.120
be near culture because it's
usually the furthest thing away

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.650
for this community
to be near culture.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.220
So we brokered with the
city and with the sort

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.180
of cultural
institutions to create

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.480
a children's storytelling
museum in the building

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.140
so that there's
continual life coming

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.600
and the arts are
celebrated there.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.270
The performing arts
are there, that's

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.874
a little bit of commercial
space but very, very little.

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:24.290
SHIH HUA LIONG:
And the preschool.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.490
DAVID ADJAYE: And
there's the preschool,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.198
which is a very, very
important component

00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:29.660
to have very high quality
preschool offering

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.999
right in the building.

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:33.040
And the third part which,
is not fully activated,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.930
is that there's a kind
of farmer's market

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.060
that kind of sometimes
comes to the plaza.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.730
But actually, we got
zoning from Amanda Burton

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.487
to allow urban farms to be
on the roof of the residents

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:45.820
so they can have their own
allotments on the roof, which

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.800
we're working on now.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.580
So really, the building is
a kind of a total ecology

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.950
and really, these are
people who are just

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.020
getting their first homes of
families are single people.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.130
And it's meant to
show that this can

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.710
be a transmitory part and a kind
of dignified part of our city.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.586
It doesn't have to feel
like it's some negative.

00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:05.710
SHIH HUA LIONG: Absolutely.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.550
And you talk a lot about
some of the artists

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.770
and you've worked
with a lot of artists.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.450
I know in Harlem, you're also
working on the Studio Museum.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.890
So tell us a little bit about
what that project entails

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.339
and how it's going to sort of
transform that neighborhood.

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:20.130
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.320
So where we were, the Sugar
Hill project is on a 155th,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.270
so up in sort of East Harlem.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.690
But the Studio Museum in
Harlem is really the beginning

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.460
of the sort of black Renaissance
arts movement in the US,

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.530
really sort of at the
moment of the civil rights

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.850
kind of emancipation moment.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.870
So it's really their 50th
anniversary right now.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.270
And they were
basically an agency

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.520
to deal with the
racism in the arts.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.750
It's really sort of secluded
a lot of white artists

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.860
and sculptors from coming
into the mainstream

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.880
because it just wasn't seen
to be what they should be--

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.286
they weren't considered
part of the canon.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.160
So there were many
artists that were actually

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.490
collaborating with
many white artists

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.200
as young sort of practitioners.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.930
But then as their
careers blossomed,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.710
the black artists were
kind of left behind

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.168
and the white
artists kind of rose.

00:11:12.168 --> 00:11:13.800
And intellectually,
there was a lot

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.417
of kind of fertile sort of
relationship between these two

00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:18.000
organizations.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.724
As And so the Studio Museum
was born to kind of collect

00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:22.140
this group and not
to let them get

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.380
lost and to also make
sure that there was agency

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.620
and support for this community.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.210
So it started off very
much as a very low budget

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.700
thing, just very simple spaces.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.180
Then they got the building
on 125th through the city,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.580
brokering a deal with them
to give them a cheap rent.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.250
And then Max Bond,
an amazing architect,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.260
refurbished it and created three
very large rooms to show work.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.750
And more or less, that was
maybe in the sort of '60s

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.580
and that has lasted till now.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.080
And space has been
falling apart.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.820
But last year there was a
big competition in the city

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.820
and internationally.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.020
We won the competition
to rebuild it.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.840
And the idea is to really
turn it into the premier arts

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.430
destination in the north of
the city, so away sort of

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.900
off the Museum Mile, but up on
125th, very close to Apollo.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.950
And really, 125th is
changing dramatically.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.910
But it's lot of commercial
sort of business is coming

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.000
and there's very little
cultural anchors.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.016
So places like the Apollo,
places like the Studio Museum

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.390
become very
important to the city

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.460
because the anchor a
certain continuity.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.750
So we are making a building
which tries to create in a way

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.230
that the Whitney
created something

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.786
in '77, a cultural anchor,
that could have just

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:42.660
become a kind of
residential area completely.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.240
But that cultural
anchor defined the way

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.800
in which that center works.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.730
We're hoping that by creating
a significant cultural offering

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.935
of exhibition spaces, lecture
spaces, public engagement

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:57.060
education kind of programs
which are very important

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.059
and studios for artists,
what they became famous

00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:02.490
for is that they incubated
artists and gave them

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.190
a year or two years'
studio space to perfect

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.249
their work as residents.

00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:09.915
And so that program
will still continue,

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.790
so there will be
artist-in-residence programs

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.910
still going on there.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.190
And this will become a kind
of major arts destination

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.100
on 125th.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.280
And we're working with the city,
sort of quite a way into it,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.960
we'll be starting
on site next year

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.168
to really build this very
significant building, which

00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:26.320
will hopefully create
an anchor on 125th

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.757
and then carry the story on in a
kind of much more powerful way.

00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:30.840
SHIH HUA LIONG: Wonderful.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.490
We look forward to
seeing that in New York.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.666
DAVID ADJAYE: I think they're
releasing images in the fall.

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:35.749
SHIH HUA LIONG: Oh, great.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:40.170
So we talked about sort of
social housing, the arts.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.810
I want to sort of turn
the focus a little bit

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.340
on libraries and
access to information.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.110
Libraries have
really become the--

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.920
well, used to really
be the focal point

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.910
of a community for information.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.330
I know you've worked on the
libraries in the UK, the two

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.040
ideas.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.377
DAVID ADJAYE: [INAUDIBLE], yes.

00:13:59.377 --> 00:14:01.710
SHIH HUA LIONG: Tell us about
the challenges around that

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.250
and how you've been able
to sort of transform.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.190
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.597
Well, it's interesting
because the two projects

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:10.680
that I won really at the
beginning my career, sort

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.430
of 2002, were at that moment
when the internet really

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.650
was becoming something that
was clearly going to change

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.000
our world or our
lives and was starting

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.870
to impact the typology
of certain institutions

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.530
like libraries.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.030
And so there was a
lot of discussion

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.140
at that time and everybody
said, well, libraries

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.070
are going to disappear
and everything's

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.390
going to be on their laptops.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.580
And to a certain extent,
it's completely changed,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.450
but libraries
haven't disappeared.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.410
But they have completely changed
because in a way, if you think

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.090
about the library,
we think of libraries

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.590
sort of in a romantic
sense in terms

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.330
of academic and
historical libraries.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.750
But libraries for normal
people, citizens in the city,

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.155
really happened post-war in
almost all Western cities.

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.780
It really was after the war that
there was a systematic program

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.650
to make boxes with books,
and usually a certain amount

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.376
of books which gave you a
sort of body of knowledge.

00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:00.750
And that was the way in which
every suburb had something,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.150
and that was the first thing
out of libraries outside

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:08.282
of the university or the kind
of great sort of institutions.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.990
So it's really a modern
typology, but one

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.727
that very quickly became--

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:12.810
SHIH HUA LIONG: Died down.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.580
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah, died down.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.080
It shrunk.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.660
But also it became
something that

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.720
became a very important way
for families and communities

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.750
to have access to
the sort of-- it

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.149
became a first device to
democratize knowledge, really.

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:26.940
But in doing that, also
what it did-- apart

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.398
from just democratizing
knowledge--

00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:31.470
it also became a
multigenerational institution

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.660
for communities.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.060
Because as communities,
we basically

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.240
stay away from different
generations naturally.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.090
We stay with our
tribes, our age groups.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.086
And places like
libraries are actually

00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:45.960
one of the few places
where multi-generations

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.340
come together.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.820
You see young kids,
you see teens,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.370
you see toddlers,
grandma and grandpa.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.410
And actually, what
we've all realized

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.750
is that these are really
powerful social incubating

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.840
spaces.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.540
So the competition
entry was to say

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.469
that the library, yes in terms
of the information has shifted,

00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:03.510
but actually the idea of
that kind of destination

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.570
in the community that
brings multi-generations

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.920
together is even more
necessary in a world

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.220
where we are now tapped into
things and in a world where

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.190
things are very expensive
for certain families

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.205
and our kind of notion of the
unit of the family structure

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:17.770
has changed.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:18.900
The library has to do more.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.290
It has to become a place
where maybe a single parent

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.540
family can allow their kids
to stay till 11 o'clock,

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.030
not just open as a kind of nine
to five or nine till seven.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.400
It has to kind of offer
language classes maybe

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.090
or motor mechanics
or learning massage,

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.680
it has to offer computer skills.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.116
So actually, what
it started to do

00:16:40.116 --> 00:16:41.490
was it started to
melt what we're

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.700
calling lifelong learning
with library services

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.560
and the notion of
a community center.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.660
And so the libraries
that you're seeing now,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.110
we prototyped those
two at that time

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.610
and we won a lot
of awards for it

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.055
and started talking about it.

00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:57.180
And there have been a lot
of big signature projects

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.810
that were done, but those
were the first to community

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.526
sort of transformations that
really showed the library

00:17:03.526 --> 00:17:04.650
world that they could work.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.210
And it suddenly just
mushroomed around the world.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.970
We had all these library people
coming to London to learn

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.068
and it's really had
this incredible effect

00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:11.859
all over the world.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.569
And I was also then brought
sort of almost a decade later

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.119
to Washington to also then
kickstart their program when

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.160
then Mayor Anthony Williams came
to London to see the libraries,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.990
called me, and wanted me to
go talk to his library team.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.090
And we built two libraries
in Washington, as well.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.190
And it was, again, helping
them understand this model

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.320
and really bring
that into making

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.870
a kind of signature
building which becomes

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.100
an important community hub.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.790
And it's amazing when we
opened these buildings,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.498
people thought, oh,
nobody's going to go.

00:17:41.498 --> 00:17:45.040
They're so full,
they're oversubscribed

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.207
and people are being pushed
out when they want to close.

00:17:48.207 --> 00:17:49.290
It's actually the reverse.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.260
We realized that actually
with the kind of accessibility

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
we have, we also now crave
sort of powerful spaces

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.710
that allow us to have
a kind of social life

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.490
that's meaningful
beyond a retail mall

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.184
or street, sidewalk.

00:18:01.184 --> 00:18:02.100
SHIH HUA LIONG: Right.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.290
And you talk about how
the library has also

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.540
started to attract
sort of teenagers,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.590
where it's the spot to go to
is let's meet at the library.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.040
DAVID ADJAYE: That was actually
our benchmark of success.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.920
We said if we could
attract young teenagers

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.306
to meet in the library,
rather than at a retail mall,

00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:21.180
then we were winning.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.080
SHIH HUA LIONG: Absolutely.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.580
DAVID ADJAYE: And
that was the test,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.220
and thankfully it did happen.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.430
SHIH HUA LIONG: So I'm glad
you mentioned Washington.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.390
With your significant
sort of signature project

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.050
there, I'm sure
the audience also

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:41.580
love to hear about just the
process of how you started

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.480
the project, also the
significance of the crown

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.480
at the National History
of African-American

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.616
Culture and History.

00:18:51.616 --> 00:18:55.770
DAVID ADJAYE: Well, that museum
is really a project sort of I

00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:02.220
guess 200 years in the making,
philosophically, and 20 years

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.880
to really bring to fruition.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.140
And it's the last possible
site on the monumental core

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.800
of Washington.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.330
The Mall is divided into two
sections, if you don't know it.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.480
It's basically the museums
that go up to the Capitol

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.840
from 15th and
Constitution Drive.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.710
If you don't know DC,
it's basically a cruciform

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.650
and one part of the cruciform is
very strict, very French, very

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.345
ordered with lots of museums.

00:19:30.094 --> 00:19:32.010
The Science and History
Museum is there, there

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.100
sort of Hirshhorn is there,
the Smithsonian Castle,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.797
the American Museum et cetera.

00:19:36.797 --> 00:19:38.880
And then on the other side,
you have the monuments

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.330
of the nation and it's much more
in a kind of English landscape.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.180
And it's taken 200
years to build this.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.721
And actually, when
the plan was made,

00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:49.107
there was a kind of petition
to have a museum that

00:19:49.107 --> 00:19:50.940
talked about the
African-American experience

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.800
and its contribution
to America, but it

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.270
was dismissed as not relevant.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.170
And so it's the
last building that

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.660
can possibly be built on the
Mall in terms of its master

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.710
plan.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.880
All the institutional
buildings have been built

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.160
and the monuments are full.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.650
They have to find places to
make new monuments, which

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.750
is why the Vietnam
Memorial is so powerful.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.900
It was kind of discovering
a new way of doing it.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.426
And we've just
completed the last site,

00:20:16.426 --> 00:20:18.300
which seemed like the
worst site because it's

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.662
half the size of all
the other museums.

00:20:20.662 --> 00:20:22.620
But in a way, the position
of it is so powerful

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.300
that it allowed
us to do something

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.870
that maybe we couldn't have
done if we had a different site.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.330
So the museum is
really trying to talk

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:37.560
about the story of the
African-American sort narrative

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.400
from really the Declaration of
Independence, the declaration

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.760
of emancipation to now.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.370
So really, there's a kind of
journey from the 14th century,

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.280
so there's a kind of moment
to think about the impact

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.710
of slavery and the kind of
commercialization of human

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.550
trade and how America's
foundations are in that,

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.950
but then really how this
community evolves out of that

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.830
kind of trauma, moved through
incredible movements which

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.660
shift the legislation and
the mood of this country--

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.660
and it's ongoing, as we know--

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.960
and how that really
allows you to understand

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.420
the identity of the
African-American here

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.130
but also to understand
the identity of America.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.847
It's not just a museum
for the community,

00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:21.430
it's actually an
American museum which

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.910
really helps you to
understand fundamentally

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.100
how America is made.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.110
And its narrative for
us was that it really

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.270
also cements the
relationship between Africa

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.560
and the Americas.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.351
Because by the slave
trade, you have

00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:35.850
this kind of
incredible relationship

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.464
that is sort of formed.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.880
And so we said
that we didn't want

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.140
to just make a museum
which is maybe just

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.765
to make a kind of
Greek temple and then

00:21:41.765 --> 00:21:45.035
fill it with artifacts or a
palace or a fabulous building.

00:21:45.035 --> 00:21:47.160
We thought that with this
building in being so late

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.440
but being so important
should really

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.150
be from its very silhouette be
a narrative about the story.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.890
So in a way, it
contributes both in terms

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.130
of its aura in its
landscape as a monument,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.940
but also then as a museum
educating in its content.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.240
And that kind of very decision
was what distinguished us

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.450
from our peers because
we were able to present

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.500
a narrative about how you make
form, which was about speaking

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.960
from the silhouette
to the very smallest

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.780
thing inside the building,
that everything is kind of part

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.420
of the content of
understanding this narrative,

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.599
everything is asking
you questions.

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:25.890
So when we opened the building,
people were like, well,

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.590
what is this?

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.250
And so the storytelling
started then.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:35.550
It's inspired by
Benin caryatid shrine

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.700
structures in West Africa.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.260
Why?

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.410
A large part of the
community comes from there.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.600
Because it was commercial trade,
it was meticulously documented,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.640
shockingly.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.580
No data about people's
names or tribes or anything,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.870
but the content--

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.680
the ships' cargo.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.690
So we know where
the ships came from

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.580
and what they did,
so we know the areas.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.490
And so we made a fiction about
that time, the 14th century,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.240
what would be the great
things that people

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.550
would know about from
west and central Africa?

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.892
And they would all know
about the Yoruba of Benin

00:23:08.892 --> 00:23:10.600
because they were the
greatest craftsmen.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.330
They were the Greeks
of Europe, so they

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.390
were the Greeks of west Africa.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.870
They were the best casters,
the best woodworkers,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.200
and the employers or the courts
and empires that were around.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.850
There was a lot
of intermarrying.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.100
So we said, well, OK,
let's look at the best

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.870
arts from that
place and let's see

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.580
if we can use that as
a reference to say,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.746
this would be one of the
kind of high points of kind

00:23:31.746 --> 00:23:35.840
of an artistic kind of moment
that would be a memory.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.590
And then let's kind
of create a hybridity,

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.020
which is the African-American
experience between Africa

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.620
and America, but then talking
about the experience of then

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.890
sort of coming from the roots
of the South, the agrarian

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.600
landscape, working the land,
building the infrastructure

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.290
of the country, labor.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.000
And we wanted to look
at sort of the kind

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.660
of beautiful traditions of
ironworking, ironsmithing,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.370
which was something
that a lot of--

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.927
if you weren't in the military
or a carpenter or on the field,

00:24:03.927 --> 00:24:05.760
ironsmithing was a very
important labor that

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.680
actually built a lot of South--

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.080
railway buildings, et cetera.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.450
And a lot of
African-American slaves

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.000
in kind of their first sort
of when they became free

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.995
went into artsmithing as trades.

00:24:16.995 --> 00:24:18.120
So we wanted to honor that.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.620
We particularly
looked at somebody

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.400
from Charleston who now is
becoming very well-known as one

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.120
of the kind of great ironsmiths
of his time, Philip Simmons.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.460
And I took one of
his metal ironworks

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.710
and sort of mapped it
and created a screen

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.124
from the mapping,
literally, to create

00:24:38.124 --> 00:24:40.040
sort of what looks like
an ornamental pattern.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.610
But it's actually
really a redrawing

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.790
of this man's work
as a kind of way

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.320
to hybridize the corona form and
to create the nature of labor

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.030
in the kind of detail
of the building.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.230
So that became a kind
of way to kind of make

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.280
kind of a very
complicated skin which

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.600
is environmentally responsive.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.860
We're the first gold LEEDs
building on the Mall.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.090
I know it's shocking, but
we recollect our water,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.247
we're sustainable.

00:25:04.247 --> 00:25:06.080
And then really because
the building concept

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.390
was to put 50% of the
building underground

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.870
and then to create two
special chambers up above

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.270
and to create a narrative
where you go down 80 feet

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.380
and then you rise up, which is
not a normal museum narrative.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.060
In fact, all the
museum people said,

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.410
this will never work because
you should go into a lobby,

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.990
it should be grand, and then
you go into rooms like the Met.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.890
And we said, no.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.140
SHIH HUA LIONG: Rethinking it.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.560
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.270
So we rethought
this and in a way,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.340
we buried history in the ground.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.820
And then we talked about
the first professional class

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.880
being in the upper
level and then

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.290
the sort of performing arts and
entertainment being above that.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.500
And then we created also
the end of the project

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.370
to draw people the best view
of the entire Mall at the top,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.137
where you have a
window which gives

00:25:51.137 --> 00:25:52.970
you views all the way
to Arlington and right

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:53.595
to the Capitol.

00:25:53.595 --> 00:25:55.136
And it's the only
place where you can

00:25:55.136 --> 00:25:56.349
get this incredible overview.

00:25:56.349 --> 00:25:57.890
So we turned the
building into a sort

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.890
of bit of a sort of a
tower, a ziggurat, that you

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.440
sort of climb, a journey
that you go from the ground

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.310
up to the top.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.320
And in doing the
work, our instincts

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.851
were sort of proven right
because we placed it

00:26:09.851 --> 00:26:11.600
in the ground and there
was a slave market

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.850
just behind the White
House on this site, which

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.400
was astonishing when we
find out the history.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.442
So we sort of in a way
by not building on one

00:26:19.442 --> 00:26:20.900
sit e putting things
underneath it,

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.850
we sort of kept the kind
of sacred relationship

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.971
to that land.

00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:28.220
It's a place where everybody
arrives on the north side

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.460
and waits and there's
a kind of water pool

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.180
that just kind of
celebrates that idea.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.870
So the building is
full of narratives.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.828
We could keep talking
about it for a long time,

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:39.005
but it's something that I would
encourage people to experience.

00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:40.130
SHIH HUA LIONG: Definitely.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.606
Thank you for sharing that.

00:26:41.606 --> 00:26:42.980
I'll just cover
one more question

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.460
and we can open it
up to the audience.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.510
So you were born
in Africa, you've

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.820
lived there for a long time,
you're doing a lot of work

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.600
there.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.480
Tell us about what key
projects are happening in

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.960
Africa and perhaps some of the
challenges in working there.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.880
DAVID ADJAYE: Challenges,
there are a lot.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.660
So there's a kind of second
wave of a sense of kind

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.560
of developed, especially
in central and west Africa,

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.680
and also in east Africa
now, and their governments

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.430
are trying to deal
with very difficult--

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.071
these are nations that
are only 50 years old.

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:16.820
We think of Africa
with its great history,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.903
but in terms of its modern
history, its modernity,

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:20.149
it's really new.

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:22.190
And just as the civil
rights were happening here,

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.110
that's when actually African
independence was happening

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.280
and kind of new identities
were being formed.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.092
So the first wave
was very interesting,

00:27:28.092 --> 00:27:30.550
people like [INAUDIBLE] building
incredible infrastructure,

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.190
et cetera.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.190
But really, it pitted
out and got quite a lot

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:39.320
of problems in terms of
power and opportunity,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.650
all the sort of things
that beginning states have.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.120
But there is a kind
of movement now

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.250
where economies are
getting more robust,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.250
people are starting to
learn how to kind of work

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.365
within a globalized world.

00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:51.740
And certain leaders now have
understood that architecture

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.710
is very much part of that, that
architecture and infrastructure

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.780
have to be brought together.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.780
So I'm working for the Ghanian
government right now helping

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.700
to develop their
rail infrastructure

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.980
system for the country, talking
about nodal sort of points

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.270
and how we develop
terminals that

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.260
celebrate sort of civic life.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.060
In Dakar, I'm working
with the World Bank

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.939
to kind of put their
infrastructure directly

00:28:16.939 --> 00:28:18.980
in the continent and not
just have it in America,

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.190
but to have it on the ground
so that the countries that

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.940
are being served actually
have a kind of base there.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.226
In places like Gabon, I'm
helping the government maser

00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:31.646
of the campus to kind of have
a much more smart government

00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:34.020
campus where people can find
things and relate to things.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.769
So it's like these are
fundamental things,

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:37.670
but these are
nation-building things

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.530
that are really
fascinating to me, as well.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.597
So that's why I have an office
and Accra to deal with that.

00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:45.180
SHIH HUA LIONG: And
we talked about it

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.520
earlier this afternoon,
how working in Africa,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.680
working with governments
now is sort of really

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.550
at the core, right, of
who you are and sort

00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:00.140
of your vision of sort of civic
experience and transformation.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.360
DAVID ADJAYE: It feels
very privileged to be

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.380
able to have that
opportunity because I mean,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.920
my work in London and in New
York has generally tended to be

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.300
much more the private sector.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.840
But now in London also, I'm now
the mayor's design advocate,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.590
so I'm now sort of supporting
in a political role

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.500
the shaping of the city and
the next sort of iteration

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.047
of the mayor's sort of time.

00:29:25.047 --> 00:29:26.630
So that would be
much more into a kind

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.840
of philosophical realm of how
London is going to develop.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.670
But in the US, it's been working
with cultural institutions,

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.400
but in a sense
private [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.860
So to suddenly go full steam
into more the political realm

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.529
feels daunting.

00:29:43.529 --> 00:29:46.070
It's felt very daunting to start
off with because it's really

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.920
something we're not trained to
do, so the logistics of that

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.280
have been a quick a very
steep learning curve.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.450
But what they create from us is
the way we think and the way we

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.200
problem-solve.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.160
I would say aesthetics come
from the problem-solving.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.470
We are obsessed with
aesthetics, but we're

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.340
obsessed with aesthetics as a
solution to problem-solving.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.710
So I always say to my
team, we solve the problem

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.490
and then derive the
aesthetics out of it.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.750
We don't create the aesthetics
and try and solve the problem.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.450
SHIH HUA LIONG: Absolutely.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.950
Great.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.670
Thank you.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.170
And the other thing
I told you about

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.470
was the best part of the
talks is really opening it up

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.800
to the audience.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.912
So would you like to start
and introduce yourself?

00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:28.120
AUDIENCE: My name is Florian.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.494
It's super cool
that you're here,

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.265
so thanks for making time.

00:30:31.265 --> 00:30:32.140
I have two questions.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.490
The first is as you
talked about storytelling,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.970
I recently watched
Chimamanda Adichie's Ted talk

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.890
about single
narrative and I know

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.162
that she talks about how
collectively Africa, right,

00:30:44.162 --> 00:30:45.120
has suffered from this.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.286
And I think we see a lot
of that narrative in the US

00:30:47.286 --> 00:30:49.980
around our black
population here.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.950
Your work at the Smithsonian
is in many ways centered

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.310
on creating a second
narrative, right,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.260
but that's not the work
of an architect alone.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.450
So I'm curious about your
collaborative process

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.370
and that with other
artists and how

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.120
that influenced the process
of structuring that space.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.880
And the second is about
the location of the museum.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.180
So it's important to have this
recognized in our nation's

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.200
capital, obviously.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.720
But as I look at an organization
like the Equal Justice

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.180
Initiative and the building
of a first memorial

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.110
to the history of [INAUDIBLE]
lynching in this country,

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:30.620
there is an equal importance
to local recognition, right?

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.370
If you could speak to
anything that you're

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.250
aware of perhaps this
being the beginning of more

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.770
of these developments
elsewhere in the US,

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.140
that would be interesting.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.750
DAVID ADJAYE: Two
great questions.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.580
I'll start with the
last and go backward.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.710
I mean, I think that there is
definitely now an awareness

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:55.100
that we move in the 20th
century from objects, artifacts,

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.540
or just expressions of
beauty to narratives,

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.770
that actually the
narratives of people

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.650
as we move to
metropolitan cities

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:09.030
all over the world that become
very powerful mixing places

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.700
becomes very important because
the notion of how we all

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.201
come together and how we make
relationships to each other

00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:16.200
is more profoundly important
in the 21st century

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.330
than it's ever been in the
history of our humanity.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.538
Because we're now coming
closer than we've ever been,

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:23.100
we actually spend a lot of time
getting away from each other

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.920
and forming our groups how we're
like slamming back together.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.970
And so in that's sort
of coming together,

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.830
where are our strands of how
we come together is critical.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.250
So I think that there's
a lot of thought

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.880
about how to kind of
talk about these issues

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.554
and how to also create ways
for different generations

00:32:42.554 --> 00:32:44.220
to kind of lock into
that and understand

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.875
how to use that to help
them in the way they are

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:48.500
and the kind of
metropolitan condition.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.840
I can't speak specifically
to the project you're

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.048
talking about because I
don't have information on it,

00:32:52.048 --> 00:32:54.180
but I know that just
in my work that I'm

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.200
doing that this is really
a big conversation.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.112
With the museum, say the--

00:33:00.112 --> 00:33:02.070
AUDIENCE: The other one
is about collaboration.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.230
DAVID ADJAYE: Oh,
collaboration, yeah.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:10.020
So there are 36
consultants, there

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.050
are four architects
that were doing this

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.080
but we were the lead team.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.600
When you're working on these
incredibly complex projects

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.020
where you're working
with the government,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.270
the local authority,
community stakeholder groups,

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.100
what we've decided
is that these things

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.190
are just too much for one
architect to work with.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.100
So we develop a
multi-headed system

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.790
where my partners would
work on different aspects

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.190
of the either
legislation, contract,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.790
specific ways of building,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.550
And so we sort of put
ourselves into specializations

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.260
and then became a
kind of team that

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.570
would then deliver that thing.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.000
We didn't work on this
project with any artist

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.990
specifically on the building
fabric or anything like that.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.090
That was actually
[INAUDIBLE] our job.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.840
So we were the sort of artistic
lead and the architectural lead

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.030
and then we worked
with [INAUDIBLE] Group,

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.870
an amazing team from North
Carolina, who delivered

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.636
our delivery on the ground.

00:34:07.636 --> 00:34:10.260
And we were based in London, we
were just setting up a New York

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.254
office here.

00:34:11.254 --> 00:34:13.170
The Smith Group, who
were the only people that

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.315
built on the Mall in
the last 20 years,

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:17.040
so we were like,
we need somebody

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.706
who has done this
because you're dealing

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:19.920
with the federal government.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.920
We worked with Davis Brody
Bond, Max Bond, his ex-partner,

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.193
because they had been one of
the few people that had work

00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:27.928
on sub-underground buildings.

00:34:27.928 --> 00:34:29.969
Which we knew were going
to build a building that

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.468
was 80 feet down and they had
just completed the World Trade

00:34:32.468 --> 00:34:33.179
Center.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.596
So we wanted that
intelligence, we

00:34:34.596 --> 00:34:35.845
didn't want to learn it again.

00:34:35.845 --> 00:34:37.710
We knew that the
site that we were on

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.540
was basically a backfilled.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.900
It was a canal, it was a
swamp that was dredged,

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.973
and it was a canal used to bring
the stones to build the Capitol

00:34:45.973 --> 00:34:47.139
and all the other buildings.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:52.039
So we knew that we were actually
putting ground on a soggy site.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:54.080
And we were developing--
usually as an architect,

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.100
you develop a
foundation of the boat,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.540
we knew that we were
developing almost a submarine.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.490
We have to develop and
double-walled system

00:34:59.490 --> 00:34:59.970
to deal with that.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.178
So we had to kind of bring
in intelligence so that we

00:35:02.178 --> 00:35:03.770
didn't make many mistakes.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.150
But that's giving you a sense.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.310
And then with the
content, we were

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.170
the kind of overarching
architects in terms

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.340
of coordinating how the spatial
kind of narrative worked,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.300
but Applebaum were
the people who

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.140
did the detail of the sonography
of the exhibition design.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.750
It was their concept and vision.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.830
So really, what you see
in terms of narrative

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.660
and the specific content is
Ralph Applebaum, who worked

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.350
collaboratively with the team.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.010
So it's a very
multi-headed system,

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.510
but it's really
exciting because you

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.330
get this incredible intelligence
from different places coming

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.530
together to form this thing.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.490
Hi Hi.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.250
A question for you about
construction technology.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.610
As steel girder construction
and reinforced concrete

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.430
really kind of radically changed
the way architecture worked

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.000
in the last century, what kind
of new upcoming construction

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.470
technologies do
you see that will

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.290
make sort of the next
radical shift in what cities

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.040
and buildings look like overall?

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.831
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:35:59.831 --> 00:36:02.714
This is the big questions
that are emerging right now.

00:36:02.714 --> 00:36:04.880
I don't think we are 100%
clear about what they are.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.490
But we know things like if arc
welding and steel and concrete,

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.750
as you said, literally radically
transformed the skyline

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.340
by creating verticality--
essentially,

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.380
it created verticality
and the ability

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.722
to brace and stiffen the
structure as you went up.

00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:23.680
The sort of things that
are happening right now

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.740
is that with elevators,
for instance,

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.610
we're on the precipice for the
first time of elevators that

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.880
no longer just go up and down
but can go sideways, up, down,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.960
and around things.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.090
That sounds like nothing,
but that literally

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.270
is a phenomenal
breakthrough which suddenly

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.930
means that we can create
scale and operation in a way

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.390
that actually nobody
could even imagine.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.290
And those are some of
the things that are

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.539
being thought about right now.

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:53.364
And these new types of
elevators are being prototyped,

00:36:53.364 --> 00:36:55.280
they're just starting
to come onto the market.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.490
Mayor Bloomberg has just put a
set in his building in London

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.882
and they're really
extraordinary things.

00:37:00.882 --> 00:37:02.590
Obviously, there's
technology [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.680
integrated systems make
smart, responsive buildings.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.280
So the building is not an
inert thing, it's something

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.160
that starts to become, as
it were, it has an ability

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.440
to sense its environment
and respond, both

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.600
to the people in it and
the environment outside.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.790
So we're able to make
buildings that are,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.330
I think, much more specific
now and the century

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.635
is going to show more of that.

00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:27.260
And I think with
that, it means that we

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.140
can make buildings that are
much more clearly related

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.170
to their geography, which is
a big problem the 20th century

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.890
couldn't do.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.230
We were just very much about
creating big clunky things,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.290
sealing them, pumping air
in them as much as possible,

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.987
and hoping that everybody stayed
in sort of temperature ranges.

00:37:42.987 --> 00:37:45.320
Well, we're now going to be
able to make buildings which

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.390
actually are able to
breathe differently

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.797
in different climates,
different altitudes; be

00:37:49.797 --> 00:37:52.130
able to kind of use the
material science of those places

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.760
to kind of reinforce their
making maybe in terms

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.430
of their fabric, their
wall constituency.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.110
And we're then going to be able
to make in the 21st century

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.800
geometries that you could only
imagine as drawings in the way

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800
that maybe the constructivists
imagined drawings

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.130
at the beginning end of the
19th century, early 20th century

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.050
that became buildings at
the end of our 20th century.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.380
So I'm giving you a
sort of mixed answer

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:20.212
because I think that the next 25
years is going to reveal a lot,

00:38:20.212 --> 00:38:21.920
but we are at-- the
precipice has already

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.840
seen that it's really
radical going to change.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.810
We can do density in a way
that people cannot imagine

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.550
and that's already up upon us.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.950
We're just starting it and
it's going to get more.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:31.783
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:31.783 --> 00:38:33.098
DAVID ADJAYE: Thank you.

00:38:33.098 --> 00:38:33.812
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:34.520
DAVID ADJAYE: Hi.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.103
AUDIENCE: My name
is [? Onome ?] and I

00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:38.390
had a question about the
problem-solving process

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.680
for you and your team.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.080
So one of things you said
that really struck me was you

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.700
focus on solving the
problem for the community

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.160
and then do this
aesthetic around that.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.570
But from your work,
you're solving problems

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.700
for different kinds of
communities-- for London,

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.190
for New York, Washington
and now you're

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.070
working in Dakar and Accra.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.840
So how exactly is that
problem-solving and creative

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.240
process when you're
working on solving problems

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.960
for different kinds of people,
different kinds of communities?

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.750
DAVID ADJAYE: Yes.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.700
It's about being
out in the field.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.380
One of the things that I
made a very early decision

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.942
was that we're
not a huge company

00:39:13.942 --> 00:39:15.650
and we could just stay
in London and just

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.900
send people out and do things.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.250
But I decided very
early on that if we

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.560
were going to be in
a continent, then

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.040
we would invest in placing a
team there so that we could

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.740
actually have on the
ground information

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.512
but also develop
relationships on the ground.

00:39:30.512 --> 00:39:31.970
So the reason for
having a New York

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.870
office, the reason for
having an office in Accra

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:38.180
is because we want to
be much more connected

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.730
and we want to be able to be
responsive in the way in which

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.700
we kind of create the kind of--

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.430
what you need, essentially,
in those collaborations

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.130
is the ability to have
dialogue and to have dialogue

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.831
and response and to
then replay and then

00:39:52.831 --> 00:39:54.080
to have dialogue and response.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.730
In a way, design is
a kind of process

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.950
of talking it
through and learning

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.870
the lessons, articulating them,
see if it works, and then kind

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.150
of expanding up again.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.525
So it becomes like a kind of
vortex that's growing bigger

00:40:04.525 --> 00:40:05.860
until you get some solution.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.730
So that sort of
cyclical kind of journey

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.470
is really important
to have continuity

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.020
and not to have a
sort of disconnect

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.000
that I feel like having
one central office

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.490
where you fly in
and out of crates

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.590
you're kind of
still in your world

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.860
and you sort of feel almost
like a space man kind of landing

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.510
somewhere, but you're insulated.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.190
Whereas I want people
to be almost as it

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.490
we're native, breathing the
air that everybody else is

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.377
breathing and being
in that context.

00:40:31.377 --> 00:40:32.460
It's profoundly important.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.016
And it seems like nothing,
but actually, it's amazing.

00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:36.390
On the three
continents, the work

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.970
that comes out of the
studio is very different.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.740
And it's very interesting.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.860
I'm the kind of main
person, but because it's not

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.400
about an aesthetic kind of
then overwriting and saying,

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.657
this is the look of
Adjaye Associates,

00:40:49.657 --> 00:40:51.240
it's coming from the
solutions that we

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.640
have to make to deal
with the problems

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.660
that we're encountering.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.100
The work is emerging
differently,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.410
and for me that
philosophically confirms

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.860
a sort of deeper belief that
architecture of the built

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.640
environment should respond much
more to the geography in terms

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.160
of the kind of terra firma,
but also to the culture that

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.760
is emerging.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.825
It should find its
aesthetics, find its notion

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:13.950
through a kind of bigger
sort of thinking about how

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.830
you do things, but it
should find its resolution

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.240
in the way it expresses
itself in different places.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.300
So for me, I'm in
the experiment also.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.490
So I'm sort of
half kind of clear,

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.410
but already know
the results that I

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.770
have make me believe that
it's really the right way.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.509
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:30.509 --> 00:41:31.550
SHIH HUA LIONG: Question.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.730
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.420
DAVID ADJAYE: How are you doing?

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:32.950
AUDIENCE: How are you doing?

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.630
My name is Kevin.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.680
And first of all,
when I just want

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.138
to thank you for showing up
and all that you've contributed

00:41:37.138 --> 00:41:40.950
to the many communities that
you've been fortunate enough

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.790
to work in and
serve, in a sense.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.460
And I also want to thank you
for being able to work in Harlem

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.670
and developing a space in
which people can come into

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:56.100
and the adjacent neighborhoods
can feel OK with that structure

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.080
to serve those certain
individuals living

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.510
there comfortably, as well.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:04.899
But then I'm starting to realize
after being born and raised

00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:06.690
in New York City for
quite some time, areas

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.920
like Spanish Harlem, Harlem,
you're starting to see things.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.600
The people who made Harlem
are no longer there, right?

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.600
We're starting to-- we're on
this line of gentrification.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.900
And even most recently,
Realtors are kind of trying

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.564
to rename Harlem into SoHa.

00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:28.980
SHIH HUA LIONG: There's an
article in the "New York Times"

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.030
about that.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.520
AUDIENCE: Harlem not only
represents a neighborhood

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.160
or a part of Manhattan;
it represents a culture,

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.800
it represents a way of life,
it represents a history,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.110
it represents a past.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.840
How do you as an
architect feel when

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:49.580
you're developing these spaces
and you can kind of see it not

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:56.005
fitting those people that you
necessarily designed it for?

00:42:56.005 --> 00:42:58.380
For me personally,
it kind of hurts

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:02.580
where I have to take my daughter
on trips to these neighborhoods

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.250
to show her but we can't
necessarily live in them

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.334
and I have history
in this neighborhood.

00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:08.500
How does that make you feel?

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.690
DAVID ADJAYE: Yeah.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.820
There it is.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.580
OK.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:20.340
Let me be brief and
give you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:26.220
The dilemma of the city
is that it's not static.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.120
It's a horrible thing.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.540
But if you look at the
evolution of cities,

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.910
it is permanently in flux.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.969
We are actually never static.

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.510
So there's that
dilemma to deal with.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.850
So the city doesn't
belong to any generation,

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:42.090
it's always belongs to
the future or it dies.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.780
So there's that problem.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.167
And it's a horrible one, but
it's one that one has to face.

00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:50.250
The second thing is this
notion of gentrification,

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:54.210
which has become a bit of a kind
of easy bashing thing, people

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:54.720
bash it.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.053
There's two things, there's
entrepreneurial opportunity,

00:43:57.053 --> 00:43:59.790
which is when
planning laws relax

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.070
certain things to
activate entrepreneurs

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.690
to kind of do development.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.440
That's one thing.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.860
It's actually very
controllable because the city

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.824
has the power to do it.

00:44:09.824 --> 00:44:11.490
But there's this idea
of gentrification,

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.420
which actually is problematic.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:17.190
But actually, the statistic
shows that only 10%

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.524
of construction is
about gentrification.

00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:21.440
We looked into it and
we were like, oh my god,

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.856
this is horrible, it's taking
over the whole [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:23.856 --> 00:44:26.430
Then we looked at the numbers
and we were like, oh my god.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.400
It's actually these hot spots,
but they become the stories

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.250
and they become the overriding
narratives that kind of blanket

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.910
out everything else.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.020
So these communities don't
completely disappear,

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.670
but they change
and they upgrade.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.190
There are certain benefits.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.570
Certain families live in
very difficult situations

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.210
and that uptake of
money allows them

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.350
to buy homes in places where--

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:51.690
so it's a very kind
of complicated dynamic

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.100
that actually does good.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.100
It does some harm because it
changes these communities.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.520
And I think as
planners, architects

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.710
I always say that
when you come in,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.475
you have to work with history.

00:45:03.475 --> 00:45:06.540
As a design, I'm
like, it doesn't

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.240
work if you don't start
from history and move

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.200
into the future.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.030
If you just start
in the future, it's

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.297
sort of an isolated bubble.

00:45:13.297 --> 00:45:14.880
It's like a spaceship
that just lands.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.430
Spaceships are fun,
I love spaceships.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.830
But cities are a
continuum, they've

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.990
been going for
10,000 years, right?

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.230
That's the history of cities.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.760
It goes back to
that's the earliest

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.362
that we know, about
10,000 years old.

00:45:30.362 --> 00:45:31.820
And it's a kind of
technology, it's

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.690
a kind of mechanism
that continually is

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.260
growing and adding to itself.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.620
So one is struggling
with this thing.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.980
But I think that it's
implicit that architecture

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.510
pays attention to that notion
of history, and urbanists do,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.060
and to find a way to always
grow it to the next thing.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.650
Because we have to evolve
it and we have to grow it,

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.690
but there are ways to do that.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.010
And that has to become
much more the norm.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.050
I mean, I'm hoping that
by the end of my career

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:00.600
when I'm no longer around,
but actually the methods

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.820
that I use are just
not even anything

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.320
that some people
say, wow, that's so

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.319
interesting and radical.

00:46:05.319 --> 00:46:06.600
It's like, this is basic.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.841
It's like, oh, yeah, I
mean, just that's whatever.

00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:11.340
We just talk about
history and stuff

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.622
because that's what we do.

00:46:12.622 --> 00:46:13.580
It's like, OK, success.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.990
Yeah.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.073
SHIH HUA LIONG: Thank you.

00:46:18.073 --> 00:46:18.899
One more question.

00:46:18.899 --> 00:46:19.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.090
I'm Matt.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.750
Hey.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.340
Something you said at the
start really resonated with me,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.300
and that was the idea of for
everyone in access and so on.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.040
It's something
leaders here say a lot

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.440
when they talk about the scale
about technology and so on.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.687
And I'm wondering if
you've got as a company

00:46:34.687 --> 00:46:36.270
the staff to do
engineering and now we

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.360
have a lot design people to work
with, people from those fields,

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.514
and look at process and so on.

00:46:41.514 --> 00:46:43.680
As we create objects that
now are in people's homes,

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.290
as well as through the
internet and on devices

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:50.340
and so on, if you've got any
words of advice for how we

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.280
might think about designing
systems and their relationship

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.700
to people and how we keep so
we're making hardware that gets

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:01.880
more and more expensive--
this is like a $600 phone--

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.120
how we keep that
open and accessible

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.750
and we still retain
that for everyone idea

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.060
at the heart of what we do.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.510
DAVID ADJAYE: It's
a huge challenge

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:17.827
and it's really at the
heart of the struggle

00:47:17.827 --> 00:47:18.660
in the modern world.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.830
The purpose of technology is
to democratize information

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:30.030
and systems and to kind
of bring us to a point

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:35.150
where we're able to do things
in this collective, right?

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.690
But there's these
difficult things

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.730
to do with inequalities
and imbalances that

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:41.460
create these problems.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.130
And so there isn't
a kind of moment

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.902
which I think is the
solution that solves it,

00:47:48.902 --> 00:47:50.610
but there's always
this constant struggle

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.310
of trying to always
turn the scales which

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.130
are kind of in balance
back to kind of parallel.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.810
And I think that's
the game, right?

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.540
So if it is about
always struggling

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.990
to straighten the thing,
then what do you do

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.660
to always democratize the work?

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.340
So if you're making
the high thing,

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.120
what are you doing
also at that other end?

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.090
So in a way for me, we always
look about in the studio

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.050
that you've got to
work in balance.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.150
So we may be working for
a very wealthy person,

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.970
but also we want to work for
somebody who really can barely

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:27.270
pay for our fees and we
want to give the same brain

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.090
power to that person
that we're doing there.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.630
So that in a way,
we're making inequity.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:38.082
For us, that's the way to
bring the thing into equity.

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:39.540
It's harder in
products because you

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.956
have a product that has a kind
of definition of the thing.

00:48:41.956 --> 00:48:43.560
But I think that
as a company, it's

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.760
about what the entire
totality kind of achieves.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.770
And we haven't got to
a place in our society

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.491
where we no longer care about
the value of our product.

00:48:52.491 --> 00:48:53.490
I look forward to that--

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:54.656
I mean, it won't be my time.

00:48:54.656 --> 00:48:56.370
But it would be great
to get to a time

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.800
when product is no
longer relevant, right?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.025
It's like, whatever.

00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:03.150
We have bigger things to
think about than the value

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.940
of the things that are things.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.480
That would be a
profound moment, right.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.712
Yeah.

00:49:10.712 --> 00:49:12.210
SHIH HUA LIONG: Great.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.050
David, thank you
so much for coming.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.010
It's an honor to have
you here at Google today

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.935
and we hope to see you
again in the future.

00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:19.240
DAVID ADJAYE: Great.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.890
Thank you so much.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:20.973
SHIH HUA LIONG: Thank you.

00:49:20.973 --> 00:49:22.940
[APPLAUSE]
