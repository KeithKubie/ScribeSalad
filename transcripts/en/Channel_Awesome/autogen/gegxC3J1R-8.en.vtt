00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.260
doing is probably harming the animal
more than helping it and I think this is

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270
more than helping it and I think this is
 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.530
more than helping it and I think this is
a great example of actually just that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540
a great example of actually just that
 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.730
a great example of actually just that

little creature that's following us and
 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.760
little creature that's following us and
take it home as a pet and then they

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770
take it home as a pet and then they
 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.590
take it home as a pet and then they
start kind of messing things up and

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600
start kind of messing things up and
 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.210
start kind of messing things up and
everything they do to try to help it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220
everything they do to try to help it
 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.370
everything they do to try to help it
isn't helping it's making everything

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
isn't helping it's making everything
 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.290
isn't helping it's making everything
worse the only way to make this animal

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300
worse the only way to make this animal
 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.150
worse the only way to make this animal
better is to give it back to its parents

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160
better is to give it back to its parents
 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.270
better is to give it back to its parents

you I need you I want to put any of this
 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.070
you I need you I want to put any of this
together but it's a very very good point

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080
together but it's a very very good point
 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.300
together but it's a very very good point
because you're right I think a lot of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
because you're right I think a lot of
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.090

like you know probably quiet or

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260
like you know probably quiet or
 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.719
like you know probably quiet or
something so no actually it's a very

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729
something so no actually it's a very
 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.070
something so no actually it's a very
legitimate point never put that together

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080
legitimate point never put that together
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.240
legitimate point never put that together
no it's that's a very very good point

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250
no it's that's a very very good point
 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.909
no it's that's a very very good point
yeah so I guess it is sort of teaching

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919
yeah so I guess it is sort of teaching
 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.879
yeah so I guess it is sort of teaching
in a sense whether it knows it or not I

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889
in a sense whether it knows it or not I
 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.440
in a sense whether it knows it or not I
mean it is they're teaching kids about

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450
mean it is they're teaching kids about
 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.750
