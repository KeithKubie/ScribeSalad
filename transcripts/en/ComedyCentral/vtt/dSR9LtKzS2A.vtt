Okay, let me clean that up.
Watch your leg, Joey,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.788

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.289 align:start size:75% position:25%
and we can't get it out.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.625
Brother, I got a new hobby, man.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.460
- A hobby?
- Yes.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.263
Mixology, man.
This is my new thing.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.098
- Kev, you know you got to go to
school for bartending.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.332
You know that, right?
- I don't have to go to school

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.534
for nothing, okay?

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.835
I took a app.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.503
- An app?
- Yes.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.771 align:end position:100%
Download a app on my phone,
mixology app,

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.073
read it for two minutes.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.641
I got it all in my head,
brother.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.476 align:start position:0%
Kev, people study for years to
become good bartenders.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:45.244 size:84% position:42%
You gonna learn from a app?

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.280
- Same people that study for
years are the same people

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.681
that created the app, so I don't
have to study for years, Harry.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.516
- Give me a lemon drop.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.552
- I don't--that's not in the
app.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.853
I don't know what--I don't know
how to do that.

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.688 align:start position:0%
- All right, let me make it
simple.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.290 size:75% position:38%
Give me a gin and juice.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.791
- Yes, that's easy.
That's easy.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.526 align:end position:100%
- Are we talking about drinks
from the States,

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.594
or are you guys in Japan?
Where are y'all at?

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.096
Where do--let's talk about--

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.797 align:start position:0%
- The ingredients are in the
name, Kev.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.267 align:end position:100%
- Brother, if I'm the
mixologist, let me mix, okay?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.703
Let me--let me bring to you what
I do best.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.138
Can we do that?
- Have at it.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.339
- Huh?
Ooh.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.241
Go boy.
Huh?

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.443 align:end position:100%
Is it a basketball, or is it a
bottle?

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.578
What do I have?
- Hey, man, just--

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.246
- Whoo.
- Huh?

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.881
- You want a long pour
or a short pour?

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.749
- I just want it in the glass.
- I'ma give you a long.

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.318
Uh-oh.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.853
Still in the glass.
- Just-just--

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.154 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Still in the glass.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.755
Who like dark?

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.557
I can't see nothing, 'cause I
like dark.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.426 align:start size:50% position:50%
Boy, watch this.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.695
Mm, hit 'em with it.
Splash that on 'em, right?

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.330
- You're getting--

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.731
- Brother, y'all like olives or
no?

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.366 size:84% position:58%
Shit, grab that one for me?

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.168
- Don't--
- Pass it back to me.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:43.636
I got you, brother.
- I'm not gonna do this.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.271 align:end position:100%
- Saw this yesterday--Joey, come

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:46.472

- Joey, brother,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.241
let me show you
something.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.442
I'm done, man. I can't.
- Just let me--come here.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.843
Taste what I got.
Harry. Harry!

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.812

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:57.383
