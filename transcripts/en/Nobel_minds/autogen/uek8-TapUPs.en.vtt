hello my avatars name is archivist

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
hello my avatars name is archivist
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.369
hello my avatars name is archivist
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from
 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.520
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be
grown in high yield inside the pores of

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
grown in high yield inside the pores of
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.200
grown in high yield inside the pores of
zeolite crystals which are

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210
zeolite crystals which are
 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.880
zeolite crystals which are
aluminosilicate semiconductors my

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
aluminosilicate semiconductors my
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950
aluminosilicate semiconductors my
question is does the quality of the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
question is does the quality of the
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990
question is does the quality of the
crystals make a difference if so with

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
crystals make a difference if so with
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.759
crystals make a difference if so with
crystals grown in space show to have

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
crystals grown in space show to have
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.490
crystals grown in space show to have
higher quality be a viable option thank

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
higher quality be a viable option thank
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.990
higher quality be a viable option thank
you so I can begin by answering what are

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
you so I can begin by answering what are
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.579
you so I can begin by answering what are
these zeolites there are crystals with a

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589
these zeolites there are crystals with a
 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.060
these zeolites there are crystals with a
small post nanopores in which you can

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
small post nanopores in which you can
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.860
small post nanopores in which you can
put nanoparticles in with some order so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
put nanoparticles in with some order so
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770
put nanoparticles in with some order so
this can be a way to prepare and then no

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
this can be a way to prepare and then no
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.340
this can be a way to prepare and then no
materials and according to the question

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
materials and according to the question
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.430
materials and according to the question
it seems I don't know but he seemed that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
it seems I don't know but he seemed that
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.509
it seems I don't know but he seemed that
the growing zeolite in space without

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519
the growing zeolite in space without
 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:07.450
the growing zeolite in space without
gravity can lead to better quality of

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460
gravity can lead to better quality of
 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.030
gravity can lead to better quality of
crystals and so may be better on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
crystals and so may be better on
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500
crystals and so may be better on
nanomaterials I don't know about

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
nanomaterials I don't know about
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.340
nanomaterials I don't know about
actually what I can say is that this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
actually what I can say is that this
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.680
actually what I can say is that this
material are in competition with many

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690
material are in competition with many
 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.470
material are in competition with many
other technologies that are now able to

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480
other technologies that are now able to
 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.810
other technologies that are now able to
prepare a nanomaterial sir I don't I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
prepare a nanomaterial sir I don't I
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730
prepare a nanomaterial sir I don't I
cannot answer the question I don't know

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
cannot answer the question I don't know
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.430
cannot answer the question I don't know
if we're going is this case on in space

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440
if we're going is this case on in space
 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.140
if we're going is this case on in space
will be willing to I performance

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
will be willing to I performance
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.409
will be willing to I performance
