00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.370
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Well good
afternoon, I am Grant Harris,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.250
I am head of the European
Reading Room here

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.530
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.270
And I welcome you to
the European Division,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.680
we're here in the European Division
conference room and we're going

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.250 position:56%
to listen to Jonathan Kapiloff speak

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.190
about quantifying the Soviet
economic and social crisis of 1920,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.160
food supply, rail transport,
fuel and demographics.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.850
Mr. Kapiloff has earned his BA
in 1980 from Columbia University

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.970
where he studied under the notable
historian of Russia Mark Raeff.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.870
He earned his MA and C Phil
degree in 1984 from the University

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.600
of California at Berkeley
where he studied

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.840
under notable historians Nicholas
Riasanovsky and Martin Malia.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.010
Now this is really a kind
continuation if you will of a talk

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.380
that Jonathan gave last year,
really a brilliant talk here

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.880
in this same room November
12 of 2015.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.660
That talk was entitled
the Geography of Hunger,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.260
how Lenin handled Russia's food
supply crisis of winter 1919/1920.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.040
And we're very happy to have
Jonathan back here again.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.030
Jonathan has done some really
deep research using Library

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.570
of Congress resources
and we're very pleased

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.480
to have him uncover all these
resources that we have and make use

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.030
of them and he's a good
speaker as you will see.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.970
So Jonathan, I'll turn this over
to you, thank you for being here.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.630
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff:
Great, thanks very much

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.460
for the very kind introduction,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.960
I think it may have been
a little too charitable.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.990
I do want to stress that
this talk is a thematic

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.010
and historical continuation of
the talk I gave last November

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.780
that was mainly focused
on food supply.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.310
And a significant part of
this talk will come back

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.540 position:56%
to food supply later on in the hour.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.170
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Let me just ask
can you hear okay from there?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.470
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: Yeah.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.490
But the focus of this is going to
be more on the issue of transport

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.780
and fuel and really the
crisis and near collapse

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.200
of the entire Russian Soviet
rail network by early 1920.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.930
And so what I want to emphasize
from the beginning and again,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.520
I could not be more thankful to
the Library of Congress for this,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.370
is that I've mainly been
working almost exclusively really

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.280
with primary source materials
from the period 1919, 1920.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.380
I've used a couple of
primary source materials

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.170
and actually a key monograph
that was published in 1922

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.880
and that monograph in
1922, which is very,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.080
very rare volume helped
me tie all this together.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.840 position:56%
But again, what I've seen is that
there's a trance amount of material,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.670
primary source material printed
at the time that I consider

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.360
to be very reliable in terms of
information about what was going

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.270
on both quantitatively and
qualitatively during this period.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.870
So I really want to try
to share with everyone

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.340
and especially the library staff
give them a sense of the uniqueness

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.600
and special quality of a lot of
these primary source materials.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.420
That's really one of
the main things I want

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.720
to accomplish in the talk today.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.680
I'm here to give a narrative on
this subject that I've talked about

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.600
and according to the title.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.960
But I'd also like to address three
other questions and if I haven't,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.070
then I kind of left everyone
hanging a little bit in terms

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.670
of what this primary
source material offers.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.410
And so in addition to talking
about demography, food supply

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.860
and especially about
the transport system

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.000
and specifically the
rail transport system I'd

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.170
like to answer three questions.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.450
One is the role that wood played
during the Civil War and I'm going

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.710
to spend a lot of time on that.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.430
If one can't understand
the role that wood played

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.860
as crucial fuel during the Civil
War period, especially compared

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.280
to what existed prior to 1917 you
really can't get an understanding

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.890
of what was going on
in European Russia

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.270
and especially how the
peasants were living

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.750
and what the state expected
of peasants at the time.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.310
Two other questions I want to
address are what was Lenin's role

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.500
in all of this, but I wanted to
focus again on what was going

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.300
on qualitatively and quantitatively

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.000
and then bring Lenin back
in towards the very end.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.040
And then finally and although
it has pejorative connotation

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.030
and I don't mean it this way,
I wanted to answer the question

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.100
of something that was discussed

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.810
at the time it had a specific
connotation the phrase I'm

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.890
about to use in 1920.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.780
The English translation is those

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.880
who do not work they shall
not eat [foreign language].

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.330
What did that mean?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.180
It had a very specific
policy connotation,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.850
it honestly has potentially
much more pejorative connotation

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.890
in the context of the Civil War
and lack of food and so forth.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.650
But in the process of
this talk I want to try

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.280
to answer those questions as well.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.110
Let me just start by saying
that I do feel that the amount

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.980
of primary source material
here at the Library of Congress

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.320
for the period 1919, 1920 has
been vastly underappreciated,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.280
that's what I've been working with.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.840
I'm not here to make
comparisons with other libraries

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.470
or brother institutions,
I've done a lot of work

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.160
in the former Soviet Union,
I also did a lot of work

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.020
at the Hoover Institution.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.970
I do believe that there
are several volumes here

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.620
that are probably unique
in Western libraries.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.180 position:56%
I don't think I could have put
together the picture that I am going

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.340
to try to present to you today
without having access to the Hoover

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.260
and then some very special
things that are here

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.680
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.230
And just to give you one example
the library has a complete run

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.890
in the original of the bulletin
of the People's Commissar

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.430
to Transport issues numbers
1 through 288, the entire run

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.330
for calendar year 1920,
it's really remarkable.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.510
And without materials like
that I wouldn't have been able

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.460
to put together the presentation
that I'm about to give to you.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.880
So what I wanted to start and this
is not meant as a review it's meant

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.690
to compare and contrast
what was going

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.630
on immediately before World
War 1 and then I'm going

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.600
to move forward briefly to the
war itself and then to 1920

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.050
to give you a sense
of what was going

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.030
on with transport and
specifically fuel.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.790
So I'm just going to step to the
map here and give a quick synopsis

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.140
of some things that happened
going back even before 1914

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.310
at the beginning of World War 1.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.720
And I'm going to point to the city
of Baku here on the Caspian Sea.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.800
And Baku was really the first
center in the entire world

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.950
where oil was not only discovered,
but started to be produced

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.630
in industrial quantities.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.580
It even proceeded a lot of what
happened in the United States

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.090
in the development of standard
oil under the Rockefellers.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.210
And this is documented it
was such a major development

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.700
in the world economy that it's not
just something to be documented

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.550
in narrow Russian sources.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.830
If anyone has read the
key book called The Prize

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:23.880 position:56%
by Daniel Yergin they will know
that Baku is where oil first started

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.840
to be used on a
commercial/industrial level.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.440
And that was in the late
1870's, very early 1880's.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.260
And what happened was
beginning around 1880

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.340
and this was a key
technological breakthrough

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.840 position:56%
as well oil is transported from Baku
a couple hundred miles along the

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.470
Caspian Sea to the mouth
of the Volga River.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.000
And from there it was
carried up the Volga by boat,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.500 position:56%
stopped in major cities [inaudible],
Saratov, Samara, Kazan, [inaudible]

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:10.810
and then eventually made its way
either by river or later by train

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.330
to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.160 position:56%
This is before the end of the 20th
century in very, very large amounts.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.920
And I have in my handout a separate
explanation of Russian weights

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.930
and measurements that existed
at the time of the revolution,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.480 position:56%
prior to the revolution, through the
revolution, through the Civil War.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.260
And the key Russian
measurement was a pood

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.100
which was approximately 36 pounds.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.920
And so from one of the
sources that I have,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.020
although there were contemporary
resources before Word War 1.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.950
I just wanted to mention
how many millions of poods

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.570
of oil was transported from Baku
on the Caspian Sea up to the mouth

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.070
of Volga near [inaudible] and then
subsequently up the Volga, Moscow,

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.180
Saint Petersburg, all the other
major parts of European Russia.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.010
So in 1912 and the source for
this is a special volume here

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.440
at the Library of Congress
called [inaudible],

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:11.250 position:56%
it was a journal published by the
Supreme Council of National Economy.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.740
So an article that
appeared in 1920 talks

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.560
about in 1912 268 million
poods of oil were transported

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.860
from the Caspian up
to the Volga River

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.830
and [inaudible] subsequently up.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:33.390
In 1913 270 million poods, 1914 244
million poods, 1915 first full year

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:41.230 position:56%
of World War 1 increased 319 million
poods, 1916 337 million poods.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.420 position:56%
Then as the war took more of a toll
on Russia a lot of men were drafted,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.100
there were labor shortages.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.660
In 1917 it fell to
280 million poods.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.360
Now here is the real
introduction to my talk.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.570
In 1918 it went from 280
million poods in 1917

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.210
down to 74 and in 1919 it was zero.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.500
The reason being that
with the conflict going

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.480
on during the Civil War
the Volga River was cut

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.590
at that time actually initially by
some Czech forces who were there

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.120
to participate on the
Russian front in World War 1.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.450
And really what happened during
most of the Civil War was

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.730
that the Soviet Regime
did not have access

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.590
to Baku oil, there was no oil.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.380 position:56%
And so that had tremendous
consequences for the entire economy.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.090
The numbers that I
cited should indicate

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:42.700
that prerevolutionary Russia,
Russia during World War I and even

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.800
at the beginning of 1917 was a
very, very oil dependent economy.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.010
It was not as an advanced economy
overall industrially as countries

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.200
in Western Europe, but there
was a very advanced oil economy

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.280
and a transport economy.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.560
And one of the things that is
discussed in many sources I've seen

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.890
and it's referred to in Daniel
Yergin's book is that really

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.990
by 1890's large amounts
of foreign capital,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.700
names that we would recognize.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.470
The Nobel family the Rothschild
family they were investing very

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.340
heavily in this entire industry
and the transport of oil

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.460
up the Volga very,
very large investments.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.880
The Nobels and Rothschilds actually
controlled most of the production

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.770
and the transport of oil
along the Caspian Sea

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.830
up the Volga and then into Russian.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.710
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: And what
time did it start this?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: It was
certainly by 1900, certainly by 1900

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.550
and there's a very pronounced
change with each passing decade.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.470
Beginning around 1890 it's a
lot more than it was in 1880,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.440
it really got started in
late 1870's, early 1880's,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.070
the 1900's is already a
benchmark compared to 1890.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.630
Now I don't want to
create the impression here

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.070
that the [inaudible] economy
was stronger than it really was,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.850
the country as a whole had a
lot of very serious and social

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.110
and economic problems and just it's
kind of something very interesting

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.320
that Yergin points out in his book.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320
But because of rising
anti-Semitism in 1912

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.040
and it was probably a
very good business move

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.170
in retrospect the Rothschilds
basically withdrew almost all their

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.580
investments, so they
were not expropriated

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.080
at the time of the revolution.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.310
I don't believe that was the
same case with the Nobel family.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:35.490
The other thing that I wanted to
talk about was the development

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.920
of the coal industry and this is
an area that's now been recently

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.960
in the news, mainly in the
Donetsk basin in Eastern Ukraine.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.850
And so without going into a
long synopsis of the development

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:55.380
of the Russian rail system the
Eastern Ukraine became a major

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.180
source of coal that powered
the Russian rail system.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.140 position:56%
And I want to talk about some other
areas that also produced coal and go

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.440
over some economic geography.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.490
But from what I believe is a
unique source here at the Library

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:13.070
of Congress published in
1922 I have information

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:19.440
about how much coal was
produced and used in Russia.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.640
So in 1903, use of coal by
Russian rail network was

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.600
over a billion poods,
again a pood is 36 pounds.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.520
By 1913 and again, Russia had a lot
of economic and social problems,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.030
issues about revolution
and social justice.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.590
But the fact is by 1913, what was
slightly over a billion poods used

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:50.820
by the Russian rail network in 1903
that had more than doubled by 1913,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.980
as well as the length of the
Russian rail network, excuse me.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.070
Now I also want to stress that
while there's a tremendous amount

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.950
of coal production in the Eastern
Ukraine there was so much demand

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:09.380
for coal in the Russian economy
that coal was imported by England.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.040
I don't know whether it
was from Newcastle or not,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.540
but a tremendous amount of coal
was imported into Saint Petersburg.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.960
Most of the coal that was
used in Saint Petersburg

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.670
for heating actually
came from England.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.180
And there was also coal from
England that was imported

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:33.090 position:56%
to feed the Russian rail network and
to power the Russian rail network.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.820
So these are two kind of key
geographical economic facts

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.290
of what happened prior
to the revolution.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.940
And I'm going to skip forward
for one second and indicate

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.100
and I'll give more of the detail
about this that as a result

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.790
of the revolution and the Civil War
the Soviet Regime really did not

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.400
have access to Donetsk coal.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.790
A couple of other places that
should be mentioned in terms

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.810
of the poor economic background
for what I'm going to start talking

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.520
about 1920 in a few minutes is
that there were [inaudible] sources

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.630
of coal in the Ural Mountains near
Chelyabinsk and north of there.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.590
There was also coal
in Western Siberia

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:21.170
and Western Siberia really isn't
on this map, we're getting close,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.580
but it's not included in this map.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:32.370
And so those sources of coal
were used and prior to 1914,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:39.120
certainly 1917 the vast majority of
the Russian rail network used coal.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.040
There was some use of wood,
wood was much harder to use,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.140
much less energy-efficient
than either coal or oil.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.460
But basically by 1914 and according

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.990
to this mini chronograph I found
here at the Library of Congress,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.820
around 75% of the Russian rail
network was powered by coal,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.650
around 10% by oil and there's a
way to power locomotives using oil,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.110
and then approximately
5 to 10% by wood.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:14.080
But all of the main rail
connections in European Russia,

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.120
the major rail routes use coal
or oil, wood was used only

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.530
on local lines or in
Siberia in particular

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.680
because there was a
lot of wood in Siberia.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.710 position:56%
And so one of the things I want to
talk about just getting back briefly

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.810
to this oil be transported
from Baku up to the mouth

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:38.290
of the Volga River is that
initially when [inaudible] came

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.600
to the Volga River it used
wood, wood was the source.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:49.650 position:56%
It was only after 1880 that you had
use of oil to power the Volga fleet.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.020
And as you see the
development of the Volga fleet,

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.770
especially after 1890
and into the beginning

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:59.460
of the 20th century it is
making leaps and bounds in terms

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.870
of how energy-efficient it is
and how much cargo it can carry.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.320
So for instance in 1914 there
are over 200 million poods

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.600
of various grains that
were conveyed up the Volga.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.810
And basically in 1903 Rudolf
Diesel licensed the diesel engine

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.950
to the Nobel family.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.440
And you have the initial
construction of diesel tugboats.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.170 position:56%
Some of these diesel tugboats on the
Volga could carry as much on barges

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:37.860
at one time, just one diesel engine
tugboat carrying several large

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.840
barges, 500,000 poods of grain.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.470
That would be the equivalent
of 500 rail cars of grain.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.930
There is a recognition from a
lot of material both primary

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:56.120
and secondary before the revolution
during 1917 and afterwards

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.170
that one railcar, standard
Russian railcar,

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.810
could carry around a thousand poods
of grain, which is 36,000 pounds

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.470
so approximately 18 tons.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.430
So you had a tremendous increase
in the intensity and efficiency

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:18.310
of the Volga commercial fleet in
terms of delivering many things.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.390
Not just grain, but all kinds of
building supplies, raw materials,

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.370
salt, many other things that
were needed by the economy.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:34.720
And what we'll see is that by 1920
the Soviet Regime had been going

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.350
for an entire full-year, for all of
1919 and really a good part of 1918

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:46.050
as well, would have access to
any sources of coal or oil.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.580 position:56%
And so I think one of the things
that has really not been appreciated

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.340
in history of what was going
during the Civil War period was

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.040
that the economy really became
entirely dependent on wood.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:06.270
Wood is a much more inefficient
source of energy than oil or coal.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:12.420
It is very hard to use wood as
the main source for locomotives

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.810
and that was the underlying
reason why there was

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:21.080
such a large transport crisis
in the Soviet control territory

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.460
in European Russia by 1920.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.290
And in fact, what I found in
all of these sources and it's --

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.180
I'm going to make an argument
people may want to swat me for it,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.090
but I'm going to make an argument
that [inaudible] Izvestia are very,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.390
very important sources

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.860
for understanding what
was going on at the time.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.570
And not only in [inaudible]
Izvestia,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.230
but all of the primary
source materials I found here

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.860
at the Library of Congress they
always talk about the use of wood

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.570
and they convert it
to what they believed

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.700
and they had good scientific
basis for this,

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.250
they may be approximations.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.930
What was the equivalent energy
use of either coal or oil

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.970
and especially dealing
with railroads they talk

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.240
about the equivalent
wood used and what

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.610 position:56%
that would have amounted to in coal.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.160
And so I'm also going to explain

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:18.920
in April 1920 the local Azeri
government Baku which was supported

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.830
by the British, the Red Army
eventually captured Baku

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.690
in late April 1920.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.940
And all of a sudden there
is a change in the picture.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.060 position:56%
A country that has not had access to
oil suddenly has some access to oil.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:42.120 position:56%
It's limited amounts, but it changes
the whole economic perspective

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.780
of what is going on.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.510
And it doesn't mean that
everything changes immediately,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.010
in fact it doesn't and I will
skip ahead and say for instance,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.200
that at least through the
end of 1920, well into 1921

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.190
and beyond wood remained
the single largest source

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.830
for powering the Russian
rail network.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.770
And that's what the Soviet Regime
had to deal with was this gathering

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.600
of wood, the transporting of
wood and getting this wood

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.360
to local rail depots,
local rail lines.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.210
Procuring wood is a very, very
difficult thing in large amounts.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.080
It has to be chopped, it
has to best transported.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.840
There are two ways really of
transporting wood in large volumes

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.070
of the type that a real
network would need.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.830
You either need to send
it down rivers or you have

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.600
to have peasants haul it.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.240
And so one of the main things
that peasants did for the regime

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.330
and basically was a form of labor
conscription was hauling wood

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.580
so that the rail system could work.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.120
The other way to do it if you
send it downriver has its downside

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.730
and this is discussed
a tremendous amount

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.460
in the primary source materials
is the wood has a certain amount

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.540
of humidity in that it is that
much more difficult to burn

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.620
in the boiler of a locomotive.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.570 position:56%
And there are numerous references to
the fact that boilers either explode

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.500
or break because the wood that is
being put into them is too humid.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.780
These are kind of what may
sound like small details,

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.560
but when you look at them from
a larger picture and realize

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.600
that wood was the main source

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:26.800
for the Russian rai network really
beginning the 1918 you get a sense

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.010
of what people were really
dealing with in trying

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.550
to make this transport system work.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:37.600
So I wanted to just -- I've given
a handout and in in the handout,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.230
one of the handouts I talked
about and I'm just going

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.790
to summarize it quickly here

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:50.780
if I can find the right page here
what are the energy equivalents

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.770
of wood compared to oil and coal.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:03.000
And it's very, very interesting
because and I found it

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.630
on the last page of the
handout key Russian weights

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.410
and measurements used at
the time of the revolution

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.490
and during the Civil War period.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.930
And basically because there
were other sources of coal other

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.790
than the coal here
in the Donetsk basin

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.780
in Eastern Ukraine
it's very interesting.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:30.570
So it basically say the basic
measurement for wood was not

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.740
by weight it was by volume and
it was called a cubic sazhen.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.020 position:56%
I've been trying to find out exactly
what a cubic sazhen equaled in terms

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.980
of volume, I've seen
references in the law library,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.040 position:56%
a special volume there that I think
is unique to the Library of Congress

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.550
that one railcar could hold
2.3 cubic sazhens of wood.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.340
But whatever it was one cubic
sazhen of wood was equivalent

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.350
to a hundred poods or approximately
3,600 pounds of Donetsk coal.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.610
It was also equal to 100
poods of Siberian coal.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.740
And there was coal in the
[inaudible] as I mentioned.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.470
[Inaudible] coal was less
rich as an energy source

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.490
than Siberian or Donetsk coal.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.270
So one cubic sazhen it took
150 poods of [inaudible] coal

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.780
to equal one cubic sazhen of wood.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.070
There was some very
low-grade coal near Moscow.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.070
That was the only coal that
the regime had access to.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.820 position:56%
And so coal from Moscow, it took 250
poods of coal from the Moscow basin

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.980
to equal one cubic sazhen of wood.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.690 position:56%
And then what is very, very
interesting is it took only 70 poods

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.130
of oil to be the equivalent
of cubic sazhen of wood.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:48.770
So I'm also going to mention just
briefly two key data points here

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.030
that give you a sense
of what was going

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.760
on with the Russian rail network

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.990
and what a tremendous
difficulty it presented

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.250
for running the entire economy.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.120
First of all and this is
in several primary sources,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.860
this is also mentioned in the key
article in [inaudible] by the head

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.000 position:56%
of the [inaudible] Fuel
Administration a guy named Alexander

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.750
Lomov is it took one full
railcar of wood to move a train

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.270
that was carrying let's
say 11 to 12 cars

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.570
of either grain, wood, whatever.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:32.890
It took one full railcar
of wood to move that train

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.150
and the cars it was carrying
a hundred [inaudible],

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.880
which is only 66 miles.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.920
So if you wanted -- here's
Moscow, here is [inaudible],

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:49.100
the distance from Moscow to
[inaudible] is approximately 275,

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.180
to Kazan it's around 500 miles.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.450
If you wanted to move a
train from Kazan to Moscow

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.580
and you weren't going to pick up
any wood on route you need to have

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.060
in effect five railcars just
full of wood to get it that far.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.130
That gives you some sense
of the inefficiencies

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.790
and the huge headache
quite frankly of trying

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.810
to make a rail system
like this work.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:18.130
It's very interesting, after
Baku was captured by the Red Army

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:23.810
in late April 1920 there are
numerous references to the fact

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:28.970
that those railcars which can be
converted to oil because again,

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.270
there's no coal available
or very little coal only

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.110
from the Moscow basin,
some from the [inaudible].

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.530
There is a reference to once
they can start reconverting some

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.420
of these locomotives to
oil use it would more

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.360 position:56%
than double the efficiency of what's
involved in transporting any cargo.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.720
And there's a specific reference
to we can use twice the number

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.020
of locomotives than we could before

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.570
to transport very scarce food
supplies, especially grain.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:06.950 position:56%
So can see from some of these key
data points how the transport system

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.950
really constructed
the entire economy

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.090
and I've got a lot
more to say about that.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.340
But if you just start from those
data points you start to be able

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.470
to see what it looked like for
the people living at the time

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.740
and you get a sense of
what Lenin and the people

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.000
and the People's Commissar
of Transport

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.510
and [inaudible] People's
Commissar of Transport for most

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:32.100
of 1920 what they were dealing with
in trying to make this beast work.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.260
It is really something
that is almost unimaginable

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.820
and what I would say
just to sum up this part

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:47.990
of my presentation is you can see
that in many ways European Russia

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.880
under Soviet control and there's
a separate editorial comment

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.260
which I don't want to get into how
much might have been [inaudible]

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.220
fault for this, not their
fault, was it circumstances,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.160
I'm not here to editorialize
on that.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.740
But you can see that if you
look at where things were

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.500
in 1920 just given some of
the data points I've cited

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.610
that this is a country
that went back to a time

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.610
at least 50 years in its past.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.590
It may not have been
as advanced as a lot

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.820
of Western European countries
industrial and otherwise,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.280
but it had a very, very
advanced oil industry.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.580
The economy was very dependent on
the use of oil in factories, coal,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.390
the rail transport
system, etcetera, etcetera

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:35.000
and basically what happened was
the Soviet Regime had to deal

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.560
with the situation where they
were trying to manage an economy

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.700
and run the country
that had gone more

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.140
than 50 years back
into its economic past.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.340
And wood was really what this was

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.950
about it's how did you procure
the wood, how did you transport

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:57.130
to rail depots and rail lines, how
did you line up enough railcars

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:02.100
of wood if you had to move
a train let's say 400 miles,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.640
that's a lot of verst, a verst
is .66 miles approximately.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:12.220
So what I want to say is and I'm
going to go into more detail later,

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:18.960
I'm starting to run short on
time already is that by 1920,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.800
by really late 1919, the Civil
War in effect is over militarily,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:31.250
there's a war separately
between Soviet Russia and Poland.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.590
But in terms of the white armies

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.430
that whether they had
democratic roots

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.180
or these so-called
counterrevolutionary forces they

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.030
were more people representing
the land of gentry,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.400
wanted to get back their property.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.830
The Civil War had really
come to an end

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.630
by October 1919, late October 1919.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.210
At one point white forces
had cut off the Volga River

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.420
that was in 1918.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.720
They were pushed back.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.790
During the spring of
1919 they came very close

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.980
to the Volga, but did
not cut it off.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:09.810
In the spring of 1919 Anton Denikin
organized a major military push

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:11.590
out of the Ukraine in
the direction of Moscow,

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.580
he got within 250 miles of Moscow.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.180
But in late October before he
got to the key town of Kaluga

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.800
where there were major
arms [inaudible]

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.650
that supplied the Red
Army [inaudible]

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.120
and that was basically late 1919.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.790
So basically what happened
by the beginning of 1920

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:34.130
as you find this situation
where there is a perception

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:38.440
by the Soviet Regime that they
need to worry about Poland,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.190
there's an understanding that
Poland could be a future aggressor,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.010
but for the first time there's
really very little in terms

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.190
of real military action
going on between the Red Army

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.320
and various white forces wherever
they were coming whether it was

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.510
Siberia, the [inaudible],
the Ukraine, so forth.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.460
The military conflict isn't over,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.070 position:56%
but Kolchak is being pushed very far
back in Siberia very, very quickly.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.720
He's surrendering, a lot of
his forces are giving up.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.390
Denikin is quickly falling back
[inaudible] was in Ukraine.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.010
There was kind of a last
stand in the Crimea,

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.310
but really for all intents

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.350
and purposes the military
conflict is over.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.360
And so what I found the single
most important source I ever found

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.800
about the Civil War in
terms of what was going

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.580
with the economy what
[inaudible] regime had to deal

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.940
with once this was all over was
something almost found by chance,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.830
it wasn't even in the main catalog,
it was in the [inaudible] catalog.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.960
And it was a key meeting
that happened

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:46.270
on the 25th of January 1920.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.100 position:56%
I believe this is a unique document,

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.020
I'm not a bibliographer
I'll leave it

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.740
to the bibliographers
to try to figure it out.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.730 position:56%
But basically it was a key meeting
in Moscow, I believe that there were

00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:00.950
at least 5 or 600 people attending,
had key speeches by Alexei Rykov,

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:04.300
Trotsky I'm sure you've
heard of, some other people.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.000
And it says on the out of
this, it's only 34 pages,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.150
this was copy forwarded
by American July 30, 1920,

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.450
that's what's on the cover here.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.260
This was a meeting that
happened approximately five

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.210
and a half months earlier
on January 25th.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.480
And basically I've never seen a
meeting or a speech like this,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.260
although there was a lot

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.170
of very open talk while
[inaudible] were censored,

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.090
it is remarkable how
much openness there was

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.690
and what they talked about.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:40.650
But this speech mainly by
Alexei Rykov who's head

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.420
of the Supreme Council of National
Economy he speaks as someone

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.950 position:56%
who believes in the communist
regime and in the communist project.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.010
But it's really couched in
terms that anyone who believes

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.410
in the market economy of
any kind, whether capitalist

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.320
or whatever wouldn't
have given this speech.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.000
And what Rykov says in this speech
is that the economy is destroyed.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.960
And then he proceeds to give a
lot of key data points for that.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.520
One of the things that I've read,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.120
kind of one of the most famous
histories of the Civil War period

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.410
by Edward Carr talks in
general terms about the fact

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:24.250
that the economy declined by two
thirds between 1917 and 1923.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.270
And there's a general
recognition by all historians

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.000
that what the revolution
and Civil War did

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.720
to Soviet Russia economically
was a disaster,

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.020
it was basically a
complete collapse.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.830
But Rykov really puts some
meat on the bones of this

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.780
that I think is unique and
makes that [inaudible].

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:51.530
So one of the things he says is he
says that because of the collapse

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.990
of the transport system and then
Trotsky also supports him on this

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:58.990
and in some important
articles contributes

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:04.010
to [inaudible] is Rykov
says we're here in Moscow,

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:09.800 position:56%
the Soviet Regime kind of controls
the central European part of Russia.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.610
But he says that we have no
contact with [inaudible].

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.700
We don't have enough trains, we
can't make them work well enough

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.340
and the [inaudible] is
basically a separate economy,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.820
it's been largely destroyed

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.240
or to a very large extent
destroyed during the Civil War.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.610
But if we wanted to import iron
ore from the [inaudible] to Moscow

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:37.600 position:56%
and make metal Moscow and in Saint
Petersburg factories right now given

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.710
the amount of trains and transport
capacity we have it would take us

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.900
many decades to just
get that started.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.560
And then he says, there was
a very large textile industry

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.670
in Russia before the revolution.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:54.180
He said if we wanted to take the
cotton from Uzbekistan and bring it

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.710
to Moscow and Saint Petersburg
and there were large numbers

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:01.920
of unemployed textile workers he
said that would take 20 years.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.360 position:56%
So what the discussion about in this
long speech by Rykov and he talks

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.910
about the destruction of
national wealth almost

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.760
as if he was a market economist.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.800
There are there other
references and other things.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.520
But what he says is there's
a tremendous destruction

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.150
of national wealth
here and the fact is

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.210
that the transport system is
not something that allows us

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.250
to recreate this whole
national economy

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.850
that existed before World War 1

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.640
and that clearly had suffered
a lot during the course

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.990
of World War 1 as well.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.050
I don't want to minimize
the importance of that.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.900
And so what he's saying is we don't
have the trains to bring the grain

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.280
from the Volga region
to central Russia.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.020
These are basically grain deficit
areas, they don't grow enough grain

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.720
to feed the local population.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.670
We don't have the trains to bring
the coal from Eastern Ukraine

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.450
to make our locomotives work.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.240
And so the question is at the
beginning of 1920, is it possible

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.540
to basically stitch together the
whole country, is it possible.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.590
And they really want to rule out
is it possible at all and then B,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.800
if it is possible how do we do it.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.580
And one of the interesting things

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.100
that Rykov cites is
he says specifically

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:24.330 position:56%
and I'm not an economist, I'm not
here to get into economic statistics

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.440
or how much did the economy
decline I'm much more interested

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.710
in the qualitative
aspects of what was going

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.930
on with some important
quantitative measurements.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.080
But Rykov does cite the fact

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.530
that the economy has
declined by two thirds.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.630
He does use that number.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.730
And then he cites another
very scary statistic,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.050
he says that because we
don't have access to oil,

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.300
this is in early 1920, we
lack all the lubricants

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.480 position:56%
that we need to do railroad repairs.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.960
We can't feed the workers who
would be fixing locomotives

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.380
because they've run
away to the countryside,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.010
that's where the food is,
there's no real food in Moscow

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.390
because trains can't bring it
there in sufficient quantities.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.310
And so it's kind of a Rubik's cube
how do you start putting this all

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.980
back together.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.910
And he cites in addition to the
constraints that I mentioned

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.750
about how much wood do you need
to make things move and, you know,

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.990
you need one railcar of
wood just to move one

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.000
of these trains a 100
verst or 66 miles.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.700
But what happens is that because
there's been no ongoing repairs

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.890
of locomotives for many years now
and it started to really decline

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:39.530
in 1914, he cites the
fact that he believes

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.570
and there are no exact
numbers it's a period

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.210 position:56%
of really tremendous economic chaos.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:49.140
He says we believe at this
point we have 3,800 locomotives

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.440
that are operational.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.550
They may not be in good repair,
but at least they're moving.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.800
They may need repairs,
but we're down to 3,800.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.630
The number in 1914 of locomotives
that were available was 20,000.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.530
And there was a lot of information

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.780
in all these primary resource
materials, what were the number

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:15.230
of locomotives that were
produced in 1919, it was 149.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.860
In the years before the revolution
and there are a lot of statistics

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.520
in these Soviet journals from
1920 that are unique here

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.600
at the Library I believe
in terms of complete set,

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:31.420
the economy was building up a
thousand locomotives a year.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.480
And so there was a key article in
Pravda that raises the question,

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.270
it's a logical question I haven't
seen it addressed anyplace else,

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:44.240
at what point do we get to a number
of locomotives as they're declining

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.290
where we can't really
effectively move anything.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.410
It may be that the [inaudible]
are a separate economy themselves,

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:56.630
the Ukraine is a separate economy,
there's a wish to bring grain

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.470
from Siberia because Western
Siberia is actually a net grain

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.770
producing area.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.490
That comes up later in the 20's
I don't want to get into it

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.310
when Stalin wants to get more grain
he goes after the [inaudible],

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.420
it's called the [inaudible]
Siberian method.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.790
He's after extra grain in the
[inaudible] and in Western Siberia.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.820
And Western Siberia
probably had a grain surplus

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.110
of around 100 million poods a year.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.820
Lenin is very interested
in that let me assure you.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.010
But the problem is even if
they could get their hands

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.290
on it how do you transport this

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.980
when one railcar will
take you 66 miles okay.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.700
That's assuming you have
the wood to begin with.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.360
So what I found in this key article

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.680
in Pravda is the question is asked
specifically, what's the number

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.090
where the system no longer
works at all, it's very much

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.820
on the verge of collapse.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.560 position:56%
And a very interesting fellow writes
an article in Pravda and says,

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.690 position:56%
if we get to 2,500 it's over, we
shouldn't even start trying anymore,

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.630 position:56%
there's going to be no more economy,
you know, there won't be a regime.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.900 position:56%
And there's a lot of open discussion
about can the regime survive.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.570
The word in Russian [foreign
language] is used throughout these

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.170
primary source documents.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:13.590
On a couple of occasions Lenin
uses it, it's rare, but he uses it.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.140
He even makes reference to the way
things were at the end of 1919,

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.550
the regime cannot continue
that way he says it

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:26.660
in a key speech that's included
in his collective works.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:33.350
So what Rykov explains at this key
meeting at the American Consulate

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:37.140
in [inaudible] is that he
thinks they have around 3,800,

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.420
2,500 seems to be kind
of the barrier

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.130
where you can just forget about it.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:47.710 position:56%
And the concern is is that with each
passing month there are 200 less

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.450
working locomotives every month.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.850
So they start doing projections
that if it keeps going this way

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.350
by the end of 1920 there's
nothing more to talk about.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.370
That's why there are
these discussions

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.190
about it's a fight for survival.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.880
They use the word [foreign
language] in Russian fight,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.300
they use the word [foreign
language] survival.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.510
And so really what happens and
I know time is short here is

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.720
that Trotsky takes the lead,
Trotsky is really the key person

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.240
in 1920 other than Lenin.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.720
And Trotsky comes up with a plan
how do we start repairing these

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.430
locomotives, how do we do that.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:30.420
And what you see is there
is a period of late,

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.330
I know this sounds very
specific, but there's a period

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.660
in late February 1920 until
approximately the first weeks

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.730
of April where everyone is
questioning whether the regime

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.250
will survive.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:49.370
And it's in exactly that
time that Lenin, Trotsky,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:53.750
the whole senior Bolshevik
leadership makes a very concerted

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:59.200 position:56%
effort to turn this around and I
have some statistics in the handbook

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.160
and it starts to show
that this decline

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.310
of approximately 200
locomotives a month is staunched,

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.680
they're just starting to hold even.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.600
And then as you get into summer
1920 Trotsky as commissar

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.760
of transport starts to
really turn this around.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.020
Not in a big way it doesn't get
them a lot of breathing room,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.930
but the fact that the regime
is on life support it's

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:29.290
on the precedence that
comes to an end.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.630
They're not making the rail system
as a whole work a whole lot better,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:37.310
but there's no longer a sense
our necks are on the block

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.410
that is just not the case.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.140
So I'm running a little
short on time.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.910
I wanted to say a couple
things about Trotsky.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:50.800
The Library here has
Trotsky's complete works

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.510
or close approximation
to them were published.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.630
The Library has a complete,
has all of the volumes.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.240
Volume 15, which I
know may sound esoteric

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.410
that covers everything
he did in 1920.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.030
And basically what Trotsky did
in late May 1920 as commissar

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:10.560
of transport was he issued
what became a famous order,

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.890
it was called order number 1042.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:19.010
And that was an industrial
plan to produce spare parts

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.200
so that these locomotives
could be fixed.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.780
And in the meantime, they're
starting to get a little trickle

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.500
of oil from Baku by summer 1920
and it's coming up the Volga

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.250
and they're starting to make,
they're starting to refigure

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:37.220
and redo some of the locomotives
that could only use wood.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.590
And they're starting to see
tremendous advantages from that.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.690
They're not really getting
Donetsk coal and I've included

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:47.960
in the document in the handout
that shows as late as October 1920,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.790
only a 10th of the mine
workers that were working

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:56.730
in the Donetsk coal basin
before World War 1 were employed

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.030
at that time.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.690
So the maximum amount
that it produced was 1/10.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.500
There was a tremendous amount
of chaos and economic anarchy

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.800
in the Ukraine, a lot of
fighting back and forth.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.390
When the Pols did attack in
April, May 1920 they got very far

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.770 position:56%
into Ukraine, they actually captured
Kiev, they didn't get that far.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:21.410
Stalin was in the Ukraine for most
of 1920 and his goal was to try

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.900
to restore the coal
industry in the Ukraine.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.630
When the Pols attacked
his focus was much more

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.960
on the military side of things.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.300 position:56%
So what I wanted to just talk about
briefly and this is what I think one

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.260
of the key things I got out of all
the primary source documents I used

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.290
here I do think the documents at
the Hoover are very important,

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:45.370
the things I got in the Soviet
archives are very important too is

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:51.850 position:56%
that there were three key government
bodies throughout the course of 1920

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:55.980
that made policy, debated
policy, etcetera, etcetera.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.970
And those were basically the
Soviet hierarchy, the senior part

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.880
of that was the Council
Peoples Commissars.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.140
Lenin was chairman of the
Council Peoples Commissar,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.400
so under Council People Commissar
you had the commissar of transport,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.890
you had the commissar of the
food supply, etcetera, etcetera.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.720
And then obviously you
had the Communist Party

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.510
and there was a Politburo.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.480
The Politburo really
made overarching general

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.780
policy decisions.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.880
So when the Pols attacked for
instance questions about how

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.860
that attack should be handled
in general terms were decided

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.940
by the Politburo, but the Politburo
really didn't do a lot more

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.330
than that.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.190
The key institution and when I was

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.370
at Columbia this was [inaudible]
always suggests, always emphasized

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:43.610 position:56%
to me is that if you can get a hold
of kind of the institutional history

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.280
of what was going on
you can really kind

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.750
of almost decode the most
important things after that.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.130
And what happens in early February,
although it's going this direction

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.250
in January at the time of
the speech that I referred

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:05.020
to is Lenin reinforces what was
previously called the Council

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.320
of Defense.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.770
The Council of Defense coordinated
all defensive industrial activity

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:17.110 position:56%
as the Red Army fought the white
armies really up until October 1919.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.730
And what Lenin and Trotsky decide
and this is as much Trotsky

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.760
as Lenin is they decide that
the council of defense has

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.840
to be expanded and it's renamed
the Council of Labor and Defense.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.960
And so what happens
during the course of 1920

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.980
and there's a very good book that
goes into the research of this,

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.560
it's the translation of English,
there's an English translation.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.420
It's documents from the Hoover
Institution called the Origin

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.450
of Forced Labor in the
Soviet State 1917-1921

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.530
if you just want to pass it around.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.620
The Council of Labor and Defense
actually becomes the key central

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.390
economic organ to deal with
this mess that I've described,

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:03.150
the transport system, lack of
food, the demographic issues

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.130
of workers running away from
the main industrial centers

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:10.880
and then factories are not open.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.900
Rykov sites the fact that there
are probably 3,300 factories

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.730
under Soviet control.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.030
He says that over 1,800
them are closed,

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.910
there's no one working there.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.210
They're barred, they're shut.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.010
That's because workers have
run away, they can't be fed,

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.360
if they can't be fed
they're not going to work.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.880
And the regime can't provide them
enough food to stay there and work.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.430
It's really incredible the
whole speech and analysis

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.710
by Rykov on January 25th, 1920.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.810
And so what happens is
the Council of Labor

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:49.020
and Defense becomes the
central economic planning organ

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.340
and it's really through the
Council of Labor and Defense

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:59.180
that Trotsky organizes this effort
to retool and repair locomotives.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.730
If you want to accept the
number 3,800 in January 1920

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.720
and they're going down 200 a month.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.820
That gets turned around through
Trotsky's efforts as minister

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.200
of transport and then working

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.090
through the Council
of Labor and Defense.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.410
And the reason the Council of Labor
and Defense is so important is

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:21.680
that it also organized conscript
labor, especially peasant labor

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.690
to go chop the wood
and transport it.

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:31.680 position:56%
And the main interaction between the
Soviet state and the vast majority

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.620
of the Russian population, which
was the peasantry was getting them

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.930
to do conscript labor to
get wood because otherwise,

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.330
you didn't have a transport system.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:49.130
So I wanted to wrap up
by saying that a lot

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:55.000
of Trotsky's political career
was tied up with this whole idea

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.860
of conscripting the peasantry to
go chop this wood and cart it,

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.810
that's what they were doing.

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:10.580 position:56%
There were limitations on how much
the regime could enforce that, very,

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:15.200
very serious limitations because
it didn't have enough food

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.730
to have Red Army soldiers do it.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.220
Red Army soldiers were now
conscripted on a regular basis

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.690
to perform labor obligations.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:27.360
The reason that the peasantry was
particularly an inviting target was

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.660
the peasants were told

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.850
if you perform your labor
obligations you bring your own

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:34.880
bread, we don't have to supply
it, but then we'll let you go.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.620
That is just the reality of
what happened during 1920.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.410
The story with the industrial
labor force in the major factories

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:46.740
where they need to produce
spare parts for the railroads is

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.570
and I have some information taken
from 1920 contemporary numbers,

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.830
how much food were
these workers getting.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:51:00.510 position:56%
On average it was something like 15
to maybe 20 pounds of bread a month.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:04.060
That is not enough to perform
heavy industrial labor.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.150
And I think the most thing
point about the whole chaos

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:12.200 position:56%
and just the whole fluidity of the
situation throughout 1920 and beyond

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.230
because as I said, wood
remained the main source

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.410
for fueling the Soviet
transport system long after 1920,

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.670
long into the new economic policy

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.480
when the food supply
dictatorship ended.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.780
Was that these factories
were not given enough food

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.890
and I cite statistics from
these primary source documents.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.890
Some of the major factories that
were trying to produce spare parts

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:42.380
or build new Soviet locomotives a
lot of them were fulfilling no more

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.330
than 10% of the orders that
they were asked to fulfill.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:51.270
There was one factory in the
course of a month produced .9%

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:56.090
of what Trotsky wanted
under order number 1042.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.330 position:56%
And so what you see is tremendous
numbers of workers being encouraged,

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:06.290
invited, cajoled to come back
to the factories where they were

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.240
with the promise that
they will be fed.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.450
And they're fed for a while and
then food supply deliveries,

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.730
whatever reason don't work out.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:20.280 position:56%
And so there was approximately 100%
labor turnover throughout the course

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.710
of 1920 and there's a lot of
very good information about this,

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.050
even if it isn't exact it's
close enough to give you a sense

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.830
of the fluidity of the situation.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.830
But how do you make this work if
you're in control of the regime,

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:36.000
how do you do this if you're Lenin
and you stop governing bodies.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.030
And the labor turnover for
just the second half of 1920

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.090
after they started to get some oil,
a little bit of coal starts to come

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:48.460
from the Ukraine, it was 60% just
during the last six months of 1920.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.080
So I think I ought to wrap
it up here it's been an hour.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.150
There's a lot more that I could
say, I would have liked to say more

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.700
about Trotsky's role in
this, but I've got to be.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.180
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Five
more minutes if you need.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.310
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: Okay,
thank you very much Grant.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:08.470 position:56%
So I guess what I wanted to say is
if you compare the initial situation

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:12.570
as of January 25th, 1920 when
Rykov gives this speech and talks

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.550
about there's a separate
bureau [inaudible]

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.450
and there's a separate
economy in the Ukraine,

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:22.410
you've got central European Russia
kind of surviving on its own

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:29.170
and most of it if it isn't a net
grain deficit situation it's just

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:33.750
barely producing enough
food to feed itself.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.400 position:56%
What you see is during the course of
1920 a very, very concerted effort

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.050
to start trying to stitch all
of these pieces back together.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:47.490
And what I can say is that by the
end of 1920 the progress was very,

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:52.390
very limited, very, very limited
partly because the coal industry

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:58.950
in the Ukraine had really
made any significant progress.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:03.750
There was a key document, you know,
Trotsky brought all of his papers

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:09.220 position:56%
with him when he was sent into exile
by Stalin and they've been donated

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.440
to the Harvard University, there's
the Trotsky archive at Harvard.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.010
And so there's a key
document in there,

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.240 position:56%
I believe it's dated early November.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.710
Thank you.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:23.480
And he talks about the
fact that the coal industry

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.970
in the Donetsk basin still isn't
working at the end of 1920.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.840
You do see some real progress
in the [inaudible] by the end

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.990
of 1920 compared to
where it was in January.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:38.040 position:56%
And by the way, the first labor
army are created in the [inaudible].

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.780
The [inaudible] is
basically Trotsky's,

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.010
I don't want to call it
province, but it's his area.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.370
His people are in control there,
they're the ones that are trying

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:51.370
to reestablish [inaudible] metal
industry, the coal industry

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:53.420
in the [inaudible] and so forth.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.620
And what's very, very
interesting again,

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.920
the primary source material
is really almost overwhelming,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.220
is that the Supreme Council

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.150
of the National Economy despite
its name did not run the economy.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:07.030
It was just basically the
commissar of heavy industry.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:11.610
And what you see is all
this territory is recaptured

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.790
by the Soviet Regime and
eventually Siberia as well,

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.500
within the Supreme Council of the
National Economy there are four

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.370
or five separate divisions.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:24.760
So there is basically a
division that controls industry

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.270
in European Russia
and that is separate

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:32.640
and Rykov runs it,
he's the chairman.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.530
But there's a separate,
a whole separate division

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:38.490
of the Supreme Council of the
National Economy just for Ukraine

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:43.690
and it has no interaction
with the Central European one.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.340 position:56%
And then down here where the Cossack
area is there is a separate Supreme

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.050
Council of the National
Economy for Southeast Russia

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.600
and there's a separate
one for the [inaudible]

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.590
and then finally one for Siberia.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.560
That is still the case
at the end of 1920.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.750
So there is some progress
made, but it's very limited

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:06.980 position:56%
and I will end here now by saying
that this key monograph that I found

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:13.220
that was published in 1922 it looks
back at the end of 1920 and 1921.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.500
And basically what it says is
that with the limited resources

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.390
that the regime had it
started to get some oil,

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:22.930 position:56%
it started to get a little bit of
coal, coal also from the [inaudible]

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:27.200
that the geographic
dimensions of the area

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.690
that the regime was controlling
overwhelmed the resource,

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.000
even the limited resource it could
bring to bear when it started

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.280
to get oil and coal that simply
the Ukraine remained separate

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.570
from European Russia.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:43.050 position:56%
The [inaudible] and Siberia remained
separate from European Russia.

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:48.670 position:56%
And I do believe that that
underlying economic crisis had a lot

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:52.350
to do, not just the issue
about food, had a lot to do

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.630
with the recognition by
Lenin and say the government

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.780 position:56%
that they really had to make a major
change and that had a lot to do

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:04.900
with why the new economic policy
was declared in the spring of 1921.

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.470 position:56%
There are obviously other reasons
we know about the [inaudible] revolt

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:11.850
and a lot of sailors and workers
were revolting against the regime.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:15.500
But if you look at the real
underlying economic reality

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:20.550
of where things stood by 1920 and
the limited progress that was made

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:25.850 position:56%
by the end of 1921 in effect the
regime did not control the territory

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:29.080
it had won from the
white armies, it did not.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:34.060 position:56%
It did several years later, but this
was a tremendously difficult process

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:39.180
and it was a wood economy that
took the entire country back more

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.480
than 50 years.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.560
So I'm going to end there.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.330
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Jonathan thank
you, that's stellar, that's really.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: Thank
you, thanks very much.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.610
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: We'll try if
anybody has a question or two,

00:57:50.610 --> 00:58:00.340
this has gone just [inaudible]
now, but any questions right now?

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:05.300
&gt;&gt; So what about I guess within
Soviet Union in terms of trade,

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.030
did they trade for oil,
[inaudible] like Southeast Asia or?

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:13.300
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: Okay, yeah
so I want to answer your question,

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:18.440
but let me just you a little bit of
background about what was going on.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.950
So obviously one of the things
I didn't mention was during most

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:25.320
of the Civil War period, certainly

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:30.590
through 1919 there was a major
trade embargo the Western European

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:35.020
countries that Lenin referred to
as the top powers refused to trade

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.080
because they were actively
supporting the white armies.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.300
And there's a lot of talk

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.820
about there was some
British soldiers dropped off

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:48.380
up here near the Donetsk area
and [inaudible] maybe was 600.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:51.990
The real ally contribution
to the white cause was

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:57.880
that the armaments given bullets,
machine guns, and everything a lot

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.420
of good economic work has been
done equaled the entire production

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.740
of what the limited Soviet
arms industry could produce

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.040
with the Red Army.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.010
It was a major, major contribution.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:16.000
That embargo ended in January
1920, it's reported, you know,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.540
in big bold letters in Pravda and
Izvestia and it's very important.

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:24.470
The reality was that there
was no real trade until later.

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:29.220
But what happens in January,
February, March 1920 and I do want

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:34.270
to answer your specific
question is Trotsky's predecessor

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.760
of the commissar of transport,

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.990
a very skilled engineer named
Krassen [phonetic] goes to England

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:42.800
because the idea is he wants
to start buying locomotives

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.480
and there's a Soviet trade
delegation [inaudible]

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.360
into Western Europe.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.620
There are a lot of things
the Soviet economy needs

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:53.000
or I would say the European Russian
economy under Soviet control needs.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.630
They need a lot of things, they
need grain, they need many things.

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:00.650
The only thing that Krassen is
trying to get is locomotives.

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:04.270
And Trotsky says in some of his
key speeches in his collected works

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:05.580
and they're really remarkable.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.430
I can just tell you the notes just
in that volume have information

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:11.320
that you won't find any place else.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.170
But basically Trotsky says we won't
be able to get any locomotives.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:19.970
And in terms of oil
what happened is when --

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.780
this is why the regime
got very lucky

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:25.540
and I should have mentioned this
and I want to get to your question.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.800
When the Red Army captured
Baku the big deal was

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.010
that there were 200
million poods of oil

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.530
that had already been
taken out of the ground.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.210
I don't know if they were
literally in barrels,

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.200
but they were ready to be shipped.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.940
And there had been a lot
of destruction to some

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.480
of the oil infrastructure in Baku.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.690
And so before 1914 Baku have
seen a lot of information.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.240
Trotsky writes about it,
Trotsky is an incredible writer

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.740
and not just flowerily, but he
talks about things in great detail.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.000
He's of incredible use
to anyone who wants

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.050
to seriously study this period.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:03.990
And so up to 35 million poods

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:06.860
of oil is being produced a
month in Baku before the war.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.050
When the Red Army captures it
it's only 10 to 15 million.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:16.380
But the 200 million that's there
allows them to start using it.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.170
And there's even talk that
given how much they need to use

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:23.330
if they can transport it that
they're going to run out by 1922.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.390
And I'm sure we all have
recognized the name Arm and Hammer.

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:31.150
It was Arm and hammer that helped
the Soviet Union restore this.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:36.310
And so in terms of trade I can't, I
would think that there's a lot more

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.850
in The Prize by Daniel Yergin

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:42.400
and about how much
oil if any was traded.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.450
But basically what you
have by the beginning

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.670
of 1920 is the effective
end of the embargo,

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:51.920
although there was no real
trade until late 1920.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.580
Then there was talk of trade
with the Western countries.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:00.630
And one of the main things that
the regime had to trade was wood

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:03.580
from the far northwest,
from the far --

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:07.770
that's one of the main things that
they thought they could trade.

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:12.060
Because the wood resources of
European Russia not even talking

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.780
about Siberia they're more than
a third of all the forestry

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.860
in the world at the time
going back to that time.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.160
So just to repeat your question
again, there is some trade.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.720
I think that the regime
needed whatever oil it had.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.030
I don't know if it traded any oil.

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:32.190
One of the things that was very
interesting that they were trying

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.220
to trade and it gives you
a sense of how special.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:41.850
Siberia was a tremendous producer
of very high quality butter

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:46.810 position:56%
and so there was a tremendous amount
of butter exported from Siberia

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:49.130
for instance to England
Western Europe.

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.320
And so that was one of the things
they were looking at trading wood,

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.110
butter, those were
the two main things.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:57.380
I believe they wanted
to hold on to the oil,

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.930
but there were other things
they needed technology.

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:06.100
You see during this period that the
entire telegraphic system becomes

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.440
totally unreliable.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.600
All the telegraph and coding
equipment was imported

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.950
from the West, so they're after
that, you know, anything they could

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.880
to restore the telegraph
system they want to do that.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.900 position:56%
Telephones, telephones were produced
in Russia before the revolution,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.370
but there are not a lot of people
around who know how to fix them

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.810
and the skilled laborers
that run away

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:30.020
to the countryside the regime
is looking where are the people

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.240
that can repair our
telephones and our telegraphs.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.540
Go ahead.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.840
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Jonathan,

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.140
I think it was the trade
with Southeast Asia.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.510
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff:
Southeast Asia I'm sorry.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.690
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:44.870 position:56%
Well there was always traditionally,
I mean you can see Iran right

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:47.450
in this little right, there was
a [inaudible] amount of trade

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:52.130
on the Caspian Sea between
Russia and Iran prior yes.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.960
But I don't think there
was any oil going

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.100
to Southeast Asia,
I don't believe so.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.690
But I would look at Yergin because
he is really the definitive source

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:04.390
on all of this, it's an
unbelievably good book yes.

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:06.590
I hope that answers your
question at least part.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:10.690 position:56%
But no, there's no real large
amounts of trade it's only later in,

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:15.370
you know, 1922, 1923 that
the regime starts trading.

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.710 position:56%
I also want to add one more thing
about locomotive, why was it so hard

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.540
to repair all these locomotives.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.960
Well you had all these private
companies before the revolution

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.050
producing locomotives, so there
wasn't one standard locomotive.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.940
So if you needed a spare
part for company number 23

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.480
that was producing
locomotives in Saint Petersburg

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.780
and you couldn't find it

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:42.210
down in Samara how did you
repair the locomotives there.

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:46.380 position:56%
It was an incredible problem, that's
what Trotsky was looking at of a way

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.060
to systemize which spare parts
we had and which we didn't.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.070
And really what happened was
you had and this is the term

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.170
at the time that's used throughout
all the primary source materials,

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.680
you had what were called locomotive
graveyards because locomotives

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.320
that weren't working they were
stripped of their spare parts.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.800
And if locomotive number 23 from
that company in Saint Petersburg,

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.420
you know, could be found and
there was another locomotive 23

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.600
that needed that particular spare
part it was just stripped away.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.680
And they had, you know, they had
locomotive graveyards of hundreds

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.060
of locomotives at a time they
were just stripping them,

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.050
that's what they were doing.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.620
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: I think
we're about out of time.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.790
Any quick question?

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:27.210
So we'll have to end there.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.830
Thank you so much for
coming, thank you Johnson.

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:31.910
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Kapiloff: Thank
you, thanks very much.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.810
Thanks, thanks.
