00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.570
I want to talk to you about how you use
chemistry to actually fire a rocket into space.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.090
There are really in a sense three considerations
you need to worry about

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.509
when your making your choice about the kind
of system you are going to use to power your rocket.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.540
The first is, what is the impulse,
in other words how much push does your fuel

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.420
actually deliver?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.260
The second thing is how much does
it weigh, because of course the heavier it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.640
is, the more costly.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.699
And then finally, the third consideration,
is going to be safety.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.890
The key idea really is that you are starting
a fire and to get a fire you need a fuel and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.460
you need an oxidiser. So normally when you
light a match, that match burns because the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.580
wood is the fuel and the oxygen in the air
is the oxidiser. But of course oxygen is not

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.640
available in space so you have got to take
your own.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.530
One option is essentially to build yourself
a firework and a firework consists

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.840
of a solid material that you light at one
end. That material contains fuel and oxidiser together.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.490
This was the principle behind the solid state
boosters that took the space shuttle into

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.380
orbit to deliver astronauts to the ISS.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.240
A second possibility is to use cryogenic liquids.
We know that hydrogen and oxygen react pretty

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.679
fast with each other and with a huge release
of heat. Well imagine that you make the hydrogen

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.859
and the oxygen liquid, you store them in tanks
and then you mix them together and light the result.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.000
That was the solution that was used in the
1970's, when I was a kid, to fire the Apollo

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.860
astronauts off towards the moon. You would
see that huge rocket, with plums of condensation

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.100
coming out the side.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.940
But the other possibility is to use two liquids,
which you could mix together, and they would

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.900
spontaneously ignite. This is the most intriguing,
but actually, to me, the most terrifying of the possibilities

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.620
These are what are called
hypergolic mixtures. They are ones that can

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.340
really give you tremendous bang for your buck.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.340
This is the kind of chemistry that makes me very nervous. Let's have a look.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.860
We are going to start with our oxidiser, Nitrogen
Dioxide, is a very very volatile liquid and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.460
it boils at about 21ï¿½C. So I have it on
ice here and we are going to condense it into

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.720
this test tube, and down at the bottom, you
can actually see some drops of NO2 coming

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.150
out of that little pipette tip. That colourless
liquid is actually Nitrogen Tetroxide linked

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.120
to another one. So we call it Dinitrogen Tetroxide.
Now we come to the part where we are going

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.300
to put in the fuel. Dimethylhydrazine, which
is actually one of the key components of a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.380
mixture called Aerozine 50, which NASA have
used for a very long time to power some of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.560
their rockets. And I have got it in this very
long pipette.That silly pipette is there

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.710
for a reason; I don't want my hands anywhere
near this thing.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:55.870
You can really see here this very fast reaction
which generates loads of Nitrogen and also

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.640
Ethane. All of the products here are gaseous
and you get a tremendous expansion, at the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.820
same time because it gets very hot it glows
so brightly, and produces produces a big brown

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.130
plume. My God this is impressive. What's
scary about it, is how fast that reaction

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.870
happens, and I think sometimes we get maybe
a little bit complacent. Here we have a reaction

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.439
which is absolutely instantaneous. This is
a reaction which clearly has no activation

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:41.629
barrier, every single collision results in
a reaction, and whats more, every reaction

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:49.789
results in very fast hot products. So you
get this extraordinary, explosive cascade.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.129
Which is where that sound comes from.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:00.289
So to me, it is a tremendous testament, not
simply to the chemists who discovered this

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.219
thing, but actually to the guys who first
applied it and first realised that this may

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:13.879
have potential. And then ultimately, to the
engineers who were able to find ways to control this.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:22.420
Its a remarkable thing and its not just the
chemistry, its the physics and its the engineering.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.420
Chapeau!
