00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.420
The history of computer science is heckin’
cool.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.860
It features the upending of basic questions,
like—what is information?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.160
It has biographical oomph—only this story’s
war-hero scientist, Alan Turing, was punished,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.930
not celebrated, after helping the Allies win
World War Two.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.880
And the history of computer science raises
profound questions about technology and society,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.670
like—how do we know that our big complex
beautiful brains aren’t really just big

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.210
complex… computing machines?

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.280
And, if we can one day build machines that
think as fast as humans, will we have to grant

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.100
them human rights?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.920
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.300
Questions about thinking machines are relatively
recent in history.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.000
But all kinds of doing machines are not, and
some of this doing involves solving mathematical

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420
problems and other high-level functions.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.879
Some time before 60 BCE, the Greeks constructed
an analog computer now called the Antikythera

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.879
mechanism.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:10.690
Using many gears, the mechanism may have been
used to predict eclipses or other astronomical

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.690
events.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.509
But the mechanism appears to have been a one-off.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.550
So historians often give credit for the first
mechanical computer to the Artuqid-Turkmen

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.140
engineer, Al-Jazarī, who died in CE 1206.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.540
We met him way back in episode seven when
dude built a robotic musical band.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.509
And a robot toilet helper!

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.500
And Al-Jazarī built an astronomical clock
that showed the signs of the zodiac and could

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.869
be reprogrammed to compensate for changing
lengths of the day.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.280
Then, in 1642, French mathematician Blaise
Pascal invented a mechanical adding machine

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.399
that used a collection of rotating numbered
wheels, similar to a car’s odometer.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.780
Our friend from episode seventeen, German
mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, built commercial

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.450
mechanical calculators in the late 1600s.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.000
And in 1801, in the early days of the Industrial
Revolution, French merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.549
incorporated the punch card into a textile
loom to control patterns—arguably the first

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.500
industrial use of computing!

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.980
But devices like calculators and looms are
pretty far from the computers we rely on today.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.390
So then the question becomes, like... what is a computer?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.710
Well, that word has changed a lot over the
years.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.480
In fact, up until the 1950s, a “computer”
was a person who computes—usually a woman.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.010
The basic idea today is that a “computer”
is a machine that can be programmed to perform

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.410
logical tasks—like math problems—automatically.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.940
For many historians, the dream of a somewhat
recognizable modern computer that can be programmed

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.790
to perform all sorts of calculations without
continuous human number-punching, dates back

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.040
to 1837.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.270
That’s when British mathematician Charles
Babbage fully conceived a digital, programmable—but

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.590
mechanical—computer called the difference
engine.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.371
This was a general purpose information processor:
it wasn’t just for a single task, but for

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.850
solving general logic problems.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.380
Sadly, the difference engine was never completed.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.470
Babbage started working on it, but never finished
due to cost overruns and fights with his machinist.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.590
But we have his notes and those of his chronicler,
British mathematician Ada Lovelace, who wrote

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.830
the first algorithm intended for processing
using a computer—basically, the first computer

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.079
program!—in 1843.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.100
Fun fact, Lovelace was the daughter of Romantic
poet Lord Byron!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.020
Another early computer was actually made and
put into use in the United States.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.970
A young mathematician–inventor named Herman
Hollerith combined the old technology of punch

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.751
cards with the new technology of electrical
circuits to produce a sorting and tabulating

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:37.770
machine.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.580
With his machine, the 1890 census was finished
in weeks instead of years.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.320
Hollerith went on to found the Tabulating
Machine Company.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.820
And it’s still in business today—as the
International Business Machines Corporation,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.070
or IBM.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.690
But neither Babbage and Lovelace’s way-ahead-of-their-time
designs nor Hollerith’s super-sorter established

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.500
computing as a science.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.590
Some important developments happened in the
years before World War Two.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.940
For example, starting in the late 1920s, influential
American engineer Vannevar Bush created an

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.000
analog computer called a differential analyzer,
which could solve calculus problems with as

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.430
many as eighteen independent variables.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.160
But the war shoved computer science into the
scientific limelight.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.010
In the 1930s, British mathematician, linguist,
cryptographer, philosopher, and all-around

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.970
smarty pants Alan Turing laid the foundation
for a mathematical science of computing.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.560
ThoughtBubble, introduce us:

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.130
Turing proposed the aptly named Turing machine—a
thought experiment to figure out the limitations

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.730
of mechanical computation.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.590
A Turing machine can theoretically perform
an algorithm, or programmed operation.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.700
It’s a universal computer.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.960
Turing couldn’t make an abstract perfect
computer, but he could lay out how the logic

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.940
of writing and reading programs should work,
and how a relatively simple device could,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.070
given enough memory, accomplish any logical
operation.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.590
During the war, Turing went to work in the
super-secret “Ultra” program at Bletchley

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.380
Park, which was an estate for British codebreakers.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.170
Turing wasn’t the only computer innovator
at Bletchley.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.100
For one thing, eight thousand women worked
there!

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.170
Also, an engineer named Tommy Flowers designed
some for-the-time hyper-advanced computers

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.900
called the Colossus series, which also helped
the Allies a lot.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.060
And were kept secret until the 1970s!

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.890
But Turing’s job, leading Ultra Hut Number
Eight, was to decipher encrypted messages

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.000
about German naval movements.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.200
The Germans used a device called an Enigma
machine to create supposedly unbreakable ciphers,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.480
or ways of encoding messages so that only
someone with the same cipher could read the

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480
message.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.000
But Turing broke through, using a computer
he built called the bombe, based on a Polish

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
computer.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.340
These wartime computers weren’t super fast
or sophisticated.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.180
They were smart ways of automating a lot of
dumb tasks.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.410
Thanks ThoughtBubble

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.780
After the war, Turing kept working on computers.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.550
His 1948 essay “Intelligent Machinery”
gave more details on the Turing machine.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.970
Then, in 1950, he published “Computing Machinery
and Intelligence” in the journal Mind.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.900
Go read it, it holds up!

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.460
Basically, this article became foundational
text in artificial intelligence or AI.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.490
Turing famously stated that the appearance
of intelligence is proof of it.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.600
Turing arrived at this idea by thinking about
a limit case: consider a computer that appears

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.820
truly intelligent, like a human.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.980
How would we know whether or not it is intelligent?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.860
Turing proposed a game to test the computer:
talk to it like a person!

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.570
This game is called the Turing Test and is
still used as a challenge in AI:

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.460
a human asks questions to both a computer
and another human, through a terminal, and

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.030
tries to guess which is which from their responses.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.170
The Turing Test was based on an old party
game, in which you did the same thing via

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.660
written notes, and tried to guess which
of two unknown people was a man and which

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660
a woman.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.510
The Turing Test led to the Church–Turing
Hypothesis: computation power is computation

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.510
power.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.730
It doesn’t matter if that power comes from
electrical circuitry or a human brain, or

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.060
how fast the individual parts of the machine
are.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.560
So any machine of sufficient power should
be able to do any computation that a brain

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560
can do.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.330
So… a sufficiently complex machine would
be as intelligent as a brain—or more.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.160
The only limit to computational power is memory.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.260
But in real life, no computer—whether brain
or series of electrical circuits—has infinite

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.260
memory.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.900
Even more ahead of his time, in his 1950 paper,
Turing suggested that—instead of trying

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.640
to straight-up build a computer as intelligent
as an adult human—it would be smarter to

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.140
build a child’s mind and then teach it how
to learn on its own.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.389
BAM, machine learning!

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.760
So what recognition did Turing get for all
of his hard work?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.290
In 1952, in the course of a police investigation
of a burglary at his home,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.070
the officials became aware that he was in
a relationship with another man, and the British

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.210
government pressed charges.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.780
Turing was convicted of “gross indecency”
and sentenced to take libido-lowering hormones.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:09.090
He died in 1954, possibly of suicide by cyanide-poisoned
apple, possibly by inhalation of cyanide while

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.090
working.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.220
Either way, one of the greatest minds to ever
live died at age forty-one.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.080
He was not pardoned until 2016.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.560
But before Turing died, he met with some important
folks in the United States…

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.190
Hungarian-American physicist John von Neumann

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.690
met Turing in the 1930s
and worked on foundational aspects of computer

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.190
science and AI.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.620
Von Neumann proposed the idea of storing a
computer program in the computer’s memory.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.680
So instructions could be stored externally,
instead of having to be fixed permanently

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.750
in a given machine.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.010
Turing also met with American mathematician
named Claude Shannon during the 1930s, sharing

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.860
his ideas about the Turing Machine.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.810
Shannon, who invented the word “bit” and
founded digital computing and circuit design

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.480
theory while still a graduate student at MIT.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.960
And conducted some Turing-like codebreaking
during World War Two.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.930
But he’s most well known for publishing
a series of papers after the war that founded

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.260
information theory, which examines how information
is encoded, stored, and communicated.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.800
We could do a whole episode on information
theory, but some of the effects of Shannon’s

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.900
work were to help transition computers, televisions,
and other systems of moving around information

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.260
from analog to digital.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.120
And information theory led to the Internet!

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.830
And over at Harvard, American physicist Howard
Aiken worked with the military and IBM to

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.610
design and build a computer, the Harvard Mark
I, in 1944.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.100
This device was used by von Neumann to run
a program to help design the atomic bomb.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.790
One of the other first programmers of the
Mark I was American computer scientist and

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.470
rear admiral Grace Hopper,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.610
who invented one of the first compiler tools
to translate programming language into machine

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.610
code.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.300
She then worked on machine-independent programming
languages, developing the early programming

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.690
language COBOL.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.050
Computers after World War Two quickly became
bigger, faster, and more complex—like the

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:01.690
U.S. Navy-sponsored Electronic Numerical Integrator
and Computer, or ENIAC, 1946,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:06.960
which filled up a large room, and UNIVAC in
1951, which was commercially mass-produced.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.720
These general-purpose computers were based
on the principles laid out by theorists like

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.340
Turing, von Neumann, and Shannon, and they
used the languages developed by programmers

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.340
like Hopper.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.820
These computers were built using a digital
code—binary, with values of only “one”

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.820
or “zero”.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.990
And real-world computing really took off after
the invention in 1947 of the solid-state transistor

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:33.640
by William Shockley at Bell Laboratories and
room-filling “mainframe” computers for

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640
businesses.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.529
In a later episode, we’ll get to back to
computers—and introduce one of our very

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:40.630
best friends in the history of technology,
the Internet.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.500
But for now, let’s remember that, up until
the 1950s, a computer was a person, usually

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.560
a woman, who was a number cruncher—

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.750
that is, someone who computes, using a machine.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.560
One of those “computers” who became an
engineer who used a computer was African-American

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.830
rocket scientist Annie Easley.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:03.420
In the era of Jim Crow laws, Easley left Alabama
and went to work for NASA in Ohio.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.640
She developed computer code for NASA missions
for decades.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.170
