00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.340
Now let us look at some
three by three problems.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.130
This time the matrix has three rows and
three columns.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.680
We are given not just A, B, and C.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.770
We are given A, B,
C in the first row, D, E,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.990
F in the second row,
G and H in the third row.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.440
We do not know what
will go here under I.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.700
Again, we want horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal relationships.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.250
A is to B is to C, as D is to E is to F,
as G is to H is to what?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.345
And similarly vertically.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.095
As well as diagonally.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:45.005
If we take all three of those
constraints, rows,columns and diagonals,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:50.045
which would be the correct choice among
one through six to put under the square?
