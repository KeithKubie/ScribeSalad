00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.200
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.800
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.800
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.240
<v 0>just checking in on you.
Oh Jesus.</v>

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.870
That took a lot of energy.
Right Day.
You probably like build.
She,

6
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.810
she shouted so fucking all the past couple of weeks kid.
What happened?

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.730
I'll tell you what happened.
Oh,
freckles is off the road.
Yes,

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.010
the old fucking conti eight what he used to be.
Hey,

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.210
why do used to be eight go to lax.
I love it.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.850
I don't doing fucking shit.
So fuck.
Call me.
I'll tell you right?
I,
I,

11
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.370
if I had the fuck [inaudible],

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.400
if we weren't in a never ending 17 fucking wars right now and they weren't

13
00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:54.550
fucking taking such a giant fucking,

14
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.650
I literally give these concepts more than I make and I did a fucking job.

15
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.790
Hi Uncle Sam going on stage telling any fucking jokes or the big,

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.380
he's like a fucking character comic.
That's what he would be.

17
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.550
This big stupid fucking hack,
you know,
going up there.

18
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.900
So he's on a fucking unicycle.
I want you here.

19
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.210
I want you to go fuck yourself about that.
Sammy.

20
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.990
How about I get to keep just a little,
just how about a container more?

21
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.880
Sorry.
Anyways,
what am I thankful for this weekend?

22
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.510
I'll tell you right now,
dude,
if,
if there was,

23
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.430
if there was a fucking way that I could figure out if I could figure out how to

24
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:41.170
get off the fucking hamster wheel,
you know,

25
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.070
because the deal is,

26
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.070
it's like you keep running or we're just going to tax the shit out of you.

27
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.530
Do you want to put your fucking money on the crap table?

28
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.650
We'll give you a little break,
you know?

29
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:56.530
But if you hit a wall like the second you start slowing down,

30
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.260
you know the government's just like,
wait,

31
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.980
does this mother fucker think he's going to retire?
He's just gonna coast.

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.753
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.510
<v 0>You're going to get in that fucking car and you're going to work.</v>

34
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.344
You felt confused,

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.410
your shit and you're going to fucking work and then we're going to take more

36
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:17.240
than you fucking make.
Huh?
Hey,
smart.
Nup that's what they should do.

37
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.110
Just come in like that fucking guy there in casino.

38
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:24.050
Smarten up by take your head and I stick it through that fucking hole.

39
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:27.980
That's basically their vibe.
So anyways,
I figured out how to retire.

40
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.240
I saw today and I was walking out of the grocery store,

41
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.550
so this guy had a Ford F150 with the camper on the back and I'm like,

42
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.510
that's it right there.
They'll let you do that.
Uh,

43
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.530
you don't want to work then you've got to live like that.
All right,

44
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.200
chip count and we're still going to give you tickets and eventually we're going

45
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.430
to tell your house away.
Hey,

46
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:51.500
if you are in that situation,
if they show up,

47
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.140
can you take the camper off the back?
And then they just take the truck,
you know,

48
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.150
you probably couldn't another the bit,
well,
yeah,
you are.

49
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.640
You can't keep the care pro right here.

50
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.490
You're going to have to move that and he fucking you getting underneath it.

51
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.120
Like those old school guys that put the refrigerator's on their back and you've

52
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:11.770
got to fucking start traipsing down the street,
you know?

53
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.920
Then you set it up and then some dose with the house like me.
It's just like,
um,

54
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.380
have you seen the guy down the street with the camper?

55
00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:22.940
I don't want that in my neighborhood.
Um,
anyways,

56
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.450
what I'm trying to say is I really enjoy time off.

57
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.030
I've been having a great time just hanging out with my daughter,

58
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.850
hanging with my wife,
threw down yesterday,
you know,

59
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.180
all the relatives came over,
everybody fucking April freckles.

60
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:42.290
I didn't go too hard.
It didn't go too hard.
I stayed away from the desserts,

61
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.970
you know,
I,
uh,
I did pretty good.

62
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.540
Then this morning I woke up,
I had my little parfait butter,
right?

63
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.160
I had the fucking,
uh,
you know,

64
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.440
a little bit of Greek yogurt with the fruit in there,

65
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.550
like the big fruitcake that I am.
And then I add a,

66
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.920
a little Hamas rep for lunch in between them having fruit with [inaudible],

67
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.010
you know,
it's holidays.
They get me this year,

68
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.750
finally figured it out after 50 fucking holidays,

69
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.360
finally figured it out.
Oh,
this is the problem.
I got to go.
Easy.

70
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.040
Go easy this Thanksgiving weekend.
All right.
I had my thanksgiving dinner,

71
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.110
I had it,
you know,
around three in the afternoon.

72
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.280
I was halfway through the plate and I was already leaning.
Oh,
it was good.
Oh,

73
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:30.560
it was delicious.
And um,
you know,
when you put your plate together,
I'm not,

74
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.440
what I hate those fucking people is I can't have my food touch other fed.

75
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.413
You know,

76
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.470
the only thing worse than the person saying that is the fucking meathead across

77
00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:44.310
the table.
Why is just all gonna be mixed up in your stomach,
right?

78
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:49.240
Both of those people should get in a car and drive off a cliff.
Now come on,
Bill.

79
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.970
You should give thanks for both of them.
Anyways,
I don't give a fuck about that.

80
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:58.020
But I will say this,
when you put together your Thanksgiving plate,

81
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.700
this is how it has to,
this is how I do it.
All right?

82
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.440
About four o'clock,
you got your Turkey.
Okay,
three o'clock.

83
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.370
You got your potatoes.
That way you can put the gravy on both.
All right?

84
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.890
And then it at five o'clock,
you know,
you want your,

85
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.860
uh,
let me move those all up an hour.
I'd say five o'clock the Turkey,

86
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.840
four o'clock is the mashed potatoes.
Six o'clock is your cranberry sauce.

87
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.280
You know,

88
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.810
it gives it a little nice little sweet kick with the gravy and the Turkey.

89
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.900
Get your potatoes in.
That's good.
The fucking vegetable.

90
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.440
You know that somebody made that.
You just try to make them feel good,
you know?

91
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:37.650
Yeah.
That shit all goes up around 12 no,
that shit that you're going to be like,

92
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.390
fuck,
I still got two more mouthfuls of that.
All of that shits up talk,

93
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:45.180
that casserole thing that you fucking aunt makes,
you know,

94
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.760
make sure you get some cashflow.

95
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.480
You're sitting there with your fucking itchy sweater it right Dan.
Uh,

96
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.040
what do I got?
What else is left?
And you get whatever,

97
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.120
like the sweet shit I keep around,
you know,

98
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.170
that's around 11 o'clock so we made some yams or something like that.

99
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.820
Sweet potatoes to simple shit like that.

100
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.180
You put that up there and then you've got your bread somewhere around eight 39

101
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.150
o'clock.
You know what I mean?
And then right in the middle,

102
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.890
I don't know what else.
That's some of the fucking thing.

103
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:17.480
You just stick right in the middle.
Ah,
and then you just,

104
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.960
you just,
you eat it.
Like the way your tune,
a snare drum,

105
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.720
any drum is out there.
If you know the,
the whatever,

106
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:30.390
there's a million different patterns,
but that's basically the way you do it.
Um,

107
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.480
and I want to just take some time here to say how bad I feel for people who

108
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:40.160
don't live in the United States of America.
So you don't have this holiday.
Well,

109
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.920
you can sit down and eat way more than your fucking chair.
Um,
oh,

110
00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:48.610
it's great.
Thanks Kim.
It's fucking awesome and kiss.
You know why?

111
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.600
Cause you got the Friday off to just lay around,
you know,

112
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.900
with the belly poking out of the bottom of your fucking sweater that you passed

113
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:59.200
out in.
You know,
um,

114
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.750
I actually,
you know,
I actually,
uh,

115
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.320
was had to like,
I'm one of these lunatics,
so I'm just like,
I try to like,

116
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:11.200
make sure everything fucking gets on the table.
It's all hot.
It's already to go.

117
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.140
And I finally realized this year,
it's just like,

118
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.950
there's just too many fucking people cooking.

119
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.440
It's just going to come the way it goes or whatever.

120
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.450
And then I realized anything that needs to be hot,
you just put gravy on it.

121
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:21.760
It's gonna fucking heat it up again.

122
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.920
And it was probably the best thanksgiving I've had in years.

123
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.420
But what's great is the Friday after the Friday after like today,

124
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.420
you don't have to go to work.
Hopefully,
you know,
you get to lounge around,

125
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.460
you know,
bleary-eyed from whatever the fuck you did the night before.

126
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.510
And then tomorrow you got all the college football games.
What do we got?

127
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.790
What do we got tomorrow?
Come on people.
You got Michigan,

128
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.380
Ohio state to kick off today.
You got Alabama versus,

129
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.810
and watch a five minute can be a good game this year.
But you know,
who knows?

130
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:57.280
If Auburn wins that,
I mean Jesus Christ,
they,
they'd be going fucking nuts.

131
00:07:57.281 --> 00:07:58.720
I mean,
tomorrow is the day.

132
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.790
You're not a man tomorrow unless you're ignoring your family.
Okay?

133
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:08.170
That's the level of football.
It's,
I'm kidding.
But I got my kid.

134
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:12.550
You heard my Kiddo,
she says,
now she goes full Paul foot.

135
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.750
Paul.
Now she wants,
now she wants it to be on the TV.
I'm fucking,

136
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.030
I'm steering her away from,
uh,

137
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.490
she always wants to see a Minnie mouse.
He goes,
Mimi,
Mau.

138
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.360
Mimi Mau.
Sounds like she's in a Mimi.
Mao Meaning Mao.
Like,
what's that?

139
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.550
What's it?
The deer hunter.
Mau.
Mau,
right.
Mimi.
Mimi.
Wow.

140
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.320
No,
Minnie mouse went to sleep.
Me,
me bow.
Um,

141
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.800
have I lost my mind?
What the fuck am I talking about?
I don't know.

142
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.880
I have no idea.
How much time have I done?
Eight minutes and 45 seconds.

143
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:49.830
Jesus Christ.
Some days,
you know,

144
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.220
this podcast flies by and then other than days feels like I did eight and 45

145
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.760
minutes.
Um,
yeah,
Michigan,
Ohio State,

146
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.490
Michigan.
They got to get it done.

147
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.350
I can't believe this is already the fifth fucking time they've played Ohio
state.

148
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.520
Which Jim Harba.
Unless I'm wrong,
I have no idea.

149
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.480
Um,
but it's going to be a great game.
I like big 10 footballs,
you know,

150
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.840
it's old school football.
You know,
they actually run the fucking ball.

151
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.980
I got to tell you that shit,
and I don't want to be a grumpy old man here.

152
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.950
Um,
that fucking game Monday night,

153
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.500
Kansas City versus the rams.
The amount of people that were freaking out though,

154
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.740
<v 3>I believe we came from.
Yeah,</v>

155
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.230
<v 0>that game was a shit show that came remind me of the Superbowl last year.</v>

156
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.620
And I think that that's basically the direction NFL football is going in,

157
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.240
whether it's just going to be no fucking defense in my favorite thing about me

158
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.500
saying there's no defense.

159
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.140
<v 3>The people that you do with three defense scores.</v>

160
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.133
<v 0>MMM,</v>

161
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.400
<v 2>okay.</v>

162
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.390
<v 0>Yeah.
That's just like,
let's just like last year,
last June,
the should,
excuse me,</v>

163
00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:07.150
there was a fumble that won the fucking game.
It's like

164
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.280
the fucking rams gave up almost 500 yards fucking passing.

165
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.880
There was almost a thought in six touchdowns.
The Guy,

166
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.390
two foot six touchdowns and fucking 500 fucking yards.

167
00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:23.200
Basically there was a total like 10 passing touchdowns.

168
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.880
It was over almost a thousand yards.

169
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.720
I think they went over a thousand yards combined.
It was a fucking joke.

170
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.330
And then everybody say to me like,
Oh bill,
you don't what you're talking about,

171
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.210
you're just worried about your patriots.
Which is hilarious.

172
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:38.270
My patriots had been thriving during this era.

173
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.510
We haven't had a fucking defense since 2004.

174
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.620
I liked that when the game 20 to 17 defense we have,

175
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.430
we've had to fucking score like 35 fucking points to win Goddamn game since

176
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.140
forever.
Um,

177
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.400
I'm just saying like if you're going to sit there and act like this is just me

178
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.760
to,
Richard Sherman was tweeting about it.
Another guy on the uh,
uh,

179
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.140
fucking Texans,

180
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.190
even Teddy Bruschi actually I actually saved his,

181
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:10.080
I did a screen shot of what he,
he basically said the way the game is now,

182
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.640
Richard Sherman is like,
all they all,

183
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:16.641
they want to see his points because what that does is that gets the casual fan

184
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:20.550
and the people that don't understand football,
who said don't fool.

185
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.760
I mean,
that's what to be honest with you.
If,

186
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.640
if soccer ever wanted to make it into America,

187
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.600
they should be doing what at the NFL has done to their game,
which is just,

188
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.380
I don't know what they just took.
Think about it.
Every era,
right?

189
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:35.850
There's been a Jack Lambert,

190
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.180
then there was with l Lawrence Taylor.
I'm just picking some of the guys I can,

191
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.440
I can off the top of my head,
uh,
a ray Lewis,

192
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.160
you know Ronnie lots,
Mike Haynes,
less day.

193
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.520
Hayes fucking lunatic.
You know Andre Tip,

194
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.480
it's just lights up Bruce Smith's like,
where are those guys now?

195
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.780
This like maybe three of them and then not putting up the fucking stats those

196
00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:08.140
guys used to put up.
You know,
they just,
I don't know.

197
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.720
These reverse island,
there's just not that guy anymore.
They can't,
they can't,

198
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:16.830
like those guys wouldn't be that guy today.
All right.

199
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:19.660
They'll shut the fuck up.
No,
but I'm just,
I'm just fucking saying.
All right.

200
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.910
All right.
His,
his,
his Teddy Bruschi.
Welcome to the new NFL.

201
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.940
When it comes to defensive football,
former linebacker,

202
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.260
teddy Bruschi wrote on Twitter or offense will move the ball in score.

203
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.900
That's it.
They're going to move the ball and score.

204
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.240
You can't do anything about it.
He goes,

205
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.480
make a handful of plays a game to take the ball away and get your offense.

206
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:46.230
A couple of extra possessions.
Score on defense is an a plus.

207
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.840
It hurts to write that.
All right,

208
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.660
so are you fantasy football play in fucking guy.

209
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.360
If you're going to fucking sit there and say I'm wrong about this,

210
00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:59.190
then you're saying Teddy Bruschi is wrong.
Um,
I hate it.

211
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.740
I hate it.
I hate everything that they'd done.

212
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.300
I hate that there's no two line pass and hockey anymore.
I hate that.

213
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:13.860
It's just the stretch passes up and down the fucking rink.
Um,

214
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.110
it's just,
everything's like turn,
you know,

215
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.500
and I think it's probably cause it's like smart phones and everybody's fucking

216
00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:22.290
looking at all the videos that you need to sit there.
Like a fucking,

217
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.740
I don't know,
a journal that forgot it's jacket.

218
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.580
I'm trying to think of some animal that shakes.
I don't know,
but don't,

219
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.060
don't listen to me.
I'm just saying,
um,

220
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.820
do that.
Fucking my home's guy is a fucking star.
All right?
But you know,

221
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.360
they both look like Dan Marino
that night.
Okay.

222
00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:46.361
And there's only one fucking Dan Marino that looked like Dan Marino,

223
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.310
verse fucking Dan Fouts way back in the day.
And those two guys,
I mean,

224
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:54.050
I'm not saying they want to eventually be there,

225
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:58.910
but like I can't imagine what Marino and Dan Fouts would've done to those in,

226
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.000
in today's era.
You know,
they threw for four,
400 yards,

227
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:04.960
a fucking game,
three,

228
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:08.410
400 yards a fucking game back when you could actually cover a receiver.

229
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.260
Borderline beat the shit out of him as he's going down.

230
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.240
You could fuck up a quarterback,

231
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.660
you could sack a quarterback and then like,

232
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.800
actually they'd lose yardage rather than the team with the core of the offense.

233
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.730
You know,
getting a first down,
cause you're tackled the guy too fucking hard.

234
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.090
I don't like it.
I don't like it.
It's fucking sissy football.

235
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.620
You know,
it just,
you know,
I get it,
I get it.
People get fucking hurt.
But,
um,

236
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.813
<v 4>I dunno,</v>

237
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.000
<v 0>just listen to those fucking announces gonna lose or did it the hardest board</v>

238
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.970
[inaudible] and then not even addressing the level that the game has changed

239
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.920
at whatever.
It's a fucking show.
It's a goddamn show.

240
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:56.150
And I'm an old man and I said,
what?
I said,
I'm just going to go to like,

241
00:14:56.151 --> 00:15:00.200
I don't know,
I'm going to fucking,
let's start watching rugby or something.

242
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.200
Something with a guy with the ball is going to get fucking tackled.

243
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.460
I would love to do a podcast and interview some great defensive players and just

244
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:15.620
see what they're thinking about this shit.
Um,

245
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.140
and how they think that they would do.
It's changed that much.

246
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:22.820
But like I said,
there's always,
you know,

247
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.880
the older generation never likes the new,
the new shit,

248
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.300
but you got guys now who literally are still playing in the league tweeting

249
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.520
saying it's fucked up.
So I want to think that I'm right.

250
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.420
But whenever I talk like this,
I always,
there was at NFL films,

251
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:39.800
if anybody can find the clip,
please tweet it to me.
There was this guy,
you know,

252
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:41.180
he was this old school.

253
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.500
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.540
<v 0>You know,
middle linebacker or something like that.</v>

255
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.420
It's like back during the Sam huff days and they asked him a,

256
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.550
Hey,
what do you think about some of the kids playing football today?

257
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:57.440
And he just goes,
Eh,
you wouldn't watch your foot [inaudible] gave you fee.

258
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.790
You almost fucking had a stroke.

259
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.190
So maybe I'm doing that,
but I just,

260
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.120
baseball is still fucking baseball man.
So you got,
you know,

261
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.490
you still got to fucking hit it over the fence.

262
00:16:11.491 --> 00:16:16.200
They got rid of the roids I think,
I don't know.
But like,

263
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.150
uh,
the NBA,
it's like nobody's allowed to stand underneath,
even on defense.

264
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.980
You gotta get the fuck out of there were just,

265
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.910
I dunno guys go in,

266
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.920
they start driving from the three point line and people would just get in the

267
00:16:31.921 --> 00:16:32.640
fuck out of them.

268
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.030
I love when the guy goes up to dunk and the guy thinks about blocking it and

269
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:37.350
he's like,
oh,
I don't end up on Instagram.

270
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:42.350
And he tries to kind of duck out of the picture and then the bench goes nuts and

271
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.930
they're waving towels at,
at a,
at an uncontested dunk.

272
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.930
Um,
am I done complaining?
I think I am.

273
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.150
I think I am.

279
00:17:17.101 --> 00:17:19.470
Gary Gulman,
Jim Gaffigan,
Michelle Wolf,

280
00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:24.000
Rich Vos and yours truly with more names to be announced.

281
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.050
Um,
we're waiting for people's availabilities and that type of stuff.
Like,

282
00:17:28.051 --> 00:17:31.740
you know,
obviously,
uh,
comics working for free,

283
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.230
giving up their free time so people are trying to work it out with their

284
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:39.180
schedules.
But,
uh,
just an overwhelming response.
Thank you guys.
So,
so much.

285
00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:41.580
Like I said,
it's the best thing that I do all year.

286
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.000
It's been helping his family incredibly.
So thank you so much for that.

287
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.710
And with that,
the old ball,
the old freckles,

288
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:52.740
he a word he used to be.
Um,

289
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.720
I miss a lights out.
Defensive.
Huh?
That's all I'm saying.

290
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.930
Remember the fucking doomsday defense against the steel curtain.

291
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.910
You know the no name defense.
The over the hill gang,

292
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:07.350
the sack exchange,

293
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.120
the 46 defense and for how much fun was it to watch the fucking bears that year

294
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.380
with Wilbur,
Gary Fensick,

295
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.060
Mike Singletary,
Richard Dent.
I mean they,
they were family.

296
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:27.070
They were fucking unbelievable lights fucking out defense.

297
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.540
I don't know why people don't like watching that.
You know,

298
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.050
a hype like a high powered offense against a great defense.

299
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.650
Watch that chess mess instead of having just like fucking

300
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.443
free for all.

301
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.190
I felt like I was watching somebody play like one of those bar games.

302
00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:46.780
You know those people,
when they throw the basket,

303
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.650
the basket ball into the basket and those people get so good they can use either

304
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:54.120
either hand.
That's the way they were fucking scoring.
We get it bill.
All right.

305
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.660
He likes everybody.

306
00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.130
You ever wake up in the morning with regrets of what you'd done,

307
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.000
replaying the terrible decisions you made the previous night over and over and

308
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:07.750
over.
Is this my inner voice?
The kicking,
sweating,
yelling,

309
00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:11.230
or whatever else you did to piss everyone in the bedroom off.
Well,
guess what?

310
00:19:11.231 --> 00:19:15.010
But deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.

311
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.800
Uh,
buying a book a but bill,
buying a mattress is so high.
Where would I begin?

312
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.970
There are literally writing this for me.
Um,
well you're in luck buddy,

313
00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:26.290
because helix sleep,

314
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:31.291

315
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:33.360
your life.
Just go to hell.

316
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.360
[inaudible] dot com slash bird take their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll

317
00:19:37.361 --> 00:19:40.750
match you to the perfect mattress.
I can't even fucking,

318
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.750
how big do I have to make the print?
I'm one of those guys.

319
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:44.920
I'm never getting glasses.

320
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.400
I think glasses a full fucking weak people

321
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.620
or people that have strong enough to admit that they have a problem.

322
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.870
I don't know where I am on that side of the fence.

323
00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:59.140
I don't know if I'm a hero or if I'm a coward.
Um,

324
00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.450
it's like Tinder for finding a mattress.

325
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.510
I just said in the large it all the fun with na,

326
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.360
with none of the next morning regrets and misery.

I am not getting glasses.

333
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:37.820
I'm just going to wait someday when there's an affordable robot.

334
00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:42.080
I'll just have that can fucking read from me.
How vulnerable at will I be.

335
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.940
Yeah.
Did you see that?
Could,
you know,

336
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.530
cause the thing will be fucking smarter than I am.
And then I also,

337
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:50.770
I can't see how soon before that thing fucking brains meet with something in the

338
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.980
kitchen.
Do you guys see that commercial?

339
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.270
I think it's for sprint.
You know where that guy who sold out,

340
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.710
it used to be with Verizon,
you know,
and then they fired him and then he fucking,

341
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:07.300
you know,
he's like the Henry Hill of fucking wireless service.
The fucking,

342
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.950
you know,
a jumps over with sprint.
So they're doing this,

343
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.601
this thing with,

344
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:15.790
this lady's going to take a picture and she's just talking about how clear it is

345
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.350
and it's three people in a fucking robot for whatever reason.

346
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:21.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

347
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.670
<v 0>And The lady is,</v>

348
00:21:22.671 --> 00:21:27.260
so the lady taking the picture is so fucking blown away by how clear the screen

349
00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:31.160
is.
She just keeps commenting on it and she's not taking the picture and all the

350
00:21:31.161 --> 00:21:34.220
people that smile and going,
okay,
yeah,
it's great.
Great.
And so he goes,

351
00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:36.140
I can't hold my smile much longer than the other guy goes.

352
00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:39.200
I can't all my smile either.
And the robot goes,

353
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.890
I can right there.

354
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.740
You see everything that just fucking happened in that commercial.

355
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

356
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.780
<v 0>They made having a robot seem fuck the normal to the point.</v>

357
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.760
You're taking a family fucking photo with it in front of the Grand Canyon.
Okay.

358
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:59.990
And then the human beings are in in their own way or admitting that they're not,

359
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.920
they're not as good as the robot.
That getting it in your fucking head,

360
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.300
that these things are are just normal and they should be in your fucking life

361
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.460
and that you're not worthy.

362
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.450
You know that fucking trader from Pr,
Verizon,
if you wanted to redeem himself,

363
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.000
should have grabbed that fucking robot and thrown him right off the class.

364
00:22:20.001 --> 00:22:24.680
All I'm saying,
that's how I liked.
That's all I would have liked it to end,

365
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.340
but I know that that's,
that's in,
that's in a perfect world.
All right.

366
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:32.040
Legal Zoom,
everybody.
Um,

367
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:37.100
evidently this podcast is brought to you by legalzoom.com and the number four.

368
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.520
You know,
the saying time is money.
It's true,

369
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.110
especially when you run your own business.

370
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:48.670
But running a successful business involves taxes,
contracts,

371
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:49.540
hush money,

372
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.560
and a whole lot of fine print things that eat up too much of your time.
Well,

373
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.860
it's time to turn to legals.
Up over the last 17 years,

374
00:22:56.861 --> 00:23:01.660
more than a million Americans have used legal zoom to help launch their
business,

375
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.140
says businesses.
It is,
but that's only the beginning.

376
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:09.580
Legal Zoom has a network of independent attorneys.
These guys went rogue man.

377
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.540
They're independent and tax professionals who can provide you with advice.

378
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:17.950
You need to get through the daily grind of running your own business.

379
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:20.890

Since legalzoom isn't a law firm,

381
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.580
I don't get another,
not a law for me.
You can take fucking legal advice for them.

382
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.310

383

they were proud of that scene where life meets legal.
I liked it.</v>

392
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:08.050
Alliteration.
It's quick.
It's a succinct,
it's the sink.
It's succulent.
Um,

393
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.780
anyways,
so,
uh,

394
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.260
I dunno what to name this podcast,
but I,
you know Billy,

395
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:18.350
it didn't have his cranberry juice.
Diddy,
Huh?
Well,

396
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:21.530
Billy's been on the rig here about all the sports.

397
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.900
I just want a little bit of defense.
That's all bill for fuck six.
Okay.
It's over.

398
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.750
Okay.
No more defense.

399
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.290
You can't take your dick out at work and,
and uh,

400
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:35.600
I don't know what else and it's called climate change.
I get it.

401
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.580
Things are changing.
I'm getting older.
Things are changing.
Um,

402
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.550
anyway,
so I'm having some people over.

403
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:45.980
I invited all these fucking people to come over my house,

404
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.000
not realizing that the Osu fucking Michigan game,

405
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.930
it starts at 9:00 AM Pacific standard time.

406
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:56.780
So kinda changes the menu.

407
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.090
I guess there'll be making some uh,
breakfast burritos over there.
Um,

408
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.970
Jesus Christ,
I hope fucking Michigan wins it this year.

409
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:06.980
They said that it has to become a rivalry again.

410
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.620
I wonder what they are all time.
I think Michigan had them and then,

411
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.850
and now they just,
deft at Ohio state has gone on such a run.

412
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.620
I would say that they caught up and passed him.
Oh,
s you come on,
you can't.

413
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.910
O s u verse Michigan's.
Anybody watching that kid down there at Duke?

414
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.330
Jesus Christ that Manchild uh,

415
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.310
Osu verse Michigan Record.

416
00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:37.330
Here we go.
Maybe that's the one all time.

417
00:25:37.331 --> 00:25:39.340
Michigan football rivalry.

418
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.470
Doodah Doodah all right,
let's see.
Early years,

419
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:48.490
the snow bowl and woody Hayes,
God know something crazy app.

420
00:25:48.491 --> 00:25:51.610
Anytime I think I'm angry.
I just watched Woody Hayes highlights.
I'm like,

I was a kid on the team.
He grabbed me.

427
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:16.090
You know the guy wanted to win Michigan verse.

435
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.850
All right,
let's,
let's just look over the last few years.
All right.

436
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.700
Michigan is not one since 2011
all right.

437
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.020
Oh,
well she was one,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six years in a row

438
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.570
and they've won seven,
eight,

439
00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:15.571
91011121313 of the last 14 fucking years.

440
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:23.690
Jesus Christ.
MMM.

441
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.040
Wait a minute.
1998 Osu one.
Get the fuck Outta here.

442
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.680
Am I reading this right?

443
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.870
I'm not reading this right.
Am I?
Oh,
that's ranking.

444
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.430
How fucking difficult can this be?
Oh No,
no.
I'm reading it right.
Okay.
Sorry.

445
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.380
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys still listening to this?

446
00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:51.420
I don't know why people listen to this fucking podcast.

447
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:54.240
This has gotta be most unprofessional thing.
Ebo

448
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.560
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

449
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.110
<v 0>I know.
I thought I went in 1999 I went to,
um,</v>

450
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.560
Ohio state versus Michigan,
but Tom Brady played that game,
so I wasn't,

451
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:09.561
I went to the one in 1998 was it 97 cause Michigan won the year I went,

452
00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:14.540
did I go and 90 maybe?
I went in [inaudible] 97.

453
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.580
I don't fucking remember all the 1990s Michigan,
Michigan.
It was a tie.
Michigan,

454
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.540
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Osu,
Michigan.

455
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.280
Decade before eighties,
starting in 1980 when Michigan,
Ohio state,

456
00:28:33.281 --> 00:28:37.270
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Ohio state,
Michigan,
Michigan.

457
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:43.620
Let's see,
the 70s,
the 10 year war,
Ohio State,
Michigan,
Ohio state tie,
Ohio state,

458
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:47.280
Ohio state,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Michigan,
Ohio state.
So wait a second,

459
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.470
I have statement one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
Michigan,
one,

460
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.190
two,
three,
four.
Then the tie.
All right.

461
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.380
Did they have the all time?
So what does he go whole time?

462
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.320
Michigan dominated the early years.
Compiling a 12.
Oh,

463
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.790
and to record in the non conference matchup.
Ah,

464
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.160
Jesus Christ.
The cost.
Small this fucking Prentice.
There's no fucking way.

465
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.870
All right,
now I gotta find this fucking thing.
This is like to the point,

466
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.620
am I forgetting that in podcasting right now?
Whatever.
So you guys,
you know,

467
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.860
he fucking,
millennials should probably go to look this up 58 fucking times.

468
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.110
I don't know.
I don't know how to figure out.
Oh,

469
00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:35.410
I took my daughter to Guitar Center for the first time,

470
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.130
the one on sunset boulevard,
the big one that they,
um,

471
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.720
they really did.
It was hilarious.
So I took a picture of me and my daughter,

472
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:44.231
right.
You know,

473
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:48.100
with the Guitar Center logo behind us and she was reaching for the camera,

474
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:51.610
but look like she was doing the rock star point right at the camera.

475
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.390
And I'm sitting there cheese and smiling next to us.

476
00:29:54.391 --> 00:29:59.110
So I look like I'm a fan of hers.
It's right now,

477
00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:00.850
it's my favorite fucking a,

478
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.620
it's my favorite Goddamn a picture that I have over.
Uh,
by the way,

479
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.900
thank you everybody that signed up to my,
for my,
uh,
Patrion page,
uh,

480
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.560
next week me and,
uh,
Joey roses,

481
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:16.030
the teen idol sensation from the opiod Anthony Program.
Um,

482
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.060
the late great opie and Anthony Program.
We'll be,
uh,

483
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.450
we'll be doing a couple more episodes of uninformed yelling at each other and

484
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.950
all that type of shit.
Uh,
I got the free time now and been fly the helicopter,

485
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.330
get some fucking video for you.

486
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:33.250
And we have exclusive footage from my short Madison Square Garden,

487
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.760
uh,
me doing the sound check saying I was going to kill.
I knew it.

488
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.980
I knew I was going to kill one of those nights.
You just could feel it.

489
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:44.990
And then in the end,
uh,
Andrew fucking walked all the way around on me,

490
00:30:44.991 --> 00:30:46.620
Joe and [inaudible] all saying goodnight.

491
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.650
It follows me all the way through the crowd,

492
00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:51.270
all the way into the back green room.

493
00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:54.600
And there was another big time comic there that I had no idea that they were

494
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.050
there,
captured that whole fucking conversation all.
So that's,

495
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.720
that's the direction my patrion page is going to go.

496
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.230
It's going to be a lot of personal shit like that.
Um,
that,
you know,

497
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.880
I don't mind putting out there for a few people.

498
00:31:05.881 --> 00:31:08.730
Try not to do it for a bunch of fucking,
you know,

499
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.210
I feel like I'll let you in enough with the earth by,
by.
Um,
all right,

500
00:31:12.211 --> 00:31:15.750
that's the fucking podcast.
Enjoy the music.

501
00:31:15.751 --> 00:31:18.150
And then there's going to be another half hour of,
um,

502
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.510
content from a Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

503
00:31:21.511 --> 00:31:25.410
Monday morning podcasts from,
I dunno,
earlier this year or 10 years ago,

504
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:29.040
whenever the fuck I started doing these things.
Uh,
I'm calling from Michigan.

505
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:33.360
I respect Ohio state.
I just wanted it to be a rivalry again.
You know,

506
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.110
I'd like to see Jim Harbaugh,
you know,
at this point,
I mean,

507
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:40.090
when was the last time his wife had a good Christmas?
I mean,

508
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:44.830
come on [inaudible] the guy's got a wind here,
you know,
I would think even,

509
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.040
even,
even when they do win,
you still gotta be like,

510
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:51.590
you know when he's around the house,
wait Jimmy,
Jimmy's relax.
Okay.
Just,
you know,

511
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.330
<v 4>okay,</v>

512
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.060
<v 0>it's breakfast.
You don't have to have some toast.</v>

513
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.200
Where do I get off calling anybody else a fucking lunatic.
Oh,

514
00:32:03.201 --> 00:32:05.630
you know what I love and went to the heart doctor and my heart looks great.

515
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:08.380
So right now my chest pains.
I know that's just fucking into gestured.

516
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.450
What would you do if I fucking killed over right now?
You know it is.

517
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:15.040
I eat too fast.
All right,

518
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:18.190
now I want all you guys who aren't doctors out there right now,
but then tell me,

519
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.430
you know the dangers of fucking there.
What about this fucking jerk off?

520
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:25.660
Who goes to that Goddamn island in the middle of nowhere and gets his dumb ass

521
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:28.360
killed?
He fucking went there at one time.
He gets shot.

522
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.900
What the bunch of fucking arrows and then Lee,
then he fucking comes back again.

523
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:38.410
Only somebody like who's delusional with religion can be that fucking stupid.

524
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.980
Yeah.
To go over.
I mean,
what the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

525
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.751
Jesus Christ.

526
00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:49.390
You know what I love too is everybody assumed it was a fucking white guy,

527
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.920
myself included.
I am,
I guess this dad where you go.
That's what the fuck we do.

528
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.180
Okay.
Hey,
don't go over there.
You could get killed.

529
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.290
<v 7>Oh yeah.
Well why don't we go check it out.</v>

530
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.230
<v 0>I think the dude was Asian American.
I hate that he lost his life.</v>

531
00:33:04.231 --> 00:33:08.790
But I am psyched that for once somebody did some dumb white guy shit,

532
00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.310
and it wasn't a dumb white guy.
All right.

533
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.690
Dumb white guys finished in November strong.
Um,

534
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.170
I always wonder what my neighbors think when I Yell Shit like that.
Yeah.

535
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.760
I can't tell if he's,
if he's gone crazy is his wife and trouble.

536
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.620
We don't know.
Oh,
by the way,

537
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.310
a massively positive feedback of Nia reading the questions.

538
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.730
So,
oh my God,

539
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.770
my fucking daughter gave me shit for the first time ever in front of everybody

540
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.230
at Thanksgiving,
at the Thanksgiving dinner table,

541
00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:44.350
she's sitting there and she was being all whining and everything,
you know,

542
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:47.360
demanding all of this stuff.
I go,
good Lord.
I go,
what are you doing over there?

543
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.600
What are you,
what are you the boss,
baby?
And she looks at me,
she goes,

544
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.950
you're in a bought baby.

545
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.910
And did the whole table was it was like when spider goes,
yeah,

546
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.000
why don't you go fuck yourself,
Tommy?
Everybody just went like,
oh shit.

547
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:00.740
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

548
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.650
<v 0>And I was looking at Nia going like,
did she just say that?</v>

549
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.830
Did she say you're the boss baby?
Or She just mumbled something.
It's,

550
00:34:07.831 --> 00:34:12.440
I know she can say,
boss,
baby,
but you in your box,
baby.
I was just like,
Jesus,
God.

551
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:18.070
And now we've entered this chapter.
Um,
anyways.
All right,
that,
that's it.

552
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:21.000
Everybody hope you had a lovely thanksgiving.
Uh,

553
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.370
don't be afraid to go for a walk.

554
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.820
Go for a walk and have some fruit and vegetables.

555
00:34:24.821 --> 00:34:26.890
You don't have to fucking do that much damage this weekend.

556
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.460
You can still enjoy yourself,
but you know,
be,
don't be a fucking jerk.
All right.

557
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.990
Um,
I don't know what that meant.
Either.
Have a great weekend.

559
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.340

564
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.780
[inaudible] dad fucking

565
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.083
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

566
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.500
<v 9>but don't be a Douche and say I can't eat the stuffing cause it was then uh,</v>

567
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.433
Burger

568
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.950
<v 0>friends.
We hear it.
The Monday morning podcast,
one to</v>

569
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.580
<v 10>a very happy and healthy thanksgiving wish to each and every one of you.</v>

570
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.590
And we would also like it if you took time to think of those who are a little

571
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:57.960
less fortunate.
That's the only fucking thing I hate about this holiday,

572
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.530
right?

573
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.530
This is such a great fucking holiday in that there is no corporate bullshit.

574
00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.120
All right?
They can't get you.
You don't,
you can't,

575
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.090
you don't have to go out and go buy anybody anything.

576
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.400
Everybody just makes something to eat.

577
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.200
You go over somebody's house and you fucking throw down and I don't know how,

578
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.620
but for some reason this unbelievable holiday has as remained like corporate

579
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:26.611
free.

580
00:36:26.611 --> 00:36:31.611
Like they can't figure out how the fuck to get you to buy something on a day

581
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:37.140
when it's all about feeding your fucking face other than food obviously.

582
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.960
But you know what I mean?
They haven't figured out a way to be like,

583
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.680
is this the year you stick the ring in the yams?

584
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.520
Buy Her a car on Thanksgiving.
You know,

585
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.310
God knows it would be all about the fucking broads,
right?

586
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.470
The fuck are you going to get hurt?
Some sort of,
what are you gonna get out?

587
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.200
One of the,
one of those,
one of those buzzer rings.

588
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:03.000
How to make your friends laugh around the water bubbler that stunk.

589
00:37:03.001 --> 00:37:05.850
That was a bad example.
You know why?
Cause I have no fucking example.

590
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.040
Because basically when you're a man,

591
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:13.130
you stop getting good gifts past the age of 12 once you're too old for toys,

592
00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:18.570
that's it.
You get close,
you get bullshit right in the fucking broad.

593
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:19.710
Sit there.
Hey,
what?

594
00:37:19.711 --> 00:37:24.630
This shiny thing that caught it only costs six weeks a year.
Pay.

595
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.000
Really?
Why don't you take this fucking piece of calls,

596
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:32.010
stick it up your Hoohah and see what happens.
Is six weeks.

597
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:36.660
If it's shiny sticker on your finger,
if it hasn't shut it,
you're fuss ticket,

598
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.240
you're fucking pie hole.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Sorry.

599
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.230
This is supposed to be about giving thanks now.
So I love this fucking holiday.

600
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.280
You know,
I like to eat.
Hey,
who doesn't?
Right.

601
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.150
But every time they have to still fucking ruin it.
One of these,

602
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.140
these network Douche bags during the Macy's Day parade,

603
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:58.440
when they sit in there with their network,
ear muffs and gloves on,

604
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.190
right with the fucking McGraff trench coat,

605
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.030
they always have to say,
you know,
thanksgiving,
that's hilarious.

606
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.690
Let's have it year and blah blah,
blah.
All this shit you're ready to throw down.

607
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:14.400
And then they got to go at the last second be like,
but what about Haiti?

608
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.300
And then they get to show a bunch of fucking earthquake victims are still

609
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:21.390
trapped under a swing set.
You know,
it's like,
can you just,

610
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.470
can I just have one holiday off?
Can I do that?
So I'm not,

611
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.110
while I'm doing to do is I'm going to watch the fucking football.

612
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.940
Did that make sense?
Um,
anyways.

613
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:37.600
Hey am I the only guy who gets creeped out by that fucking eight legged Turkey

614
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:41.320
John Madden has every year?
Did he stop doing that because he's retired now?

615
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.570
I that was always something a little wrong about that.

616
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.880
Or maybe there was a little bit of foreshadowing of what manmade turkeys are

617
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.720
going to look like in a few years.
Right?
I mean,
they already do that with,

618
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.880
with the chickens,
don't they?
People Lock Wide Meat,
right?

619
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.620
So they gave him fucking steroids and now they can't even walk because they're a

620
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.210
tipping them over.
Do you guys see Food Inc?

621
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.970
It's just see that,
oh God,
this podcast started off with such promise out of,

622
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.850
you know where I am and it right now.
Um,
anyways,

623
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.240
this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday.
Here we go.

624
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.950
Let's get back to some familiar ground here.

625
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:22.330
Let's get back to what I say every week.
Uh,
for Monday,
November 22nd.

626
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.010
Wait a minute.
November 22nd,
this is a,

627
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:30.400
a important day in the history of America.

628
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:36.070
This is a,
what is this?
This is the 1963.

629
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:41.850
This is the 47th anniversary of the whacking of President John F.

630
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.740
Kennedy.
Right.

631
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.070
Cause he was the first guy who started printing money outside the Federal

632
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.660
Reserve,
printed out some fucking coins and they weren't having that shit.

633
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.700
So they fucking whacked him in Dallas.

634
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.630
And then to send a message to every fucking president who came after him,

635
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.310
they put his head on the fucking silver dollar,
you know,
not in honor of him.

636
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.050
That's the Federal Reserve's way.

637
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.780
It's like when you shoot a deer and you put its head on the wall,

638
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.180
that's what the Federal Reserve does.
When you fuck with them,

639
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.720
they blow your brains out and then they stick your head on a coin,

640
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.580
you know?
But if you play by the fucking rules,
they stick you on some paper.

641
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.840
That's how it works.
That's my theory.
And I'm,

642
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.140
I'm going with that.
Yeah.
47 years ago to this day,

643
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.530
and they haven't changed anything in Dealey Plaza in Dallas.

644
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.040
If you ever go there and you want to see the creepiest tourist attraction of all

645
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:37.420
time,
they have not even changed a post office box.
You walk there,

646
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:41.410
it's like stepping back in time.
You can walk around with audio.

647
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.580
I know I've talked about this before,
but for,
uh,
for uh,

648
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:48.970
all the mates over there and fucking England down in Australia.

649
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.340
Where else?
Where else do I have to give shout outs to Ireland,
Scotland,
Sweden.

650
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.890
All the places I've played over there.
I'm actually,

651
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:02.380
it was actually talking to my booker,
uh,
my booking agent.
Um,

652
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.450
last week I'm putting together another Europe run for 2011.

653
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.850
All right.
You fucking cunts.
Uh,
going to be another London,
Dublin,

654
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.260
Glasgow,
Stockholm,
Sweden.
Maybe I can do with Scandinavian run over there.

655
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.800
You know,
upgrade is my fucking life.
All right.

656
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.790
And for all you European outcasts down under,

657
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.530
ah,

658
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.190
we're also working on Australia and I know I promised yours come in there in the

659
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:33.440
fall.
I don't know what the fuck happened,
but um,

660
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.670
what are you going to do?
You know,
if you guys have plenty to do down there,

661
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:41.410
right?
ACDC,
uh,

662
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.280
that go through the phone at those people,

663
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.950
Nicole Kidman and are angry forehead and a Justin Bieber,
Justin Bieber.

664
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.980
Justin Bieber is arguably the biggest star to come out of Australia since,

665
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.420
uh,
said that guy through the phone that I could never remember his fucking name.

666
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.940
Michael stray hand by the way was a football player is trying to remember and
uh,

667
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.940
just to be a cunt,

668
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.830
I said Justin Bieber was from Australia and if you actually got upset and

669
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:14.810
started screaming at whatever the fuck you're listening to this podcast on right

670
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:17.870
now,
and you actually know where the fuck the persons from,
you know,

671
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.900
what does that say about you?
You know,

672
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.840
I'm sick of them talking about the Justin Bieber haircut.

673
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:27.410
Mick Jagger had that fucking haircut on the fucking Ed Sullivan Show,

674
00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.860
you know,
back then when he wore ties.

675
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.660
All right,
what the fuck is going on here?

676
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.440
My brain right now is thinking about making up like fucking diff,

677
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.490
12 different categories so I don't have to talk about the same shit to get a

678
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:47.840
little stale.
It's getting a little stale for me.
Um,
yeah,

679
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:49.100
that's something I wanted to talk about.

680
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:54.050
Let's talk about fucking a front men in rock music.

681
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.880
The Best Front men of all time.
Recently I've gone on this,

682
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:03.881
this insane rolling stone old school kick where uh,

683
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:09.020
I finally downloaded,
uh,
get your Yaya is out there,

684
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:13.720
live concert from uh,
uh,
Madison Square Gardens.

685
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.020
Fucking unbelievable.

686
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.280
Then I was on the road when I was in Columbus and I bought another one just

687
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:20.450
called ladies and gentlemen,

688
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:23.840
the rolling stones and they're playing somewhere in Texas.

689
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:29.550
It's just fucking unreal how unbelievable those guys are as a live band.

690
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.930
And I was watching Mick Jagger and I started thinking,

691
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.930
cause I always left him out of the equation when I was thinking,
you know,

692
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.310
best front men of all time and I might have to give it to him.

693
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.680
All right.
You know,
I always argue Brady,
Peyton Manning,
I think you know,

694
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:50.540
who do you,
who do you like better?
You like a Freddie Mercury or Mick Jagger.

695
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.813
Now,

696
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.940
Freddy Mercury is fucking unbelievable as far as how that dude seriously turn

697
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:02.450
Wembley stadium into like a coffee house and had like it just a sing along just

698
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:05.150
him and the crowd,
not even the fucking band.

699
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:10.600
He's like sitting down and chilling out like he's,
he's like,
he's in,

700
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.350
in his fucking living room.

701
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.400
I think as far as charisma and power of voice and just the ability to be five

702
00:44:19.851 --> 00:44:24.320
foot one 102 pounds and strut around the fucking stage and have everybody

703
00:44:24.321 --> 00:44:29.150
captivated.
I Dunno if you can beat Freddie Mercury,
but uh,

704
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:34.350
if anybody can,
I would,
I would put Mick Jagger right up there.

705
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:39.150
Go watch some of his lives.
Shit.
He sees fucking ridiculous.
How,
how,

706
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.330
what an amazing front man that guys,
he did rip off some shit.

707
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.350
I saw him when he was,
um,
what does that song,
uh,

708
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.370
the midnight Rambler,
you know,
you know the whole breakdown part where he's like,

709
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:54.520
well,
hey,
have you heard about up posted?

710
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.160
Blap all right,
well he dropped to his knees milking the moment,

711
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.390
which anybody who's watched music knows he stole that from James Brown.

712
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.340
And he also was doing some,
his version,
his fucking English version,
you know,

713
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.170
have those,
those little fucking,
you know,

714
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:13.560
the James Brown thing where you fucking somehow your feet aren't moving,

715
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:16.770
but they are moving,
but you're not taking steps and you're going side to side.

716
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:20.760
He steals a little bit of that.
Um,
but as far as white dudes go,

717
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.020
you know what I mean?
Uh,

718
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.440
I though those would be my top two and,
uh,

719
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.960
I would listen to either either side of those arguments.
So I'll bring them on.

720
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.590
I want to hear what you have to get,
what you have to say.
David Lee Roth,

721
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.930
you know,
as far as like heavy metal goes,
how do you find a guy,
you know,

722
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.370
Robert Plant,
although I gotta say Robert Plant,
you know,

723
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:47.180
the one thing that knocks him down a little bit is,
uh,

724
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.190
when he wasn't stealing lyrics from old blues guys,

725
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.670
he was singing about dungeons and dragons before it came out.

726
00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.580
So his shit,
I dunno if it,
uh,

727
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.940
if it holds it this certain certain bands,

728
00:46:02.941 --> 00:46:06.720
it's weird like the music holds up,
but sometimes the lyrics,

729
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.990
like I was listening to some old Metallica the other day and his fucking awesome

730
00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.500
as they are,
some of their old lyrics really has a Keanu Reeves,

731
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:19.350
you know,
flavor to it.

732
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.480
You know the thing that shouldn't be,
whoa,

733
00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.270
what's,
what does it seek and destroy?
It's all destruction.

734
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.100
It sounds like a 12 year old wrote it.

735
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.630
Am I really criticizing Metallica on a week when I should be giving thanks that

736
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:40.380
those guys fucking blew my eardrums out for 30 fucking years.
I'm sorry.

737
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.570
You know what?
This is my deal.

738
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:46.020
I figured out the other day I have taken 24 flights,

739
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.900
24 different flights.

740
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.820
This is the life of a touring comedian since the beginning of October.

741
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.730
I basically,
let's see,

742
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.500
I flew from La to Boston,
Boston to Minneapolis,

743
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.230
Minneapolis to Chicago,
Chicago to La.

744
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.640
Then I flew la to Chicago,
Chicago to Albany,

745
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.880
drove to buffalo and then I went buffalo,
Chicago,
Chicago,
la.

746
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.070
I've already lost count.
How many of those are La to St Louis,
St Louis,

747
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:24.360
La La to Dallas,
Dallas to Columbus,

748
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.640
Columbus to Dallas,
Dallas to la.

749
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:33.580
What the fuck did I go after that?
Oh,
in between there a fucking La to New York,

750
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.020
New York,
back to La.

751
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.580
And then this past weekend I went fucking La to Newark,

752
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:46.960
New Jersey.
Drove to Pennsylvania,
did a college Gig,

753
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.860
drove back to New York,
picked up Joe to Rosehill over there,

754
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.420
drove down to DC,
did a gig down there,
went to the airport,

755
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:58.630
got on a fucking puddle jumper,
flew to Hartford,

756
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.010
gotten a rent a car,
drove out to Fox woods,
did a gig there,

757
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.520
drove from Foxwoods back down in Newark,

758
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.230
got on a fucking plane and flew all the way to la.

759
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.410
I've done all of that since the first weekend

760
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.950
in New York.
And would you believe it?
I threw my fucking back out.

761
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.030
That's what ends up happening when you fly on planes and Shit and you just

762
00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.830
sitting there like you're on fucking punishment.
And I fucked up my,
I don't know,

763
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:29.380
my back got tight the other day.
I,
I uh,
I,

764
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.310
I threw out my back and it's still fucked up.

765
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.370
I don't know what the hell to do about it.
You know,

766
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.740
not only do I not know what to do about my back,

767
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.290
I don't know what to do about this podcast right now cause I don't know what

768
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:44.170
happened.
It was starting off great.
I sang you a little fucking song.

769
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:49.210
I put an echo effect on it.
Um,
you know what?
Let's,
let's talk.

770
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.820
Let's talk a little fucking NFL football.

771
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:55.390
I didn't watch any NFL football yesterday because I was traveling.

772
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.650
I missed it all.
I did sit down and I watched the Patriots,

773
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.230
the Patriots game,

774
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.530
and a lot of people sent me emails and they were anticipating that I was going

775
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.390
to trash Peyton manning.
All right?

776
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.230
And I think it's time I have to,
I have to two,
two fucking

777
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.940
reemphasized my mission statement.
All right.

778
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.210
Somewhere in all this shit defending Tom Brady,

779
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.120
people think that I hate Peyton manning the same way.

780
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:27.520
People really think that I fucking hate the jets.

781
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.610
I'm going to get to both of those.
All right.
Peyton Manning,

782
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:35.110
the Shit I gave him was how they were calling him the greatest QB of all time.

783
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.640
That's where I give them shit.

784
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.670
I give him shit about that and I give him shit about his performance,

785
00:49:39.671 --> 00:49:41.980
his play off record.
That's what I do.

786
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:45.580
But I don't think he sucks as a quarterback.

787
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.180
I just take offense when somebody says that he's the greatest quarterback of all

788
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:52.540
time and that Tom Brady always takes a fucking back seat to them.

789
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.220
That's what I don't like.
Despite Tom Brady's play off record.

790
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.800
Tom Brady's winning percentage is right there with Peyton.
Manny,
he's,

791
00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:07.040
he does better in the fucking playoffs and they're head to head match ups.
He's,

792
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:12.010
he's fucking killing the guy.
So,
but I,

793
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.000
you know,
I still understand that Peyton puts up these monster numbers,

794
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.731
but how about it?

795
00:50:16.731 --> 00:50:20.980
Every once in awhile you have a debate about Tom Brady and Peyton manning and

796
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:24.850
it's sort of like maybe six people like Peyton,

797
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:30.080
seven people like Tom Brady,
just,
you know,
50 50 maybe tips,
Tom Brady's way.

798
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:32.000
Every fucking once in a while just doesn't happen.

799
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:37.750
So yesterday the Patriots beat the colts or hung on to beat the cults,

800
00:50:37.911 --> 00:50:41.630
which is why I'm not going to talk shit.
All right.

801
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:45.410
Unlike these fucking jets fans who keep winning in the last seconds against

802
00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:49.630
fucking,
you know,
teams that aren't gonna make the playoffs.
Um,

803
00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.670
you know,
and then they start sending me emails,

804
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:55.160
like they just want to play off game,
which I really don't understand,

805
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.560
which I kind of get because they don't do well in the playoffs for my entire

806
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:03.620
life.
So I guess these are victories.
So I guess that's why you talk shit.

807
00:51:03.621 --> 00:51:08.060
I have no fucking idea.
But you know,
Peyton manning yesterday,

808
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:12.740
it's not like we beat the cults,
you know,
that's not the,

809
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.390
the fucking Marvin Harris,
Reggie Wayne,
Dallas Clark and all those guys.

810
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:21.680
You know what I mean?
I know Reggie Wayne play,
but come on,
it's like they're,

811
00:51:21.681 --> 00:51:25.670
they have a ton of injuries and that defense sucks.
All right.

812
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.930
But on the other side of the ball,
uh,
we have two rookie titans that are,

813
00:51:30.931 --> 00:51:34.340
are often,
seems to be built around,
and we were starting like three,

814
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:37.250
four rookies on defense.
So we're both sort of a,
it's weird.

815
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.990
I think both of those teams and their records are a testament to how fucking

816
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:46.010
good both of those quarterbacks are.
And certainly with the Patriots.

817
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:50.120
What a great coach Bill Belicheck is.
All right.
All you fucking cons.

818
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.350
Who keep telling me,
you know,

819
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:56.351
keep trash and bill Belicheck you know these guys are still given me shit on the

820
00:51:56.901 --> 00:52:00.350
Internet about that spy gate fucking horse shit.

821
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.090
Let me see if I can put this thing to bed.
First of all,
man.

822
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.530
Genie man genius as the jets call them jet fans of course.

823
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.600
Sanchez man genius

824
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:16.010
Richard Todd's the next Joe Nemeth you know they do that shit down there,
right?

825
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.890
Um,
he,
he coached with the Patriots so evidently of bill,

826
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:24.200
if bill Belicheck was doing that all the time,

827
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.150
he built his fucking resume and he has a job right now in head coaching because

828
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:32.780
of that spy gates shit.
And then he turns around and rats out.
Bill Belicheck.

829
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:37.100
And then I've also told all you've cons out there that bill Belicheck is not the

830
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:38.570
only guy who does that shit.

831
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.490
They send out a league wide memo telling everyone to stop doing it and if you

832
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:47.720
don't believe me,
if you don't believe me,
that everybody does it.

833
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:53.140
Watch when head coaches talk to each other on the sidelines on Nfl Sunday,

834
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.290
do you notice that they put their hands up over their mouth or they take their,

835
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.930
their fucking,
you know that little,
yeah,

836
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:03.110
that sheet that they have all their plays on and they put it up over there

837
00:53:03.111 --> 00:53:04.040
fucking mouth.

838
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:10.090
They put their hand up over their mouth like fucking a Joe Pesci in casino when

839
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:13.190
they're out there in the parking lot.
Why do you think that is?

840
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.230
Why do you think that is?

841
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.680
All you guys who are trying to blame that fucking epidemic of a crime on one

842
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:23.690
guy.
Why do you think they do that?

843
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:28.740
Do you think it's because they have bad breath?
You fucking morons.

844
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:33.990
It's because not only does everybody do it,
there's still doing it.

845
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.540
You just can't do it from the sidelines.

846
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.190
They got people up in the booth by [inaudible].
They got,
fuck,

847
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.740
I bet they got people in the crowd with cameras,
with zoom lenses.

848
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.150
This millions of dollars at stake.
There's egos at stake.
All right.

849
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.770
I just love how people,
okay,

850
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.250
people are gonna do fucking roids take HGH.

851
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.940
They're going to fucking cheat when,
when the fucking refs aren't going to look.

852
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.350
But you know,
they're not going to still continue to,
to,
to,

853
00:54:00.351 --> 00:54:04.500
to videotape what that technology exists.
Give me a fucking break.
All right.

854
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.240
And if any of you comes out there,
who always bitch says that Bella Cheat Shit.

855
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.110
If you can explain to me why they're covering up their fucking their hand over

856
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:14.970
their mouth.
And if one of you dumb fucks,

857
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.150
tries to tell me that someone on the other sideline with the naked eye can look

858
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.510
through 22 players and read the lips of somebody.

859
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:28.350
I am going to find out where you live through,
uh,

860
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.270
something,
something.com and I'm going to slap you with this fucking microphone.

861
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.900
All right?
So there you go.
I actually,
I can't blame it.

862
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.730
Says I actually felt bad for pate Manny.
Uh,

863
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.980
that game.
He played a great fucking game.
He did all the fucking work.
Okay.

864
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:50.980
I can't talk shit.
That game was tied up.
Okay.
V Vinod Terry comes in,

865
00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.560
kicks the fucking field goal.
All right.

866
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:56.310
This isn't like last year where he had all his fucking weapons.

867
00:54:56.311 --> 00:55:00.000
It was the Joe Montana moment and the reason why I trashed him because they were

868
00:55:00.001 --> 00:55:03.360
already handing him the crown is the greatest quarterback of all fucking time

869
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.440
before he'd even won his second ring.
So I felt vindicated.

870
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:11.610
So I actually felt bad for the guy when he's running off the fucking field.
Uh,

871
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.700
and believe me,
I couldn't believe it,
but I actually did.
I was like,
yeah,

872
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:18.410
you know,
guy played a great fucking game,
you know,
he,

873
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.650
he doesn't have any of his weapons.
He still hung in there and uh,
you know,

874
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:27.710
and I can't talk shit about the Patriots because our defense is,

875
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.220
is it's just,
I mean,
it's,
it's aged me 30 years.

876
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:36.600
I just watched the replay of the game and I'm so fucking glad I wasn't watching

877
00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:40.920
that live,
uh,
were great.
First down,
second down,

878
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:44.670
but third down,
huge.
Jesus Christ.

879
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.160
It's a,
we're still a,
I,
you know,
I would say two years away,

880
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:53.160
but because we have bill Belichick,
I would say we're still a year away,

881
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:57.210
but I just don't see us going deep into the playoffs with that fucking defense.

882
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.130
And,
um,

883
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:04.860
and I still don't think we match up well against the jets because they have a,

884
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.590
they have a really,
really good defense.

885
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:12.900
So I think that can neutralize our offense.
And then they go out there.

886
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:15.190
They have a great offensive line in [inaudible].

887
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.890
Sanchez has too much fucking time.
I don't know.
But I,
I don't,

888
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:21.870
I don't see them kicking the shit out of us.
I mean,

889
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:25.750
we could obviously still win that game in New England,
but,
um,

890
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.910
which I actually have a feeling we're going to,

891
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.420
cause that's just how things kind of seemed to work out in the NFL.
But like,

892
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.380
you know,
I don't know.
I honestly,

893
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:39.640
I honestly can't talk shit about that,
Kim.
It was a fucking awesome game.
And,
uh,

894
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:44.440
and again,
I admit it was a little sad watching Brady and Peyton manning with,

895
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.010
with teams that weren't as good as back in the fucking day,
you know,

896
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.520
but I'm hoping that they're both coming around because a,

897
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.400
it's a fucking great match up.
There you go.
Look at that.

898
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.300
Look at me the week of thanksgiving,
not being a cunt.

899
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.470
And uh,
let's see here.

900
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.530
I have some reason I have the jets down here.
The jets,

901
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:10.090
somebody said a bill in two weeks we beat,
oh,
okay.
Here we go.

902
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.210
It says bill,
in two weeks we beat two of the best NFL teams,

903
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.900
the Steelers and the colts.
Uh,
see that's another thing.

904
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:20.680
The cults aren't one of the best teams.
They have one of the best quarterbacks.

905
00:57:20.681 --> 00:57:22.840
And you're thinking about cults,
teams of the past.

906
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:26.740
You can't see them say they one of the best teams when all their guys are hurt,

907
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:30.220
you know.
But anyways,
he says,
I think that is nothing compared to the,

908
00:57:30.221 --> 00:57:30.791
but however,

909
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:34.120
I think that's nothing compared to the accomplishments of the New York jets.

910
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.160
I praise Rex Ryan,

911
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:41.161
Mark Sanchez and the whole jet organization for continuing to barely be able to

912
00:57:41.711 --> 00:57:46.630
beat under 500 teams.
I mean the lions,
the Browns,
and now the Texans.

913
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.460
Why even wait?
Might as well build the Mark Sanchez statue right now.

914
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:56.140
Fuck the jets.
Um,
yeah.

915
00:57:56.270 --> 00:58:00.670
And there's another,
I can't talk shit cause the browns raped us.
So,
uh,

916
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.630
this is the thing,

917
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:05.320
I've been breaking the jets balls about winning last second every fucking week.

918
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:08.680
But you know,
once you do it six weeks in a row,
I mean,
you can't ignore that.

919
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:12.190
That does say something about your fucking team.
So,
uh,

920
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:16.900
and after last week when I went one in three with my gambling,
you know,

921
00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:21.790
and I couldn't pick a fucking winner.
Um,
I gotta admit,
man,
this,

922
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:25.750
this year has been really a,
it's kind of fucking awesome,

923
00:58:25.751 --> 00:58:29.740
but it's really hard as a gambler trying to pick,
you know,

924
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:35.020
like what team is just going to step out and just be the fucking team,

925
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.970
you know,
I mean jet fans for as much as you guys keep winning.

926
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.950
I mean how much you agent down there and fucking New Jersey with the Jersey jets

927
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:49.420
there.
Huh?
It's fucking gotta be brutal for you every week.
But uh,

928
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:53.070
this week I actually,
I've,
I've gone to and one and a,

929
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.460
I have to bring this up here,

930
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.950
Paul Versey and I want you guys to give him shit too on his Facebook page.

931
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.800
Don't be overly mean.
Just actually,
you know what?

932
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:07.420
You would really be funny if you guys all just sent him letters of condolences

933
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.870
and you just hope that he's doing all right.
And if he needs anything,

934
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:15.070
you're there for them.
Just,
just go with that angle.
Um,

935
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.110
because he did the unthinkable,
the unprecedented last week.

936
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.960
Okay.
We,
we pick four games each week against the spread and against,

937
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:29.680
I know how,
how many odds,
and I have many odds were stacked up against this man,

938
00:59:29.681 --> 00:59:33.720
but Paul Versey
went,
oh,

939
00:59:33.721 --> 00:59:35.070
in four last week.

940
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:42.660
He fucking would have been better off if you blindfolded them.

941
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:46.580
Spun him around three times and gave my handful of darts and there was teams

942
00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:49.370
written on the wall and just said,
start throwing.

943
00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.720
I broke his balls a little bit.
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

944
00:59:52.721 --> 00:59:53.920
I don't even think Nia could do that.

945
00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:57.123
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

946
00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:02.130
<v 10>Oh,
so if you have time,
go to Paul Versey on Facebook via our Z.</v>

947
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.680
I don't be a con because it's the week of thanksgiving.

948
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:10.120
Just just send him letters of condolences.

949
01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:13.990
Just Act.
Treat him as though a family member just passed.
You know,

950
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.080
maybe like a family pet,
you know,
not a young family member.
Like,
you know,

951
01:00:19.081 --> 01:00:23.990
somebody like,
I like a grandfather that lived you.
It was 97 and died.

952
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.060
You know those weird things where it's like,
you know,

953
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.190
you gotta tell him I'm so sorry for your loss,

954
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:32.630
but you know the fuck he lived to be 97,
the lucky son of a bitch.

955
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.780
Um Oh in fucking four.
I mean,
I almost did it last week,
one and three.

956
01:00:37.781 --> 01:00:40.540
But that's the thing about going,
oh,
and for,
I mean it's,
it's like going,

957
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.770
Oh and 16 in the NFL.
Somebody,

958
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.740
somebody is going to come around and do you a favor.
Right?
So tonight,

959
01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:48.880
the last game I have,

960
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.240
and this is just like that Seahawks game last week when I picked Arizona and the

961
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:56.660
second I picked Arizona,
I'm like,
no dude,
pick the Seahawks.
And I was like,
no,

962
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:59.660
stick with your first choice for some stupid fucking reason.

963
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:03.040
I took Denver and the points tonight.
And uh,

964
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:08.070
I just really can see Phillip rivers coming out there with a fucking vengeance,

965
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.870
you know?
Oh,

966
01:01:10.871 --> 01:01:14.320
I gotta give a shout out to one of my listeners who I didn't even see the email,

967
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:19.380
but he gave me five pics for this week and he went four and one against the

968
01:01:19.861 --> 01:01:24.760
spread.
So a hats off to you,
sir.
You are a a,
you're a better man than me.

969
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.520
Um,
all right,
let's move on here.
Let's get on with the,
uh,
oh my drinking.

970
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.540
People are asking me about my drinking or the lack thereof.
Uh,
yes,

971
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.430
this is my 37th day of sobriety.
I got this shit down.
Okay,
I got it down.

972
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.670
I'm going to,
I'm,

973
01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:46.671
I'm easily going to make it to the rose bowl because I've already,

974
01:01:46.861 --> 01:01:50.550
I've already gone through my tough drink and towns.
I went to DC,

975
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:54.510
I went through New York,
I worked with Joe to Rosa,

976
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.990
Chicago,
Minneapolis.
What the fuck else are you going to do up there?

977
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.420
MMM.
Oh,
by the way,
I,

978
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:06.470
so I saw that show man versus food and that was a show that I used to make fun

979
01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:10.530
of.
I thought it was fucking stupid.
And,
uh,
she was like,
yeah,
this is dumb.

980
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.140
I want to watch this fucking sweaty guy eat all this goddamn food.

981
01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:18.590
And I don't what happened.
I was on the road and I watched him.

982
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:25.530
I don't know where he was,
but he fucking,
uh,
he,
he,

983
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.690
he ate this sandwich was a hit,

984
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:32.691
eat a Turkey sandwich that I swear to God was the size of a purse who stack that

985
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:35.370
fucking high.
It was ridiculous.

986
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.400
And then it came with a shake that you could literally put,

987
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.250
you could like,
you know,
people who like have like a,

988
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.260
like a tree growing in their house,
you know,
big.
That fucking pot is that,

989
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:52.140
that was all,
she was four pounds of milkshake.

990
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:57.690
So the dude eats all but two bites of the Turkey Sandwich.

991
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.820
He sucks down this shake that look like,
Yep.
You fucking

992
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.290
wasn't as big as a fire hydrant worth of fucking milkshake.

993
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.980
He sucks this whole fucking thing down.
You're writing.

994
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:13.830
He's got 20 minutes to go to eat the final two fucking bites.

995
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:18.390
And he's just sitting there with like,
you know,
like the thinker,

996
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.220
you know that pose,
that great statute.

997
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:25.390
He's sitting there like that except he's sweating and it took him 17 minutes to

998
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:26.340
eat two bites.
I mean,

999
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:29.460
I could have stuck both bites in my mouth and ate them in like 30 seconds.

1000
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.670
That's how fucking full this guy was and how hard he had the concentrate to not

1001
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:39.060
just fucking blow chow right after he fucked a bloat shout.

1002
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:43.630
Jesus Christ.
That's from my high school days.
Dog Hair about Eddie.
Yeah,

1003
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.250
he's drinking.
He fucking Blue Chow last night kid.
Um,

1004
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.290
try and not to fucking puke.
But anyways,
he went to uh,

1005
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.040
he went to Minneapolis and uh,
he,

1006
01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:00.960
there was some sort of sandwich up there that two places claim.

1007
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.970
What the fuck was the sandwich?
Two places claim that they are the original.

1008
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.500
Could somebody please tell me what that place is?
What the name of that place is.

1009
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:13.770
I want to fucking go there cause I want to try that sound cause it looked

1010
01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:18.771
delicious and for that matter if you see a city that I'm going to from coming to

1011
01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:23.130
your city and there's that fucking place where you got to go.

1012
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.540
Like when I went to buffalo and they had anchor bar in a was a Duffy's or

1013
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.720
something like that,
like those are the two places to get,
you know,

1014
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.190
they basically invented buffalo wings.
If you know of any of those places,

1015
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:38.610
please let me know because I'm really running out of fucking sporting events to

1016
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.940
go to,
you know,
unless I want to start to go into like,
you know,

1017
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:45.240
little league games and stand there like a fucking pervert.

1018
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.920
I'll just show up with those black frame glasses standing,
you know,

1019
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.990
close enough to,
to the field,

1020
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:57.960
but just far enough away from the rest of the crowd,
they'll,
you know,

1021
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.170
all by myself just looking like a fucking creep.
Um,

1022
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.140
please let me know those because,
um,
I gotta tell you,
you know,

1023
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.800
I'm having a fucking,
I'm having more goddamn fun on the road right now.

1024
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.350
I'm just meeting a lot of,
you know,
I'm finally getting to do some theaters.
Uh,

1025
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.620
I'm having great shows.
I know,
I feel like I got,

1026
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:21.310
my new is starting to get solid and uh,

1027
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.580
I dunno,
I'm not boozing so I'm kind of doing other shit,

1028
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:28.090
checking out some restaurants and whatnot.
So if you know of the,

1029
01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:31.300
some of those places,
please let me know.
All right.
And with that,

1030
01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:33.610
let's get on with the drinking question.
Uh,
hey bill.

1031
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.490
So now that you have 30 plus days,
37,

1032
01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.200
30 plus days without any booze in you,
what are the pros and cons?

1033
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.110
I remember when you were gone when you were on the wagon earlier this year,

1034
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.300
you said something to the effect of it being a little boring and you remembered

1035
01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:50.680
every second of every day.

1036
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:55.600
I'm really interested to hear what the pros are in your opinion.
Uh,

1037
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:59.530
do you feel more energetic,
clear minded,
et Cetera?
By the way,

1038
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:02.540
are you a little squeamish to about Frankenstein ma?

1039
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.520
What Frankenstein manning is going to do to the pet secondary tomorrow go pets.

1040
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:11.410
Yeah.
See,
yeah,
true.
Patriot fans were fucking nervous.
Uh,
yeah,
I was,

1041
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.330
I was nervous.
Um,

1042
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.560
the only thing I had I was counting on was the fact that he wasn't coming in

1043
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:20.530
with the cult team that you are used to.
But anyways,

1044
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:24.820
back to the drinking questions.
Uh,
what are the pros and cons?

1045
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.630
All right,
let's go with the cons first.
Cause those are funnier.
The cons are,

1046
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:33.423
uh,

1047
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:39.010
you know what the hardest part about not drinking is is you,
you,

1048
01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:44.020
you'll never realize how much you are bombarded with beer commercials until you

1049
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:48.280
stopped drinking.
And it's not the dumb beer commercials.
You know,

1050
01:06:48.281 --> 01:06:53.140
the ones like the corona ones where it's the battle of the sexes or those ones

1051
01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:56.500
where they,
you know,
they're just trying to be funny where they're just like a,

1052
01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:58.870
yeah,
you know,
why don't you order a real beer?
Will,
you know,

1053
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:03.160
when you take your skirt off for whatever,
you know,
those are just silly.

1054
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.330
Or those fucking Budweiser frogs and lizards back in the day,

1055
01:07:07.331 --> 01:07:09.340
those ones don't make you want to drink.

1056
01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:14.050
But those ones where they talk about the clean,
refreshing,
you know,
and they,

1057
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.393
you know,

1058
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.540
without those fucking Sam Adams commercials with the guy with the beard is

1059
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:21.640
burying his face into all those hops.

1060
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.020
And then they just did just pour in the fucking beer into that perfect beer

1061
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:30.280
glass.
Those are the ones where I start fucking,
you know,

1062
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.290
I start getting all clammy,
like,
uh,
you know,

1063
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.760
and it's weird when you're not drinking because if I'm drinking,

1064
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.940
I see one of those,
I'll just,

1065
01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:42.400
I'll either not even notice it or I'll just be like,
God damn,

1066
01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:45.700
I want a beer and I'll go get one.
But when I'm going cold Turkey,

1067
01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:47.530
when I see those commercials on my God,
Damn,

1068
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:52.420
I would like about 56 of those right about now.
I would like to man versus booze.

1069
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:58.840
Oh,
fuck did.
There's a youtube video.
Don't do it.
I don't condone it.

1070
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.490
But if you do it,
I'm going to watch it.

1071
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:05.590
The health risks are unbelievably dangerous.
Do not do that.

1072
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:10.720
Do not do that.
You can't do man versus booze.
Somebody's gonna fucking die.
Uh,

1073
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:12.850
which is why they don't have any of those challenges in a bar.

1074
01:08:12.851 --> 01:08:15.340
So strike all of that.
Do not do that.
But that's,

1075
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.510
that's what those beer commercials make me want to do,

1076
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.150
man versus booze.
And it makes me want to sit there and,
uh,

1077
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.060
oh God.
How about a fun challenge that would be,
can you imagine if he had like,

1078
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.940
you don't you like those?
Uh,
this is how much I want to drink right now.

1079
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.360
You're not,
you know,
those,
uh,
those,
those refrigerators that you,

1080
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:39.680
that people keep wine bottles in,
wine,
wine,
wine,
fridges,

1081
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.610
refrigerated wine things,
so fucking stupid.

1082
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:45.230
Whatever the fuck you call those things.
You know,

1083
01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:46.790
where they had the glass doors so you can see,

1084
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:48.590
you can see the bottles chilling in there.

1085
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.260
Imagine if you had a fucking ceiling to floor,

1086
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:58.090
just like a refrigerator had a glass door and behind it you just saw a bunch of

1087
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:02.990
frosty fucking bottles of beer,
you know,
in,
in,
on,
in.

1088
01:09:02.991 --> 01:09:07.991
The other one was just a bunch of frosty fucking awesome looking beer glasses.

1089
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.600
Right?
And you went,
you had to kill them all,

1090
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.290
even if you couldn't fucking do it.
The pneumonic,
God damn fun that would be,
see,

1091
01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:22.640
this is why I'm never gonna make it.
I'm not,
I'm not gonna go my whole life

1092
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.630
because,
uh,
you know what?

1093
01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:29.720
I think I might do that with de Rosa when I eventually get off the wagon,

1094
01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:31.490
we might do man versus booze.

1095
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.240
What is wrong with me?
See this,

1096
01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:39.830
this is the cons of going just totally cold Turkey is you start having

1097
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:43.730
fantasies.
Like,
I just got lost in that Jesus Christ.

1098
01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:46.870
And then I was thinking like,
yeah,
we'll do it.
We'll fucking take a vacation.

1099
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.710
We have a fucking house on the lake.

1100
01:09:48.711 --> 01:09:52.370
Like this whole homoerotic fucking beer fantasy with Joe to Rosa.

1101
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:56.420
The fuck is wrong with me.
That's what I was literally thinking.
You know,

1102
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.680
cause when you do something like that,

1103
01:09:57.681 --> 01:10:02.480
you want to make sure you got no place else to go.
Okay.

1104
01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:07.160
That's one of the cons.
You start fantasizing about booze so much.

1105
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:10.670
You actually put yourself in [inaudible] gay situation with one of your best

1106
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:11.504
friends.

1107
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.490
Ah,
God damn it.
One of the things I love most about Joe de Rosa is,

1108
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:22.250
is he's a complete fuck up.
That's what I love about it.
You know,

1109
01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:26.040
there's nothing better than hanging out with a fuck up is because you know it's,

1110
01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.730
there's no pressure for you to get your shit together.

1111
01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.990
It's like when you hang out with a do gooder gooder,
it's a constant reminder of,

1112
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:36.920
of,
of how awful you are as a person and how shitty your living your life.

1113
01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:40.460
But when you get hang out with a guy like Joe to Rosa,
you know,

1114
01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:45.380
be smart about it.
He gets his work done,
he finishes right in the script.

1115
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.930
He does his shows,
but afterwards,
he's old school.
He really is.

1116
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.330
He's like Dean Martin without the charisma and the good looks.
Um,
anyways,

1117
01:10:56.331 --> 01:11:00.950
why am I trashing Joe on Thanksgiving?
Huh?
It's a week to give thanks.

1118
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.120
I give thanks to that.

1119
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.510
You know that Joe de Rosa and for years us Comedians have always trashed Joseph.

1120
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.740
Joe De Rosa talking about how he doesn't have any shoulders.

1121
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:14.940
And I have maintained for a good two and a half years.
I've been screaming,

1122
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:19.890
I've been telling to,
to,
to people with def yelling at deaf ears,

1123
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:22.560
what's that fucking expression?
Whatever.

1124
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:26.610
I'm talking to people and not listen to me.
Joe De Rosa does not lack shoulders.

1125
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.750
He has shoulders.

1126
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:31.800
But what he doesn't have is that those two chunks of flesh,

1127
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:37.890
you know,
the chunk of flesh on either side of your neck,
uh,
either,

1128
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.460
yeah.
Between your neck and your shoulder.
That that meat right there.

1129
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.640
The trapezius muscle,
is that what it is?
He doesn't have that.

1130
01:11:44.641 --> 01:11:48.150
He doesn't have collarbones.
That's what happened.

1131
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:51.810
This collarbones never grew while the rest of his skeletal system grew.

1132
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.250
His collarbones didn't.
So,
uh,
hence there was no need to put flesh in there.

1133
01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:00.540
So Joe is a head,
he's a neck and on either side of his neck,

1134
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.830
he had this ball and socket joints for his shoulders are right where those,

1135
01:12:04.831 --> 01:12:08.340
those rivets were on the side of Frankenstein's next nec,

1136
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.640
next plural idiot.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.

1137
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.770
36 minutes in.

1138
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.240
So those are the cons as you start fantasizing about booze.

1139
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:22.230
And for me anyways,
I can't speak for anybody else,

1140
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:27.231
but it just makes you want to drink like 90 fucking beers like that.

1141
01:12:28.191 --> 01:12:29.070
There's a bar,

1142
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:33.900
there's a German bar on the upper east side and this time went out.

1143
01:12:33.901 --> 01:12:36.570
When I go off the wagon,
this is where I want to go.

1144
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:39.780
They have this insane,

1145
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:42.990
I can't remember if it's a boot or if it's one of those things,

1146
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.380
those beer glasses that looks like a giant fucking Bong.

1147
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.560
Um,
you know,
like I,
that's what I want to drink.

1148
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:56.820
I wanna drink one of those or just one of those giant mugs of fucking beer.

1149
01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:00.630
That's the con right now because as great as I feel,

1150
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:04.590
that's what I think of in my head when I think about drinking everyday.

1151
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.350
The glass gets bigger.
Frostier and uh,

1152
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:10.861
Jesus,
I'm gonna,

1153
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:13.440
I'm gonna start drinking halfway through this podcast if I keep talking about
it.

1154
01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.450
All right?
Uh,
what are the pros?

1155
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:20.720
Weight loss specifically in your face?
It,
your,

1156
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:24.690
your face tightens up.
It's great.
You get your jaw line back.

1157
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:27.953
Um,

1158
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:32.730
when some drunk whore comes up to you with fucking cigarettes and wine breath,

1159
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.870
you see her for what she is.
All right.

1160
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.790
You don't hang out with people after the show.

1161
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:42.360
They get all drunk and fucking loud.
And what you end up,
you're standing there.

1162
01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:46.950
What you really start hearing is these cliched conversations that you have

1163
01:13:46.951 --> 01:13:50.730
participated in for the last 25 fucking years of your life.

1164
01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:52.740
You know,

1165
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.720
you stand back and you get to watch people slowly lose control of their,

1166
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.100
uh,
their judgment.
Um,

1167
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.670
and you start to see people say things and do things that they're going to

1168
01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:06.481
apologize,

1169
01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:10.710
a regret for regret for or regret the next day.

1170
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:15.850
Um,
what else?
Uh,

1171
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.900
it starts to make you look at where you are and your life,
you know,

1172
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.320
and uh,

1173
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.910
I don't know if you're going to do something that's sort of scummy you have to

1174
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:29.170
do with stone sober.
And I think a lot of times when I do dirt bags,
Shit,

1175
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.480
you know,
or I just do dumb shit.
I think it's because I'm drunk.

1176
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.490
No,
I think that's why I'm drinking.

1177
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:40.240
Just cause I'm shouting down that voice in my head that's telling me bill,

1178
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:44.500
go to bed right now.
Just go to bed,
read,
you know,

1179
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.830
finish that script.
That's another thing too was I started drinking.

1180
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.560
When I start thinking of the sketch I was going to write or something like that,

1181
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:53.860
I haven't done it.
And I'm like,
God,
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

1182
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.360
And I start thinking,
you know,

1183
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:59.410
the successful guys would be going back to the hotel room right now and they'd

1184
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:03.970
be finishing it,
right?
Take out a little fucking feather.

1185
01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:07.390
You know,
stick it in that ink.
Well,
and they would finish writing it out.

1186
01:15:07.391 --> 01:15:08.440
But not you who you are.

1187
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:11.800
You're sitting here talking to these fucking people about football from the

1188
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:15.970
1970s.
So,
um,
there's plenty of pros about it.

1189
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:20.410
You know,
I think if you're in a fucked up relationship and you sober up,

1190
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:24.970
that'll help you,
you know,
I think,
uh,

1191
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:29.971
I think a lot of people kind of use booze as a way to sort of medicate their way

1192
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.760
through the year,
you know,

1193
01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:36.790
and not address shit that's really pissing them off and stuff.
I don't know.

1194
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.560
I don't know.
Makes you want to work out.

1195
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:41.620
It makes you want to change other stuff in your life where,
uh,

1196
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.280
and actually go out and do things.
Another thing to see,

1197
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.920
now I'm talking about going into cities.

1198
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:51.580
I want to go to cool places to eat and that type of stuff and rather than,

1199
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:51.881
you know,

1200
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:55.420
where are the bars at so I can do what I've already done for the last 25 fucking

1201
01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:58.480
years.
So there you go.
Those are the pros.
Um,

1202
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.750
I'm not saying you got to quit it for good unless you're a full on alcoholic,

1203
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:06.670
obviously I would quit it for good.
But if,
uh,
you know,

1204
01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.780
we just getting that big Ted Kennedy had,
it's great to take a fucking month off.

1205
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.460
You know?
I don't know.
That's it.
I don't know about you guys,

1206
01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:18.940
but I've just been boring the living shit out of myself this week.
All right,

1207
01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.160
let's get to underrated.
Overrated.
All right.
This is,

1208
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:25.780
this is going to cause some fucking emails.
All right.
Overrated.
Reverse racism.

1209
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.080
I love how white men tell minorities to quit whining about how unfair things

1210
01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:36.550
are,
but the second day become victims of racism.
All you hear is,

1211
01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:40.240
I can't insert complaint because I'm white.

1212
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:45.790
Uh,
take some of your own advice.
Take some of your own advice.

1213
01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.040
You fucking hypocrite.
Could I have butchered that anymore?

1214
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.410
Let me go back and read that.
Reverse racism.

1215
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.310
I love how white men tell minorities to quit whining about how unfair things
are,

1216
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.310
but the second they become victims of racism,
all you hear is,

1217
01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:02.230
I can't insert complaint because I'm white.
Take some of your own advice.

1218
01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.810
You fucking hypocrite.
There's the reed.

1219
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.390
I fucking love that one.
I 1% agree with that one.
I,

1220
01:17:11.391 --> 01:17:16.130
it's embarrassing when I hear white guys,
specifically white guys,

1221
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.863
you know,

1222
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.050
white women still complained because that's what women do of all colors.

1223
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.650
They just fucking bitch.
They're going to bitch about something,
you know,

1224
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.830
take them to the restaurant that they've always wanted to go to.

1225
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.900
You take them there and what happens?
Oh,
why do we have this thing over here?

1226
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.550
Right.
Bitch about the table.
It's cold.
I like it,
man.

1227
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:41.510
It's cold.
Do you have the fucking blah blah blah.

1228
01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:45.020
Do you have that special?
And they take it off the menu and then they pout

1229
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:47.630
and what do you want to do?

1230
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:52.400
You want to fucking take the check when it comes and stuff it down the back of

1231
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:52.911
their throat?

1232
01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:56.970
Like that creepy moth at Hannam electric or that or that one fucking dude you

1233
01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.080
said do and in that movie that I can't remember the name of Jesus Christ.

1234
01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:05.150
His podcast sucks.
Ah,
yeah.
I really,

1235
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:05.984
I,
you know,

1236
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:11.060
I really can't like listen to white people bitch about a white guys bitch about,

1237
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.440
you know,
like affirmative action when they bitch about that type of shit.

1238
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:19.220
All I can say is if you can't keep your fucking head above the line,

1239
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:23.810
you know,
come on
really

1240
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:27.980
if you fall,
you know,
do you know?

1241
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:32.480
But you have to be fucking up as a white dude to get under that fucking line.

1242
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:36.470
Like say colleges when they have that affirmative action thing.

1243
01:18:36.471 --> 01:18:40.630
So then somebody a gets the same scores of you but they're not whites.

1244
01:18:40.631 --> 01:18:44.220
So they fucking get in and you're going to sit there and bitch,
Moan and come.

1245
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:48.110
Come on.
Seriously,
come on you.
You've got enough fucking advantages.

1246
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:51.980
You fucked up on,
you've got to take that one on the chin.
That's how I view it.

1247
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:55.280
And so I'm going to support that one cause I know it's also going to bring a

1248
01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:57.980
bunch of fucking emails so we can talk about race on the podcast.

1249
01:18:57.981 --> 01:19:00.920
Something I would love to do.
All right.
Underrated.

1250
01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:06.140
Michael Vick love or more hate him.
He's the best QB in the league right now.

1251
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:10.400
Classic,
classic,
classic.

1252
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.550
You see that right there.
There you go.

1253
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:19.550
This is what this is.
That is the ESPN way of looking at football.

1254
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:23.120
Did you watch Michael Vick last week against the hapless fucking Washington

1255
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.340
Redskins and they're awful defense.

1256
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.720
You would've thought Jesus Christ himself was playing fucking quarterback.

1257
01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:30.800
They would.
They could.

1258
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:35.220
They say this is one of the most you're baking cake type every Michael Vick,
he,

1259
01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:40.820
Michael Vick and Michael Vick g one fucking game in the middle of November and

1260
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:43.580
this guy is suddenly,

1261
01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:47.600
he suddenly catapults fucking Tom Brady.

1262
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.780
Peyton manning is as far as like all their accomplishments,

1263
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.200
all the things that they've done.

1264
01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:01.070
He cares like two to two or three good fucking gains are right now.

1265
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:06.110
He is the best QB in the fucking league.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1266
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.470
It's just,
it just fucking unreal.
I get it.

1267
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:14.490
He's the fastest fucking guy in the NFL.
You can't fucking tackle the guy.

1268
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:15.181
I get it.

1269
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:18.810
He stayed in the pocket now and he's actually doing what a quarterback is

1270
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:22.170
supposed to be doing.
You know when the first guy is an open,

1271
01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:24.900
he doesn't take off and run anymore.
He looks for the second and third,

1272
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:28.470
third guy open.
I get that shit.
All right,

1273
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:33.510
and I'm not saying like somebody asked me last week when he was doing what he

1274
01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:35.190
did against the Redskins.
He said,

1275
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:39.180
do you think this makes Michael Vick the best quarterback in the league?
I said,

1276
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:42.600
look,
if he does what he did tonight against the fucking Redskins,

1277
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:48.150
like three weeks in a row,
he becomes without a doubt,

1278
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:53.340
shoulder to shoulder with the best qbs in the fucking league.
Okay,

1279
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.140
but you gotta win in January.

1280
01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:59.100
You got to lead your team and the fucking playoffs or else it doesn't mean shit.

1281
01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:01.830
I mean,
yeah,
it's amazing.
The guy's fucking,

1282
01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:06.330
he's most athletic dude I have ever seen.
He's got an unbelievable army flight.

1283
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:07.680
He has all the,
I'll tell you this,

1284
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.800
he has all the fucking tools to become the greatest fucking QB of all time.

1285
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:13.450
If,
if,

1286
01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:17.970
if he actually starts to play the position where he stays in the pocket and does

1287
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.860
that without a fucking doubt.
But no,

1288
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:22.680
he's not the best QB in the fucking league right now.

1289
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:28.200
He's not.
He's the most fucking amazing to watch.

1290
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.490
I don't this,
this is,
look at,

1291
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:36.150
this gets back to me when people think I hate the fucking jets.

1292
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:37.440
This is what I hate.

1293
01:21:37.441 --> 01:21:41.220
I hate people who get crowned king before they take the fucking crown.

1294
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:44.430
That's what I can't stand.
That's why I went off on Peyton last week.

1295
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.620
That's why I'm going off on the jets this year.

1296
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.750
You guys listen to this podcast for three fucking years.

1297
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.640
I've made fun of the jets and that type of shit,

1298
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:52.350
but it hasn't been like this year.

1299
01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:58.290
And the reason was was because that hard knocks shit talking that they did was

1300
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.550
the most over the top disrespectful fucking thing I've seen in.

1301
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.910
So God damn it fucking Rex Ryan.
Yeah,

1302
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:09.060
we'll go undefeated in September and kicked the fuck out of them.

1303
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:11.610
We'll kick the shit out of those fucking day fucking guy.

1304
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.790
And everybody's talking about how confident,
confident that guy was.

1305
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.950
And I called him out on it and you know what?
I was fucking right.
I was right.

1306
01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:23.340
They weren't that fucking good.
And they still aren't that fucking good.

1307
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.630
They are winning games at the last second.
They lost their first fucking game.

1308
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.120
They lost to the ravens and they lost to the packers.

1309
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.330
They've yet to play the colts.
Which a,
they're not really that good this year,

1310
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:35.160
but they haven't played the fucking Steelers.

1311
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:38.970
They haven't blown anybody away other than the fucking patriots with their awful

1312
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:43.050
fucking difference.
So where do you get off talking all this shit.

1313
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:47.550
That's why I'm giving him shit.
Okay.
I really don't give a fuck.

1314
01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:51.500
You know I give a fuck this year if they win the Superbowl,
but I don't get,

1315
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:53.790
I don't wish that fucking misery on jets fan.

1316
01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.550
Do you really think I want you guys to go your whole lifetime and never win a

1317
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:59.850
championship?
I don't.
I don't.
All right,

1318
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.780
but this year I don't want you to because you talked all that.

1319
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:06.550
You guys didn't talk all that Shit because Rex Ryan talked,
I'll let shit.

1320
01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:10.120
That's all this shit is about.
All right.
But other than that,
I don't give a fuck.

1321
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.000
It's fun that they're good.

1322
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.350
It's not fun when they suck that game against the culture yesterday wasn't fun

1323
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.160
because what's his clothes?
Because Peyton manning didn't have all his guys.

1324
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:25.030
It's not,
you know what I mean?
It'd be like beating the Yankees.
If a while,
Jesus,

1325
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:27.630
their whole fucking team would have to go down the amount of fucking free agents

1326
01:23:27.631 --> 01:23:32.460
they sign.
Um,
it'd be like beaten.
Uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1327
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:35.750
What the fuck is you,
you know what the fuck I'm saying?
All right,
so don't,

1328
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:37.510
don't get like this whole thing,
you know,
switch.

1329
01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:40.330
I know I'd say over the top shit,
but I'm just trying to be funny here,
right?

1330
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:43.540
So all you cops who are taking this shit way too fucking seriously.

1331
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:45.160
Speaking of which,

1332
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:50.290
I got some audio for you guys that one of my great listeners sent into me and I

1333
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.990
absolutely love this fucking audio,

1334
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.280
but it's also embarrassing to me because this guy reminds me,

1335
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.960
I hate how much I am just like this guy.

1336
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:06.520
I hate that I give a fuck about sports as much as this guy.

1337
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.470
Uh,
speaking of the eagles and the Redskins,
okay.
If my friends overseas,

1338
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:16.210
either way,
uh,
uh,
the,
there was a football game.

1339
01:24:16.211 --> 01:24:19.810
Eagles played the Redskins in the Eagle's fucking raped the Redskins.
So this,

1340
01:24:19.811 --> 01:24:24.811
this radio host goes on the radio and has a 12 minute fucking meltdown

1341
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:33.010
about all this shit he's had to endure as a Redskins fan,

1342
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:36.810
which is kind of funny because they've won three Superbowls in my lifetime.
So I,

1343
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:41.230
part of it is hilarious cause he goes,
you know,
it's been 10 years of this shit

1344
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.260
and I just would love to see him do that rant and get to that that moment and

1345
01:24:47.261 --> 01:24:51.670
say it's been 10 years of this shit and say that standing on in in the middle of

1346
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:53.320
Wrigley field when it's packed,

1347
01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.250
it's been 10 years of this shit.
Oh,
your poor fucking baby.
Um,

1348
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:04.270
but it's actually,
to be honest,
it's been longer than that because you know,

1349
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.730
it's going to,

1350
01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:07.720
going on like 20 years and once you start getting up around 20 years,

1351
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:12.820
it sucks as a fan.
Um,
just talk to the Canadian fans up there.
You know,

1352
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:15.550
it's starting to suck up there,
isn't it?
You guys gotta be,

1353
01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:18.670
you guys gotta be happy.
The Canadians look really good this year.

1354
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:20.320
They have a really solid fucking team.

1355
01:25:20.321 --> 01:25:24.820
But the fact that the Canadians haven't worn it since 1993 and so unbelievable

1356
01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:29.320
that franchises,
they've never gone this long in the history of that,

1357
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:30.400
of that franchise.

1358
01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:34.570
They've never gone anywhere near this long without winning a Stanley Cup.

1359
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.520
Those fucking assholes,

1360
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.360
I think right up until 1979 I think they had a better winning percentage then.

1361
01:25:45.551 --> 01:25:46.660
I think the Yankees,

1362
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:52.300
I might be wrong on that now.
I think I'm Ah,

1363
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.910
I might,
I think I'm right on that.

1364
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.710
I think they were averaging winning one every fucking three one every three

1365
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:04.310
years easily.
Ah,
fuck knows.
I'm bad at math.

1366
01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:08.000
But anyways,
so anyways,
um,
just go to the MLM,
podcast.com.

1367
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.180
This fucking rant is so funny and,
and first of all,

1368
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:14.480
somebody sent the email and told me that this guy was going to go off and what

1369
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:17.360
makes us so God damn funny as the way he starts the rent.

1370
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:20.600
I thought it was just going to be some guy blowing a gasket,
but it starts the,

1371
01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.850
restarts it so calmly.

1372
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.350
He just starts off saying something to the effect of,
you know,

1373
01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.260
my grandfather was a Redskins fan.

1374
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:40.220
He used to watch Sammy Bob.
He goes through his death.

1375
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.300
He literally did background.
My Dad was a Redskins fan.

1376
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:49.280
I've been a redskin fans.
I probably spent in my lifetime,
probably,
I dunno,

1377
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:50.151
seven,

1378
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:54.980
$8,000 on throwback jerseys and Redskins merchandise.

1379
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:59.930
He lays the fucking ground where he gives you the fucking backstory.

1380
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.800
And then he just launches into this thing.
And I gotta admit,
man,

1381
01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:04.700
I got 10 minutes into it.

1382
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:08.810
I just shut it off because I was so embarrassed that I have,

1383
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.130
I blown a gasket like this guy.
I mean,

1384
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:16.280
he gets like seven minutes into it and I'm like talking to the guy like,
dude,

1385
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.850
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter this much.
Just let it go.

1386
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:21.770
And it's actually really funny except for this,

1387
01:27:21.771 --> 01:27:25.280
this guy in the background keeps going,
kid,
kid,

1388
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.870
kid home.
And it really gets fucking annoying.

1389
01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:34.820
Other than that is fucking hilarious.
Um,
all right,
52 minutes in.
Let,
let's,

1390
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:39.170
let's move on here.
All right.
This,
this fucking segment is really taken off.

1391
01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:44.060
I'm loving this one.
This segment is best line in a bad movie.

1392
01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.700
Uh,
and this week's video,
which is up on the Mlm,
podcast.com.

1393
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:50.780
You got to watch this one.

1394
01:27:50.781 --> 01:27:54.290
Please do not have any food in your mouth when you watch this because you will

1395
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:58.850
spit it all over.
A loved one.
Um,
watched the video,
Steven Seagal.

1396
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.370
Bloodbank uh,
it was just fucking awesome.
I just,

1397
01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:07.580
I really want to just go out one night and just rent five of the worst fucking

1398
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:11.870
movies ever and just sit there and watch it with a couple of people that can

1399
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:15.260
appreciate it because some of the lines of these fucking movies are incredible.

1400
01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:16.094
Please,

1401
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:21.080
please keep sending me these videos because it's just making a nice long list of

1402
01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:23.990
movies that I have to sit down and watch.
Um,

1403
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:29.930
you know is great for that by the way too.
Are you guys fans of 30 rock?

1404
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:33.770
And I'm only going to name a name here cause this is something positive.
Uh,

1405
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Judah Freelander is an encyclopedia of knowledge on movies in general,

1406
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:45.530
but forget about bad movies.
And if I remember correctly,

1407
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:50.100
he actually collects them.
And,
uh,
I have to,
you know what I got to,

1408
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:55.070
I'm going to have him as a guest on this show and before he comes on,
um,

1409
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:59.690
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna ask for his top five worst movies,

1410
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:02.190
best worst movies of all time.
And I'm telling you,

1411
01:29:02.191 --> 01:29:07.191
he can break these movies down like Siskel and Ebert back in the fucking day as

1412
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:12.660
to why their grit,
not why,
not only they're awful,
but they're also great.

1413
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:13.780
Like he's a,
this is what I'm,

1414
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:17.100
one of the many things I miss about living in New York was running into him and

1415
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:21.780
I would always bring up,
you know,
it all started one time I was,

1416
01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:25.710
I was hanging out at the comedy cellar and he was down there and I was trying to

1417
01:29:25.711 --> 01:29:30.180
remember this name of this Steven Seagal movie.
And I was like,
I was like,
dude,

1418
01:29:30.181 --> 01:29:33.900
what was the name of that movie?
Uh,
Steven Seagal had his,

1419
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:37.960
one of his earlier ones.
And uh,
he,

1420
01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:41.520
he fought all those,
those fucking Bob Marley looking dudes.

1421
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:46.890
And he just goes,
without even missing a beat.
He just goes marked for death.

1422
01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:50.550
Great movie.
And I go,
what was the plot of that?

1423
01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:55.551
He goes to plot of that movie is basically Steven Seagal beats up Jamaica.

1424
01:29:58.450 --> 01:30:01.380
I'm butcher and all this shit.
He said it in a much funnier way.
And then he,

1425
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:04.440
then he broke down.
Why?
That movie was great.

1426
01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:08.760
And it basically came down to who said that movie introduced the breaking of

1427
01:30:08.761 --> 01:30:13.440
bones in martial art movies according to him or,

1428
01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:16.110
or took it to just an entirely different level.
And I'm telling you,

1429
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:18.960
if you watch mark for death in you're squeamish,
ah,

1430
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:22.980
that's not a movie to watch because I've never seen so many compound fractures.

1431
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.810
Is that the compound fractures that the one where,

1432
01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.490
where it comes out through the skin?
That's the one I'm talking about.
All right.

1433
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:32.100
And once again,
I started talking and I get in over my head.

1434
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:37.020
I suspend the easy listening podcast.
I'm all right.
Here we go,
uh,

1435
01:30:37.021 --> 01:30:38.400
youtube videos for the week.

1436
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:42.090
I can't remember if I put this one up last week,

1437
01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:46.080
but I'll look up the car.
James Brolin.
It's a,
uh,

1438
01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:49.500
one of the worst and hilarious trailers I've ever seen in my life.

1439
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:51.420
This is another movie that I have to see.

1440
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:56.040
A white line fever is another one.

1441
01:30:56.041 --> 01:31:00.330
Those are two bad movie trailers.
Uh,
angry birds,

1442
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:03.780
peace treaty
and a,

1443
01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:06.840
and here's another segment I'm going to introduce if you guys have all time

1444
01:31:06.841 --> 01:31:10.950
favorite classic youtube videos.
All right.

1445
01:31:10.951 --> 01:31:12.180
Look up food fight

1446
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.920
and try to guess which wars that they're talking about.

1447
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:19.860
I'm a more on the first time I watched it and just thought it was funny because

1448
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:23.670
it was food blowing each other up and then I really started to see the uh,

1449
01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:29.130
the metaphors or was it the similes I never simile is using like avs.

1450
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:35.640
Well then they would have to say America is a cheeseburger.
That's a metaphor.

1451
01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.570
Assembly would be America is like a cheeseburger are at,

1452
01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:42.550
you'll understand it when you watch the video if you haven't seen it yet.
And uh,

1453
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.510
as far as drummers goes this week,

1454
01:31:45.511 --> 01:31:50.160
this is another Stuart Copeland one and this is a band that I meant to get into.

1455
01:31:50.161 --> 01:31:54.240
And I don't know what happened.
I got so busy,
but a oysterhead,
uh,

1456
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:59.380
watch the Youtube Video Oz is ever floating as a performance that they did live

1457
01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:03.070
on Conan O'brien and the band was Stewart Copeland on drums.

1458
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:08.440
Um,
what's his face?
I just went,

1459
01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:13.390
I just spaced on his fucking name.
Trey.
Uh,

1460
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.090
the guy from fish,

1461
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:22.630
I forget his fucking name and a stage Geo.
I was never a big fish fan.

1462
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.180
Um,
I think they're awesome,

1463
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:28.000
but I just can't listen to a fucking 58 minutes songs.

1464
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:33.190
And a on base was Les Claypool.
That was the band and they're fucking awesome.

1465
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.280
And I'm going to download some of this shit.
All right.
And with that,

1466
01:32:36.281 --> 01:32:38.740
I think all the only thing we have left,
I'm going to end with advice,

1467
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:40.330
which really seems to be the way that we end.

1468
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.360
Do I have time for a couple of quick questions?
I don't think I do.
All right,

1469
01:32:43.361 --> 01:32:46.840
let's get to the advice for the week.
All right.
Question Bill.

1470
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.260
Being a frequent flyer,
don't you,
uh,

1471
01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:55.720
think this controversy over the new body scanners is fucking bullshit.

1472
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:59.770
A guy hit a bomb in his fucking underwear.

1473
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:04.830
What exactly do these complaining bastards expect us to scale back on security.

1474
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:10.890
We have become so pampered and used to the utmost comfort that we are doing the

1475
01:33:11.531 --> 01:33:13.180
terrorist's job for them.

1476
01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:17.050
Who gives a fuck if someone is seeing your cock or your tits,

1477
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.700
he or she is seeing hundreds a day.
Uh,

1478
01:33:20.701 --> 01:33:24.430
you sir are a fucking moron.
All right.

1479
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:27.490
If you go through airport security,
I don't know if you've noticed,

1480
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:31.810
they're not exactly the fucking navy seals,

1481
01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.750
although they have gotten better in the last couple of years,
but they don't,

1482
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:38.230
you know,
they're always shooting the shit.
They're always fucking around.

1483
01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.020
They're not really paying attention.

1484
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:44.530
It doesn't really look like it's a high paying fucking job.
All right,

1485
01:33:44.531 --> 01:33:48.970
let's go with that.
All right,
let's go with secondly a body scanner.

1486
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.110
Entire body skin.

1487
01:33:50.111 --> 01:33:53.560
Let's get over the fact that you don't want a naked picture of yourself,

1488
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:58.390
which is you're fucking right to not want that,
by the way.
All right.

1489
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.580
Secondly,
I don't know about you,

1490
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:04.330
but I fly every other weekend and when I go on benders like this at the end of

1491
01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:04.510
the year,

1492
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:07.300
cause I owe the bank or cuts in the fucking government a bunch of money,

1493
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:12.440
I go on like you know,
four or five weeks in a row I fly.
All right,

1494
01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.260
so I got to get a full bond body scan,
uh,

1495
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:19.090
on the way out and the way back.

1496
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.400
You know,
I really have to start checking to see them.

1497
01:34:24.401 --> 01:34:29.401
I'm not going to be completely filled up with memory on this fucking Olympus ls

1498
01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:31.990
10.
They have the God damn time right there.
I apologize.

1499
01:34:31.991 --> 01:34:35.380
Let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about.
Um,

1500
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.810
yeah,
so,

1501
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:41.350
so you're basically saying that I shouldn't complain that like six weeks in a

1502
01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:46.351
fucking row and a total of 12 times I'm going to take radiation from head to

1503
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:51.430
fucking toe.
All right.
And don't even tell me,
oh,

1504
01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:55.810
it's only for fucking second to when you go to get your fucking,
you know,

1505
01:34:56.350 --> 01:35:00.740
teeth rayed they put that leather,
fucking,

1506
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:04.700
that led vest leather,
that led vest over all your fucking organs.

1507
01:35:04.701 --> 01:35:07.070
And then they go lay leave the fucking room.

1508
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:12.050
And I'm supposed to stand there like I'm at a Jay z concert and I'm getting

1509
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.460
frisky at the same time with my fucking legs spread and doing that Jay z thing

1510
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:21.020
over my head.
And they're going to know,
fuck that this cancer in my family.

1511
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:23.120
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it,
pat me down.

1512
01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:26.210
So that's why I did the one on the,
on the way out.
I was like,
yeah,

1513
01:35:26.211 --> 01:35:30.440
I'm not doing that thing.
And I said to pat me down.
So then,
you know,

1514
01:35:30.441 --> 01:35:34.040
they did it and they said they came up to me and this guy said,

1515
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:38.420
I have to pat you down.
Uh,
are there any parts of your body that are,
uh,
that are,

1516
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:42.440
that are,
that are sensitive?
And I wanted to be like,
well,

1517
01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:45.320
I'm thinking all of us have areas of our body that are sensitive

1518
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:51.460
just to creep them out.
That was basically like,
no,
dad grabbed my balls.

1519
01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.620
I don't give a fuck.
Right.
I didn't know what he was going to do.
Right.

1520
01:35:54.621 --> 01:35:58.730
So he's puts on his dishwashing gloves and starts patting me down and they don't

1521
01:35:58.731 --> 01:35:59.564
grab your balls.

1522
01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:04.430
What they do is they go way up your inner thigh and he gives you your ball bag,

1523
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:08.690
a little of a backhand on each side of the ball bag,
you know?
So,

1524
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.970
and I got admit and made me laugh a little bit.
Yeah.

1525
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:16.520
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

1526
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:20.450
You're not taking a fucking head to toe naked fucking picture of me as your z.

1527
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:22.460
You know,
I,
you're not,

1528
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:25.790
you're not fucking radiate and my entire body so I can get on a fucking puddle

1529
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:29.030
jumper to go to Hartford.
I'm not doing that.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1530
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.250
Jesus Christ,
lazy motherfuckers.

1531
01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.390
You know
what people forget.
I,
so I don't get it.
You know what I mean?
This,

1532
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.160
this one,
I understand that they're,
you know,

1533
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:45.710
quote unquote trying to keep me safe.

1534
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.710
But what I don't understand is that people don't understand that during those

1535
01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:51.980
times of fear,
and let's try to keep you safe.

1536
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:57.220
The amount of fucking like privileged that you lose and you never fucking get it

1537
01:36:58.101 --> 01:37:01.790
back.
And they always take a little more than they should.

1538
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:04.970
That's why it's great that people bitch.

1539
01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:08.630
And it's great that you can bitch because if you bitch like this in China,

1540
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:12.040
they'd probably put you to death and then harvest.
You're fucking Oregon's.

1541
01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:14.660
All right.
So yeah,

1542
01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:18.590
I think it's fine with the amount of fucking cancer that's out there and that

1543
01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:21.440
people fucking talk on their cell phones all the Goddamn time.

1544
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:25.940
You don't want to end it,
you know,
you don't want to add to it with head to toe,

1545
01:37:25.941 --> 01:37:29.930
fucking Zappa,
fucking radiation.
You know,

1546
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.720
I'm standing there,
I don't have my fucking shoes on.

1547
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:37.430
I'm stripped down to a fucking tee shirt.
I got jeans on and Shit.

1548
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.640
I don't have anything on me,
you know.

1549
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:44.570
And there's all this fucking flipping out about the fucking airplanes.

1550
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.070
What about trains?

1551
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.780
You could literally have a box that said,

1552
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:52.850
I have dynamite on the side of it,

1553
01:37:52.851 --> 01:37:55.680
and you could see the fucking conductor would help you it on.

1554
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:58.350
There's no metal detectors.
There's no nothing.

1555
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:00.420
Despite the fact that 15 years ago,

1556
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.050
that guy got on the long island railroad railroad and shut that shut the whole

1557
01:38:04.051 --> 01:38:07.500
fucking thing up.
So I don't like that.

1558
01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:12.120
I don't like that whole fucking ice scan,
scan my retina shit.
No,

1559
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:16.590
go fuck yourself.
I'm not doing that.
And um,
it's,
you're right,
dude,

1560
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:18.360
if you have no problem with it,
you know,

1561
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:24.260
good luck with your testicular slash brain slash tongue slash throat slash big

1562
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:29.460
toe cancer if you fly all the fucking time.
Like a lot of people.

1563
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:32.940
I'm not doing that shit.
I'm not fucking doing that.
That's,
uh,

1564
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.800
the fuck dead.
You know,

1565
01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:40.530
when you're acting like before this shit went down,

1566
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:44.160
they haven't been keeping a safe,
you know,

1567
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.080
they have been since nine 11.
Knock on wood,

1568
01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.070
nothing fucking happened before those stupid body scanners.

1569
01:38:53.071 --> 01:38:55.840
Nothing has fucking happened.
All right,

1570
01:38:56.010 --> 01:39:00.390
we'll find everything is fucking fine.
You don't need those goddamn things.

1571
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.920
You know what's funny is if next week somebody actually does something,

1572
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:09.210
the conspiracy theorists are going to say that the government did it because

1573
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.470
people were refusing those body scanners.
All right?

1574
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:16.110
That's just my opinion,
man.
I seriously,
you know,

1575
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.940
I'm not trying to get head to toe radiation.
I,

1576
01:39:18.941 --> 01:39:23.010
I get that they're trying to fucking keep me safe.
But you know,

1577
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.560
if they truly wanted to keep me fucking safe,

1578
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.220
they wouldn't be shooting the shit and joking the amount of fucking times that

1579
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:33.690
they are when I'm going through.
All right?
And that happens a lot.

1580
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.680
Specifically,

1581
01:39:34.681 --> 01:39:39.150
it's the person who's looking at the TV screen is talking about whatever and his

1582
01:39:39.151 --> 01:39:40.260
joking and laughing,

1583
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:44.760
which you're going to do because they have an unbelievably boring fucking job.

1584
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:48.570
I would be doing the same goddamn thing,
but if they truly gave a fuck,

1585
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.630
they would spend a lot more money on the people that they get to do the security

1586
01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:59.220
rather than these new fangled fucking God damn machines.

1587
01:39:59.221 --> 01:40:03.900
I'm not going through those.
Pat me Down,
give,
give my fucking,
uh,
my ball bag.

1588
01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:07.590
A couple of backhands with the dishwashing gloves.
I don't give a fuck,

1589
01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:08.790
but I'm not going to stand there.

1590
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:11.970
Spread Eagle and end up with cancer or the taint.

1591
01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:17.430
All right?
But you know,
you guys want to do it.
Go ahead and do it.

1592
01:40:17.431 --> 01:40:20.580
I don't give a fuck,
but I hope enough for you.
Say No.

1593
01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:24.990
So it doesn't become mandatory.
All right.
That's it.
All right,

1594
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:28.050
let's get with the advice here.
All right.
Hey,
hey the Ed bill.
Uh,

1595
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:32.070
I need your thoughts in this situation.
This girl I hooked up with was a freak.

1596
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.470
Um,
I never banged her.
I just fingered her and got her off and she blew me.

1597
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:41.430
Her ass was huge.
It was amazing.
She texted,

1598
01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:45.270
she texted me the next day and saying how amazing it was and our crazy,

1599
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:49.490
she got off and loved it.
I thought the next date,
our third was going to be the,

1600
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.040
uh,
a fun sex fest.
No doubt about it.
But I don't know.

1601
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:57.430
She said she didn't want to do this anymore.
She was moving down to Irvine,

1602
01:40:57.550 --> 01:41:01.420
leaving her old apartment that was just a few miles from me and she said we

1603
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:06.380
wouldn't ever hang out again,
so she didn't stay in touch.
Ah.

1604
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:09.850
The one time she,
she was meeting up with friends in Santa Monica,

1605
01:41:09.851 --> 01:41:10.840
my neck of the woods.

1606
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:14.890
We texted back and forth and by the end of the night she flaked again.

1607
01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.290
We'll wait a minute.
You said she's not keeping in touch?

1608
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:19.450
I guess when she left she didn't keep in touch,

1609
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:21.760
but then she texted you when she came back to town.

1610
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:25.260
I'm going to have to assume that because I can't talk to you.
All right.

1611
01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.150
Said you're going to meet it the other night and then she flaked again.

1612
01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.240
She said she liked to rendezvous,
but of course she never did.

1613
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:34.600
Then she asked me why I'm obsessed with seeing her.

1614
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.050
I told her the truth that I had a fun time with her.

1615
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:40.570
We both had a blast and she clearly got off and I figured we could continue this

1616
01:41:40.571 --> 01:41:44.050
good thing we got going.
I didn't directly say I want to fuck her,

1617
01:41:44.051 --> 01:41:47.080
but the point probably came across in the texting.
Uh,

1618
01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:48.760
I'm straightforward with woman bill.
I'm,

1619
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:53.910
I'm also aware of how this girl's Ben and he left out a few words.

1620
01:41:54.011 --> 01:41:56.230
I'm assuming he's saying been messing with my brain.

1621
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.790
I even told her I couldn't shake her rough,
I felt used,

1622
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:05.290
but since we didn't fuck it wasn't a good use,
the mission wasn't complete.

1623
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:08.590
Hot Sex on a player makes the mission and,
uh,
makes the,

1624
01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:13.870
makes the mission complete.
Jesus,
uh,
we don't talk anymore.

1625
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:16.120
I haven't seen her and I'm bummed I never banged her.

1626
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:19.690
I was hoping you might have some insight as to why she suddenly stopped seeing

1627
01:42:19.691 --> 01:42:21.490
me.
She wasn't faking it.

1628
01:42:21.491 --> 01:42:24.900
She was really digging me and suddenly she halted the whole operation before it

1629
01:42:24.901 --> 01:42:28.810
could banger.
What gives me help me out.
Please give me some insight.
All right,

1630
01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:31.780
dude.
Well,
I don't know her and I,

1631
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.830
so I can't really break it down that much.
Uh,

1632
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:40.150
there's a number of reasons why she,
she could have done it all right.

1633
01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:42.370
He said the girl was a freak.
Look,

1634
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:47.371
the fact that all she did was bang you and you're now Jones and four and you're

1635
01:42:48.521 --> 01:42:52.120
saying that she's a freak and everything.
Um,

1636
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.920
and then out of nowhere she said she didn't want to do this anymore is one or

1637
01:42:56.921 --> 01:43:01.600
two things that's either a,
one of those,

1638
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:06.070
those girls who fancies themselves a femme fatale and the light guy getting guys

1639
01:43:06.071 --> 01:43:10.780
all worked up and then just dropping you like a fucking hot potato,
you know,

1640
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:15.970
um,
just to fuck with your head.
There are girls out there that like doing that.

1641
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.513
Um,

1642
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:24.690
but if I had to guess because she actually blew you and did bring you to orgasm,

1643
01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:30.630
I would say that this sounds like a bad girl trying to reform herself or for

1644
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:33.340
people who are more liberal.

1645
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:38.340
This is a woman who's had her fun and she's realizing that when she begins a

1646
01:43:38.501 --> 01:43:43.150
relationship,
the way she did with you,
that uh,

1647
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:44.350
that it doesn't go anywhere,

1648
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.680
but she still loves to fuck and she's fighting that so she moves away.

1649
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:56.030
Maybe she banked so many guys in that area.
She needed a,
she needed a new start.

1650
01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.930
So she's down there and fucking San Diego or wherever the fuck she went,

1651
01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:04.040
and now she's,
you know,
she's being that girl,
you know,
I used to fucking blah,

1652
01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:07.880
blah,
blah,
but now I don't,
you know,
maybe she's looking for her husband,

1653
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.300
so maybe that's why she did it.
I have no fucking idea.

1654
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:14.840
Maybe she's lonely down in San Diego.
She misses her friends.

1655
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:16.640
She comes back and in a moment of weakness,

1656
01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:20.430
she texts you and then she starts crying to her friends,
go and look at me.

1657
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.100
I'm going to hook up with this guy.
I don't even like them.

1658
01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.860
And then they're just like,
go through thin.
Don't do it.

1659
01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:28.190
You don't have to do this.
You're doing so good right now.

1660
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.280
You're not being a whore then.
Then she leaves you hanging.

1661
01:44:31.281 --> 01:44:36.140
But I'll tell you this right now.
You got to let her go.
You gotta let her go.

1662
01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:40.370
All right?
You got to be like,
when it comes to women,

1663
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:44.300
if you're just out there and you want to fuck you gotta be like a relief
pitcher.

1664
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:49.010
All right?
You serve up a fucking meatball and they knock it out of the park.

1665
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:51.650
You can't be throwing your next pitch thinking about the last one.

1666
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:54.170
You got to let the shit go start over again.

1667
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:57.740
So right now what you need to do is go out and find another fucking freak,

1668
01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.710
which you know,
if you're straight forward with women like you are,

1669
01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:01.760
you're going to find one.

1670
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:07.340
And if you really just take the time to try to break them down and see what

1671
01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:09.770
different kinds of women respond to,

1672
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:13.340
you literally become like a fisherman and you know,

1673
01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:15.380
whatever kind of woman you're looking for,

1674
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:18.800
that's the bait you're tossing out there.
All right?

1675
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:21.110
If you're looking for a wife for a serious girlfriend,

1676
01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:24.170
you don't go to a meat market,
you know,
join a softball league,

1677
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.060
take a cooking class or something like that.
Go with a good girls are,
you know,

1678
01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.830
or if you do go out to the meat market,

1679
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.370
look at the one who's actually watching her alcohol intake.

1680
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:38.870
The one who seems to be the responsible one,
responsible,
a wife,

1681
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:43.640
a mother to your children,
right?
And one who doesn't ever stuff all hanging out.

1682
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:48.200
But you know,
if you're looking for who with,
you know,

1683
01:45:50.130 --> 01:45:51.440
it's all kinds of places to go.

1684
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.860
Actually the great thing about whores is they're everywhere.

1685
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.440
That's what I love about him.
You know,

1686
01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.220
it's like bottled water can pretty much get it wherever you go

1687
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.990
now.
You know what I mean?
You got the office whore,
you got the fucking,

1688
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:09.830
the horror at the gym,
you know the one that shows up in full makeup and fucking,

1689
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:14.770
you know,
works out on level one on the stair master.
Oh,
oh.

1690
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:17.840
Looking over his shoulder to see who's checking her out.
Right?

1691
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:22.490
But that girl is a fucking nightmare.
Even if she blows you,

1692
01:46:22.491 --> 01:46:24.080
you're going to have makeup all over your lap.

1693
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.030
Here's the funny,

1694
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:32.370
I finally got to the funniest fucking hour and 10 minutes into the Goddamn

1695
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:34.340
podcast.
Where was it all week?

1696
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:39.910
You know what the reason why this podcast wasn't as funny as usual is because,

1697
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:41.743
you know,

1698
01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.270
I was thinking about all the people who don't get to laugh in the world this

1699
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:50.400
week.
You know this week when we're supposed to give thanks.

1700
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:56.810
Hey England and Australia in Sweden.
Yeah.
We'll throw Denmark in that too.

1701
01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.370
What's up there?
Ireland?

1702
01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:04.440
What he is saying them Madagascar.
Do you guys have any sort of weak like that?

1703
01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:07.440
We have a big feast.
What about the Irish?

1704
01:47:07.441 --> 01:47:09.090
You guys got to have some big thing that you know,

1705
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:13.030
turns into some sort of drunken brawl.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

1706
01:47:13.031 --> 01:47:14.380
Can you go with any more hacky shit?

1707
01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:17.470
Let's go to Scotland and then you put your fucking skirts on,
right?

1708
01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.250
You're fucking scared where he could.
Um,

1709
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:24.020
do you guys have any days like that?
We're,

1710
01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.350
all you supposed to do was just sit down and eat and then there always has to be

1711
01:47:27.351 --> 01:47:30.410
the Debbie Downer who just sits there and starts talking about the less

1712
01:47:30.411 --> 01:47:32.590
fortunate,
you know,

1713
01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:35.410
or one of these fucking celebrities who has to do a little public service

1714
01:47:35.411 --> 01:47:39.010
announcement.
You know,
Jane this week of Thanksgiving,

1715
01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.010
let's not forget about those Colombian minors.

1716
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.680
So wherever the fuck they were from,
oh wait,
they got rescued.

1717
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:48.100
But still they were down in that hole for a long time.

1718
01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.690
I like how this is like the one time of year too,

1719
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:54.300
when people all of a sudden go out and they want to feed a homeless guy.

1720
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:55.631
You know,

1721
01:47:55.631 --> 01:47:58.030
I had a buddy of mine did that and he went down there and they thought that they

1722
01:47:58.031 --> 01:48:00.190
were all going to be fucking high five of them and they were actually,

1723
01:48:00.191 --> 01:48:01.600
they actually got pissed at him.
They're like,
well,

1724
01:48:01.601 --> 01:48:04.720
where the fuck are you are the other 11 months of the year?
And he was like,
wow,

1725
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:08.470
that's a good point.
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast for this week.

1726
01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:12.430
