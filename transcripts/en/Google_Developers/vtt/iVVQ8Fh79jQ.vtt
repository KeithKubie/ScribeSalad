00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:05.790
VLADIMIR MAKEEV: I
am Vladimir Makeev.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.890
I'm CEO of Surf, and
we build mobile apps

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.230
and machine-learning solutions.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.560
We have a strong design team
and strong development team.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.220
We know everything about
the lastest technologists

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.770
in the world.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.790
We share a special Google
list of these technologies.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.660
And when some new
project comes to us,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.960
we just look in on this table
and check if some technology

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.250
fits to this project.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.680
And we decide, yes,
this technology

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.470
will be nice for this client.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.929
VADIM MAZIN: A lot of people
say that we are all friends,

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:38.970
and we are like a family.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.240
But Surf, it's a reality.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.130
My name is Vadim.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.630
I'm a PR Director at Surf.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.220
We were among the
first companies

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.740
in the world who were
certified by Google.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.715
This lets us have access to a
lot of early access programs.

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:53.590
EVGENY SATUROV: This is
two-way communication

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.720
between Surf and Google.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.630
And we get all these
early access services.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.810
But we also give
Google feedback.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.360
And Google helps
us with problems

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.420
we have sometimes with
these new features.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.550
VADIM MAZIN: For
example, recently we've

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.490
had a very cool experience
with instant apps.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.170
We've had a very
good opportunity

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.930
to develop an app for
our favorite bookstore

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.500
and transfer everything we love
about it into a mobile app.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.910
It was a very
challenging mission

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.850
because the bookstore
itself is very complicated.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.510
We've discovered that it took
more than 100 screens to just

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.194
cover the functionality.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.110
EVGENY SATUROV: Labirint
is one of the largest

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.520
bookstore in Russia.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.040
Instant apps allow
us to convert people

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.160
who just Google the book
to the real customer

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.992
without even installing the app.

00:01:40.992 --> 00:01:42.700
VADIM MAZIN: Recently,
we started working

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.410
on our very own product.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.950
It's a machine-learning solution
for prediction analytics.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.940
It helps retailers.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.970
It helps airlines
to predict sales,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.150
to optimize logistics
and supply chains,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.060
and find the optimal
prices for each situation.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.310
We've used TensorFlow for it.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.090
We've developed it for a
very specific retailing

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.140
company in Russia.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.990
But as it turned
out, the solution

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.070
can be applied to other spheres
from industry production,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.320
airlines, hotels because
prediction analysis is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.550
kind of a multi-tool right now.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.190
Being certified means
certain standards

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.840
that we apply to ourselves.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.270
We need to become
better each year.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.640
Google guides us by giving
us access to technologies,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.125
by giving us advice,
by giving us reviews.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.000
VLADIMIR MAKEEV: The
main goal of the program

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.910
is to make the apps
of the world better

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.730
because you can focus on
really important things for you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.200
like improving yourself--

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.226
VADIM MAZIN: --and more free
time to spend with your family.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:45.850
VLADIMIR MAKEEV: --or
just sleep a lot.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.000
