00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.210
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.
So last week I

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.400
described collective pitch control for a helicopter, 
I described cyclic pitch

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.580
control for a helicoper, and I also 
described anti-torque pitch contol

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.790
But this week we're going to combine them all and describe something called collective-cyclic pitch mixing.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.980
It's pretty cool, and it's basically how every helicopter pilot flies,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100
including Carl in this case.
The way I'm gonna describe this to you is by setting up

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.290
and showing you a high speed video clip of Carl 
flipping the helicopter over and flying inverted.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.490
[rotor noise] You're about centre of the frame, maybe a little less right there.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.670
[rotor noise]

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.860
[rotor noise] That's gonna be good.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.220
It's pretty interesting, because if you think about it he's having

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.390
to use both collective and cyclic to make the sweep, go up, and then he's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.490
going back to negative collective.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.630
[music]

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.000
And then he's balancing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.170
it up there with cyclic all the time. So you can see he's never using

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.210
one particular input. It's always a variation of both. OK so if you

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.260
didn't really understand what was going on there, I asked Carl to do something else for us.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.450
I asked him to mount a camera on the back of his helicopter looking at the swashplate, and then

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480
take a normal flight so you could see the collective-cyclic mixing, but here's a couple of things to

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.680
keep in mind. At the top of the screen you're going to see the rotors, and at some point it's gonna look like

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.870
the rotors are bending. That's actually not happening. What you're seeing there is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.050
something called the rolling shutter effect. The second thing you're gonna see it looks like the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.230
rotor shaft is speeding up and slowing down wildly. That has to do with the frame rate of the camera.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.410
That's called aliasing. If you want to know what aliasing is, just click this box over

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.500
here and I'll explain that to you in greater detail.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.690
[electronic servo sounds]

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.040
[music]

00:02:13.060 --> 00:03:06.870
            

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.050
[music]

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:56.770
          

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
OK I've been getting a lot of comments on these 
videos about whether or not an actual

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.090
helicopter can do these types of manouvres. 
And the answer is yes, and no.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.160
Helicopters can do this if they're designed for it, 
however you're limited by

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.330
the meat servo sitting in the seat. A human can only 
take so much accelleration.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.370
So how do you scale up what you're seeing on this RC helicopter to a real

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.410
helicopter? Before they flew a space shuttle into space they had to do a wind tunnel test

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.460
on it somehow right? Well it gets complicated but there's a term called similitude

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.500
and similitude has to do with the geometric

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.670
kinematic and the dynamic similarity between a small scale object and a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.850
full scale object. Engineers do this all the time, especially aerospace engineers.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.040
So anyway, go look at the wiki link I'm gonna put below and read up on similitude

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.220
so you can understand it. I will tell you this. It has something to do with continuum mechanics

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.400
which is by far the hardest course I've ever taken in my life. So if you must know

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.570
there's a city in Florida named Destin, and the thrift store there is the coolest place

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.760
on earth for me personally. Anyway next week's video will blow your mind.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.910
It's really complicated but it's really interesting, so

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.080
if you can understand it you're doing pretty good, but it blew my mind.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.260
It's gonna blow yours too. 
Have a good one, and get Smarter Every Day.
