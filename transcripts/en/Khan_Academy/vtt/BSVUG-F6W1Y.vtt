00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.000
Problem 12.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.160
The prime factorization
of a natural number.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.020
You can kind of view that
as positive integers.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.750
Sometimes they'll throw a 0 in
the natural number definition,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.770
depending on what context
you're working in.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.780
But the prime factorization of
a natural number n can be

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.130
written as n is equal to pr
squared, where p and r are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.610
distinct prime numbers.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.580
Fair enough.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.420
How many factors does n have,
including 1 and itself?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.710
Well, they're saying that this
is some natural number that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.620
can be written this way.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.060
Let's just pick one example.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.320
So if we just set p-- I'm just
going to pick some prime

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
numbers here-- p is equal to 2
and r is equal to 3, then n is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
equal to p times r squared,
times 3 squared, which is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.480
equal to 2 times 9, which
is equal to 18.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.320
This is just one instance--
one n that satisfies these

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.770
conditions.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.930
I could have picked 5 and 7, or
I could have picked 3 and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.330
2, but all of them should have
the same answer, because

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.200
that's what this question
is implying.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.630
So this is a possible n.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.990
And then how many factors
does it have?

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.930
Let's factor it out.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.770
It's got 1 and 18,
2 and 9, 3 and 6.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.710
So it's got 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 factors.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.540
So the answer is D.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.540
And you could try it out with
other numbers, if you like.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.060
Make p is equal to-- make
p equal to 3, and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.660
make r equal to 2.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.520
Then you'd have 3 times
2, times 2.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.950
You'd have the number 12, and
you'd see its factors are 1

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.780
and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.550
So you'll see the same thing,
exactly six factors.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.970
Problem 13.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.790
Given pn is equal to 150, where
p is a prime number and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.520
n is a natural number, which of
the following must be true?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.860
So, let's just think about it.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.110
What are all the possible
values for p?

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.620
To do that, we'd have to
figure out the prime

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.540
factorization of 150.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.020
I'll do that in black.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.900
So 150, let's do its prime
factorization.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.680
That's 2 times 75.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.260
75 is 3 times 25.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.630
25 is 5 times 5.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.670
So 150 is equal to 2 times
3, times 5, times 5.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.980
That's its prime
factorization.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.730
So p could be any of
these numbers.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.380
So for example, p could be-- if
p was 2, then n would be 3

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620
times 5, times 5.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.890
If p were 3, then n would
be 2 times 5, times 5.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.910
If p were 5, then n would be
2 times 3, times 5, right?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.190
Let me write this, make this
a little bit clearer.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.390
These are my p's, because p
has to be one of the prime

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.060
factors of 150, and then n is
whatever's left over when you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.000
divide by that p, right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.580
In each of these cases.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.700
So let's look at the choices.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.520
Which of the following
must be true?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.380
p is a factor of either
10 or 15.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.060
Let's see, 2 is a
factor of 10.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.130
3 is a factor of 15.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.350
5 is a factor of
both 10 or 15.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.190
So that actually looks like
the correct answer.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.080
Let's write that, let's
square that right now.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.340
Let's look at the other choices,
just to make sure we

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.890
haven't missed anything.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.740
10 is a factor of n.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.720
Well, let's see, over here--
well, no, 10 is not a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.630
factor of this n.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.290
3 times 5, times 5 is 75.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.710
10 is not a factor of this
number, so it's not going-- 10

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.670
is a factor of these two
choices, but this is a

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.720
possible n right here.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.610
75 could be n.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.600
So this is not the
correct answer.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.420
n is a factor of either
10 or 15.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.190
n is a factor.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.640
Remember these are our
n's right here.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.380
These are the potential n's.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.260
This is not a factor of--
this is neither a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.680
factor of 10 nor 15.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.360
10 and 15 are smaller numbers
than all of these over here.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.330
So this is not the answer.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.210
And then 15 is a factor of n.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.790
15 is a factor of n.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.810
So in order to have 15 to
be a factor, you have

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.875
to have a 3 in there.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.500
Now you look at this
choice, right here.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.950
2 times 5, times 5.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.830
This is 50.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.890
This n right here is 50.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.760
15 is not a factor of 50.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.970
So our first inclination
was correct.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.320
p is a factor of either
10 or 15.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.570
Next problem.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.550
All right.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.820
The greatest common factor
of n and 540 is 36.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.440
Which of the following
could be the prime

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.940
factorization of n?

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.480
So let's just think about
this a little bit.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.580
The greatest common factor of
n and 540, so the largest

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.750
number that goes into
both 540 and this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.470
mystery number n is 36.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.150
Which of the following
could be the prime

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.930
factorization of n?

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.000
Let's just take the prime
factorization of everything,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.880
just so we can kind of go down
to the most digestible parts.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.980
So the prime factorization of
540, let's see, 2 times 70.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.050
This is the same thing as 3
times 90, and 90 is 3 times

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.500
30, and 30 is 3 times
10, 10 is 2 times 5.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.580
So the prime factorization of
540 is equal to-- there's two

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.460
2's here-- so it's equal to
2 squared times 3 to the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.190
third, times 5.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.070
That's 540's prime
factorization.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.940
Now, the greatest common factor
of n and 540 is 36.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.710
36 is equal to what?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.300
That's-- I'll do it right
here-- 36 is 2 times 18.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.990
That's 2 times 9, and
that is 3 times 3.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.120
So 36 is equal to 2 squared
times 3 squared.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:10.330
So, n has to be some multiple
of this that does not

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.370
still go into 540.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.280
Let me show you what I mean.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.850
Let's see which of these
could be possible prime

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.610
factorizations of n.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.440
So A is 2 times 3 squared.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.730
Well, that doesn't work because
remember, n, this

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.890
right here, 36 has to be
divisible into our n.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.160
36, or 2 squared times 3 squared
is not divisible into

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.340
this, because we don't have
a 2 squared here.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.870
So A is not our choice.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.720
I'll do it in red when
I knock out choices.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.300
So A is not our answer.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.030
2 squared times 3 squared.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.810
This is tempting, because 36
definitely goes into 2 squared

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.840
times 3 to the third.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.420
Sorry, this is 2 squared
times 3 to the third.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.560
2 squared times 3 squared
definitely goes into that.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.220
In fact, it goes into
it three times.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.730
This is 36 times 3 right
here, right?

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.740
Because the difference between
this number and this number is

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.680
the power of 3, and this one
has a higher power of 3.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.320
So 36 definitely goes
into this number.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.300
But we have to be
very careful.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.170
This number, this number right
here, also goes into 540.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:20.950
If n was this number right here,
then n would go into

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.810
540, because this is 2 squared
times 3 to the third, 2

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.950
squared times 3 to the third.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.680
Then the greatest common factor
of n and 540 would be

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.110
this, instead of this.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.470
So this can't be our answer
because if this was our n,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.050
then n would be the greatest
common factor of n and 540.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.640
So this can't be our choice,
because this is actually a

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.980
larger number that goes
into 540, than

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.290
this one, right here.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.100
Let's look at choice C.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.160
2 to the fourth times
3 squared, times 7.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.460
This looks good, because
36 definitely

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.660
goes into this number.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.665
2 squared definitely goes
into 2 to the fourth.

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:03.070
It goes into it four times.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.980
3 squared definitely goes
into 3 squared.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.180
And then we're multiplying
it by 7.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.600
And what's good about this is
we're multiplying it by a

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.470
number or a factor that's
not in 540.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.530
So this looks like our best
choice right here.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.420
This looks like our
best choice.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.450
Let's look at the last choice,
just to make sure we haven't

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.750
missed something.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.710
2 to the fourth times
3 to the fifth.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.470
This part, right here, is
definitely a multiple of our

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.380
greatest common factor, so
it looks good so far.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.740
But then we do it times 5.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.500
If this was our n, if this,
right here, was our n, then

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.409
the greatest common factor
of this number and 540

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.100
would not be 36.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.920
It would be-- let's see, we
would have 2 to the squared,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.050
because that's the largest power
of 2 that goes into both

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.050
of them, it would be 2 squared
times 3 to the third, times 3

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.780
the third right-- because that's
the largest power of 3

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.340
that goes into both-- times 5.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.490
The greatest common factor of
this number and 540 is this,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.320
which just happens to be 540.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.720
So it can't be this
choice right here.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.130
And you get to the same
argument on choice B.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.150
The greatest common factor
of choice B and 540 is 2

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.660
squared-- because 2 squared goes
into both numbers-- times

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.890
3 to the third, which is a
very different number.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.850
Or not a very different number,
it's 3 times 36.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.830
So that's the other rationale
for why B is not

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.120
a legitimate answer.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.670
Next problem, 15.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.520
Scroll down a little bit.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.230
A shipping container.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.130
A shipping container measures 8
feet by 12 feet by 24 feet.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:41.970
Let me draw that.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.370
So we have 8 feet by 12
feet, and there's 24

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.500
feet, just like that.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.100
So it maybe looks something
like that.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.150
That's actually what shipping
containers really do look

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.890
like, looks something
like that.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.150
The container is to be filled
with identical cube-shaped

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.630
boxes, each having
sides measuring a

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.130
whole number of feet.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.080
Which of the following
expressions represents the

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.150
smallest number of such
identical boxes that could be

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:14.160
packed into the container with
no empty space remaining?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.030
They say the smallest number
of identical boxes, which

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.910
means we want to get the biggest
possible, we need the

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.860
biggest possible boxes that
can be fit-- cubic boxes--

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.510
that can be fit into this
container with no space.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.330
So the dimensions of those boxes
have to be the greatest

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.610
common factor of
8, 12, and 24.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.970
So we could write this
right there.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.110
Dimensions or, let me say the
box side, has to be equal to

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.630
the greatest common factor
of 8, 12, and 24.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.590
So what's the biggest number the
goes into 8, 12, and 24?

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.660
You could do this
from inspection.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.750
It's 4.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.040
And you can verify that.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.420
If the boxes were 4 on a side,
then in this dimension you'd

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.415
fit 8 divided by 4 of
them, or 2 of them.

00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:58.840
So you'd have one, two boxes
in that dimension.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.760
In this dimension, over
here, you would have

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.310
three of them, right?

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.750
12 divided by 4.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.040
You'd have three boxes
in that dimension.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.980
And in that dimension, you would
have-- let me draw these

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.550
just like that-- you
would have six.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.200
You would have 6, or
24 divided by 4.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.260
So if you want to know the
total number of boxes you

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.130
fit-- I'm just looking at the
choices, they didn't actually

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.250
do the math-- they say, well,
in this dimension, I have 8

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.600
divided by 4 boxes.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.230
In this dimension, I have
12 divided by 4 boxes.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.960
And in this dimension, I have
24 divided by 4 boxes.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.630
So that's how many
boxes we can fit.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.710
We could multiply it out, but
this is actually one of our

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.160
choices, right there.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.770
So the whole key is just to
realize, well, look, if the

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.500
boxes have to be cubes, and
there's no remaining spaces,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.840
the dimension of the boxes has
to be divisible into all three

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.520
of these-- all three
of these-- numbers.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.730
And I want the biggest possible
dimension because we

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.370
want the smallest number of
boxes, and that's where we got

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.550
the greatest common
factor of 4.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.520
And then you say, OK, 4, and if
we have boxes of dimension

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.140
4 feet, and in this direction
we're only going to be able to

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.340
fit 8 divided by 4, this
direction 12 divided by 4, and

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.330
this direction 24
divided by 4.
