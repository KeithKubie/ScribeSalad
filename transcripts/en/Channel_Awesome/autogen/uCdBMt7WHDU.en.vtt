still the initial idea is I'm because
 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
still the initial idea is I'm because
this<00:05:08.770><c> sounds</c><00:05:09.070><c> like</c><00:05:09.130><c> it</c><00:05:09.400><c> should</c><00:05:09.580><c> make</c><00:05:09.760><c> itself</c>

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it should make itself
 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it should make itself
you<00:05:10.600><c> know</c><00:05:10.720><c> or</c><00:05:10.930><c> you</c><00:05:11.080><c> Owen</c><00:05:11.440><c> it's</c><00:05:11.650><c> a</c><00:05:11.770><c> cookie</c><00:05:12.160><c> that</c>

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start position:0%
so it should really can make itself but
 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
so it should really can make itself but
this<00:05:18.280><c> is</c><00:05:18.550><c> much</c><00:05:18.910><c> closer</c><00:05:19.240><c> this</c><00:05:19.630><c> is</c><00:05:19.690><c> actually</c>
