inspired by some of my teachers in
 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.580
inspired by some of my teachers in
physics and I decided to prepare a PhD I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
physics and I decided to prepare a PhD I
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680
physics and I decided to prepare a PhD I
was at the beginning I was hesitating

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
was at the beginning I was hesitating
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.520
was at the beginning I was hesitating
between science and arts and so I was

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
between science and arts and so I was
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.709
between science and arts and so I was
inspired by height painters directors of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
inspired by height painters directors of
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.380
inspired by height painters directors of
movies as well as by scientists and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
movies as well as by scientists and
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.779
movies as well as by scientists and
during the first year of my university I

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789
during the first year of my university I
 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.619
during the first year of my university I
short a movies and I was very attracted

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

and but then I was also inspired by some
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700
and but then I was also inspired by some
of my professor in physics and finally

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
of my professor in physics and finally
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280
of my professor in physics and finally
decide to prepare iperion physics and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
decide to prepare iperion physics and
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.210
decide to prepare iperion physics and
during this phase ed I understood what I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
during this phase ed I understood what I
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090

was fascinating the research and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
was fascinating the research and
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640
was fascinating the research and
discovering new landscape in the field

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
discovering new landscape in the field
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.490
discovering new landscape in the field
of knowledge and so finally a westec to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
of knowledge and so finally a westec to
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.549
of knowledge and so finally a westec to
physics from this time
