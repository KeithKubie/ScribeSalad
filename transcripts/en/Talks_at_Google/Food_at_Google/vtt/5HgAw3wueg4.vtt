00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.990
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome everybody.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.210
My name is Mark Bello.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.790
My assistants: the lovely Jenny over here
and that's Sam.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.870
A little bit about what I do.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.460
Any pizza makers in the house by the way?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.460
Yes.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.990
What are those?

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.320
Kind of like a?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.429
Like bagels, is that what you're talking about
or English muffins?

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.679
&gt;&gt;male audience member #1: I try.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Try.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.289
Alright.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.289
Other pizza makers?

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.289
Dough makers?

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.220
People that make their own dough?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.220
Yep.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.440
So, so my business is called Pizza a Casa
Pizza School.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.680
We also affectionately call it the Pizza Self-Sufficiency
Center and uh, well in a nutshell what happened,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm born here, Mt. Sinai Hospital, and grew
up in West Chester and then Essex County,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.910
New Jersey.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.579
So I love the pizzas of New York, New Jersey,
New Haven, has anyone been up to New Haven

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.579
for pizza?

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Yes.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
Pepe's or Sally's?

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.579
Or both, right?

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt;female audience member #1: [inaudible]

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: And Modern, right, so.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.720
But, so I love the pizzas from here and I
found myself in college in St. Louis and then

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.480
grad school in Chicago, and you know, when
I was out there, I mean I loved the Midwest,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.400
but to say the pizzas were not the pizzas
that I grew up eating.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.490
You know, in all fairness to deep dish, I
mean though my bracelet does say "death before

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.470
deep dish" on it, I, I will enjoy a slice
of deep dish when in Chicago, but to me, it's

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.740
more of a casserole than it is, you know,
the thin crust sort of slices I grew up eating.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720
So when I went over, when I come home to visit
my parents, you know, Thanksgiving break,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.110
winter break, straight from the airport; my
favorite slice shop in Milburn, New Jersey,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.860
La Strada Pizzeria is still there.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.930
Then throughout the visit I would go to all
my favorite spots throughout New York, New

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.930
Jersey.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.250
If you guys later on wanna geek out about
like where to go, if you want to tell me some

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.200
new places, I'm down to hear it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.850
And not only to eat pizzas, but to get extra
pizzas, because I had this whole system of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.000
transporting slices back to Chicago.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.390
You know, each slice, first of all, don't
close the box till it's perfectly cool, so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.280
you don't, you know, get the pizza all soggy.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.470
Then wrap each slice tightly in foil, individually,
tightly in foil to prevent freezer burn, and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.040
then into a Ziploc labeled into my mom's freezer
in Jersey and then back to Chicago in my suitcase

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.220
in one of those soft cooler bags.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.220
So I did this for a while.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.420
My friends would, you know, tease me and simultaneously
they'd sneak into my apartment and steal slices

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
out of the freezer.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940
So, you know, I've cooked all my life.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.920
But one thing I'd never done is I'd never
done anything involving yeast, because I was

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
intimidated.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.910
Was the yeast gonna work, was it not gonna
work?

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
And a good buddy of mine, a guy named Neal,
grew up working in the pizza biz since he

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.200
was like 14 years old and we were out late
one night, you know we could go to a White

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.970
Castle, we were starving, we could go to a
White Castle, we could go to a diner and instead

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.640
you know Neal's like "this pizza thing is
ridiculous, you should start making your own."

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.590
So we went to the supermarket and bought the
yeast and the flour and the cheese and all

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.690
that and so began this quest on not just how
do you make a pizza at home.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.280
But how do you really get like a dynamite
crust?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.300
You know, good balance of crispiness and breadiness,
good balance of flavor and all that, given

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.430
the limitations of your, your home kitchen,
you know?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.630
Does anyone have a pizza oven?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.790
Yet, right?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.260
That's what we like to say.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.650
So what I was doing was playing around with
a, I had an electric, domestic, you know,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.590
home oven in my apartment.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.900
And we, these late night sessions would start,
you know about sunrise we'd still be checking

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.650
out slices and all that.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.990
So today for the class what I've got here,
this is a 500 degree electric portable convection

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.560
oven, so essentially simulating what your
home situation is.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.120
And in our classroom and we're gonna cue a
video in a second here, what we have is we

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.650
assemble a group of folks, you know, it's,
it's a lot of fun because people don't really

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.430
know each other before the class starts and
at the end of class everyone's swappin' slices,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.880
e-mail addresses, all that.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.489
And anyway, what we teach is how to, you know,
get this great pizza given the limitations

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.489
of your home kitchen.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.440
So you'll notice in the video our oven is
just an electric domestic oven.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.290
It tops out at 525 degrees and that, you know,
maintaining the heat in your oven with a good

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.560
baking stone in there and then paying attention
to the little tips and techniques that we

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.259
impart in the class, you know, will, will
show you how to how to get this great pie.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.620
But anyway, do you guys wanna cue that video
and take a look?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.180
[music begins]

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:31.210
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Well my name is Mark Bello and
this is my place, it's called Pizza a Casa.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.760
Pizza a Casa means pizza at home.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:43.020
This is something that can easily people get
together with their friends and their family

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.981
and they say, let's, let's make Pizza a Casa.

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:50.310
And so here it's a cooking school and what
we do is we, very specifically we teach people

00:04:50.310 --> 00:05:02.800
how to make a really dynamite pizza given
the limitations of, of the home kitchens.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.249
All kinds of people come to our classes.

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.690
Some people are practicing pizza makers who
want to just take their pizza making to the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.770
next level and other people have never touched
flour in their life.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.520
And everybody, after the four-hour class that
we have, leave pizza proficient and able to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.650
replicate this in their own ovens.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:35.860
[pause]
During the course of our pizza class, we're

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:44.069
gonna teach you all the little tips and techniques
that really get a dynamite crust, great balance

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:50.860
of flavor, given the limitations of your home
oven.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.319
So you know the lessons that we have here,
I've been making pizza for a decade plus,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.889
and the course is to fast forward you past
all of the limp, lifeless, soggy pies that

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:07.360
I had to endure and just take you right to
the, to the main event.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.009
[music ends]

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.370
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: So that's our space.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.370
We're down on the Lower East Side.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.089
If you guys know the Doughnut Plant, we're
very, you guys familiar with the Doughnut?

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.110
Oh yeah, trouble.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.650
We're a couple doors down, right next to Kossar's
Bialys, there's sort of a round food theme

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.120
going on where we are, so.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120
Ok.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.949
So I'm gonna make three pizzas today and three
different pizzas.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.909
Actually six in total because they'll be enough
slices for all of you guys to have a little

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:35.909
taste.

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.869
And then also we did a menu for the TGIAF.

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:42.089
Has, have people had the sandwiches yet that
we did or the vegetable dishes and stuff?

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:43.089
Oh, ok.

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.139
Yeah Jason and his crew were rockin' those
out.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.199
So the first pizza is Margherita, you know.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.509
The very, the classic, you know, tomato sauce,
mozzarella, basil pizza, which by the way

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.740
very intentionally the colors of the Italian
flag.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.169
To me the Margherita represents like the perfect
pizza.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.279
And when I go to a new place, whatever sort
of you know quail egg, truffle, shaved asparagus

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.439
thing they're gonna tempt me with, I have
to get a Margherita, 'cause that's the equalizer,

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.389
you know, just to see how it is.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:16.240
And, and this pizza really I think also demonstrates
the fundamentals of how to get just a really

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.400
great pizza, again, in your home oven.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.199
Something I like to say a lot is "less is
more."

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.619
You know?

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:24.479
And you'll see.

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.409
So first of all here's our dough, nicely risen
up in the container here.

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:33.680
And very simply I can point you to our dough
recipe on the web site as well.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.149
Smooth surface to work your dough.

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.389
And I dust this with some all-purpose flour.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:46.379
And then remove the dough, gentle to not tear
up.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:52.399
Yeast has been doing all this nice leavening
in there and you want to maintain that.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:59.919
Alright, a little flour on the top.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:05.349
Something I like to tell people too is an
amoebic pizza tastes better than a circular

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:10.539
pizza that you overwork to make a circle,
because you know really just hammering that

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:14.699
pizza to try to get it perfectly symmetrical,
you're taking all the, all the breath of the

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:18.770
yeast out of the dough and it gets very flat
and that's where you get your cardboardy crust.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.789
So, you know, I'll show you how to get a circle
and it takes a little practice, but don't

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:24.789
be fixated on it.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:29.069
If your pizza starts looking like the shape
of Alaska or something like that, it's all

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:30.069
good.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:37.149
Alright, so first thing, just a very gentle
touch, I'm just patting my dough down.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.599
And I press it all the way to the edge.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:44.099
I don't have to force a thicker outer edge
to get that that puffy handle or in Italian

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:46.670
called the cornicione.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:52.959
I just leave the center ever so slightly thicker
because as my circle gets bigger, the center's

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.740
gonna thin and I want to leave myself a little
bit of slack in there.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.329
Alright, so my hands fit on there nice, I
wanna check is this movin' and groovin' on

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:09.370
the marble, so I give it one more, it's like
in between periods in a hockey game, Zamboni

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:17.069
comes out, smooth that up and then nice glide.

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:23.060
Alright, and this is a move that I picked
up about three years ago just totally by accident.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.510
I got to make pizzas in this Italian restaurant
with a wood-burning oven, and the first night

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.620
I went, I was, the chef invited me to come,
I'd never cooked in a wood-burning oven, made

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.110
some pizzas, they apparently were good enough
to send to the customers.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.480
The customers didn't send 'em back, so that
was a good sign, so they invited me back the

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.589
second night and little did I know that the
pizza chef basically considered me now trained,

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:46.540
so he just didn't show up, Saturday night.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.500
So I'm there and I'm totally in the weeds,
trying to, you know, keep up the pace.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.029
And the owner comes over and shows me this
move and I have since dubbed this the DJ,

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:58.610
because it reminds me very much of sort of
like a record scratching sort of a routine.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.879
But very simply you're just pulling the outer
edge of the dough to stretch it into a circle,

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:08.420
so one hand is just applying enough pressure
just to hold it so when I pull it, it doesn't

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.440
slip out from my hand.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:21.750
And I'll show ya. [pause] You see the dough
is spinning around by itself as I go? [pause]

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.350
Voilá.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.940
Cool.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.540
Anybody?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.139
[applause]

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:36.129
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: That's it, alright.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:43.791
So, ok, so I'm gonna stretch out two of these,
so I can get a peel here and this is some

00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.791
semolina flour.

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:50.220
This is what I'm gonna use as a release on
my peel, the big spatula thingy, also called

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.050
a peel, p-e-e-l.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.629
If you don't know any of the terms that I
use today, you can Google them.

00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:57.629
No, just kidding.

00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:58.629
[laughter]

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:00.040
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Like you've not heard that before.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040
Sorry.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.709
Alright, let me stretch this guy out here
and then I'll start demonstrating that.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:08.709
Ok, once again, circle out.

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:09.709
Some flour down.

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:10.709
[pause]

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:11.709
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: So thin semolina,
right?

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:12.709
The sort of thing that you use in pasta.

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:13.709
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: The, I'm sorry?

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:14.709
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: Thin semolina,
right?

00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:21.150
The sort of thing that you use in pasta.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:29.259
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: The semolina is a coarse, it's
the like the durum wheat that used for like

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:30.259
making pasta.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:35.360
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: There is also the
coarse semolina that’s the texture of [inaudible].

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Texture of?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.379
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: [inaudible] you
actually can see the grains.

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:39.379
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:41.620
These, you know what later on I'll, I'll give
you a shake of this.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.959
It's, it's pretty gritty.

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:46.140
I mean essentially it's like ball bearings
on there, that's gonna allow the pizza to

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.730
roll right off of the peel.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.069
The other thing I like about semolina is that
a little bit of it is gonna stick on the bottom

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:55.810
of the crust, and so it toasts, and you get
this nice added textural crunch.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.269
And it also gets a kind of a nice, a little
subtle nutty flavor to it when it toasts.

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:04.279
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: [inaudible] two
brands of semolina, the finer or the coarser,

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.280
I'm trying to figure out which one.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.480
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: This is the coarser of the two,
yeah, that I'm using here.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.430
I buy this, I mean, for pasta making it's
the same stuff that I use, this is the Italian

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.430
stuff.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.600
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: [inaudible]

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.689
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:21.459
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: The coarse, it's
like grits.

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:22.459
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh, like.

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:23.459
Oh, ok.

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.730
You know like in New Haven they use cornmeal
to dust their pizza peels, and they make it

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.139
work, I mean, because I find cornmeal accumulates
a lot on your, on your baking stone, starts

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:37.279
to burn and you know I mean I love a charred
pizza, but it gets this sort of bitter thing

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.279
going on.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:43.259
They know how to rock it in New Haven, I don't
know, but for me the semolina I find is utili,

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:48.470
you know works great for releasing the pizza
and then also gives you that nice texture

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.410
and added flavor.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.959
Ok.

00:12:53.959 --> 00:13:01.600
Thank you, sir.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:10.879
[pause] Alright, all these little imperfections,
or perceived imperfections here, leave 'em

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:11.879
be.

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:15.639
'Cause you know if you start to sort of overwork
this here, that's where you're gonna get that

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:19.319
flat cardboardy crust, and if you leave that,
that's all gonna rise up and be beautiful

00:13:19.319 --> 00:13:21.149
and bready and crispy.

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:24.120
In a few minutes you're gonna taste this.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.279
Fresh mozzarella.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:30.569
This is from a place in Little Italy called
Alleva, which is actually the oldest Italian

00:13:30.569 --> 00:13:32.449
cheese shop in the United States.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:36.410
They've been making mozzarella since 1892.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:45.709
But you know, if I don't have my, my Italian
you know mom and pop shop mozzarella, in the

00:13:45.709 --> 00:13:50.910
supermarket, you know, we would be buying
the low moisture, whole milk balls of mozzarella.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.920
Not the part skim, the whole milk, more flavor
and it's gonna melt a lot better.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.779
And you're gonna see, you don't have to use
a lot to actually get this going.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:03.740
So I'll cut this in some slabs.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:10.449
[pause] This here and get my sauce prepped
as well.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.269
So the sauce too.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:13.529
Crazy simple.

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:16.540
And I stirred hours to figure this out.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.860
But basically this is something that's called
passata, which is a, means puree in Italian.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.470
It's an Italian tomato puree.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.490
But your, your pureed tomatoes, good quality
tomatoes, and this is you know about a $3.00

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:34.800
bottle right here, I can get about six pizzas
out of here.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:43.790
[pause] Some nice fresh garlic.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:50.689
And then with either a garlic press or a microplane,
one of these graters here, what I do is per

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:57.000
bottle of passata, which is a 28 ounce bottle,
or if I'm doing canned, canned pureed tomatoes,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.890
it's a 28 ounce bottle, or 28 ounce can, three
cloves of garlic grated in there.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:10.209
So yeah, what I like a lot about the microplane
is you get that nice paste going on.

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:27.980
So that's gonna melt right into the sauce.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.680
[pause] And that's sauce.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680
Simple, eh?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.930
You're gonna see, it actually, this is gonna
cook on the pizza in the oven.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.879
So right now if you were to taste this, you
would be tasting that garlic for the rest

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:42.450
of the day, but for the six to ten minutes
that these pizzas are gonna bake, it's gonna,

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.970
you're gonna have nice bright tomato flavor,
the garlic's gonna be there.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.279
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: So if you go to
like the store and get like cans of Hunts

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:53.500
crushed tomatoes or whatever, it's the right
consistency?

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.709
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes.

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:57.309
Some tend to be a little thicker than others.

00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:58.980
This is puree as opposed to crushed.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.899
Crushed is a little bit thicker preparation.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:05.819
And different purees have like different viscosities,
I mean this is kind of what I'm looking for.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:09.529
But you know it's just sort of a trial and
error thing, you know, find a puree that you

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:10.529
like.

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.740
And it doesn't have to be you know like fancy
imported Italian, I mean of course these are

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.860
delightful tomatoes and I've got another bottle
up here if anyone wants to come up and take

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.860
a taste.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.129
But you know a lot of domestic brands, California
brands, Canadian tomatoes.

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:27.850
We, we hosted a tomato tasting event at our
shop and winning tomatoes, Luigi Vitelli from

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.250
Canada for the whole peel, so.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:35.540
You know, so first thing that's going on my
pizza is not the sauce, it's actually the

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.600
cheese.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.720
This is a point often in our classes where
people you know coming in during the meet

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.350
and greet they're like, oh, you know I'm a
pizza maker, but one of the problems is my

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.930
pizzas never cook right, you know, they're
gummy, they're soggy, they're undercooked,

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:50.930
like what am I doing wrong?

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.420
And at this point in the demo, they're like,
wait a minute, you're not gonna put more cheese

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.009
on there?

00:16:56.009 --> 00:17:00.660
And that's the thing is that overtopping the
pizza, the pizza doesn't cook.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.069
So, and how did I figure this out?

00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:04.800
Totally by accident because what happened
was.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.700
You wanna start breaking this up here?

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.780
Sam, if you guys.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.780
I'll do that.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.670
I figured this out because like one day, you
know, I was hungry, I had a ball of dough.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.420
I had a little mozzarella, I had a little
sauce.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.550
Not as much as I normally would use to make
a pizza, but I made it anyway.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.950
And it was the best pizza I'd ever made.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.720
And then I realized, that was my big "ah ha"
moment, like that's what I was doing.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.300
I was basically suffocating my pizza under
too many toppings.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.990
So it's a pretty cool thing to figure out
that, you know, if you use less your pizzas

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.990
come out better.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.520
So I mean that just equals, you can eat more
pizza.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.170
Alright, so second, my sauce.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:49.560
[pause] And it's also, it's not about like
a full opaque blanket of sauce here.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.360
I wanna allow the pizza to breathe as it bakes.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.570
And when this is finished, and you'll see
the finished product, all that sauce and that

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.790
cheese nicely spreads out.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:10.860
It's also where six years of art school comes
very handy.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.090
Tell who my favorite action painter was.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.090
Alright.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:24.242
I'll get the pecorino on it in a sec. [pause]
So I'm just kind of dotting it here and there

00:18:24.242 --> 00:18:25.450
on the cheese.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.020
You know if the cheese was to go on the top,
what would happen is, instead of it melting

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.160
and spreading out, it would just basically
bake in place, so you'd have these sort of

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.950
toasted, you know, islands of mozzarella.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.450
But this is gonna allow the crust to bake
through in the beginning and by the end everything

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.910
should be all spread out very nicely.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.480
And then the last thing that's gonna go on
before baking is some pecorino Romano to give

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.200
it a little nice saltiness there.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200
[pause]

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.600
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: [inaudible] have
salt in your sauce?

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.100
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: The sauce?

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.000
This contains salt, this bottle, but it's
pretty mild.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.200
And most purees like in a can do not.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.150
And what I say is just throw a teaspoon in
there.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.420
Because the salt's gonna come later.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.140
There's less than a teaspoon actually of salt
in each dough.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.600
The mozzarella, and I have more of this too
if you guys, you know, post demo wanna come

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.000
up and taste the raw ingredients, is not super
salty.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.170
It's sort of the combination of all the ingredients
together.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.490
You know a lot of times in cooking, you don't
wanna add your salt until the end because

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.350
all the ingredients come together, things
cook down and all that.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:31.090
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: So the one teaspoon
for the bottle or [inaudible]

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:37.260
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: If, for, if I'm doing a one
teaspoon per 24 ounce bottle or 28 ounce can

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.260
of tomatoes.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.750
And then the salt comes later.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.660
This, the pecorino Romano, you guys know this
is the cheese we all love to you know grate

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:54.430
on our pastas, shave on our salads, and here
I just give this a nice blanket of pecorino.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.520
And the microplane again just gives me a nice
snowy blanket here.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.510
All things told it's about a half an ounce
of cheese, pecorino.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.490
Less, whenever I weigh this, the mozzarella,
it never exceeds three ounces and it's about

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.460
three to four ounces of sauce.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.310
Alright, I'll hand this off to you guys.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.310
[pause]

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.790
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Do you want me to do it or do you
just wanna?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.450
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: I got it, yeah.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.190
I'll do that.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.410
[pause] And you notice I'm taking the pecorino
all the way to the edge, 'cause when you get

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.510
those little toasty bits of pecorino on the
edge of your crust.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.200
The end of the party, what they call in the
biz the bones, like the stack of crusts that

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.760
nobody wants to eat.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.300
Barely, no bones.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300
Ok.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.300
So.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300
Check on my pizza, how's this doing?

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300
[loud noise from oven]

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.300
[pause]

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.300
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:57.780
&gt;&gt;male audience member #5: How long do you
have to preheat the stones for?

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:08.590
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: I like to preheat my stones
for an hour.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:13.940
Now that is a much, that's a longer preheat
time than pretty much any oven requires, but

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.480
you know you're preheating the stones, not
just the oven.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.830
The thing that's good though is that once
you get those stones heated up, they are one

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.870
I mean they act, they give you that sort of
brick oven effect where they're gonna crisp

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.210
the bottom of your pizza and pull moisture
out of it, but additionally they're like a

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.400
capacitor that's gonna keep that heat in your
oven, so if you pay attention to just keeping

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.960
that oven door you know open as little as
possible, those stones are gonna help your

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.200
oven, you know, it doesn't have to work as
hard once it's preheated.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.270
You know it takes say a half an hour for your
pi, your oven to heat up and then the stones

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.780
need a little bit more time to catch up.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.241
But once they're there, that's really where
you're gonna get you know the crust that,

00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:51.504
that you're gonna see in a moment here.

00:21:51.504 --> 00:21:58.660
&gt;&gt;male audience member #6: So like I noticed
you gave the pizza a little shake on 

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.820
the paddle before you dropped it in.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.256
&gt;&gt;male audience member #6: Is there a way
to save it if you realize you don't have enough

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:03.256
[inaudible]

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:04.256
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: If you're stuck?

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.256
&gt;&gt;male audience member #6: Semolina on it?

00:22:05.256 --> 00:22:06.256
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:22:06.256 --> 00:22:07.256
And it's good to figure that out beforehand,
then, you know.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:12.390
So what happens if, you know, if it is stuck,
you're gonna see it kind of hang on that spot

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:17.530
and you can basically just lift it up and
then just toss a little semolina under there,

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:23.040
or if it's a really sticky situation, you
know I'll just dust another peel with semolina

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.960
and then do sort of a transfer.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.021
And if it's a really like, you know, point
of no return situation, I'll roll it up, put

00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:32.570
it in foil and make like a little calzone,
so.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.570
Yeah.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.570
[laughter]

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.250
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Calzones are tricky because
they do take longer to cook in your home oven

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.850
and you know to get the inside all melted
and warm on the outside before it's overcooked.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:48.200
So what I like to do is start 'em in foil
and cook 'em for about 15-20 minutes and then

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.330
unwrap them on the stone and then finish them,
you know give them a nice toast.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.840
&gt;&gt;male audience member #7: What's the temperature
of the oven?

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.070
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: This oven, the dial goes up
to about 500 degrees.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.620
&gt;&gt;male audience member #7: [inaudible]

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.240
I set, you know at home you want to set your
oven as hot as it's gonna go.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.330
And I do not advocate hacking your oven, by
the way, like you know, wrapping the thermostat

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.250
in insulation or you know what's the other
one?

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.200
&gt;&gt;Sam: The self-cleaning mode.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.560
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: The, yeah the self-cleaning
mode.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560
&gt;&gt;male audience member #8: [inaudible]

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: How are those pizzas lookin'?

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.342
&gt;&gt;male audience member #9: The broiler with
the door closed?

00:23:23.342 --> 00:23:24.342
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: What's that?

00:23:24.342 --> 00:23:25.342
&gt;&gt;male audience member #9: The broiler with
the door closed?

00:23:25.342 --> 00:23:26.342
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: The broiler, the problem is,
is that you're, you know usually the broiler

00:23:26.342 --> 00:23:28.610
is up top, so what it's doing is it's just
raining heat down on the top of the pizza,

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.610
so.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.560
So that's one of the things.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.160
But again, what you're gonna see is done with
no hacking.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.050
It's all, you know, straight up.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:42.960
And you know the oven that you have, I mean
gas or electric, no name whatever, you know,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.800
what, what's important again is a decent,
you know, a nice thick baking stone and then

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.080
proper adherence to, to these principles here.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.810
Next is, I'm gonna do a pizza for you guys,
it's potato rosemary pizza.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.560
[pause] In fact.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.480
&gt;&gt;male audience member 10: [inaudible]

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.820
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: How thick?

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.050
About, well these stones are a clay mixture
called cordierite.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:12.880
These are about half inch thick stones right
here.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.960
So you know the thinner stones you, what you
run the risk is I mean they'll get to temperature,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.250
but once the pizza hits it, it's gonna pull
the temp, the heat out of it and it's not

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.860
gonna rebound in time to properly cook the
bottom of your pizza.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.590
&gt;&gt;male audience member #11: [inaudible]

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:34.100
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You know it's on an oven by
oven basis.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.840
At the shop we have, they like, we have an
electric oven, very even heating, and I like

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.490
how convection works.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.690
For the class, however, I just teach on bake.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.230
Like the most fundamental, basic, you know,
of oven functions to show that with, with

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.420
no fancy bells or whistles you can really
get a great pizza.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.840
But you know what I say at home is you and
your oven will become very good friends, you're

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.970
gonna learn if it's like extra hot in one
corner, so you know you have to rotate your

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.470
pizza mid-baking and things like that.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:03.690
So whereas my, the oven at the shop, I do
like convection, you know when I do catering

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.410
gigs and I'm using someone's kitchen as my
pizzeria that night, I often find that convection

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:13.420
can be uneven heating, it's just on an oven
by oven basis.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:19.760
And please like bring on more of these questions,
I can totally geek out on ovens with you guys,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.460
flour if you want to talk about it.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:27.170
I used to work at Murray's Cheese, you guys
know about, down on Bleecker Street, so, don't

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.360
get me started about cheese.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.560
&gt;&gt;male audience member #12: [inaudible]

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.950
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: One of the tricks that I've
seen with the broiler, if you wanna get like

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.890
a really nice dark underside of the pie, is
preheat your oven like you normally would,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.280
so it's all evenly heated and then at the
very end, like 10 minutes before you're gonna

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.410
get your pizzas in there, throw it on broil
and get that stone extra hot and then you

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.900
can get the pizza in there and then you'll
get that nice charred underside.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:07.547
&gt;&gt;male audience member #13: What if, if you
have a gas oven with a broiler that's underneath.

00:26:07.547 --> 00:26:08.547
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes.

00:26:08.547 --> 00:26:09.547
&gt;&gt;male audience member #13: Then, does that
change it? [inaudible]

00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:10.547
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright, so here's a little
hack that I, well no.

00:26:10.547 --> 00:26:17.090
At home we have a gas oven and it has a broiler
below and when I turn that to broil, I have

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.590
a little laser thermometer that can tell me
the temperature of my baking stones and I've

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.760
seen my stones get upwards of 600 degrees,
so that's kind of cool.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.400
I'm surprised that no one has yet built an
oven.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.550
How they looking?

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.550
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Good.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Good?

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.550
Ok.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.550
Ok.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.640
That you know it would just I think be a matter
of insulation.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.970
You know.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.170
The ovens that we have in the shop, actually
generously provided by Viking, great oven.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:47.230
We've actually been keeping count of our pizza
making and since the store opened April 15th

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.370
of 2010, we have made what, what have we?

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.881
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Five thousand eight hundred and one.

00:26:51.881 --> 00:26:52.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Five thousand eight hundred
and one pizzas in our oven.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.110
We've got a little clicker to count and that
oven is going strong.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:01.590
But one of the things that Viking said was,
"Now Mark, don't cook on the cleaning cycle."

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.240
So I promised I would not.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.520
Yeah, there are, I've seen plans on line how
to cut that latch when, so when the cleaning

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.400
cycle, you can get the door open.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.600
Do not advocate it.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.000
Alright.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
You know what guys?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.210
If you wanna start on that as well, so if
you noticed guys, so these potatoes here,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:27.330
what I've got is raw red potatoes, which I
soaked in a little bit of extra virgin olive

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:34.170
oil, and grate a clove of garlic in there,
and then a little bit of salt and some fresh

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.170
rosemary.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.170
&gt;&gt;male audience member #14: [inaudible]

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.310
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh yeah.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.880
&gt;&gt;male audience member #14: [inaudible]

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Sorry.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member #15: So did you mandolin
those?

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, I have a very simple mandolin.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.910
Just like one slice fits all, a sixteenth
of an inch.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.860
It's about the thickness of a dime.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:58.540
And so they're raw, and then just sort of
steeped in this oil and rosemary mixture.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.300
And notice my application too.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.530
I'm not like overlapping or shingling these
on there.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:09.560
What I'm doing is I'm doing more of like a
tiling or a cobblestoning of the potatoes,

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.050
allowing the crust again to breathe.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.030
And also if, if at any point like I'm overlapping
the potatoes, that's a spot where I run the

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.990
risk of the potatoes not cooking all the way
through as it goes.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:27.790
&gt;&gt;male audience member #16: So there's obviously
a lot of [inaudible]

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:34.210
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes, this is where I contradict
myself because I don't like to put the oil

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.010
like on the Margherita and most of my pizzas
until the pizza is done.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.820
Because what happens is you put the pizza.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.820
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.820
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.820
You wanna pull that out?

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.820
[pause]

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.880
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: &gt;&gt;Alright.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.110
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Give it a little bit more, yeah.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.890
I'll get it in one sec.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.150
So with oil.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.910
The perils of putting oil on in the beginning.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.580
One of the things is it just sinks down into
your pizza, so you know, you still get all

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.850
the calories, but you don't get that really
nice finishing touch, so what I'll do is when

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.340
that pizza comes out, just a drizzle of the
good Sicilian stuff here.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.530
And, and also a peril of putting oil on ahead
of time if you've ever been in a pizzeria

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.070
and your eyes are stinging or it's like kind
of hard to breathe and you're like, what's

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.070
up?

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:23.010
It's, it's usually either some sort of fat,
oil or, or excess flour burning in the oven.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:28.980
So if the oil hits your pizza stone, your
fire alarm is going to go off shortly thereafter.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.610
With this one, the oil actually clinging to
the potatoes and also clinging to the rosemary

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:38.870
kind of, well buffers the rosemary from burning
and then also kind of just helps to, to, these

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.740
aren't soaked in oil, they're actually just
kind of have a nice you know outer coating

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.780
of it right there.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.570
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.260
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.260
Alright.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.750
Let me look in.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.120
[loud noise from oven]

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.740
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Put this one on there.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.810
[loud noise from oven]

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.110
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright, hand me those peels
and I'll get these guys in while I'm yapping

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.440
about Margheritas.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.890
[loud noise from oven]

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:17.450
[loud noise from oven again]

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:23.020
&gt;&gt;male audience member #17: [inaudible]

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.030
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, for two reasons.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:32.320
I mean one just so all of the, you know, elements
kind of gel together, but two because of the

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.000
dreaded pizza mouth, which is when you bite
into that slice.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[laughter]

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.990
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah and you just trash the
roof of your mouth for the rest of the night.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.340
So yeah, during the class like this is the
first pizza we eat, it's usually about an

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.340
hour and a half in.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.790
You know we've made our dough, our dough is
set aside to rise and people are, you know,

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.820
I can just see the hunger in their eyes and
I'm like talking about basil and not bruising

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.160
it and everything and I know they're just
like, will you cut the pie already?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.020
And I'm like, totally, hey, I'm stalling so
you guys don't burn the roof of your mouth.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.020
Ok.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.020
So the basil.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.460
Basil, very delicate herb.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.010
Chopping basil is a no no.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.010
It will bruise your basil.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.780
Either tearing the basil or using, I like
to use a pair of snips.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:17.250
You know instead of pouncing down on the basil
with a blade, the scissors are just gently

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.360
cleaving through here.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.660
How many people do we have?

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.600
Because I want to cut this in enough slices
so everyone gets a sliv.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600
What's the count?

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.220
&gt;&gt;unknown: [inaudible]

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.710
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:35.870
Well it would help 'cause I gotta do my, my
math here for my pie chart.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.210
&gt;&gt;unknown: [inaudible]Thirty.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.230
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Thirty?

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.880
&gt;&gt;Jenny: I've got 30.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Ok, I'll cut 16 slices.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.000
That's perfect.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.490
&gt;&gt;unknown: [inaudible]

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.730
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Ok.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.820
Sixteen slices of each.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.610
&gt;&gt;unknown: Plus those guys back there.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh, I'll hook those guys up
later, I got extra doughs for you, I, yeah,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.280
I know what's up.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.410
[laughter]

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.540
[pause]

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.930
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Ok.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:08.530
So, basil's on there, the heat from the pizza
is gently waking up the herbaciousness of

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:14.030
the basil, here's my good Sicilian oil, just
a nice controlled drizzle on there.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.260
That, when I've measured it, it's about a
half a tablespoon.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.410
&gt;&gt;male audience member #18: [inaudible]

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.300
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oil?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.590
You're gonna taste it in a second, it's just
the beautiful like cherry on top.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.590
Yep.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.590
Cutting the pizza.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.590
Your grip.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.590
This is sort of your traditional grip.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.370
Work at a pizza place and you'll notice your
wrist will start to hurt cutting multiple

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.370
pies like this.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.510
The grip I like to employ is like this, I
kind of call this like my gangster-style grip

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.510
right here.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:47.350
It's uh, gives me just all my force can be
concentrated directly down, so I just hit

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.830
that pizza and then just roll and I got a
nice clean cut without it skating all over

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.830
the place.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.330
Do you guys hear that crisp sound?

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:59.960
As I'm going across, so.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.540
Sixteenths on this.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:21.850
[cutting sounds] Alright, Jenny, you wanna?

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:37.100
[cutting sounds] Walk that out.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:52.360
[pause] So it's very quiet.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:34:07.620
That's, what do you think?

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:16.780
Is it good?

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:33.639
&gt;&gt;male audience member #19: So the bread-type
people are all about you know the [inaudible]

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.639
and high-gluten flour.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.639
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.639
&gt;&gt;male audience member #19: And all that kind
of fussing with the dough.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.639
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.639
&gt;&gt;male audience member #19: [inaudible] Do
you think it helps?

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.639
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, I mean, well so this dough
was made, this has had about 36 hour sort

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.639
of a rise on it.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.310
And the fermentation you know that occurs
in that.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.960
In our class we teach what's called a quick-rise
dough, which is like make your dough, set

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.810
it aside to rise, it's ready to work in about
45 minutes.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.210
This is also what a pizzeria calls emergency
dough, which is like, uh oh, we're running

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.250
out of dough, make some more dough fast.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.480
But you know, a lot of pizza makers, and myself
included, I like the extra sort of depth of

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.470
flavor you get with a dough that has time
to rest and you know this fermentation that

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.520
occurs, the chemistry between the yeast and
the flour and everything else.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.460
So if I'm doing a party or something, I plan
to make my doughs a day and a half, two days

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.810
in advance or something like that.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.740
&gt;&gt;male audience member #20: It must also make
the dough easier to work.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.340
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's
a number of things.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:23.870
When the dough is actually straight out of
the, out of the container on a quick rise,

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:29.880
it's like this pillowy, it's malleable and
really, really, you know, it's actually very

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.580
seductive and it's kind of hard not to just
wanna dive into it, and just you know flatten

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.510
it out again, but it's nice to work.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.250
But you know I actually a lot of times with
my doughs I pull 'em straight out of the fridge

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.250
and I work 'em cold.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.510
You have to, it takes a little more practice,
you have to be a little bit more aggressive

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.300
to stretch it, but you know, you really get
rewarded with a nice crumb, like the little

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.810
pockets of air in there and nice bubbles and
stuff.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.840
But did you guys notice with this pizza, I
mean you know given it was still pretty thin,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.830
there was still, you know some air.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.830
What'd you think of it?

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.830
Was it, was it good?

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.830
&gt;&gt;male audience member #21: [inaudible]

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.830
[applause]

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.830
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah?

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.830
Alright.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.830
Cool.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.830
Thank you.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:03.830
Good.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:04.830
This is always in the class the moment of
truth, like if people, you know, so far we're

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.500
batting a thousand, but if not one of my favorite
spots, right up the street.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500
But um.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500
[laughter]

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.120
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: So, so first of all the crust.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.130
You guys like the crust?

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.071
The amount of cheese, was, did it satisfy
your cheese tooth?

00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:20.880
You know, did you, and you, did you think
like given how much I didn't put on there,

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880
right?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.990
What about the sauce, you know?

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.880
Garlic, tomatoes, you know nice balance.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.830
And what about just the balance in general
of the flavors?

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.850
Like nothing overwhelming, everything just
kind of in sync?

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.391
And the oil, did you, did you enjoy the oil
that fini, yeah, isn't that nice, that little

00:36:34.391 --> 00:36:39.590
fini, and that, that it's not a ton, it's
just that finishing drizzle that again at

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.820
the end so you really can taste that.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.360
Let me check how these guys are doing here.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.940
&gt;&gt;male audience member #22: How long [inaudible]

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Until it's done.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.550
'Cause it.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.550
[laughter]

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.680
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: No, that's totally the answer,
because every oven is different and like depending

00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:00.190
on you know how good I'm about getting the
oven door closed as fast as possible, you

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.320
know, so it's anywhere in my ovens like six
to ten minutes.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.201
And you know, in, in the classroom our oven
very even heating, pizzas go in there, pretty

00:37:09.201 --> 00:37:12.540
much don't have to do anything unless there's
an ingredient that's gonna go on later on

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.540
in the bake.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.560
You know, this is another important thing
is certain ingredients are going to burn or

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.620
overcook if you put them on at the beginning,
so they go in later.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.810
And at home actually, our oven, we, the back
right corner is the hottest part of the oven,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.600
so I know that even though, you know, it's
gonna be, like I don't have to look at the

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.110
pizza for five minutes, but then I know at
five minute point I need to give my pizza

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.640
a turn, so it cooks evenly.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.380
Now doing that I don't like you know open
the oven door and go, huh, or get my tongs

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.500
and kind of eek it along.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.600
I get that door open, I get it on the peel,
I pull it out, I get that door closed.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.040
Then I make my adjustment, and then get that
back in.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.290
So again, always maintaining that heat in
your oven is a good thing.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.470
Pizzas will cook quicker and they'll cook
better.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.470
Ok.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.960
So this guy, how's it looking?

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.960
Good.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.960
Alright.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.960
A minute more?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.960
Ok.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.440
I'm gonna start stretching out for the final
pizza, and we're actually gonna do a sweet

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.620
pizza for you guys.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.800
This is a class favorite.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.310
In fact, I can tell the total Nutella addicts
in our classes because when it's time to make,

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.700
ah, there you go.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.920
When it's time to make our pizzas, they just
go straight to this pizza, like they don't

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.380
start with the savory, they just dive right
into it.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.650
So this is a fun pizza.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:27.610
It's a banana roasted on the crust and then
for a nice crunch, you know I was using pine

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:32.800
nuts and then I found these, have you guys
ever had the dry-roasted peanuts from Virginia?

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.190
Like again, another raw ingredient you're
welcome to come up and taste later.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.180
Like unlike any peanut I've ever had.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:43.470
These nice salty, crunchy peanuts complimented
by the caramelized like bananas on there and

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:47.370
then the finishing touch of the Nutella, it's
a, it's a wonderful thing.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.590
So see that come together in a sec, I promise.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.590
How are the potato guys looking?

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.420
I want to give them a nice, nice toast on
there.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.680
Pretty good?

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.130
Alright let me get this guy stretched, we'll
get another peel.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.130
Other things with stretching the dough, by
the way.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:06.300
So throwing the dough.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.780
You know the pizza purists will say, throwing
dough is forbidden.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.141
And one of the reasons is a crust that is
hand hewn, you know I don't know if you, there's

00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:20.240
a light behind me, but if you can see this
sort of you know interplay of a little bit

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.030
thicker here, and little bit thinner there,
that's where you get that just nice different

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.920
you know the different textures and flavors
going on in your crust, where a crust you

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.370
know made by centrifugal force and flour in
your eyes, is very uniform across the way

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.740
and just very soulless.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.650
Now that being said, you know, it's fun to
throw dough.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:44.150
We actually keep a practice dough in the store,
it's made out of silicon, so if aspiring you

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:48.570
know Olympic pizza maker athletes want to
try it, they don't have to risk losing one

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.190
of their precious doughs in the process.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.370
I'm sorry?

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.330
&gt;&gt;male audience member #23: [inaudible]

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.700
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh, yeah.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.120
Oh, I have friends who compete in these competitions.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.120
They're insane, the things.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.680
They'll like flip the dough, it'll roll behind
the head, they'll catch it on the other side.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.440
But when they make me a pizza, I'm like, do
it on the table please.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440
So.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440
[laughter]

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.700
[loud noise from oven]

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:18.440
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: I think we could go just a little
bit more on this guy.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440
[pause]

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member #24: [inaudible]

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.060
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: When I'm doing a quick-rise
dough, so I wanna get my yeast like kicking

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.780
into gear that much faster, just a pinch of
sugar to feed it to proof it.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.330
But when I'm doing a cold rise, I don't use
sugar.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:39.750
It's very simply flour, active dry yeast is
what I'm using for this, not instant, but

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:45.450
the active dry, water and salt and a little
bit of oil.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:50.970
And actually I've got for you guys some dough
stirring spatulas with our dough recipe printed

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:55.110
on the handle, we give these out in class,
so, you can take it and try your hand.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.110
[scraping sound]

00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:00.540
&gt;&gt;male audience member #24: Is it heresy to
use store-bought dough?

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.700
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: It's not heresy to use it, but
what I find a lot of the times is

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.700
&gt;&gt;male audience member #24: [inaudible]

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.910
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.330
You know, a lot, so another thing people come
into the class and they say, you know, I've

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:16.830
been making pizzas but one of the problems
I have is I stretch it and it shrinks back,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:21.060
and you know, and it's like impossible to
work, what am I doing wrong?

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.510
And it's not necessarily you.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.380
The person making the dough that day maybe
like you know, got a phone call, left the

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:31.110
mixer on too long, the dough is over-kneaded,
you know the glutens are overdeveloped and

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.670
you've got this hockey puck that's impossible
to stretch.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:39.830
So, I actually did a class once at a, at a
culinary center in a supermarket where they

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.880
said you know we want to do like an abridged
class using our dough.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.420
So I took their dough home and I made some
pizzas with it and it was great.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.310
It worked really wonderful, so I was like,
cool, you know?

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:54.630
The day of the class, disaster, or dough-saster,
and so, so I had my jar of yeast with me and

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.820
my kit and we busted out the flour, and we
made our dough on the fly.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.740
So really, you know when you, when you make
your own dough, you know the dough.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.130
You know the hydration.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.369
You know it's gonna work the way that you
expect it to.

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:11.090
Pizzeria dough, too is nice and it's convenient,
but often that dough is formulated to work

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.460
in your pizzeria's you know like six, seven,
eight hundred degree oven and it's a completely

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.690
different animal.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:22.660
Where this dough, really, you know, ideally,
just totally sings in your home oven.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.050
Alright Jenny I'd say get those guys out now.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.380
&gt;&gt;male audience member #25: What's your basic
[inaudible].

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.050
What's your basic flour?

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.710
What's your flour [inaudible]

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.700
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Am I allowed to name names?

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.510
I guess I said Nutella, right?

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.970
So, for all my pizzas, actually whether I'm
doing a dough that's gonna be going in a home

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:47.760
oven or I'm doing like a you know fire-breathing
dragon, like 850 degree wood-burning oven,

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:53.880
I just, is, I like to use an all-purpose,
an unbleached and an unbromated all-purpose,

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.900
so a good quality all-purpose flour and personally
I use a brand called King Arthur, which you

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.790
know, yeah, see, I say the name and people,
it's like it has this cult following.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.800
&gt;&gt;male audience member #26: [inaudible]

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.119
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Not, you know, well their all-purpose
is actually a higher protein content than

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:13.360
a lot of all-purpose flours, it's somewhere
in the vicinity of 12%.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.940
I find it works great, you know.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.630
You know in the beginning I was playing around
with all sorts of flours, I got the, the double

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.710
zero, you know or the doppio zero, the flour
that you know by the rules of Neapolitan pizza

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:31.100
making you must use to make your, your pizzas.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.670
And definitely for a pizza that cooks you
know in like under a minute in one of those

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:40.130
super hot ovens, that's where you get that
really nice crispy exterior and that nice

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:41.380
pillowy interior.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.090
But you know I made the dough according to
all of the Neapolitan rules, the half an hour

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.430
of kneading, the double rise, all the stuff,
but baked it in my home oven and the results

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:50.430
were, were less than stellar.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:55.160
So I started playing around with bread flours,
pastry flours, you know high gluten, all this

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.790
stuff and then I would assemble friends and
family for my blind taste test focus groups

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.640
and I'd make like four Margheritas, and each
Margherita was made with a different batch

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:09.730
of dough and you know the one that came up
on top was the all-purpose flour dough.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.670
[pause] Alright.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.670
[pause]

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:17.490
&gt;&gt;male audience member #27: [inaudible]

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:23.200
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: That was a little bit more fresh
rosemary on there.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:33.510
So again these potatoes, when they went on,
were raw.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.770
[pause]

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.300
[cutting sounds]

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:43.630
&gt;&gt;male audience member #28: [inaudible]

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:51.110
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: I'm sorry, what was the question
again?

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.750
&gt;&gt;male audience member #28: [inaudible]

00:44:54.750 --> 00:45:04.290
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, you know, I, I, you know,
so much of pizza making is trial and error,

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.830
and just figuring out how to get that balance
and when it should cook, you know?

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.280
And I find that, that the potatoes reach the
finish line at about the same time when the

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.650
crust does, you know.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:20.340
This is where certain ingredients, like I
do a pizza actually one of the things for

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.540
the happy hour is we basically, we're not
doing pizzas, but we're doing panini, which

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:31.930
are essentially reverse engineered pizzas
in sandwich form and one of them is this pizza

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:37.510
that I make that's smoked mozzarella with
tomato sauce, sun-dr, and sun-dried tomatoes.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.610
And the thing is if the sun-drieds go on in
the beginning, they're gonna burn before the

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:41.610
pizza's done.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.300
So what you want to do is about a minute to
spare is get that pizza out and then dress

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.850
it with the sun-drieds, and then back in for
a quick warm up.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.850
So.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.230
What do you think?

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.250
Do you like it?

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.270
You'd think like you know starch on starch
it's just gonna be this really you know Atkins

00:45:56.270 --> 00:46:00.660
nightmare pizza here but very, I mean crisp
and just really really light.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.010
This is a very tr, classic Roman pizza.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:08.260
You know in Rome it's the patate pizza and
some versions are simple like this, some they

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.740
do a little bit of mozzarella, some they do
some caramelized onions.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:16.250
In class, I like I show this as a demo pizza
and then I encourage people to be creative,

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:20.130
and you know they I see things like pancetta
going on top, Ricotta, like different things

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.830
like that, but again stressing that whole
mantra of less is more, you know.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:29.560
If you overload the pizza with too many things,
I mean, the flavors are gonna compete, but

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.930
also the pizza underneath, or the potato underneath
all those toppings isn't gonna cook.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.460
I mean did you find those potatoes cooked
to your liking?

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.260
&gt;&gt;male audience member #29: [inaudible]

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.050
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: In this guy?

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:49.640
Yeah, you know I'm kind of a, I'm ah looking
at the pie overall.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.750
I mean one of the things when I when I get
an oven, I bust out my laser thermometer and

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.330
I check, when I cater I carry this thing with
me, you know on a holster on my side just

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:01.750
to check, 'cause I don't know if I'm doing
two pizzas at a time, like I'm doing here,

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.900
what this person's oven, how it behaves.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.590
So I get a quick read on the stones, and these
stones are pretty much in the same temperature

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:11.140
range, so I know they're gonna you know come
out right about the same time.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:16.950
And just experience and kind of like smell
and spidey sense kind of you get like weirdly.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:21.570
It just, make enough pizzas and you're gonna
see they just get better and better and better.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.690
Ok the banana that's going on here.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:29.070
I like to pick bananas that are riper than
I would, you know, put on my Cheerios in the

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.070
morning.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.660
Because the riper the banana, the more sugars
that you've got in there and what's gonna

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.860
happen is when that bakes on there, the sugars
are gonna come out and they're gonna caramelize

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.130
and you get that really nice flavor coming
out of that.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:52.730
And just like the potato pizza, I'm gonna
lay these banana slices out tiled, not overlapping,

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:59.270
so they cook through nicely and Jenny and/or
Sam, if you guys could distribute this one

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:15.120
right here, I'll trade ya. [pause] Banana
peel makes a nice cutting board as well, you

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.280
can just kind of hang on to it like that.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.990
I call these my MacGyver meets Martha tips.

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.000
&gt;&gt;male audience member #30: [inaudible]

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.810
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.830
You want my honest opinion?

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:36.160
I think, wheat, wheat, I love whole wheat,
you know I really, I love whole wheat bread

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.770
and I love, you know, tuna salad on whole
wheat, but I find with, you know like I wouldn't

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:47.080
put pastrami on banana nut raisin bread and
I feel that mozzarella and tomato sauce just

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.850
doesn't harmonize with the flavor of whole
wheat.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.480
And, and reading on whole wheat, I mean a
lot of the things I've learned, one, you know,

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.660
when you make a whole wheat dough, you have
to cut it in half with some all-purpose flour

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.940
in order for you to get that gluten development
and that being said you're still gonna get

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:08.540
sort of like a lumpier kind of mealier crust.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:12.140
You know, and reading, some of the things
that I've seen that you know unless it's an

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:18.109
issue of like I had a guy in class who by
doctor's orders had to eat all whole grain

00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:22.480
things and I understood, but in terms of the
absorption of nutrients, you know, you're

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.240
not gonna absorb anything more from a whole
wheat than from a good quality all-purpose.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.900
And then you know you're getting a compromise
in the texture and the flavor.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.970
The one thing you do miss is your missing
your fiber and that, you know, you should

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:35.990
get elsewhere.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.850
But you know I've yet, I've still been playing
around, I've been playing around with these

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.690
white wheat flours, have you guys seen those?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.690
Yeah.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.690
To see what I could get.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.910
And what I recommend is that if you're doing
a whole wheat crust, whereas I would never

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:51.090
attack this dough with a rolling pin and just
totally flatten it out, the whole, I was doing

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.980
this whole wheat crust with this guy in class
and we ended up, we were having a really hard

00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.000
time stretching without it just totally lumping
and tearing up, so we took a rolling pin to

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.570
it and made it really flat and then it came
out very crispy and then the sweetness of

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.710
it wasn't like overwhelming, and that was
really nice.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.450
There's some frozen pizzas that I've seen,
like there's one that Whole Foods sells called

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.450
American Flat Bread.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:15.350
It's like a $12 frozen pizza, which is you
know, kind of expensive, but really dynamite,

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:19.780
and it's made with a flour that's called a
white wheat, which is, I, from what I understand

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.800
it's a, it's a flour that's milled like to
an all-purpose and then the germ is reintroduced

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.360
back into it, so you're getting that, the
nutrients, or supposedly.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.470
&gt;&gt;male audience member #31: Or you can take
a vitamin.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:34.970
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Or you can take a vitamin, yeah.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:42.880
But you know, going with a flour that is not
a bleached flour and not a bromated flour,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.640
and actually you should Google bromating and
see what that says, Or actually King Arthur,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.580
you can e-mail their baker's hotline and they
will tell you it's a

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.580
[laughter]

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.580
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.580
Seriously.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.660
&gt;&gt;male audience member #32: [inaudible]

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.109
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You guys have enough?

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:58.109
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Nope.

00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:59.560
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh, sorry.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.560
Full on banana.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.120
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Shall we just [inaudible]

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.120
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: What?

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.120
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.070
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright, and so, and with this
pizza, like I was talking about, ingredients

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:14.080
that go on later, the nuts go on towards the
very, very end, just to get a quick toast.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.500
If they go on in the beginning, they're gonna
burn before the pizza is done.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.350
And the other thing, the Nutella, actually,
I don't even like to bake because often it's

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:33.010
gonna dry out or it's gonna burn and it doesn't
taste so good that way.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:38.250
[loud noise from oven]

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:43.500
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: That's good.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.810
Alright.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:50.060
[loud noise from oven]

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:56.760
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: So, and this is a pizza actually
that I do like to do a little bit lighter.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.580
You know, a little bit lighter on the cook
so it's a little bit breadier, I feel that

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.600
really just compliments the flavors with that.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.320
When I'm making my pizzas, you know, I, I
start, this is an eight ounce ball of dough

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.160
right here, now risen up, you know this is
a sixteen ounce pint container, you can see

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.810
the dough's pretty much doubled in size.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:17.480
But depending on the pizza I'm doing, you
know, limited a little bit by the size of

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.250
this oven, but that first Margherita I tried
to go a little bit on the crispier, breadier

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.850
side in parts, where as on that potato one
I wanted to go real thin, so you just got

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:30.230
that nice kind of crispy thing, so you know
every pizza I make, whether it's a savory

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.590
pizza or a sweet pizza, it's the same dough.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:37.570
And how, you know, the, the diameter in which
I stretch it, because they're all, you know,

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.780
roughly eight ounces in weight, is gonna dictate
if it's gonna be a crispier pie or a breadier

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.780
pie.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.650
So you kind of find too, you know with your
pizzas, what, you know, what kind of crusts

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.930
you like or what kind of crusts you feel compliment
the toppings that are going on there.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:53.400
The Nutella.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:59.210
To, how do you get Nutella in a jar like evenly
spaced on a pizza?

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:03.240
Well, what I used to do is like I'd just seriously
with a knife be trying to like, it was just

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.240
a mess.

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.540
And then a friend of mine showed me this trick,
you take like a little sandwich baggie and

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.460
like a coffee mug and you stretch it out and
lay it on top of the mug and then grab a spoonful

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.000
of that and just kind of stab it in the center
of the bag and you're able to just pull it

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.830
off cleanly without like filling that zipper
with Nutella and then when it's pizza making

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.680
time, just a little snip off of that and that's
your piping bag.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.460
And then depending on your love for Nutella,
you know, you can chew the bag after that

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.760
to get every last drop out of it.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.000
&gt;&gt;male audience member #33: Why [inaudible]

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.040
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Why, I'm sorry?

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member #33: Why [inaudible]

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.320
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Heat it up?

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.830
You know this I usually just put it in a warm
spot in my kitchen, like we've got it in a

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:47.490
cupboard like above one of the fluorescent
lights there, just enough warmth so it's malleable.

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.380
But I find with Nutella it's tricky like often
for the amount of time that this is in the

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.450
oven if the Nutella's on there, it's gonna
burn before the pizza's done, so.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:54:01.300
And a lot of ingredients too that would burn
normally like if just left alone, in suspension

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.680
will work really nice.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.560
So for example like garlic, you know, on a
pizza?

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.210
Grate, if I was to grate just raw garlic or
shave it right on top of the pizza, you know,

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.390
most likely what I'm gonna get is bitter burned
pieces.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.900
&gt;&gt;male audience member #34: [inaudible]

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.900
Yeah.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.570
But what you can do is take that garlic and
grate it or with a garlic press into something

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:24.990
like some Ricotta or something like that and
spread that around and that will be a buffer

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.390
to keep the garlic from burning, you know.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.390
The herbs.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:32.140
I don't like to put like my basil didn't go
on my Margherita prior to baking because,

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:37.200
you know, it would either dry out or burn
on the top of the pie or it just sinks into

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.280
the sauce and cheese and just gets all grayish-green
and lost there.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.160
But the rosemary too.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.230
The rosemary, you know, that sprinkle of fresh
rosemary on the pizza at the very end, but

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:50.760
the rosemary that was already on the potatoes
here, just with that light coating of oil,

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.359
is gonna buffer it and keep it from burning,
so.

00:54:55.359 --> 00:55:03.730
How we looking on these?

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:10.430
[pause] Alright, that's good.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:17.900
[pause] One of the things too, I was, oh,
hello?

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.730
The, did you turn that mic down just when
I was drinking?

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:23.270
You guys are good.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:24.270
[laughter]

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:25.810
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Wow!

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:27.080
That's amazing.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.560
[laughing] What if my stomach rumbles, will
they hear it or is it only, you know, 'cause

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.020
I'm a little hungry right now.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:36.430
So the menu upstairs, I was talking about
how it's the pizzas reverse engineered into

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:40.950
sandwich form, but I like to think of my pizzas
also the other way.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:46.330
It's like there are flavors that I like in
another sense that I then, in fact, the, the

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:51.250
smoked mozzarella, sun-dried tomato pizza
that I do that we have the panino upstairs

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:56.680
for you guys to try out, it was originally
a sandwich that I had had and it was so great,

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:00.010
I thought this should be, you know, I actually
never liked smoked cheese or sun-dried tomatoes.

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:03.430
I found smoked cheese was, you know, I associated
with that sort of rubber brick that comes

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.550
in your holiday gift basket, you know.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.581
And then the sun-drieds were always like whole
preparation in a salad, you bite into it,

00:56:09.581 --> 00:56:10.970
it's all too much at once.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:16.140
And, but then I had this, this sandwich and
it was just like, it was given to me for free,

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.140
I wouldn't have bought it, you know.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.490
And then I just cooked it up and it was delicious.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.260
And, and the sun-drieds were chopped up, so
you know one bite you didn't get the whole

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.859
sun-dried in your mouth and just the balance
of the smoked cheese with the sun-dried tomatoes

00:56:26.859 --> 00:56:30.690
in this sandwich, which also has a little
bit of balsamic vinegar on it, it's just fantastic.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:35.120
So what I like to teach in the class, like
as far as the recipes for the pizza, it's

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.620
more a list of ingredients, listed in the
order in which they go on the pizza.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:43.119
You know, less about quantities, more about
just imparting a sensibility to people about

00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:45.670
how pizza successfully comes together.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.750
An example of this is a pizza.

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:49.750
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:50.750
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Looking good?

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:51.750
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:52.750
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Nuts?

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:53.750
Alright.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:54.750
Let's do it.

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:55.750
Alright.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.750
[pause]

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:57.750
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Check it out.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:58.750
[loud noise from oven]

00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.750
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yes.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:00.750
Alright.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.750
Give that, we can get those on there and [pause]

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:03.460
[loud noise from oven]

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:11.010
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: That looks great.

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:23.340
[pause] Alright, so here are those lovely
Virginia peanuts.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:30.620
Can you guys see the nice kind of, there's
the camera, that nice kind of toasty caramelization

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.440
that's going on there?

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.720
So when's Goggle gonna invent internet that
you can smell?

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720
[laughter]

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.110
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You'll.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.090
&gt;&gt;male audience member #35: [inaudible]

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:44.990
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: What's that?

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:48.930
&gt;&gt;male audience member #35: [inaudible] It's
bad.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:52.310
it's going to be really bad.

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.000
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.820
&gt;&gt;male audience member #36: [inaudible]

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.130
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Actually, you know what?

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:02.710
When we're done garnishing these, we'll pass
these peanuts around just so you guys can

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:07.810
have a little snickety-snack and see what
they're like.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.810
Alright.

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.690
You wanna reintroduce that into the oven?

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:15.710
&gt;&gt;Jenny: I would love to.

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:18.130
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Alright.

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:22.950
[loud noise from oven] Alright, bingo.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.560
What's that?

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.170
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:35.180
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh, yeah, ok, well they can
have them on the pizza.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.180
I spoke.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.060
You just want them, I know it, so.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:41.100
Alright peanuts will come around in a second
on the pizza.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.100
Ok.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.100
So back to sensibility with pizza making.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.130
So there's a pizza that I, that I make I call
it the pesci affumicati.

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:50.480
If you have an app for translating, you know
it'll tell you that that means smoked fish,

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.480
you know.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.130
But it's totally a bagel and lox pizza.

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:57.050
You know one morning I had dough, I had Russ
&amp; Daughters, you guys know Russ &amp; Daughters,

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:58.050
right?

00:58:58.050 --> 00:58:59.050
Lovely smoked fish.

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:02.940
I had some sable and I had some Norwegian
salmon and I had you know all the accoutrements

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.930
that, crème fraiche and the capers and red
onion and all that kind of stuff.

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:11.060
So I knew that if I baked you know this smoked
fish on the pizza, that was, that's heresy

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.560
right there, you know.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.050
So what I [someone sneezes] did is I, bless
you, rolled out my crust.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:19.670
Now if you bake a crust completely naked with
nothing on it what's gonna happen it's just

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:23.040
gonna completely balloon out in your oven,
dry out, it's gonna you know be like a cracker

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.690
that will shatter when you cut it.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:29.349
So some sort of a buffer to go on there before
you bake, so what I did with my mandolin,

00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:31.940
some red onion and just did some slices on
there.

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.010
So the onion kind of sat on the pizza, you
know gave up a little bit of moisture, it

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:37.250
steamed the crust.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:41.880
I threw on some poppy seeds as well, 'cause
that's how I like to roll with my bagels.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.940
And then, and then baked that and baked it
to a little bit of a lighter more kind of

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:50.000
bialy-like crust, which is actually the way
this one's going as well, and then out of

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.590
the oven, allowed it to rest, so it wouldn't
basically melt my crème fraiche, and then

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:58.710
the crème fraiche went on and then the capers
and then the salmon and the sable.

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.790
Ridiculous, in a good way.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:01.790
Ok.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.190
So, let's pull those guys out.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.870
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Alright.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:14.220
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You think?

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.230
[pause] Oh yeah.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.900
[various noises]

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:26.740
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: So I'm just cutting off the
tiniest little corner here on the bag.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.590
&gt;&gt;male audience member #37: [inaudible]

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:33.670
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Pastry bag?

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:38.640
You know I just, it, one day just we didn't
have pastry bags, we used these and you know

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.900
these, get 'em in the supermarket, they work
great.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.480
I mean, check this out, you just kind of squeeze
it down like so.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.010
&gt;&gt;male audience member #38: [inaudible]

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:51.780
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yeah, and for the classes we've
got our pre-dispensed Nutella amounts.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.220
And if you're nice we let you have a second
bag.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:03.140
[pause] Now I always have to just resist the
urge to rush this and then have an exploding

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:10.120
Nutella bag in my hand.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:22.750
Once again, art school, thank you.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.960
[pause] Alright.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:02:10.780
You guys have been such a nice audience, I'm
gonna pull out a second bag of Nutella.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.780
[audience whooping]

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.780
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Oh yeah.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.780
Oh yeah.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.780
[pause] Alright.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.780
You wanna start cutting that one up?

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.780
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.780
&gt;&gt;Sam: [inaudible]

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.140
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Actually you can use the podium
over there.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:26.619
So my dough's like totally Leaning Tower of
Pisa right here, exploding.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.550
[pause]

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:40.140
&gt;&gt;Jenny: You're cutting it into sixteenths?

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.930
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Sixteenths.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.080
[pause] You guys know the comedian Mitch Hedberg?

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.170
He had, one of my favorite routines that he
does, he said that he went to get a slice

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.030
of pizza and the guy gave him like the smallest
piece.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:02.300
He said if the pizza was a pie chart for what
he would do with his lottery winnings, he

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.770
got the "donated to charity" slice.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.540
[laughter]
Or Yogi Berra.

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:14.480
He said, told a waitress you know, cut my
pizza into six slices instead of eight, 'cause

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480
I'm not hungry enough to eat eight slices.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.480
[laughter]

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480
[pause]

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.420
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You ready?

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.810
Alright.

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:37.960
[pause] Oh yeah.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:46.730
&gt;&gt;Jenny: [inaudible]

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:59.890
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yep.

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:17.430
[sound of cutting pizza]

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:26.200
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Ready?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:56.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Yep. [pause] I'm gonna drink.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.290
[laughter]

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:15.970
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Anyone wanna lick the pizza
wheel?

01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:17.410
It's sharp actually.

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:19.442
&gt;&gt;male audience member #39: How do you sharpen
them?

01:05:19.442 --> 01:05:24.470
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: You know this one, this is a
commercial one and I've had my trusty side

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:28.580
arm like for ten years and though it has a
couple little nicks in it and stuff.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.880
Super sharp.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.130
And then for this model, which we actually
carry this in our store.

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:38.070
It was funny because the company that manufactures
these doesn't typically sell to, doesn't sell

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.619
to retailers, only to restaurant supply.

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:41.980
So I didn't have the cred, you know to do
it.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.839
But I wanted to have the, so in our shop,
in addition to the classes, we have a little

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:51.160
gear store for where to get you know our favorite
pizza stone, our tomatoes, all these things.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.000
So I had to sort of court them to get to use,
you know, to get their product.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.560
Anyway, we have their product there.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.090
They do sell a replacement wheel.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:01.950
I've never had to use one, because you know
unless you're like a high-volume pizzeria,

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.030
these are totally bullet proof.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:11.530
What I like about this pizza wheel too is
the model number, is the P-1-7-7-A, so visualize

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:12.630
that.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.720
Yes.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.830
Sense of humor, yes.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:20.820
My buddy Neal, the guy who you know a decade
plus ago we made those pizzas in Chicago that

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:27.300
first night, he is saving up for a P177A tattoo
like Old English font across his back, apparently.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:32.680
So, the company of course wants a picture
when that's done, so.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.680
What do you guys think?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680
You like it?

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.680
Yeah.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.680
&gt;&gt;male audience member #40: I love it.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.089
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: I'm not a super sweet tooth,
but this one definitely, you know, I make

01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:39.089
an exception.

01:06:39.089 --> 01:06:40.089
You like those peanuts?

01:06:40.089 --> 01:06:43.750
Is that a nice, they're really you know crunchy,
salty, nice compliment with that.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.660
So I imagine that you guys are probably still
hungry, 'cause we had a couple slivers.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:55.260
What's going on upstairs is that smoked mozzarella,
sun-dried tomato panino, also another panino,

01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:00.040
which is done with taleggio cheese, which
is like a funky, rich, you know cow's milk

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
cheese from Italy.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
You guys know it?

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.960
It's kind of funky in smell, but its bark
is worse than its bite.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.430
It's really rich creamy buttery cheese, with
honey and white truffle oil on there.

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.180
And that one's crazy pizza.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:17.980
I actually, I did a menu for a café at this
auction house and they banned that sandwich

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:23.390
because it was, the aromas were too distracting
for the auction that was going on I guess.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:24.390
But it's a good one.

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.130
You know, it's, it's, yes there's truffle
oil on it.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.760
And truffle oil often is a red flag.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.810
I see it in a menu and I, you know, it's often
used like gratuitously, it's like, oh, it'll

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.920
be gourmet if I douse it in truffle oil.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.710
But this one I think qualifies as actually
working.

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:40.800
I think there are actually children named
after this particular combination, so that

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.830
says something about its powers.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:47.940
And then also we did we did little sliders
with our sausage recipe.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.990
It's ground pork with fennel seeds, chili
flake, garlic and a little bit of salt and

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.200
actually if you taste these and you like that
sausage, shoot me an e-mail, I'll be happy

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.900
to share the recipe with you guys.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.741
And then a couple of vegetable dishes as well.

01:08:00.741 --> 01:08:01.741
So hope you guys enjoy that.

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:02.741
I guess, what time do we have?

01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:05.140
&gt;&gt;male audience member #41: Quarter past.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Quarter past?

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.980
Oh, wow, so I was pretty good.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.920
Any other questions?

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.569
A couple, I know you know we've had actually
five, has anyone here been to the class?

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:23.400
Because we've had five groups from Google
come and I'd say we have a dozen people at

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.139
a time, a dozen to sixteen, so that's probably
at least half your company, right?

01:08:27.139 --> 01:08:28.139
[laughter]

01:08:28.139 --> 01:08:32.170
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Anyway, we do, we would love
to see you guys down on the Lower East Side

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:35.639
if you're ever like just in the hood going
to the Doughnut Plant, pop in and say hello.

01:08:35.639 --> 01:08:37.869
If we've got some pizzas coming out of the
oven, we'll gladly throw you a slice.

01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:38.869
Yeah.

01:08:38.869 --> 01:08:39.869
So.

01:08:39.869 --> 01:08:40.869
&gt;&gt;male audience member #42: [inaudible]

01:08:40.869 --> 01:08:41.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Good.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.900
Thanks guys.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.900
[applause]

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.900
&gt;&gt;Mark Bello: Thank you.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.539
And Jenny and Sam [inaudible] and Steve.
