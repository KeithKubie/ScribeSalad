00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.780
I am so moved and honored
by winning this prize.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.690
I look at my predecessors
who have received that prize

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.230
and I am awestruck
by all of them.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.270
There are people I have admired
my whole life and to feel

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.230
that I am recognized among them
is so meaningful to me and also

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.170
that this is a prize for
the study of humanity

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.140
that has really been
the foundation

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.900
of what has mattered
to me as a scholar.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.420
Looking across history
and seeing what it meant

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.190
to be a human being at different
periods of time and trying

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.710
to understand the challenges
that we all share as members

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.860
of humanity and how those
challenges may appear

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.740
in different forms from
era to era through history.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.490
So I could not be more
delighted and honored

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.030
than by the awarding
of this prize.
