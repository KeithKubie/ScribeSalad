00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.639
Hey, what's up guys grant here hanging out with Chris Caron and listen

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.039
We're gonna be giving away this iPhone ten to one of you for our upcoming self-made event happening in April. That's right

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.670
We're gonna fly one of you down here all

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.949
Expenses paid to hang out with us for three days so we can train you on how to do YouTube just stick around

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.270
We'll show you how hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the king of random today. We've got another experiment

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.050
We're gonna try because I think

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.250
Hundreds of people have requested to see this we're gonna see what happens if we take thermite and pit it against dry ice

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.660
The plan is pretty basic

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.090
And it's fairly similar to when we did our test with liquid aluminum and dry ice we've got a big old block of dry ice

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.549
We're gonna bore a whole part of the way down through the block

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.579
We're going to fill that hole with thermite, and then we're gonna light it off

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.109
We'll find out what will happen, which one do you think will win the thermite or the dry ice?

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.980
All right, there's a block of dry ice now let's fill this up with thermite powder

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.730
It's a good amount all right, we're gonna use a sparkler as a fuse and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.290
I'm gonna put it in upside down just so that I can light the base of it and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.169
Not have to you know deal with the wire on it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Here we go sparkler

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.330
Sort of the weirdest birthday cake I've ever seen

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.180
one heck of a candle and

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.569
The frosting is not that great there we go

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.680
Here we go

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.880
Whoo that whole block is glowy orange. Oh, and now we've got molten metal

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.319
Flowing around down inside that looks awesome. I'm hoping that the GoPro is picking up the glowing block

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.859
From the side because you can definitely see light

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.199
Coming through the side of the dry-ice just from the heat of that molten iron that looks really neat oh

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.960
I love that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.220
beautiful

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220
There's our little block of iron

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619
at least part of its iron

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.129
Is this nice carved out hole into our dry ice?

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309
knock off a little bit of the extra dirt and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.209
Iron beads that have landed on here

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.510
Let's get more thermite fill it back up and light it off again

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.159
Okay, guys grant Chris jumping back in for just a second with a few more details about our event in April

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.769
And how you can spend three days with us all-expense-paid roundtrip two-hour self-made event that's right

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.949
We're flying you down to teach you everything we know about how to build a successful YouTube channel

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.420
Or you could win the iPhone 10, we're giving that away as well now this isn't gonna be for everyone

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.769
But there are two types of people out there

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.039
We want to talk to you specifically you're either trying to make a living as a youtuber and getting

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.489
Frustrated because the platform keeps changing and everyone who seems to be successful on YouTube

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.599
isn't answering your emails or you're a business owner who understands that YouTube is one of the Internet's best-kept secrets on how to create a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.169
Perpetual lead base that can help your business grow and take it to a whole new level

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
But no one's opening up and showing you how to do it if you're not one of these two types of people then this event

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.929
In this contest is not for you, so don't worry about it, but if you are then here's the deal

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.970
All right

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.570
Pack it down in just a little bit. I'm not trying to make it too dense or anything. I just

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.358
Wanna really make sure a lot of its in there

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.909
Sparkler did a great job of igniting it before

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.160
Ah that looks so cool just a puddle of our molten iron inside the dryer

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.769
I love that glow through the side wall that I had

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.290
It's so cool

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.279
now I want to see if it's melted its way all the way through the block a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.649
Little bit we just barely got through the bottom of it

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.080
Here's our reacted thermite

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.350
It's super super warm

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.429
Thermite versus dry ice which one do you think won?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.380
I think they both did a pretty good job

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.080
The thermite melted this way down through the dry ice quite a bit, but with a single batch

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.419
The dry ice did still contain the thermite this stuff can suck a lot of heat out of something

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.550
Usually when we light off thermite

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.530
It just really sticks to the walls of everything that it touches, but because it can't stick to the dry

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.860
Ice this is kind of a first

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.750
Having this solid separate ingot as a result from our thermite pretty fun to look at I'm not sure what the difference is between this

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.280
blackened carbon bit and this shinier more metallic living spot

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.080
Kind of think that maybe this is some nice pure iron, and this is like some slag

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.989
But I could have that backwards or maybe the aluminum has separated itself out somehow

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.900
I need to do some tests that looked really cool

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.890
I loved the glowing molten metal inside the dry ice just glowing orange through the walls of it

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.890
I thought that was such a cool look

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.239
Really glad I did this. Thank you guys for recommending

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.540
This as I said we had

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.709
tons of people who wanted to see thermite versus dry ice

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.769
If you've got an idea for a cool experiment you want to see us

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.790
