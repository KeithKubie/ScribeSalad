00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.189
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:05.189
Can everybody hear me?

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.189
Cool.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:07.189
Well, good morning and welcome to the third
day of Google I/O. Thank you everybody for

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.820
coming to this.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.849
And I'm excited to see so many bright faces
here.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.240
And this is the Chrome fireside chat.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.630
We try to do this every year as an opportunity
for you guys, the developer community, to

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.910
engage with us, the Chrome team.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.760
So today we have a few product managers and
a few engineering managers here today to take

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.760
your questions.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.660
If you look over on that screen, there is
a URL there that you can go to which will

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.420
bring you to that page that you see on the
left over there where you can submit questions

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.120
and vote on questions.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.420
So that will automatically refresh throughout
the session, and I'll take questions from

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.070
there and I'll alternate with questions from
the audience.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.159
And so there's two standing microphones, one's
over there and one's over there.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.550
I would recommend actually moving close to
the edges so that you have easy access to

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.110
the microphones if you want to ask any questions.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.789
So that's it.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.570
We have an hour.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.570
Let's start with some intros.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.800
Each of us will tell you our name and what
we work on, and we will try to say something

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.650
about either a recently launched product or
feature that we're excited about or something

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410
that's coming up.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.090
So I'll start.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.480
My name is Jeff Chang, and I'm a product manager
on the Chrome browser.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.490
And I'm currently responsible for end user
features and I also help coordinate the releases

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.890
that we do every six weeks.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.070
And the recently launched feature which I'm
the most excited about, which hopefully you've

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.020
heard about by now, is tab sync, the synchronizing
of tabs across the many devices where you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
use Chrome.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.440
We had previously already had the ability
to sync your bookmarks and settings and other

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.320
stuff like that, but tab sync in particular
allows you to see all the tabs that you have

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.730
open on all of your other devices and open
any of them at any time, which I think is

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.590
really useful, especially across mobile and
desktop.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.770
And the tab even includes the navigations
history, so you're right back where you left.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.979
But that's me.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.060
And I'll pass it off to Alex now.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: Cool.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.060
Hi.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.170
So my name is Alex Komoroske.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.880
I'm a product manager on Chrome as well.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.010
I focus on the open Web platform, so all the
technologies that Web developers use to build

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.440
cool apps.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.750
My favorite stuff -- and if you saw my talk
on Wednesday this won't surprise you -- is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
Web components.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.170
So Web components is a new technology, a new
standard that's being developed.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.760
So relatively early stages, but it promises
to allow people to totally change the way

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.530
they architect their Web apps and be much
more productive.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.770
So I truly believe this is one of the technologies
that four years from now we'll look back and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.150
say how did we build stuff without this?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.010
I'm really excited about the Web components
in particular.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.850
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Hi, my name is Erik Kay.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.550
I'm an engineer on the Chrome team.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.980
Actually, I've been with the Chrome team now
for a really long time, almost since it started,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.180
which is actually getting close to six years
ago, believe it or not.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.470
We were secret for almost two years at the
beginning.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.670
And so even though we've only been out for
about four years now, it's been a long road

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.099
at this point.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.349
Anyway, I've done everything from the auto
update system to Chrome extensions, and our

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.709
app system, and I also now help lead the Native
Client effort and a few other things.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.580
The things I'm most excited about -- I'm actually
really excited about Web components too, Alex,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.580
also.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
I think that's pretty awesome.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.250
But selfishly the new stuff we're doing with
apps I think will really be a big deal for

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.370
people who want to use Web technologies to
do more advanced applications going forward.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.500
So I'm really excited to see what people are
going to build with that.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Hi.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.120
My name is Ian Ellison-Taylor.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.819
I'm the director of product management for
the Web platform.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.400
And I'm just realizing I probably should have
sat at that end since we already covered a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.980
couple of my favorite features in Web components,
and apps.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.079
I think just to echo Erik's comment, I think
that what is coming with the new generation

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.180
of apps is going to be a game changer.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.750
We kind of teased it just a little bit in
the keynote.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.570
We tried not to really oversell it because
it's very early days, but there's a ton of

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.510
very cool stuff coming there.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.540
But just is to make Pavel's life worse and
not repeat, probably the other thing -- the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.830
other major area I'm really excited about
that's coming up in the next sort of 12 months

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.570
is around all the tools work.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:53.010
We've got -- I think Pavel showed some amazing
stuff with our own dev tools in Chrome, but

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.380
if you also saw Adobe did a fantastic talk
on some of the work that they're doing around

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.401
Brackets and Shadow.

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:04.410
So -- and they're doing -- have done some
great work with Edge and designer focus tools

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.690
for the Web platform.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.620
And then there are other lots of companies
as well, Cloud 9 to name but one.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.229
So I think with a big investment in tooling
as well as on top of the platform we can make

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.830
it much easier for people like you to build
some amazing experiences.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.920
So I think that's really going to help.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.740
So I think that's pretty exciting.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.610
&gt;&gt;Pavel Feldman: Thank you.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.250
I'm Pavel Feldman, software engineer working
on the developer tools.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.180
And the areas we are currently focusing on
are better authoring so that you can develop

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.260
Chrome within the tools, its memory.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.230
As the platform matures we see a lot more
requests on the memory.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.100
As your apps are running for days and weeks,
you better make sure you have no memory leaks.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:56.130
So we have a new heap profiler, we have new
tools for native memory measurement, lots

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.690
of stuff there.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.300
The other area that is important for us is
support for mobile.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.500
We are working on the remote debugging for
the mobile and as well as emulating mobile

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.290
handsets on your desktop.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:16.530
We do support the -- we've created the remote
debugging protocol that we are happy to see

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.530
other big players using now around WebKit.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.400
The other area that is important for us is
the rendering smoothness, and you've seen

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.699
a couple of sessions on that yesterday.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.699
That's where we make sure your apps are buttery
smooth.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.610
And we are happy to see more and more requests
there.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.350
And overall we are happy to see the way the
platform matures and the way you have more

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.110
and more demand in the tooling.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.670
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: I'm Felix Lin and I'm on the
product team for Chrome OS.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.160
I spend most of my time working with hardware
partners to bring Chrome devices to markets.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.930
I guess I'm most excited about the recent
Samsung Chromebook and Chromebox that were

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.090
just released, and the close working relationship
over the past couple of years we've developed

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.190
with Intel and Samsung and Qualcomm and all
the other folks in the PC ecosystem building

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.680
devices.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.760
I'm a huge fan of Chrome, as you can imagine.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.600
I love all the things these guys have built,
but what we're really trying to do with Chrome

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.910
OS is fully integrate Chrome directly with
the hardware and deliver the best possible

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.220
experience in a fully integrated package.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.880
And so the benefit of Chromebooks and Chromeboxes
and other devices is that, you know, when

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.729
we can control the entire stack all the way
down to the hardware, we can deliver the best

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:48.520
possible experience for Chrome and the Web
on any hardware that people have.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.801
And so it's not about replacing PC's or replacing
other devices, but for the people who are

00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:58.949
spending more and more time on the Web, what
we want to do is just deliver an awesome,

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:04.639
magical experience for all the rich, immersive
experiences that you guys are building for

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:05.690
the Web.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.009
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Great.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:09.560
All right.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.880
So now we're open for questions.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.220
Feel free to walk up to any of the microphones
and ask or otherwise we will trade off with

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.819
the --
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: We'll take precedent for the people

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:27.280
who actually take some bravery and walk to
the mic.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280
[Laughter].

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.900
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: We'll just intersperse the ones
from moderator here.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.129
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:34.129
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:35.129
Good morning.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.129
I've got a question.

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:42.330
We're seeing yesterday that it's possible
to open tabs on other devices, and sometimes

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.070
if you're like left at home or you have the
devices -- the tabs open there and you open

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:55.190
on a mobile device, will it be possible to
close the tabs that are home because I read

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.460
it on the mobile device, it's done, the task
is done?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.600
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Yeah, I want that, too.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.180
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: So the question was it's great
that you can open tabs that are on other devices

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.740
from your other devices, but what about closing
them as well?

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.550
That's a really interesting feature request.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.110
We'll have to think about that.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.029
It might be possible if Chrome is running
on that device, but if that device has already

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:19.210
been shut down, obviously you couldn't do
it immediately.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.410
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: I think we could do it.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:27.050
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Maybe we could -- maybe we could
figure something out there.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.380
But yeah, I imagine that could be useful.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.870
But yeah, when we started designing that feature
we talked about tab sync, I think we realized

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.839
pretty quickly on that you wouldn't want the
exact same set of tabs duplicated everywhere.

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.200
So that's not the way it works.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.200
It's more or less a dashboard almost.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.620
You can see all of the devices you have, what's
open on each one and you just pick and choose

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.560
what you want.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.451
But we'll definitely keep that in mind.

00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.451
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:53.451
&gt;&gt;&gt; +1!

00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:54.451
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can I make a question on Chrome OS?

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:55.500
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Yes.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.950
&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the road map on Chrome OS and VPN?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.120
Sometimes to configure Chrome OS to VPN's
and getting to the site of a network it's

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.530
been a little bit of a hassle.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:12.450
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: So Chrome OS today already supports
VPN's and we're doing a ton of work through

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:20.269
the management console to enable I.T. administrators
to centrally manage an entire fleet of devices

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:25.100
quickly and easily to support different authentication
schemes, different access control mechanisms

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.100
and all that.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.340
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Looks like we have another megaphone
question over here.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.490
I'm wondering if anything is in the works
to improve drag and drop interoperability

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.880
between Web apps.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.880
So A couple of years ago we had the ability
to do file drag and drop in HTML5 and it was

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.870
fantastic and I would love to see sort of
the next evolution so I could, for instance,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:57.130
be in Gmail and just drag an attachment out
of a message over to another application that

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.910
can do something with that file and have that
application be able to sort of interact with

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.310
Gmail to pull in the information it needs
and do something, or vice versa, drag out

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.640
of an application on to a Gmail, et cetera.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.380
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: So that's a great use case
there.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.560
And there isn't exactly precisely a standard
respect being developed to do precisely what

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.580
you're asking for, but something that does
something sort of similar is Web Intents,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.790
which is a spec that we're driving that allows
applications to say I have an attach or whatever

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.930
and allow the users to pick which application
they would like to sort of service that request

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:30.930
with.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.880
So theoretically you could have a loose coupling
between Gmail and any other Web app that would

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.160
want to view those images or what you have.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.950
But that's a good point that users are familiar
with drag and drop and it makes sense to be

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:47.899
able to drag and drop these things between
tabs, but that's not something that's currently

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:49.290
on the roadmap.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.290
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Yeah.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.649
I just want to emphasize that last point,
is loose coupling.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:57.800
So Web Intents is another one of these really
exciting Web technologies that I think is

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.300
going to change the Web in a year.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.990
That you're going to look and say, oh, my
God, how did we interact without this?

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:10.740
Because the idea is that now Gmail can interact
with a whole host of Web apps that it knows

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.750
nothing about.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.260
It didn't have to be performed with the knowledge
that Oh, I want to save this attachment to

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.920
Dropbox or G Drive or whatever else or that
I want to share this picture with Twitter

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.930
or Google+ or whatever else.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.390
That it's up to you in the apps that are provided.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.430
And just that fact that we can now have these
websites interoperate without having to hard

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.769
code relationships between them I think is
going to be a game changer.

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:37.269
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Cool.

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:39.279
Any other megaphone questions?

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.490
All right.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.110
Let's take one from the Google moderator page.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.740
So offline it's pretty important for the Chrome
OS story.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.990
What features are missing from the Web platform
that would help drive offline application

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.990
uses?

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.920
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: I'll take a stab at this
one.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.180
There already are a suite of technologies
in the Web platform that allow you to do offline

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.180
things.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.720
You've got things like Local Storage, you
have app cache, Index DB and others.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.029
They aren't necessarily a joy to use right
now, but they do exist as alternatives to

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:14.029
build upon.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.140
The file API is a great -- another great example.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.670
But I would argue actually that the way to
think about really driving offline application

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.820
usage is the way you develop your applications.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.080
So if you develop your application with an
always on server -- always connected through

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.329
a server mindset, you're going to approach
it in certain ways and architect your app

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:34.610
in certain ways.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.820
And then when you try to layer on offline
it can be pretty challenging because you don't

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.839
have that server connection all the time.

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:45.450
So actually orienting yourself as a developer
and saying I'm going to start at the beginning

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.290
working in this world where I don't know if
I have internet connection, it sort of forces

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.240
you actually to pivot your thinking and to
design your apps in a different way.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.340
And that's a great thing about the new -- the
next evolution of Chrome apps is actually

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.100
they encourage you as a developer to start
from this world where you are sort of offline

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.120
by default, and connecting to the server is
almost an exception.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.560
So that really orients you to sort of the
architecture app in the way that really works

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.850
for offline.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.800
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.230
So thanks for the shout-out to the Chrome
apps, but the -- we really want to emphasize

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.029
that this is one of these key architectural
things that we are building in from the beginning

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.930
for Chrome apps is to say that apps should
be written to be offline by default and we're

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:32.079
doing a lot of things built in to them to
make it possible to make it easy for you to

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.540
not get -- you know, get your app into a bad
state.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.790
One of the interesting things about offline
is people sort of get hung up on, you know,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.150
Oh, well, I've got connectivity everywhere.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.120
Why do we need offline?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.470
And it's because offline isn't such a straightforward
thing.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.950
It's not a question of am I on an airplane
with no connectivity?

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:59.720
It's, Oh, well, sometimes I've got spotty
connectivity on my cell network or other times

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.380
I'm at a trade show with 5,000 people all
using the same Wi-Fi, you know, connection

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:14.110
or other times I'm at a hotel with a captive
proxy or, you know -- there's -- offline is

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:20.390
-- has a wide spectrum actually, and making
your apps that is resistant, resilient to

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.410
these network conditions takes a little bit
of forethought.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:29.690
You have to build app, assume that it's offline
and basically you're operating on local data

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.690
and syncing with the server.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:37.010
And all these features that Alex was talking
about with local storage, operating on that

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:43.480
local data, having your code running locally
to begin with and then synchronizing the server

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.050
and as you get network connectivity is sort
of the key to making offline work.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.240
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.850
The computer that was projecting the URL for
the questions just died and won't start up.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:03.600
So we're going to try to replace that, but
hopefully we have a pretty good queue of Google

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.689
moderator questions there and audience questions,
so let's keep going.

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:09.689
&gt;&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:13.339
So Chrome is a leader of the HTML5 standard,
no doubt.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:18.840
I was curious on the roadmap for the mobile
Android version of Chrome, when that would

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.019
kind of catch up to the current platform.

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:28.260
Specifically in my case for the WebGL implementation,
being that that's super hard in Tegra and

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.070
Intel chipsets, but I just wondered if it
was on the roadmap and where that might fall.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Is anyone from that
team here?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.190
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Oh, is there someone

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.600
in the back?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
Oh, yes.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.889
Oh, Mrs. Smith, good Lord!

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:48.310
Yes, Grace, come down and maybe answer this
question, otherwise I'll make up something

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.250
like it will be there next week, maybe Tuesday.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.250
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.260
[Indiscernible] is also here.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.450
So WebGL we are under development behind the
flags.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.980
There's a performance issue that you just
mentioned and then there's a potential DOS

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.069
attack.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:09.179
So we try to work with like OEM device drivers
to try to address these problems.

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:12.709
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: The high level strategy,
of course, is that all these features end

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:14.429
up on mobile.

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:22.839
There's implementation issues, and also recognizing
that the unique power management requirements

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.389
make it a little bit tricky, but generally
when we do new features in the Web platform

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:29.480
we're thinking about the mobile scenarios.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.659
Almost -- I would say first and foremost generally.

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:36.960
We worry a little bit less about the desktop
because that's an easier scenario.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.960
So pretty much everything.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.729
I can't think of anything off the top of my
head that we're not thinking about being in

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.779
mobile sooner or later.

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:54.130
So hopefully we'll -- that lag between desktop
and mobile will get shorter and shorter.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.859
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: So there's also -- there's
a little bit of this temporary lag, but the

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.019
fact that Chrome for Android is relatively
new.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:05.240
So we're still going through and making sure
we get all those pieces that we worked on

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.470
to make Chrome for Android work back into
Chrome.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.609
So that process takes a little bit of time,
which is why it takes a little bit for us

00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:18.279
to catch up to where desktop Chrome is right
now, but that's a temporary problem.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:20.960
So there's a long-term problem of some of
these features that you have to make sure

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.541
you design it in the mobile -- to work well
in mobile use case and other ones that it

00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:28.769
just takes awhile for us to catch up to the
desktop.

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:33.119
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Okay.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:39.479
Next question from the moderator page is,
OSX 10.8 has a power nap feature that keeps

00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:44.460
various bits of a user's data synced while
the machine is suspended, email, et cetera.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.289
Any plans for such a feature in Chrome OS?

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:57.419
Felix, do you want to try to take this one?

00:18:57.419 --> 00:18:59.840
I guess, you can look at it on that screen,
too.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.519
Since that machine is broken anyway, maybe
we can get that screen mirrored on that screen.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.769
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: So this is definitely a feature
that we're looking at.

00:19:09.769 --> 00:19:15.210
I don't know exactly when we'll have this
feature in Chrome OS.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.840
Certainly as we work with Intel and other
hardware partners, these types of capabilities

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.149
are much easier for us to implement because
we have full knowledge of the hardware that's

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:28.529
running in these systems and we can actually
design them.

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:33.950
The great thing about Chrome OS, though, is
that you could buy a machine today and if

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.080
that machine has the capability at all to
make this possible, we'll roll out that feature

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.019
and you will get it automatically.

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:48.159
So a lot of these features, when we spec the
minimum requirements for Chrome OS boxes,

00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:52.250
a lot of what we're doing is looking forward
and making sure that we've got the kind of

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.999
head room that we need to be able to add new
features, new capabilities, even though what

00:19:55.999 --> 00:20:00.519
we release on any given day may not include
this full set of capabilities.

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:06.720
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: I should point out as well,
this basic feature, this basic request, makes

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.929
sense in a lot of different scenarios.

00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:11.989
It makes sense, especially on mobile as well,
where you don't know, you don't want to constantly

00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:13.960
have your radio powered up.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.950
There's also been, with these event pages.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:24.009
Generally we're moving towards a model where
it's possible for Web apps to sort of allow

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:28.149
Chrome to wake them up, do a little bit of
work, put them back to sleep in response to

00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:29.289
events.

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:33.429
That's really basically the core of what power
nap is doing as well.

00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:35.210
So we are looking into this on multiple fronts.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:40.739
So while Jeff is figuring that out, I'll move
on to the next one.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.739
Okay.

00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:49.780
Will I ever be able to run Chrome OS on a
tablet, maybe even a Nexus 7 tablet?

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.239
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: That's a great question.

00:20:56.239 --> 00:21:00.729
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: Um, Chrome OS was really designed

00:21:00.729 --> 00:21:05.729
to run on a variety of form factors, so there's
nothing about Chrome OS that says that we

00:21:05.729 --> 00:21:09.909
can't run on a tablet or pick your device
form factor.

00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:15.519
The first device that we focused on, because
of the complexity of use case, is the calm

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:20.509
shell where we just bring full capabilities
of Chrome to bear.

00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:27.399
You know, today, Google's OS for tablets is
Android and we are able to bring all of the

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:33.419
capabilities of Chrome to Android for Jelly
Bean and Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:40.379
We're working on creating a completely seamless,
coherent experience across all devices, regardless

00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:43.470
of whether the underlying OS happens to be
Android or Chrome OS.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:49.889
So from the user standpoint, whether you are
buying content from the play store or whether

00:21:49.889 --> 00:21:54.749
you are running an app, our goal is to make
it such that you don't have to worry about

00:21:54.749 --> 00:22:00.320
whether it's actually Android or Chrome OS
running on that tablet; we want that to work.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.489
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Next.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:09.720
How will the two operating systems, Android
and Chrome OS, eventually converge?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.629
Yeah, we get asked -- we've been asked about
this in the past, you know, one thing to keep

00:22:14.629 --> 00:22:21.429
in mind is that Chrome OS has the goal of
designing an end-to-end computing experience

00:22:21.429 --> 00:22:26.099
that -- that embodies kind of the same core
principles as Chrome does, the security, and,

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:31.070
you know, over time we've been thinking about
what parts of the technologies between those

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.710
two makes sense to integrate, right?

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.669
We are very happy to say that Chrome for Android
came out of beta this week, so Chrome for

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:39.399
Android is now stable.

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:42.850
And maybe Felix you have some other comments
on this or --

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.789
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Well, I can add a few things.

00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:48.889
I mean, one thing is that you'll see, I think
you are going to see more and more convergence

00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:51.169
over time.

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:57.690
You know, we -- first off just bringing Chrome,
you know, to Android was sort of the first

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.400
big step.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.269
But there are many places where we -- where
we can integrate more.

00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:08.849
First off, getting the same set of apps running,
using the same cloud infrastructure.

00:23:08.849 --> 00:23:14.710
But I think the opportunities doing some of
the -- I think the Chrome-to-phone stuff that

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:20.009
we had before, we're looking to -- to have
-- to leverage a lot of the same infrastructure

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:22.749
and to have more and more integration over
time.

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:27.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.919
Any other microphone questions?

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:31.239
Don't be shy.

00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:36.249
Any plans for a messaging platform inside
of Chrome or Chrome OS, similar to C2DM or

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:41.870
iOS notifications, which I believe are coming
to the desktop?

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:49.299
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So we actually do have some -- effectively
with the sync we have a notification system

00:23:49.299 --> 00:23:55.129
built into Chrome and into Chrome OS and it
turns out that behind the scenes a lot of

00:23:55.129 --> 00:24:00.729
the, you know, infrastructure is very similar
and, again, as I said, that we're looking

00:24:00.729 --> 00:24:04.469
to unify some of the basic infrastructure
that we share across Android and Chrome.

00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:09.789
I would expect to see our messaging systems
converge as well.

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:15.200
&gt;&gt;Alex Komoroske: You can imagine the solution
wouldn't just have to be about messaging,

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200
per se.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.179
It could be about notifications, so different
apps could decide different things that were

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:20.200
worthwhile to do.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.239
In fact, actually in the meet the Web platform
video series we showed off a mock of what

00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:27.029
that could look like.

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:28.369
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Cool.

00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:30.149
All right, audience question.

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:32.299
&gt;&gt;&gt; A question about Chrome apps.

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:37.049
What's the plan to get Chrome apps for Chrome
on Android, and how is it going to work?

00:24:37.049 --> 00:24:41.859
Is it going to the Chrome Web store, it's
going to a (indiscernible) to play?

00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:43.159
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Okay.

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:46.399
Let's see, how do we start with this?

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:51.950
First off, you know, it's a common question
that we get about what's our plan for getting,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.259
you know, Chrome apps to mobile.

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:58.440
So you heard Sundar say at the keynote, I
said the other day at the apps talk we are

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.109
intending to get Chrome apps to mobile, basically
everywhere that we have Chrome.

00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:05.659
Now how are we going to do that?

00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:06.659
The details of that?

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:08.340
The timing of that?

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.770
You know, it's too early to say.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.639
I can say that we're looking for your feedback.

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:15.769
We want to know from you what you want.

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:19.619
What are the most important features that
you want to see brought to mobile?

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:23.109
And just one last little plug, we are hiring.

00:25:23.109 --> 00:25:26.299
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So if you want to help make this

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:28.119
happen, you know --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:30.210
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Exactly.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.389
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Cool, another audience question.

00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:38.599
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also about Chrome apps, you launched them
from within Chrome but with a new version

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:41.500
that will act a lot like they are native to
the platform.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.519
Any thoughts about setting them up so you
would be able to launch them as if they were

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:45.519
a native app?

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:47.099
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Absolutely.

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:52.489
That's one of the key features of the next
evolution of Chrome apps here is that we are

00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:54.320
pulling them outside of the browser.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.609
It's not just that they have standalone Windows;
it's that the way that you launch them will

00:25:57.609 --> 00:26:01.279
be without even necessarily having to have
Chrome running.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:06.139
So basically you will just launch them from
the native desktop.

00:26:06.139 --> 00:26:12.779
&gt;&gt;&gt; When will we have private key SSH?

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.580
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:21.599
So I know that the engineers working on that
pretty -- on the SSH thing for Chrome OS is

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:24.149
a top feature request.

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.960
So I know that it's going to come.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.359
I don't know what the timeline is.

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:34.440
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.049
Looks like we've got someone walking up to
the microphone.

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.789
Go ahead.

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:41.979
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why was the change to Aura made?

00:26:41.979 --> 00:26:46.980
I know when the Chrome was initially announced,
the launch video mentioned that you didn't

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.980
even have a desktop background.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:56.330
And the change on -- to Aura in the newer
version of Chrome OS did make it a lot more

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.029
like a desktop operating system.

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:00.759
What was the decision, why did that happen?

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:04.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: It was 99% user feedback.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:12.190
I mean -- I think when we launched Chrome
OS in the particular UI model, it was something

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.190
of an experiment.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.669
It was something that no one had ever done
before.

00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:19.940
We said that we were going to update it based
on user feedback.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.609
And obviously I think Sundar made the point
about performance improvements and feature

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.279
improvements, but people just gave us their
feedback that they wanted it to be a little

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:36.220
bit more like a -- you know, a "traditional"
OS and particularly I think that model, I

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.179
mean this is just for me personally -- I will
let Felix talk a little bit.

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:45.669
For me personally the tab model I think worked
really well on the smaller screen.

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:51.269
But once you get to sort of Chromebox style
and you're on a large monitor, that's -- that

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:54.830
single large window gets a little weird, you
know.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.929
It's like you get a huge crick in your neck
going from one side of the screen to the other.

00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:05.409
So being able to like open multiple windows,
switch between -- then multi-tasking, now

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:08.940
I've got three or four things going on at
once, I want a quick way to switch between

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.909
them.

00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:15.000
There's just a use case that seemed pretty
important.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.450
And that you can very easily configure it
so it behaves like it used to if you don't

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.450
like that.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.419
Then you just run everything full screen,
keep everything in a tab.

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:28.330
So if you're in that model, you don't really
lose anything, but if you want something a

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.570
little bit more traditional with multiple
windows, you can do that, too.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:37.749
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: I think the biggest benefit of
having a windowing system is that people can

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:39.820
do more than one thing at one time, right?

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.059
So a very, very common use case is writing
an email and checking your calendar, if you

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:48.309
have to flip between tabs and you only have
one pane, it's a pretty miserable experience.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:54.369
Also, as -- as Ian was mentioning, you know
with the Chromebox we are now able to deliver

00:28:54.369 --> 00:29:01.820
an experience on dual 30-inch monitors, if
you have got a huge desktop having one full-screen

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.730
window is not a great use of space.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:10.010
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Also, one other kind of funny
thing that we discovered by having a full

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:16.600
screen browser, which is there's sort of an
interesting psychological effect for users.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.570
So users have sort of preconceived notions
of what a browser can and can't do, it turns

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.570
out.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.460
And so they see tabs, they see an address
bar, they see a back button and they immediately

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.690
assume, oh, well it's, you know, it's only
a Web page, it can't do everything an app

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:32.690
can do.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:37.789
Or it certainly can't run offline, so there's
sort of these interesting things that sort

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:39.950
of get in the way just by having it there.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:45.789
And as we move to more focus on apps within
Chrome OS and wanting to bring apps fronts

00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:50.009
and center, it was important to pull those
out of the browser and really give them their

00:29:50.009 --> 00:29:51.009
own windows.

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:53.869
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: That actually reminds
me since I tease this on Twitter about there

00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:55.009
being an Easter egg.

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:57.080
It reminds me of one of them.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.239
So Kan, if you saw the keynote yesterday,
Kan did the sort of the spinning window thing,

00:30:01.239 --> 00:30:03.059
so that's in Chrome OS.

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:06.960
So that wasn't just something we rigged up
for the keynote.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.229
You can -- it shows the power of the window
manager, so one of the keys is very obvious.

00:30:12.229 --> 00:30:14.469
&gt;&gt;&gt; Control alt and then refresh button or
something like that?

00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:15.739
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Sorry, what was that?

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:18.379
&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't it like control alt and then the
refresh button?

00:30:18.379 --> 00:30:20.309
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: It may or may not be
that.

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:22.499
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have done it before.

00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:23.499
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor:.

00:30:23.499 --> 00:30:25.659
[ Laughter ]
You give it away.

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:30.639
But there's another -- another Easter egg
that was in the keynote as well.

00:30:30.639 --> 00:30:35.139
I don't know if anyone spotted that one, but
I'll maybe talk about that later, if the questions

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:36.369
are good enough.

00:30:36.369 --> 00:30:41.549
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Go ahead.

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:49.860
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the current Chromebook runs on
Intel or Celeron, but all of your Android

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:56.929
devices currently run on ARM, video, Qualcomm,
TI, respectively, if you're ever going to

00:30:56.929 --> 00:30:59.840
get to a point in the future where you are
going to be able to dual boot a device, whether

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.389
it be a tablet or a laptop, desktop, or even
a smart phone down the road, into either Chrome

00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:11.580
OS or Android, you have to get on the same
CPU hardware platform, is there anything inherent

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:17.029
that makes it difficult for Chrome OS to run
on say an ARM chip or is this just a matter

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:21.659
of timing that this is basically something
that you should expect at some undescript

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:23.349
point down the road?

00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:28.719
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: I think -- we can't talk about
any future products obviously.

00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:35.009
But there's nothing about Chrome OS that limits
it to a particular processor architecture.

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:36.999
Completely open source.

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:44.359
In fact, many of the ARM vendors have brought
Chrome OS up on different ARM SOCs, and it's

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:53.729
really a matter of, you know, timing and price
point and, you know, a variety of other things

00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:59.249
with respect to, you know, packaging a product
and bringing it to commercial release.

00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:03.779
So I don't -- you know, basically there's
nothing holding anybody back.

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:06.889
Other than, you know, commitment to ship the
product.

00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:09.190
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: There is one thing that I will
toss out.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.249
Which is it's not a limitation of Chrome OS.

00:32:13.249 --> 00:32:18.559
It's more just sort of what our chip sets
have been building -- what the ARM chip sets

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:24.580
and manufacturers have been building, so their
main focus is on phones and now tablets, and

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.289
what's interesting is that phones and tablets
have smaller screens.

00:32:29.289 --> 00:32:34.899
And it turns out that -- that the thing that
you need that's one of the biggest performance

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:40.950
bottlenecks on computers in general is memory
bandwidth between the CPU and the display

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:41.950
architecture.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.339
And the bigger the screen, the more memory
bandwidth that you need.

00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:48.609
Turns outs the smaller the screen, the less
you need, right, you know, conversely.

00:32:48.609 --> 00:32:54.559
So it's an optimization that you can do to
make it use less power, to be cheaper and

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:55.559
that sort of a thing.

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:59.151
So many of the ARM chip sets are designed
to really be only efficient up to a certain

00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.409
screen size.

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:05.029
So it turns out, this is one of the things
that held ARM back getting to the desktop,

00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:07.830
bigger monitors, you know, hi-res.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:12.879
But now as tablets have had -- now get an
increased density, increased size, increased

00:33:12.879 --> 00:33:16.409
number of pixels, they've had to solve those
same memory bandwidth problems.

00:33:16.409 --> 00:33:23.069
So I think we are right in the cusp of being
able to see really awesome desktop and laptop

00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:27.830
ARM form factors coming and you will see it
probably for a variety of systems.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.899
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Thank you, next question.

00:33:32.899 --> 00:33:33.899
The moderator page.

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:38.250
Speaking of sync, any plan for app syncing
as well, with an API that would allow apps

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.659
to sync their data as well?

00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:41.059
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So, yes.

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:45.970
That already exists.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:55.419
There's an extension API people can start
playing with today, storage API, Chrome.storage.sync,

00:33:55.419 --> 00:34:00.440
basically it's a simple key value store so
you can sort of maintain your state and your

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.340
preferences and that sort of a thing.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:08.970
It's an easy way to sort of move app and extension
settings from -- from machine to machine.

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:15.330
We have much more planned for doing more cloud-based
storage and making APIs available to apps.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:21.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: And obviously there's
a quick plug for our colleagues on drive that

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:26.369
for applications to be able to store their
application, the user data, that's obviously

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:30.099
one of the goals for drive and getting drive
onto lots of devices.

00:34:30.099 --> 00:34:35.490
So you get sort of both -- both parts of the
equation, your settings and your data that

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:36.490
can travel with you.

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:40.539
So sync is a huge part of the overall strategy
about what we think is really interesting

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:43.960
about having lots of devices, but a Chrome
experience on one of them.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.609
So I think it's pretty key.

00:34:45.609 --> 00:34:48.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Okay.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.730
So regarding Chrome OS and the enterprise,
what plans do you have for enhancing the management

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:57.960
and performance of Cloud Print, particularly
around management of over 1,000 printers at

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:07.039
a given company?

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:12.499
I know that in Chrome, we don't usually talk
about version numbers, but Chrome 20 stable

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:16.710
-- just went to the stable channel this past
week.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.000
Actually, I take that back.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.020
I'm mixing up my versions.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.809
We are always managing multiple releases at
the same time, so we have four different channels,

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:26.970
I'm actually thinking about 21, 21 I know
has Cloud Printing more directly integrated

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.980
into the Chrome's print dialogue itself, so
it's easier to find your printers more easily

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980
when you are printing.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.150
And know that that dialogue has a search box
that you can search across all of the printers

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.410
that are available to you.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:45.870
So I hope that's -- that the UI team has considered
the issue of -- of when you have lots of printers

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.329
there, although I think this question might
be around more from the enterprise.

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:50.329
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Yeah.

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:52.790
Actually, I wonder if any here -- if they
have any from Cloud Print here.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.839
They have a session today, so if there's no
one from the cloud print team right here,

00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:01.440
definitely go to that session and ask them
if they have done a lot of work there.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.140
So they can probably answer the question.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.180
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Cloud Print is actually the
last session in this room today, I think.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.630
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Actually, just so you know, I
mean one of the big strengths that we've seen

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.089
with -- with Chromebooks and Chrome OS has
been enterprise management.

00:36:16.089 --> 00:36:22.920
This ability to, you know, drop in, you know,
a thousand new devices and just hand them

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.920
out.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.130
And you not have to image them and configure
them on a per user basis and deploy a whole

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:33.289
bunch of stuff to them is one of the key strengths
we see of Chrome OS.

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:37.260
And so we've been investing pretty heavily
in the enterprise management console to really

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.480
make that better.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.330
So if there's any limitations on that, we
want to hear about it.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.660
File bugs, you know, talk to us.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:51.650
Because we think that this is an area that
we can really own.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:56.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Yeah, we have an audience question.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.859
&gt;&gt;&gt; So I came in a little bit late, I don't
know if you addressed this yet, but I was

00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:03.460
curious about what's the state of eating your
own dogfood within Google?

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.849
If you could talk about the transition of
getting people to be full-time Chromebook

00:37:08.849 --> 00:37:11.460
users instead of regular desktop users.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.279
Are people doing that?

00:37:13.279 --> 00:37:14.400
How successful is it?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.530
What kind of experience have you had?

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.740
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Sure, yeah.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.869
The question is asking, you know, about the
phrase eating our own dogfood, which means

00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:25.839
using our own products as they are being developed
at Google.

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:29.529
I can say for sure for Chrome browser, I definitely
eat my own dogfood.

00:37:29.529 --> 00:37:34.430
I run Canary, which is the nightly auto update,
built side-by-side with the beta installation

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.970
on my machine.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:42.020
So I actually use Canary every day, so I can
stay with the latest engineering.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.059
But I don't recommend that to normal folks.

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:48.490
It's painful at times.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.839
And in terms of Chromebooks, I certainly carry
around my Chromebook with me.

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:56.089
I have it right over there and I use it and
it's really convenient when I'm going to meetings

00:37:56.089 --> 00:38:01.640
and stuff, especially when I want to get out
an email in like 60 seconds or something.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.120
Open it up on my lid, press the button and
be able to fire off the email and close my

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.039
lid within 30 seconds while, you know, like
my other Windows laptop might be churning

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:15.830
away on the anti-virus thing for like a minute
because Google corporate makes us run anti-virus

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.020
on them.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.680
So, yeah, we definitely see that a lot around
the office.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.210
But I do, you know, use multiple devices and
multiple operating systems.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.269
And for Canary on Windows, I run that, because
I want to get the latest code from our engineers

00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:30.269
as soon as possible.

00:38:30.269 --> 00:38:33.390
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you have anyone going cold turkey,
just Chrome OS exclusively?

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:40.309
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: I can tell you that the dogfooders
at Google who are using Chrome OS have skyrocketed

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:43.950
since we released the latest Chromebooks running
on Intel Corp.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.950
You know the great thing about Google -- two
things, right?

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.780
We have access to whatever computer we want.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:56.240
If you want a Macbook Air or Macbook Pro,
whatever high-end system you want, you can

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240
have it.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.350
If you want a Chromebook, you can have it.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:04.590
We don't force anybody to dogfood Chrome OS,
so everybody who is using Chrome OS uses it

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:10.329
by choice, and when you think about it, the
fact that you see people, more and more Googlers

00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:16.849
who have their pick of any hardware that they
want walking around with Chromebooks, typically

00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:22.660
which cost often a fraction of what they could
be spending, it's pretty remarkable.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:33.369
I can tell you that with the latest Chromeboxes
and the latest Chromebooks, these devices

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:42.550
are just completely hassle free, battery life,
power management, superb, you know, even the

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:49.529
-- the first generation Chromebook, just because
of the fact that we have so many existing

00:39:49.529 --> 00:39:55.200
customers on older hardware and the fact that
we're constantly updating even older hardware

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.779
with newer releases of Chrome OS, you know,
I switch devices continuously, and so yesterday

00:40:01.779 --> 00:40:06.920
during a keynote when you saw Brian talk about
the fact that, you know, he's got 7 or 8 different

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.660
machines and he just walks from one machine
to the next, he doesn't carry a single machine

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:16.869
he has to worry about, you know, that is all
possible because of Chrome and Chrome OS.

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:22.650
You know, when you're using a machine which
is a year old and you pick it up one day,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:27.190
and it's running 30% faster than the day before,
because you've got the auto update pushed

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:35.010
to you, it's really noticeable, and users
really love it, and so even today, even though

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:43.240
I've got, you know, you know, the latest Samsung
Chromebook, when I switch to the device that

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.130
I've been using for over a year, I really
don't notice much of a performance difference

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.680
for most of the things that I do.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.940
I'll notice some things for, you know, high-end
video and things like that, but the device

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.670
is completely usable, it's just great.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.940
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So let me give you another perspective.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.869
I do use my Chromebook exclusively as my laptop,
I have to use a different laptop, because

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:12.599
in engineering we to test on a bunch of different
platforms, but I do live on my Chromebook,

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:18.920
and it's pretty common now within Google especially
with the hardware, I'll say that the IT staff

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:25.490
within Google, you know, loves it and they
want more people to switch over, as soon as

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:31.520
they can, and Google -- Googlers are a really
demanding audience.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.530
It turns out that, as Felix said, they can
use whatever hardware they want, and -- and

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.780
a lot of them are doing heavy-duty development
tasks and that sort of thing, and so making

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.559
hardware that is going to be good enough for
the majority of Googlers to actually get their

00:41:45.559 --> 00:41:51.170
job done is a tall task, and the biggest bit
of feedback that we heard early on was that

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:56.440
for Googlers the previous generation of hardware
wasn't quite powerful enough.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.240
And now the feedback that we've gotten from
people, is like, wow, this is actually -- this

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:07.299
has crossed the line and it's great, it's
easy, and totally what they want.

00:42:07.299 --> 00:42:12.170
Now, they want more of course and so we're
working to make -- build even more powerful

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:18.410
machines and a wider variety of form factors,
and trust us when we say that Googlers are

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:22.180
some of the most demanding audience out there,
and -- but the rate that they're growing and

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.439
they're selecting in and using it themselves
is going through the roof.

00:42:26.439 --> 00:42:31.250
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a great idea to have kind of your
computer as like an appliance or kiosk, and

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.859
I feel very nervous if I have anything on
a single machine, that is my only copy, I

00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:39.450
like moving everything to the cloud, just
being able to -- but I know that there's lots

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:45.630
of little, you know, dusty corners of our
lives where they're not all, you know, able

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.250
to be pushed to the cloud on Chrome OS yet,
so it's nice that you guys are kind of filling

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.250
in those holes.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: That's a great point.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.130
I'm the same way.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:43:00.950
Since I don't do development, I'm 99% -- 99.9%
of my time is spent on a Chromebook, and mostly

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:07.769
that -- honestly it's about I'm old and I
need a keyboard, I love tablets, but I spend

00:43:07.769 --> 00:43:11.940
all my time in e-mail, I just need to be able
to type on a real keyboard, but I love the

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.260
battery life, that sort of 8, 9 hours, I can
get through the day and I don't have to carry

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.500
the little power brick around, so the battery
life thing is huge for me when I'm running

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.500
around campus.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.190
Another thing that's really nice about Google,
and I bounce between different offices, I'll

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.750
often not carry a machine with me, and I'll
go to the other office, we have these little

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:37.470
tech stop places and I can grab a Chromebook
from tech stop, I just log in, carry on from

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:41.559
where I left off, and then I just hand it
back at the end of the day, and I just don't

00:43:41.559 --> 00:43:45.400
have to travel with anything, so when I'm
going through security, and, you know, just

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.630
everything gets so much easier when I can
just pick up that machine, log in, carry on,

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.980
hand it back and not worry, like what did
I leave on that machine?

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.990
What was I doing?

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.349
Did I do anything weird today?

00:43:56.349 --> 00:44:01.440
So for me, that's a hugely important use case,
and I think we'll see more of that as time

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.440
goes on.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.440
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.079
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Let's take a question from this
side.

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:09.730
&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is on moderator but it seems
to have dropped off.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.509
I just want to know about international availability
of Chrome OS devices particularly the new

00:44:14.509 --> 00:44:22.839
Samsung Chromebook, because I'm from New Zealand
and, yeah, we just don't have access to them

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:23.839
there.

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:29.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: What's the international
access for Chromebooks, particularly the new

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.480
one.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.019
Particularly New Zealand?

00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:38.470
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: So the new Chromebooks are currently
available in US and UK.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:43.980
We're looking at getting them certified in
more countries as quickly as possible, but,

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:50.390
you know, as with all things, it's a matter
of just figuring out where the demand is and

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:53.420
how to role out in more countries and get
the certifications.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:45:00.339
You know, the demand for the new Chromebooks,
i think, have greatly exceeded the expectations

00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:06.479
and so, again, it's just a matter of time,
but we're working on getting it out there.

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:07.479
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:08.839
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:13.810
Back to this -- actually, I'll go ahead and
let's do a couple of these.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.880
At least one of these.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.039
How far is Web GL support for mobile versions
of Chrome?

00:45:18.039 --> 00:45:22.430
I think we already answered that earlier up
at the microphone.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.599
Next question here is about Chrome on iOS.

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:30.940
So for you guys in here, we launched Chrome
on iOS yesterday, we actually it's like the

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.210
number one ranked in the app store now, right?

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:38.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Yeah, Chrome on iOS
was number one, and drive on iOS was number

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.260
two.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.260
We'll see how long that lasts.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: So we're happy that --
[ Applause ]

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Thank you.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:51.559
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: We are definitely very happy
that we were able to get that out to you guys,

00:45:51.559 --> 00:45:56.690
especially with the think store we've been
telling, it's very important that we have

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.680
Chrome available on as many platforms as possible.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.680
In terms of how Chrome runs on iOS, you know,
we obviously have to follow Apple's technical

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.360
specifications there, so in terms of the actual
Web content it does use the UR WebView.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.000
I don't know if anyone else has any comments
there.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.470
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So there's two things: You have
to think about performance on a number of

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.339
different axis, right?

00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:25.009
So one is how long does it take -- how fast
is it to just get around and get your work

00:46:25.009 --> 00:46:29.569
done and do stuff like that and then the second
thing is there's raw compute performance or

00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:31.180
rendering performance within the page.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.640
I guess you could count those as three areas.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.630
So on the compute -- on the pure compute side
of things, like if you were to download just

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:44.319
a JavaScript benchmark, we're limited by what
Apple provides us in that they don't allow

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:49.859
you to run your own jitted, you know, JavaScript
engine.

00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:56.759
They don't allow you to provide your own rendering
-- you know, Web rendering engine, it's just

00:46:56.759 --> 00:47:00.930
not allowed by the terms of service, and so
we have to use UI WebView, and the UI WebView

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.049
is actually more restrictive than what's in
Safari.

00:47:04.049 --> 00:47:08.340
Even though it's some of the own code, they
actually turn off some features.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:14.220
And one of the things they turn off is the
use of the JIT in their JavaScript engine,

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.829
so that slows down heavy-duty JavaScript things.

00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:24.029
The second thing it does is it affects some
of the GPU acceleration, how that interoperates.

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:27.779
So we have some limitations there, so if you
wanted to do just sort of the raw how fast

00:47:27.779 --> 00:47:33.259
is this particular page spinning in a loop
doing stuff, we aren't going to be as fast

00:47:33.259 --> 00:47:39.359
as we are on other platforms just due to limitations;
however, the good news is is that that's not

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.380
the entire story.

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:44.230
The usability, you know, in terms of how long
does it take you to get from point A to point

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:51.700
B is how much we predict what you're going
to type, that helps with sync, your usage

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.499
patterns, the Omni box, how we're able to
pre-fetch -- guess what you're able to do

00:47:57.499 --> 00:48:02.200
using our pre-rendering and some of our DNS
pre-fetching stuff.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.460
We have a lot of tricks within Chrome beyond
just the JavaScript engine and what we're

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.999
doing inside the Web rendering engine.

00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:15.579
So actually if you read some of the reviews
that are floating around out there, if you

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:21.180
see the ones that load up a benchmark and
compare them AB, you'll see that we're slower.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:25.660
If you see the ones that try to use it and
say I navigated to the following three sites

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.140
and time that, you'll see that we're actually
way faster, that some people are getting things

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.440
done twice as fast.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.109
Getting to their web pages, so if what you're
doing is surfing and navigating around, actually

00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:38.640
I think you'll find Chrome on iOS is really
fast.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.319
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Yeah, for me just the fact that
all my favorite websites all ready auto complete.

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:46.310
It just helps a ton, and for me I use a lot
of tabs.

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:53.090
I tend to open a lot of tabs in the background
when I'm reading stuff, like read it or something.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:59.009
Being able to flip through really easy, switch
through them is a huge usability improvement

00:48:59.009 --> 00:49:00.009
for me.

00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:01.009
All right.

00:49:01.009 --> 00:49:02.009
Go ahead.

00:49:02.009 --> 00:49:06.910
&gt;&gt;&gt; On a similar note, one of the things that
makes Chrome so much more fast than anything

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:12.079
else is the extensions, and in particular
for me, the Omni box extension capability

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:15.650
of making completion work.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:18.089
When are you considering bringing this to
mobile?

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:22.930
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So I think we talked a little
bit about this before, but basically, you

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.890
know, Chrome is a pretty big set of features
and the Web has a very broad set of features

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:33.990
and so we only just got, you know, Android
to -- Chrome to Android a few months ago,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:39.529
and we only just got Chrome to iOS today,
or yesterday.

00:49:39.529 --> 00:49:44.789
So we've got a little ways to go to get to
feature parity, and extension is one of those

00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:49.880
parts that we actually like to take our time
with because it has, you know, deep integration

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.039
to all of the various hooks in the browser.

00:49:52.039 --> 00:49:58.140
We also think that in mobile it's quite likely
that how you want to extend the browser is

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.160
going to be different.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.690
Also the performance needs of mobile are different.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.589
So -- so some of the changes we've been making
in the desktop has have been anticipating

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:09.009
our needs in mobile.

00:50:09.009 --> 00:50:13.130
If you look at the new stuff we've done with
event pages in extensions where basically

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:18.660
there's no longer going to be an always-running
persistent background page for every single

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.380
extension, that way we can be a little more
on demand, this is partly to reduce the resource

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.779
function of extensions, and we think will
make it more adaptable to mobile down the

00:50:26.779 --> 00:50:27.779
road.

00:50:27.779 --> 00:50:31.450
Unfortunately, you know, I don't have a good
timetable to tell you, but it is something

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.450
we're interested in.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:36.549
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right, switch over to this
side again.

00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:42.880
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm curious if there's going to be any
advancements in printer support without Google

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.200
Cloud Print.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:51.490
Right now it seems like you need a separate
machine in order to be able to print.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:55.369
Is there any way that it's going to be possible
with a Chromebook alone.

00:50:55.369 --> 00:51:01.210
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Sounds like you're asking about
printing outside of Google cloud but specifically

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.210
for Chrome OS.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:03.210
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:09.779
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: Today people can use any of their
legacy printers by using Cloud Print through

00:51:09.779 --> 00:51:12.690
an existing machine on the network.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:18.380
On my home machine I have windows XP set up,
I've got Cloud Print installed and I can get

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:25.279
to any of my legacy printers on the network
through that with pretty much every printer

00:51:25.279 --> 00:51:28.380
I'm aware of on the market today.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:33.109
They're already Cloud Print enabled, so by
simply going any new printer that you get

00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:38.950
today pretty much can just be on the network
and accessible to any Chrome OS or any other

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:40.640
device that uses Cloud Print.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.730
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:43.910
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.089
Back to this side.

00:51:46.089 --> 00:51:53.880
&gt;&gt;&gt; I found out I think next year that Google
is giving my daughter's school a bunch of

00:51:53.880 --> 00:52:00.880
Chrome OS netbooks and we live right next
to Mountain View, so I was just curious like

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.249
what's the thinking behind that, and is it
more than just a local thing?

00:52:04.249 --> 00:52:07.130
Is it like going to be in other places around
the country?

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:14.039
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: So I know for sure that we've
had a lot of -- a lot of schools around the

00:52:14.039 --> 00:52:15.039
country starting to adopt Chromebooks.

00:52:15.039 --> 00:52:18.220
Felix can probably tell you the exact numbers,
but I know that the feedback has been very

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.220
positive.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:28.250
&gt;&gt;Felix Lin: Education is one of the most
-- most aggressively verticals adopting Chromebooks.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.600
And the beauty of the Web and education is
that, you know, the Web is really a great

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.900
equalizer, right?

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:42.240
All the best content, apps, information, accessible
to students, very, very low cost, always up-to-date.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.269
Chromebooks are phenomenal platform for schools
because schools have, you know, shrinking

00:52:47.269 --> 00:52:53.470
budgets, no IT staff, and being able to take
a device that has zero maintenance, zero management,

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:58.780
always up to date, doesn't require a ton of
care and feeding, and gives people access

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:06.050
to all of the tools that they use is really
just a great formula for education.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:13.130
We're -- in addition to, you know, the hundreds
and hundreds of schools I think in 48 states,

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:20.839
there are schools that are deploying Chromebooks,
we're seeing huge initiatives at national

00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:27.151
levels where in many emerging markets countries
are looking to Chromebooks as a way to, you

00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:35.140
know, transform education and really transform
great economic transformation across the country.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:42.839
And, you know, it's really all about, you
know, the rich content that's available, all

00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:49.130
the educational material that is available,
and just the ability to get a situation where

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:56.920
instead of, you know, a 20 students to one
computer type ratio in a school, giving students

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:03.089
a one to one opportunity where every student
has a computer that they're using to enhance

00:54:03.089 --> 00:54:07.099
their learning, is truly transformational.

00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:11.390
And so, you know, from our standpoint, and,
you know, this is the great thing about working

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:17.339
with many of our hardware partners, in education
we're finding a great willingness on the part

00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:22.720
of companies to be able to foster education.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:28.390
People don't seem to have as large a profit
motive in education as they do in other verticals

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:33.931
where they need to be making, you know, an
enterprise profit, but this is just a huge

00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:37.150
opportunity for us and for -- for future students.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:41.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right, back to this side.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.609
Congratulations, by the way, on shipping Chrome
for iOS.

00:54:45.609 --> 00:54:47.749
It's a good thing.

00:54:47.749 --> 00:54:55.829
I was in a session yesterday afternoon, optimizing
your HTML for -- for a mobile device, and

00:54:55.829 --> 00:55:01.132
the presenter invited us to follow along,
give URL for slides, and said we're going

00:55:01.132 --> 00:55:05.890
to working on this interactively, so I pulled
out my iPad and downloaded Chrome for the

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:10.319
iPad, and was following right along, and then
he said, okay, now we're going to install

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:15.369
the page speed extension, so we can watch
and see what happens, and I said, great, search

00:55:15.369 --> 00:55:21.519
for page speed, right here, Chrome Web store,
and it said umm, the Chrome Web store is not

00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:23.560
supported on your OS.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:29.970
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: I tried to touch on this earlier,
but extensions are something we definitely

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:34.349
want to support down the road on mobile and
other platforms.

00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:39.809
It's just very early days and getting into
mobile is going to take us a fair amount of

00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:40.809
work.

00:55:40.809 --> 00:55:41.809
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:43.240
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Go ahead.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.210
&gt;&gt;&gt; So another Chrome on iOS question.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:51.430
I'm just wondering if it does or is going
to support URL schemes so that iOS developers

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:54.529
launch Chrome if they choose to.

00:55:54.529 --> 00:56:04.170
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Do we have anybody from the iOS
team around here that can answer that?

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:09.390
Tell you what, why don't you -- if you want
we can look that up for you and leave your

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:10.390
e-mail for us.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:11.619
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: We can put you in touch with
the right people.

00:56:11.619 --> 00:56:12.740
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.740
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.980
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Hi.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:19.319
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a question about my Chromebook.

00:56:19.319 --> 00:56:29.109
I would like to use it as a Web development
platform with my HTML JavaScript files, and

00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:33.930
I tried that yesterday and then I ran into
two problems.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:42.509
One is that I don't have a text editor for
my HTML files, and I saw one of the presentations

00:56:42.509 --> 00:56:47.119
that was using an app, I want to know which
app that is.

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:52.759
And the second problem is how to run my HTML
files from Google Drive.

00:56:52.759 --> 00:56:55.369
I only get a preview of the source code.

00:56:55.369 --> 00:56:57.670
I don't get a run.

00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.329
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So I can talk to that.

00:57:01.329 --> 00:57:06.619
So that you're probably talking about our
presentation where we had some text editors

00:57:06.619 --> 00:57:11.170
running on Chrome OS, and this is using some
of the new apps features that we've been working

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:12.190
on.

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:17.279
They're pretty early on, so they're right
now available to people developing in Canary,

00:57:17.279 --> 00:57:20.299
but we hope to have them more broadly available
later this year.

00:57:20.299 --> 00:57:25.960
If you're a developer, want to ride the ragged
edge, you know, you can come check out -- we've

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.339
got some sample code.

00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:33.599
I think that particular little micro editor
is checked into GitHub, and our Google Chrome

00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:39.440
repo, but a warning is that it's early, it's
very simple.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.170
It actually isn't as cool as it looked.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:47.559
We -- we -- we actually hit over all the rough
spots.

00:57:47.559 --> 00:57:51.819
But there are -- I'll tell you that just one
of the cool, fun things about the new apps

00:57:51.819 --> 00:57:55.440
stuff we've been doing, is just once you add
these new capabilities of seeing what people

00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.161
want to build with them, and within Chrome
team, one of the first things people wanted

00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:04.079
to build actually was code editors, and in
fact we have like three of them already that

00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:10.390
people are just doing different things with,
and so we actually expect there to be a plethora

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.390
of code editors.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.279
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: I don't know if you mentioned
it already or not, there's definitely IDEs

00:58:14.279 --> 00:58:15.730
available in the Chrome Web store.

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:19.430
A bunch of them are pretty highly ranked.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:27.859
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: The number of cloud ID's emerging
and you can use them, and as the Chrome, we

00:58:27.859 --> 00:58:32.930
are providing them with the extension APIs
so they could plug into the instrumentation

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:42.519
and get the dev tools integrated into the
cloud tools, so you have both complete ID

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:46.579
with the remote persistence and the debugging
capabilities on the Chrome OS.

00:58:46.579 --> 00:58:47.859
But it's all coming.

00:58:47.859 --> 00:58:48.859
We're working on that.

00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:52.419
We're working with base teams on these capabilities.

00:58:52.419 --> 00:58:54.390
&gt;&gt;&gt; And then how do I run my HTML file?

00:58:54.390 --> 00:59:00.619
When I clicked on the file from Google Drive,
I just got a preview.

00:59:00.619 --> 00:59:06.910
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So you have to ask the Drive team,
so unfortunately none of us are from there,

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:11.109
so I don't know if they have any plans to
allow direct hosting of HTML straight from

00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:12.109
Drive.

00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:17.440
I assume that's what you mean for public consumption,
but if you just want to do local development,

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.590
it should be possible to do -- to read the
files locally and render them, you know, in

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:23.590
Chrome.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:24.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: (inaudible)
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Yeah, we can check with the drive

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.590
team.

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:28.239
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: Yeah, we can check with the
Drive team.

00:59:28.239 --> 00:59:31.309
It looks like we pretty much ran out of time.

00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:32.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ellison-Taylor: Hang on.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:37.119
I forgot one other Easter Egg, you probably
already know, there's another Easter Egg in

00:59:37.119 --> 00:59:43.779
the video, the History of Chrome, so you might
want to study that video and -- and there's

00:59:43.779 --> 00:59:47.489
something pretty cool in there so --
&gt;&gt;Jeff Chang: All right.

00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:48.489
Perfect timing.

00:59:48.489 --> 00:59:49.489
Yeah.

00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:50.489
So thank you for coming.

00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:53.789
We enjoy doing this every year as long as
you guys come, and so hopefully see you next

00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:59.369
year, otherwise if you just stay in this room,
there's a bunch of Chrome sessions after us,

00:59:59.369 --> 01:00:04.000
looks like high performance HTML5, history
and future of Google Web tool kit, writing

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.480
secure Web Apps, and Chrome extensions and
the Google Cloud Print section, so please

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.530
enjoy the rest of conference, and thank you.

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:10.650
