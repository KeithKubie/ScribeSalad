00:00:01.553 --> 00:00:05.220
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.950
- Welcome to A Conversation
With History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.040
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.910
Our guest today is Dudley Herschbach

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
who is the Frank B. Baird,
Jr. Professor of Science

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.410
at Harvard University and
co-recipient of the Nobel Prize

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.610
in chemistry for 1986.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.020
He is the 2005 Hitchcock Professor

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.620
on the Berkeley campus.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.040
Professor Herschbach, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.873
- Very glad to be here.

00:00:56.873 --> 00:00:59.560
- Welcome back to Berkeley I should say.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.160
Where were you born and raised?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.320
- San Jose, a third
generation native of San Jose.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260
- Uh-huh, California, and looking back

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.070
how do you think your parents

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.993
shaped your thinking about the world.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.840
- Well, of course, they had a huge impact.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.540
In particular I well remember

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.630
since I was the first of our family

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.030
to go to college, in fact we knew no one

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.130
who had gone to college,
that they were dubious,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.510
they were wary, they
warned me that they'd heard

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.470
there are a lot of egghead professors

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.470
who had funny ideas and
certainly impractical ideas.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.470
It wasn't clear that there'd
be anything worthwhile

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
that I would learn there, but was a danger

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.590
I might be too arrogant afterwards,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.320
should work with my hands

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.250
and I was sort of on my guard then

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.370
when I arrived at Stanford,
where I was lucky enough

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.140
to go as an undergraduate.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.130
- And your parents had a farm

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.130
and so your early life was
a farming life in San Jose?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.063
- Well, near San Jose--

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:08.240
- [Harry] Near San Jose, okay.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.360
- Out toward Campbell, Saratoga area.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.480
I went to a grammar school with 80 kids

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.700
and four rooms, two grades per room,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490
graduating class of 11,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.927
gives you an idea what it was like then

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:24.900
and the high school was about 250 people,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.153
that was kids in Campbell.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.420
But yeah, we had several acres.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.510
We had potatoes, we had cows

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.240
that I milked everyday for some years.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.240
In the summer I picked prunes
and cut cots, later walnuts.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.280
I remember how the kids who
did that in the late season

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.230
picking walnuts, your hands
would be stained yellow

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.967
and it wouldn't go away for a few weeks

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:56.300
and there was sort of a
stigma attached to that.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.333
For me didn't bother me, it
was kind of badge of honesty.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.710
- And looking back, what did you learn

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.710
from that farming life that
affected you later in life?

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.273
Did it make you a better
scientist or what?

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.860
- It might have because I
worked a lot with my dad

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
who was a builder, he
built houses one at a time.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.160
He drew the plans, he
studied to be an architect

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.920
in Oakland school, not a college,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.210
but a special school of course.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.510
He came out in the
depths of the depression

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.900
just when I was born, 1932,
no future for architects,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.790
so he went into building,
which he knew something about

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.903
'cause his dad had been a builder.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.150
But his company failed in the depression,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.800
had to take second mortgages
and too many of them failed,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.010
so then after that he just
built houses one at a time

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.950
and his three sons would work with him

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.330
and I heard my dad talking a lot about

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.860
this is the way a good
mechanic would do it,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.960
by that he meant a proud craftsman

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.910
who wasn't gonna cut any corners,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.300
but put extra bracing even
where it wouldn't be seen

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.800
and all the rest, so that certainly

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.700
I think was a powerful influence.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.250
In fact, my dad had a favorite saying

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.250
that been the motto of my research group:

00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:31.740
"The difficult we do immediately,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.280
the impossible takes a little longer."

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.270
I think the second phrase
appealed a lot to a kid

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.073
as kind of a heroic thing.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.720
My mother had nothing beyond
high school education,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.860
but she was very interested in culture

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.980
and music and reading and all,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.880
had a great influence on all her kids.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.230
- Did you have any teachers
say as a high school student

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.330
that pointed you in the
direction of science

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.520
and then of course at Stanford
you must have had many

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.490
who influenced you to turn to science?

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.580
- That's right, I had a high
school chemistry teacher,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.693
John Miseka, in fact a
master's degree from Berkeley,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.610
it was terrific, wonderful teacher,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.070
and he absolutely knew his stuff.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.370
When I took freshman
chemistry later at Stanford

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.520
I discovered how good Miseka's
high school course was

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.020
and other classes at this
Campbell High School then.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.360
I learned a lot

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.210
even though the teachers weren't
particularly well prepared.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.613
For instance, the very first
class I had was in algebra.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.060
The instructor walks in

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.123
and he says I don't
know much about algebra,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.163
but I know one thing,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.720
I've just come from
serving in artillery corps

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.500
in Second World War

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.760
and if we calculated
something the right way

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.680
but got the wrong answer,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.550
shelled our own troops, we got no credit,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.057
so you'll get no credit.

00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:06.890
(laughing)

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.600
You have the right method,
but the wrong answer.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.840
Well, within a few weeks there
are several kids in the class

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.930
who had a better grip
on algebra than he did,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.230
but that was no sweat for him.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.260
He regarded his job as
a former military man

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.420
as to make sure that the
privates and corporals

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.960
do things up to snuff, so
he got us to explain to him

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.010
and our classmates what we understood

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.620
or thought we understood
what was going on,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.180
so it was really very
effective the same way

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.283
all the way through.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.960
So we had a special experience

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.720
because so many of our teachers

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.970
had come from Second World War

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.850
and without any preaching us
or any overt discussion of it

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.040
really they were conveying something

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.040
about the seriousness of
learning what you could

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.880
and taking advantage of it.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.710
- And then what about Stanford,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.573
any teachers stand out there?

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.170
- The very first day I met
my first professor ever

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.330
and he was Harold Johnston,
now retired from Berkeley

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.020
where he later became a very,
very distinguished scientist,

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.760
but this first day he was a
very shy assistant professor.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.960
But he told us immediately,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.310
this little group of six advisees

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.610
that gathered with him the
day before classes began,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.280
something that opened my eyes immediately,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.320
he said the university exists to preserve,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.823
transmit, and create knowledge.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.753
Well, I knew they had
libraries and all that,

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:53.720
I knew the transmission was
as in high school teaching,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.683
I no idea about research,

00:07:56.683 --> 00:08:00.440
so I think that I probably
heard of it first that day

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.490
and then he told us a little
about his own research

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.480
which was in the field
called chemical kinetics,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.900
trying to unravel what governs

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.510
how rapidly chemical reactions occur.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.640
Usually they're multi-step processes

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.550
and it's very tricky to figure out

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.513
what may really be going on

00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:21.053
with the tools that were available then,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.220
but it got me very
interested in a basic field

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.150
and later that was a key
part of my own research.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.680
- Let's talk a little about doing science

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.488
before we get into the
work that you have done

00:08:39.488 --> 00:08:43.070
and I'm hoping that you
can help us understand

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.680
what you see as the temperament,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.283
the character required
to to do scientific work.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.490
- I think it helps a
lot if you are A: Naive

00:08:56.346 --> 00:09:01.346
and B: Have a high threshold
for frustration and confusion.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.320
I like to tell my students
that the neophyte student

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.160
and the veteran researcher
are very much alike

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.630
in one important respect,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.760
namely both are confused most of the time.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.530
The difference is the neophyte
is usually often upset

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.330
about being confused, especially
if they're a bright student

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.770
gone through high school and
all and been patted on the head

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.030
all the time for breezing
through courses what not

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.640
and they find it's a
different thing in college,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.823
especially when they start some research.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.310
They naturally think oh,
there must be something wrong

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.163
with me or maybe the professor,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.760
whereas the veteran
researcher is very happy

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.960
when they're confused because he realizes

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.510
unless you're confused, if
it's perfectly clear already

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.560
then you're not gonna learn anything new.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.060
Furthermore, the researcher
knows that in science

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.030
you have a very special advantage

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.500
over essentially all
other human enterprises.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.750
I like to emphasize this
because I think most people

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.850
don't really recognize it,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.010
namely what you're trying
to find out in science,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.280
call it truths or understanding,
waits patiently for you.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.990
It doesn't change, contrast
that with a chess game.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.910
You might make a great move, but whoops,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.680
your opponent makes a better one,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.617
so in business, politics,
sports, sadly war,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.010
people often make a very
well-conceived sensible move

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.230
but whoops, it's a little
late or a little early

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.180
and turns out to be a fiasco or disaster

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.960
instead of a triumph.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.001
In science you can get it
wrong over and over again.

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:55.400
It doesn't matter if
you find the right way,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.540
the right perspective an idea eventually,

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.970
so I tell my students
that to be a scientist

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.361
is something like being a musician.

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:07.820
A musician really needs to love music,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.000
devote a lot of effort into
mastering their instrument,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
but in science you can play
99.9 % of the notes wrong,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.713
get one right and be justly applauded.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.120
- So it sounds like you're saying

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.130
that there is a patience here
that if one doesn't have it

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.360
in the beginning, one
develops it over time

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.120
because as you say nature is waiting

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.940
and it's just, to use
the language you used

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.530
in yesterday's lecture, it's
you just have to find the way

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.230
to get access to the right conversation

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.930
to hear what's going on.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.830
- Yeah, I often add after
saying the kind of thing

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.320
I just said to you,
that you should realize

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.090
you probably will play
99.9% of the notes wrong,

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.090
so you need this immunity to frustration

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.663
that I mentioned already.

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:11.350
And you need to understand
that you do have

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:16.350
this advantage in science that
it's waiting there for you.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.660
The Czech poet who wrote
a poem, not about science,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.300
but it could apply to science,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.300
he said the poet really
doesn't write the poem,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.600
it's already there, it's
been there a long, long time,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.540
he merely finds it.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.620
(laughing)

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.210
- Now what about courage?

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.210
And I raise courage because
for truly outstanding insights

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.023
you really have to go out there
on a limb sometimes right?

00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:59.155
So does your naivete compel
you to or help you do that?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.600
And therefore you're not as
courageous as you look or what?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.910
- Yes, I was going to
refer back to my remark

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.740
of how it helps to be naive at the start

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.120
because in a fundamental sense

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.240
it's naive to do science at all,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.390
to think that you can really figure out

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.310
something fundamental
about how nature works,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.840
but the motivation is very strong.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.650
It grows from the sense of
wonder at finding ourselves

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.233
in this incredible universe.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:37.090
So if you're deeply moved
by that it keeps you going

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.910
and I think it helps also to have a sense

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.990
especially fostered by
interacting with people

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.990
who you admire very much for
what they've done in science

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.133
and very often for their human qualities,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.830
it helps very much that these
young mentors and colleagues

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:03.270
because then you know you're
part of this whole enterprise

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.890
and you're part may turn out
just to be something small,

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.040
but nonetheless it adds to whole effort

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.030
so this fellowship of striving

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.760
is a very strong reinforcement.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.170
- And this is very much a cosmopolitan,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:24.580
a global fellowship in the sciences.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.180
- Science is very much
a social enterprise.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.180
Often competition among
scientists is played up,

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.620
but that's very misleading
because science is intrinsically

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.000
very cooperative, very
democratic in that ideas

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.620
that turn out to have
merit are really found out

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.480
and ideas that aren't are too eventually

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.150
and it doesn't matter
where they come from.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.480
I mean this is this centennial
of the miraculous year

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.680
of 1905 where this unknown
patent clerk sent in these papers

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.499
that changed perspective
of physics in ways

00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:09.154
that are still echoing a century later--

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:11.427
- You're referring to Einstein, yeah.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:16.427
- But he was publishing
papers without a PhD

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.420
all this from unknown
place, so it may not be

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.420
quite as easy sometimes
today with reviewing gauntlet

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.420
that authors often have to run
and the need to find funding

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.210
often if it's a specially
experimental project

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.330
that needs special
apparatus and all the rest,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.637
so in the real world
there's kind of mundane

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.850
but difficult obstacles to deal with.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.620
So that's why you need this
kind of evangelical fervor

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.620
to pursue an idea, naive
evangelical fervor if you like,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.470
pursue an idea that may not be
already recognized by those.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.950
You need some mavericks

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.000
and you have to have a
system of support in science

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.010
and a scientific community
that permits some mavericks

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.010
to roam around and they may
not solve some major problem,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.630
but they may give a new
perspective which allows people

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.710
to get around, recognize and
get around some roadblocks

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.040
that have been in the way of the path

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.463
that consensus had seemed to endorse.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.350
- Talk a little about
this creative movement.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.070
We'll talk about your work in a minute,

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.110
but what is it about, I'm curious

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.420
because the way you were
talking about discovery

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.050
and the creative moment
where just in general terms

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.500
where you see something,
it sounded almost like

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.523
a religious experience, but it's not.

00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:52.090
- No, no.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.530
- Or is it?

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.033
- It has some kinship.

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:59.530
I think of our science
as really a kin to art

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.040
and other humanistic activities

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.550
because I have my students
write poems for example.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.140
I tell them that writing a poem

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.430
is more like doing real science,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.250
frontier science, than the
usual textbook examples,

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.780
which tell you just the
information you need

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.730
in a context that's carefully
set up so it's pretty clear

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.330
you're supposed to try to get the answer

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.520
in a certain way and so on.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.400
Well, in the real world
is nothing like that.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.120
Nobody knows the right answer
if you're doing research,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.770
true research domain that's wide open,

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.700
nobody knows the right questions even

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.960
or necessarily the right approach.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.840
So, I like to say science
is necessarily child's play.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.230
Children are fantastic learners,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.900
they learn with very little help

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.510
from adults in their native language.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.050
Of course there's reason to think

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.200
there's some inbuilt propensity to this,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.000
but even so it's quite
astonishing how quickly young kids

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.020
do it and one advantage
they have over adults

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.740
is they're not worried whether
they're getting it right.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.200
They just play and they
sort of experiment.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.470
I think they hear these
huge people make sounds

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.050
and see that they react to them

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.170
so they want to emulate
that and that's what happens

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.160
and that's something like what you do

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.140
in scientific research.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.610
You you have to play in a
way and you have to guess

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.340
and you're often not, you
find your guess doesn't lead

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.340
to a sensible result so
you try something else.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.980
That's the kind of thing it is.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.070
People often think oh, well a scientist

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.360
has all these pens in the
pocket and are well organized

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.570
and know just what they're doing.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.070
No, no, not at the frontier,
so the corresponds to the poem

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.660
is very close in that the
poem is a personal thing,

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.590
there's no question whether
it's right or wrong,

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.080
it's whether it illuminates
in an interesting way,

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.640
even some commonplace situation,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.740
so it opens your eyes
to new possibilities.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.090
That's exactly what we cherish in art

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.870
if we experience the
performance or painting

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.440
or sculpture that sort of makes us see

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.120
some aspect of the world or
human experience differently

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.800
ever after, it's the same
criteria that you judge

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.487
a scientific contribution by
if it changes the way you think

00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:28.013
and what you do next.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.370
- In your own work as
you emphasized yesterday

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.490
in your lecture, you were in a way

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.370
standing on the shoulders of
scientists who came before you

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.840
so in a way, let's talk now
a little about your work

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.840
and help us understand
how you know what you did

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.300
in layman's terms to merit a Nobel Prize

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.220
and how it actually reflected a lot

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.810
of what you've just described

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:04.810
namely working in a community,
but at the same time

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.680
being as you say somewhere
on the lunatic fringe

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.880
of a physical, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.133
Talk a little about that.

00:20:15.085 --> 00:20:18.400
- Yeah, well, I think its
characteristic in fact

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.540
of many, many episodes
or adventures in science

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.817
that I've witnessed in my
time and read about in history

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:29.950
because I love history and
it's certainly generally true

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.500
that as I mentioned before,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.400
science is intrinsically cooperative.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.440
Every scientist knows how much they owe

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.200
to their predecessors and
even to their contemporaries

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.240
even if nominally they
might look to be competitors

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.730
or whatever since you have
to announce to the world

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.220
whatever you find in science,
your nominal competitor

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.440
may actually help you more
than they help themselves

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.440
because what they find and
report may from your perspective

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.330
advance your development, the
problem more than their own.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.363
Anyway, what happened in my case was,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.960
as I mentioned earlier,
Harold Johnston, my mentor,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.900
was doing a classic kind of research

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.770
on how fast chemical reactions go,

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.490
but that's all in the bulk,
that's all people could do then

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.410
and people just thought
it was not feasible at all

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.990
to carry out experiments
where you could study things

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.580
at the level, individual
collisions, if that detail

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.430
one would love to have
about what actually happens

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.620
in these collisions.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.240
How much energy goes into
separation of products

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.080
or vibration of the new bonds
or tumbling rotational motion

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.660
and fundamentally then from
understanding the forces

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.390
that govern such things,
how the electronic structure

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.990
reactions and products determine
what's going to happen.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.283
It's the most fundamental
thing in chemistry,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.573
so it's difficult to get at
that in the conventional way

00:22:07.573 --> 00:22:10.620
because as I always like to say

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.360
suppose you could only study

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.090
human psychology by flying
a blimp over a stadium

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.043
listening to the murmuring
and shouts of the crowd.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.410
The chemist in more or less that condition

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.580
by having to work with
zillions of molecules

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.060
in the test tubes and on most
of what you'd like to know

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.063
in averaged down.

00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:33.777
And the method we developed
was pretty obvious and naive.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.746
Oh well, if you have a high vacuum,

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:41.910
so you pumped out molecules
that otherwise would be there

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.140
you can form two streams very
dilute streams of molecules

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.950
which are spaced far enough apart

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.040
that they don't interact with
each other in either stream

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.980
and they'll cross, a few
of them will collide.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.170
If you have enough
sensitivity you can detect

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.890
the newly formed products as
they fly through the vacuum

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.283
to your detector, so
single collision chemistry.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.350
And it turned out that
initially a simple class,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.780
a special class of reactions
that people thought

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.760
was non representative and involving,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.080
so called alkali reaction like a sodium

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.080
was reagents that included halogens

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.420
because sodium is willing
to give up an electron

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.970
to halogen containing marloxes very easily

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.970
so it's a rather facile,
more rapid reaction than most

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.450
so you could hope to get a bigger yield

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.580
and therefore even under
these severe conditions.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.240
So that's dilute beams interacting,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.600
maybe you could detect something.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.740
And as I mentioned yesterday,
in our first experiments

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.920
our yield was equivalent to
monolai or molecules a month.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.920
This is pretty pruny by chemical terms,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.450
but because these properties,
these special molecules,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.030
we could detect at that level

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.460
with not terribly elaborate apparatus.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.040
And we knew we could do that
by virtue of previous work

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.340
of other people that didn't
quite get to the point

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.930
of doing this, so this is what happens

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.433
in every new generation.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.670
I tell students sometimes you
may think from the textbooks

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:25.180
and from all you read and so on,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.240
that gee, previous scientists had it easy,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.420
they just get all these lovely results,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.560
what's left for you to do?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.410
And what you may not recognize

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.870
is that you have a legacy of new tools,

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.110
concepts as well as instruments and all

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.000
that open up new eyes
literally that you can use

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.900
to see things your predecessors could not

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.360
and to think of doing
probes nobody thinks of

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.360
until sort of the technical
feasibility of actually doing it

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.520
is somewhere on the horizon at least.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.720
If it's too far over the horizon

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.400
people don't even imagine it,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.250
so that's why early days people
said that's lunatic fringe

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.810
to think you can study
chemical reactions that way

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.350
and basically what we did was just show

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.920
that that's not the case.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.920
And when it came to going into
a broader range of reactions

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.340
that was technically a lot harder

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.400
and people really thought
that was out of question,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.210
but by then we developed
a lot of experience

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:35.080
with the easier ones and
especially with the genius

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.230
of Joo Hwan Lee as a
superb experimentalist,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.450
we were able to go on and
do it and many other people

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.100
soon found they could do, sort
of like the four minute mile,

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.130
so long people thought you couldn't do it,

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.270
once it was done, very soon
other people were doing it too.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.570
- So and as you recounted yesterday

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.880
that there's experimentation,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.430
there's tinkering, there's
sort of building apparatus

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.090
that will make this possible.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.610
But you're also looking back in time

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.500
because this came from
a line of experiments

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.020
done by a physicist I guess named Stern--

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.600
- He was a chemist by training--

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.790
- Oh chemist, okay--

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.150
- Yes, remember he got
his PhD in chemistry

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.273
for dissolving CO2 in various solids,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.050
beginning you would hardly imagine

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.980
led ultimately to the work he did.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.670
- And then, but then moving ahead

00:26:29.272 --> 00:26:31.793
because there are analogies what you did,

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.610
but let me ask this question

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.140
and remember I'm not a scientist,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.730
there are analogies with what you did

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.050
to what Townes had done in physics

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.800
to discover the labor in terms of the way

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.600
the apparatus was set
up to make discoveries.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.020
- They had a kinship.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.040
I mean if you think of it,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.873
it's a really an evolutionary thing.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.270
What Otto Stern did was ancestor
both to Townes' discovery

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:05.110
of the MASER and then the
LASER and to the work we did

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.572
and to much other work, so
all these kind of evolved.

00:27:09.572 --> 00:27:12.130
what happens is things get combined

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.440
and out of the combination
new things grow,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.330
that's kind of biology we're
talking about now right?

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.750
so this is the biology if you like

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.940
of intellectual development
of what is physical science.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.940
I mean the ideas are terribly important

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.120
and they propagate and
combine and spawn progeny.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.900
That's really what happens.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.380
- And what is the implications
for a general audience

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.180
of the work that you did?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.130
I mean I gather it it can help us

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.937
in understanding global
warming, is that a fair--

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.440
- Yes, there are lots of
practical applications,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.040
so many in fact that it's
a little embarrassing

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.650
if you start listing them
because it sounds that

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.700
oh, you're taking credit
for everything under the sun

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.190
and the reason is simply
that it's so basic.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.930
This is the way I try to explain it,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.090
I say nature speaks to us in many tongues

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:13.110
and they're all alien,
alien not foreign, alien.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.920
And what the research
scientist in the basic sense

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.030
is trying to do is decipher
one of nature's dialects

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.190
in some area, the vocabulary,
some of the grammar

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.550
to the extent you succeed, you
discover she's left messages

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.900
all the places we couldn't read before.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.070
So in that sense you see basic research

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:37.070
is just trying to understand
is the most practical possible

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.200
because enables you to read the messages.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.200
There plenty of historical
sawdust we can trace

00:28:45.277 --> 00:28:50.277
where huge effort in human
and financial resources

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.350
were devoted with no result

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.880
and later you see the
reason why you couldn't read

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.940
the messages that were there all the time

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.163
because you didn't have the basic science

00:29:01.163 --> 00:29:03.923
that made it possible to go ahead.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.870
Often when the basic
science is there, zingo.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.930
Take the development of the atom bomb.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:15.490
That was very short time
after the discovery of fission

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.520
which was motivated
entirely by basic science,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.203
nobody was looking for that.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.160
Another example is often cited
is the discovery of X-rays.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.790
If you tried to ask what
could you do for surgery

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.403
no one would have gone in a direction

00:29:35.403 --> 00:29:40.403
that would have led to
discover X-rays, on and on.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.890
The whole business of nanochemistry

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.150
you hear about so much work
and fascinating new materials,

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.050
all that came from playing
around with molecular beams

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.640
and discovering that gee, you
got a big peek at Carbon 60

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.070
when you expanded carbon vapor

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.800
through one of those supersonic nozzles

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.680
I mentioned yesterday.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.410
What could that be?

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.770
And they played around and said gee,

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.510
it must have a structure
something like a soccer ball

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.600
that touched it all off, so you don't know

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.600
what's going to grow
from it, but you do know

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.830
that with basic research since
you're learning something

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.670
in nature's language,

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.530
there's really a whole literature there

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.850
that becomes accessible to you.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.950
So that's the nature of the work we did

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.360
and it turns out even though we've studied

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.920
only a certain range of
reactions because we could do it

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.380
in this fundamental level
of single collisions

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.260
and therefore figure out what it meant

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.980
in terms of how the
electrons cover what happens,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.000
which you'll be talking about today,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.250
it's transferable to a
huge range of reactions.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.180
I don't know, DNA anywhere,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.130
if you have a certain bonding situation,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.280
if you say oh yeah,
that's what's gonna happen

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.330
when they react, see what I mean?

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.570
So it turns out relevant to practically,

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:03.494
well, really all of
chemistry, that's the answer.

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.880
- You touch on a very interesting problem

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.613
because society and government
seem increasingly unable

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.730
to understand this connection
between basic research

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.290
and all the goodies that come out of it

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:25.203
whether for the economy,
for industry, and so on.

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.040
How do we get around that problem?

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.520
I know that one way that you like to do

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.710
is actually talk about
the history of science,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.173
talk a little about that.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.770
- Well, what comes to mind is

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.380
I've several times in
recent years been involved

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.800
in looking for a new director

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.150
for this nonprofit organization

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.620
or president for this society
and you read the books

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.973
about how to interview candidates,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.980
what they tell you is you
ask questions that find out

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:03.100
what is relevant in their past performance

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.620
to the qualities you think
this person should have.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.591
Don't ask them can you do this or that,

00:32:10.591 --> 00:32:13.313
what you want them to
do, but ask questions

00:32:13.313 --> 00:32:16.960
that find out whether they've
done something already

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.210
that illustrates their capacity

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.113
and their sort of instincts and so on.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.260
Well, that's what we
do in science isn't it?

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.260
I mean we have a curiosity to understand

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.410
something fundamental that has emerged

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.410
probably out of a lot of other work,

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:43.410
they sort of grows and you know
I love this quote of Feynman

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.260
who said "science is
not about what we know,

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.810
it's about what we don't know."

00:32:48.692 --> 00:32:51.470
And so really good science
is opening up your eyes

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.440
to more things you don't know,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.040
so it defines important questions

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:01.040
to focus on and when you
address those of course

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.350
you ask what, that way you know already

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.890
can we bring to the surface
of this new challenge?

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.490
And usually it involves
putting things together

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.440
in a new combination, a different way

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.553
than people had in mind before.

00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:22.510
- Now in one interview that I heard

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.950
that you had given you talked a lot about

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.150
Ben Franklin and what struck me

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.660
as I listened to your
account of his success

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.290
as a public figure and as a scientist

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.070
that we're not as successful these days

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:42.070
in identifying these achievements
of particular scientists

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.600
to essentially build a
legitimacy for science.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.800
In that account of Franklin

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.120
I thought that that's what you were making

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.830
a very interesting insight about

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.360
namely that here was a
guy who had a public role,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.350
was actually doing very basic science

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.380
and when we look back at him

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.710
we don't realize that
in a funny kind of way

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.990
we remember him as one
of the founding fathers.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.960
- Yeah, it's very interesting.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.930
He was a very curious man
about all kinds of things,

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.810
Self-educated, two years of school only.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.810
He retired at age 42,
42, halfway through life

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.440
in order to concentrate
completely on these experiments

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.120
for electricity that had obsessed him,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.830
as is the way he described it.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.130
Although he's very practical
minded guy as the image,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.090
the icon says, that's quite
true, but he had no idea

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.530
that it would lead to anything practical.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.110
In fact, there's a
famous letter to a friend

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.920
in which he confesses
that he can see no future

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.350
for any value of practical
value of electricity

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.083
except to keep a vain man humble.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.500
Because he was trying to figure out,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.823
you have to realize up to
then electricity was a toy.

00:35:04.974 --> 00:35:08.829
You rubbed glass with
fur, you got some sparks.

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:12.130
What touched it off was the discovery

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.930
of the so called light jar

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.220
we could store some electricity

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.840
and then people started
making electrical generators

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.470
that were really a way of
rubbing fur against glass

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.640
and generating more sparks,
so with that equipment

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.680
you could start exploring, and
he did this beautiful series

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.290
of experiments that
clarified what it was like.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.650
Then he recognized gee,
lightning must be electrical.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.720
Now at that time lightning was
thought to be supernatural,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.400
so that had enormous impact
and it had the practical result

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.910
of lightning rods, which is
no minor thing in those days.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.060
Well, that made his reputation enormous.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.853
He was called a Newton of electricity.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.610
In a way it was more shocking than Newton

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.610
if you don't mind a pun,
because people were familiar

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.000
with gravity and Kepler's
analysis of planetary motions

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.710
and all that before
Newton's fantastic theory

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.033
of what all happens.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.720
Franklin didn't provide
mathematical theory,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.280
that had to wait for Maxwell's equations

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.390
the next century and all, but
he had provided this insight

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.690
and all and it opens eyes so much

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.730
that he was recognized as
a very great scientist.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.730
It had so much to do with why
he was successful in France

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.600
and getting the French to
donate the money and the troops

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.360
and made it possible for
this ragtag 13 colonies

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.100
to defeat the most
powerful military nation

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.850
the world had ever
known up till that time.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.850
So respect for the nation's
scientific capabilities

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.770
especially when you are
the leading debtor nation

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.100
in the world as the
colonies certainly were then

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.730
and we're now in that situation ourselves.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.487
- Except now we don't
recognize the science.

00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:11.850
- You don't recognize the lesson,

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:16.340
well, we should recognize
since so many young people

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.120
from the rest of the world
come here to study science

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.090
in our universities that
the rest of the world

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.930
does admire our science,
but also the science

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.090
is not something that you can plant

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.140
and preserve just one place.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.750
With the right encouragement
it takes root everywhere.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.690
Stem cells are a good example.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.470
If for political reasons we are hampered

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.160
as we are right now are,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.630
or even prevented from pursuing
research in stem cells,

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.680
it's gonna go on, it's going
on brilliantly in South Korea

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.650
right now, they're the world's leader

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.800
in doing the most interesting research,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.723
developing new ways to get stem cells.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.040
- Somebody who thinks a lot about history

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.610
about the history of science
and science and history,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:13.597
what is your analysis of
the sort of difficult period

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.750
we're going through in the dialogue

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.323
between science and society?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.660
Is there a failure here?

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.510
Is it the politicians
manipulating the discourse

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:34.510
to get votes, is it religious
constituents who are concerned

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.610
about seeing the world in a different way,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.400
or has science itself failed in some way

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.303
to help legitimate
itself in this dialogue?

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.970
- Well, I think the
fundamental problem is that we,

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:55.070
I mean everybody, scientists,
all the people you've named,

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.880
have allowed science to be perceived

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.230
as not part of our general culture,

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.600
but something that's just
separate for this subspecies

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.750
of geeks or nerds or whatever,
and if it would be recognized

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.773
that that is not actually so,

00:39:10.773 --> 00:39:15.773
that science is a shared human
adventure, our whole species.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.950
I could talk a lot about that,
but we need to break down

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.750
this notion of science is something

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.070
just for these very special people

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.130
and we hope we get some
benefits if we allow them

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.432
to play around in something
we don't understand

00:39:34.432 --> 00:39:36.090
and so forth.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.920
That's not in the long run
sustainable or healthy situation

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.920
for society, so what I think
is crucial is that we find ways

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.240
to integrate science in our
whole educational enterprise.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.590
For example, the founding
fathers in the age of reason,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:59.590
that's when our country
placed great value on science,

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.010
wonderful statements by
John Adams and so on,

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.380
not only Ben Franklin.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.260
We've already seen how important
his scientific stature was.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.160
The fact that our nation exists at all,

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.460
but Jefferson, he had read Principia,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.530
the Principia of Newton
in the original Latin

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:21.180
and we have correspondence
between physicists of the day

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.930
who knew Jefferson was
very well read in Newton,

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.070
who would send what we'd call
a preprint to ask his opinion

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.693
because so often they were
referring to something

00:40:30.693 --> 00:40:33.700
that Principia was a foundation
of so much development

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.600
at that time of ideas in
science, and we have letters

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.890
where Jefferson wrote back and said

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.660
well, you don't have this just right,

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.200
this is what Newton really was saying.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.700
Imagine!

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.020
Okay?

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.180
And here's another story about Jefferson,

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.820
when he went to France
as successor to Franklin

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.390
as our ambassador there, he was
appalled by the French plows

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.180
which were so crude.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.600
You know, his whole political philosophy

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.041
was based in the idea of free farmers

00:41:05.041 --> 00:41:06.890
and a nation free farmers and all that,

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.120
so he sent himself, Jefferson did,

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.770
the problem of improving the plow,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.601
particularly what's called a moldboard,

00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:16.190
the thing that peels the soil back,

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.650
you know, has a very beautiful
shape, that's Jefferson!

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:23.230
He recognized that was a calculus
problem, he knew calculus,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.370
he solved it, and then
he not only did that

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.920
he figured out how to
instruct the machinist

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.260
to approximate the calculated
solution that he got.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.230
For a hundred years that
was the standard plow,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.580
French gave him a gold medal.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.850
He was however, philosophically opposed

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:43.530
to patenting anything, so
he didn't, and as you know

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.580
he died a pauper for other reasons.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.680
Anyway, these stories ought to be part

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.140
of our whole education.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.070
It's shared stories that make a society,

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.300
but we have blinders on.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.290
When you study history
you don't talk about

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:04.010
the importance of Franklin's
stature as a scientist

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:09.010
in history, you don't talk
about Jefferson and his plow.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.430
When you do calculus for that matter,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.290
you don't have kids solve the plow problem

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.740
that Jefferson saw.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.980
There's lots of ways we
can knit together science

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.130
and other courses.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.580
Until a lot of science is
integrated into other courses

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.660
we won't begin to break down this notion

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.320
that it's something totally separate

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.550
instead of something that's pervasive

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.530
that naturally shows up all over.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.280
I mean for example, if you
ever come across in history

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.070
how it was that the
Greeks beat the Persians

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.820
and the famous battleships,

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:49.820
it was because the Greeks
had sliding seats in rowing

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.610
which made them much more efficient

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:53.973
and much more maneuverable.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:59.610
That was a scientific and
technological improvement.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.830
Over and over you have
this through history,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:06.840
but because history in our mind
is something about generals

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.200
and politicians, they ignore the things

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.200
that make really the much more
fundamental changes often.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.510
Well, we can do better and we
have to do it I think in a way

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.640
that gets teachers and faculty together

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.310
to share these mini cultures

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.360
and find that they can hybridize

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.000
produce something new,
again a biological metaphor.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.590
- It sounds like you're
saying that in a way

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:36.400
that the short term problem may
be press coverage of science

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.240
and of scientific discovery,
but the real basic issue here

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.880
the fundamental issue lies in the way

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.880
we educate future generations
so that they know science

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:55.610
but know how science fits into women kind

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.432
and mankind's story,
that's what you're saying?

00:43:58.432 --> 00:43:59.783
- Yeah, yeah.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.780
- And what do you see going
on in science education?

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.724
Are we meeting that
challenge that you're posing?

00:44:10.724 --> 00:44:15.450
Is the curriculum at places
like Harvard and Berkeley

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:19.030
reflecting that need to integrate science

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.830
with the humane disciplines?

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.040
- I'm afraid I can't say
yes much as I would like to.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.160
The compartmentalization
is a very powerful force

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.283
in large institutions as you know.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.770
And there are a few people I know of,

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.830
the proverbial voices in the wilderness

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:48.380
except it's hardly a
wilderness it's the opposite

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.450
that speak in this
direction and I can quote

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.430
many from the past who have too,

00:44:55.430 --> 00:45:00.290
but I think we're gonna
have to just keep at it

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:03.340
like the myth of Sisyphus
you push the rock up the hill

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.420
and the version I like is a Czech version

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.200
where as the rock rolls down
again as he knew it would be

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.300
he's whistling as it goes down the hill

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.050
knowing he has to push it up again.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.450
If you think it's a truly worthy thing

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.370
you keep doing what you
can in that direction.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.060
- I know that in some
of your voluntary work

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:28.290
you've been very active in programs

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:32.990
that identify budding scientists
and high schools and so on.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.990
What are you seeing out
there in terms of the way

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:42.963
talent is emerging, is
it the way it always was?

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.030
And then the failure lies
with the educational system

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.863
or what?

00:45:47.863 --> 00:45:49.070
Talk a little about that.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.680
- Well, this is the most positive thing.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.800
In fact, in my judgment at the moment

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.780
and it's something we
could build on far better

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.730
than we do, especially now
with this wonderful tool

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.790
the web, which of course can be misused

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:07.110
and is, can be just a garbage dump

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:12.110
instead of a cornucopia
as it also is fortunately

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.433
of powerful information and methods.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.840
I don't think for example,
we're ever going to have

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.070
in the foreseeable future
as many qualified teachers

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.810
of science and math as we need.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:31.327
However, if we realized
that the kids that wind up

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:35.250
going pretty high up in these fairs

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.277
that you mentioned, high
school science fairs,

00:46:37.277 --> 00:46:40.483
The science talent search
is the most well known,

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:47.050
but it's just 40 finalists
in Washington each spring.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.640
There's a lesser-known, but much bigger

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.730
international science and engineer fair

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.650
both of those incidentally
now are sponsored by Intel

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.120
as the prime sponsor, which
is a very sensible thing

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.223
given the nature of Intel as a company.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.210
The International Science Engineers,

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.840
1,400 kids from 50 countries,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.000
they meet in a different city every year

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.210
and they've all been winners

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.410
in regional, state, or local fairs.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.360
Now you go talk to those kids,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.930
they're very aware of these
science education problems

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.730
in the schools they came from.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.920
They would love to be a resource

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.380
to interact with their own schools.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.960
We could generate a great
network, which is kids.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.090
Remember the story I
told about my experience

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:38.083
in high school with my teacher in algebra.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.720
Well, these kids can do wonders

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.500
and there are instances
in college education,

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.600
my colleague Eric Misour at Harvard,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.990
Alex Pines here at
Berkeley, have done a lot

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.630
with what's called peer instruction

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.987
where you pose questions
and the students argue out

00:47:58.987 --> 00:48:01.950
and they vote and then they find out

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.040
whether we got the right idea.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.290
Then they argue again to see
if they can understand why,

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.190
so the key thing is getting
students in the first place

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.690
to take ownership instead
of allowing it to seem

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.973
to belong to some higher authorities,

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.750
the previous generation or whatever,

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.180
and then they'll get the
wider community therefore

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.580
to take ownership too.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.720
What I would love to see since we're here

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.100
before our TV cameras,
is every week on the news

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.880
and every network, one
or two minutes segment

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.670
allowing one of these
kids from a science fair

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.430
to describe their project.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.880
They're usually excellent at it

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.400
because in working their way
through a series of fairs

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.470
they've had to describe their
project to whoever comes,

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:57.540
sometimes little kids,
sometimes even scientists

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.470
and they adjust
accordingly and they learn.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.240
They're the best ambassadors for science

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.500
because the attitude
that I mentioned before,

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.450
that society feels
science is too rarefied,

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:12.577
they won't understand and all that

00:49:12.577 --> 00:49:14.780
and that's been implicated in school

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.720
unfortunately for most
people, puts them off.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.820
If you have a scientist
speaking, even though sometimes

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.470
we have marvelous programs, NOVA and all,

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:26.130
they're not watched generally as widely

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.360
as they really deserve to be,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.670
but everybody then would see kids,

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:35.760
everybody's interested in a
kid just because they're a kid

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.260
but also then they
discover they're very good

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.700
at explaining their science and teachers,

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.060
other kids, parents, they'd watch,

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.310
I think it would be a regular thing.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.910
I think that would change very much

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:54.910
the whole society's
attitude and as you know TV

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.390
the way it works there's plenty
of little one or two minute

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.983
gaps they have to fill, we know
what they fill it with now,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.780
this could be done.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.400
- It sounds to me like we
have a real role model problem

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.383
in the sciences.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.463
Our current president is not Jefferson,

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.700
we don't have Franklins
in the hall of Congress

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.340
and so the it sounds like you're saying

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:25.340
that in fact we may wind up having to turn

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.100
to the excitement of younger people,

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.550
the newer generation actually
doing science actually

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:36.760
to inspire a broader sense
of what science can do.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.013
- I think it would be the
best way to go in fact.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.700
Science is a very useful
thing even if it's done

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.180
by very senior people occasionally.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.180
It's intrinsically useful I
said earlier, it's child's play.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:57.003
Well, of course, you don't
say that to funding agencies,

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:01.190
but in a serious way it has to be

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.430
if you're talking about basic science

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:07.430
that has a chance to learn
some of nature's language

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.570
and that's the most
fundamental and as I argue

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.420
the most practical kind we can do.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.200
And of course there's a whole range

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:20.200
I wouldn't belittle science
in the service of a short term

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.040
technological aim, that's
making use of what we've learned

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.250
already of nature's language

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.890
and often in a very
enterprising imaginative way,

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:38.890
but if we fail to recognize
that we've got to have people

00:51:40.783 --> 00:51:44.560
who are so inclined, scientists,
to have this burning urge

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.350
to probe deeper in a fundamental way,

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:52.200
we are losing out on the most
important long-term aspect

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.593
which is to learn more
from nature's language,

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:59.100
explore more of that
ignorance that opens up

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.100
as we learn more as Feynman emphasized.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.910
- How would you advise students

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:09.373
who want to go into science
to prepare for the future?

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.670
- Well, I think they
should explore widely,

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.980
not just science and math,
but literature, history,

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.980
they could should make themselves
person who has wide eyes

00:52:25.578 --> 00:52:29.230
'cause often what you wind up doing

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:30.380
in all kinds of thought,

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.990
but I think especially
pronounced in science

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:37.500
is metaphorical kind of
comparisons and analogies

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.760
and often the thing that
you think of in science

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.450
isn't some narrow technical
thing that depended on

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:47.950
having taking X number
of courses or something

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.430
to get you this point.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:54.323
No, it's some down to Earth
metaphor with something done

00:52:54.323 --> 00:52:56.510
that people wouldn't ordinarily think of

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.310
as related to science at all.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:03.993
It may be related to art
or music or whatever.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.890
I mean a lot of what you do
in say chemical synthesis

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:13.210
where you have these simple
elements, chemical bonds,

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:16.290
often you're specially
interested in biological things

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:18.430
then the main atom,
their carbon, hydrogen,

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:21.840
nitrogen, oxygen, the big
four, maybe a few others

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.020
here and there, so the
elements are simple.

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.423
Well elements of the Beethoven
composition are pretty simple

00:53:28.423 --> 00:53:31.810
you just have a few notes
intervals and what not,

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.550
but it's matter how you assemble them,

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.470
so it's the same thing.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:40.610
I like to say science is
not really a technical thing

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.270
as much as an architectural thing.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.970
An architect has to understand
quite a few technical things,

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.910
but that's not the
essence of architecture.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:53.000
Architecture itself is more
than that, it's a broad thing

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.040
that has to recognize
the aim of the project

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.960
and the fact that how are people

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.410
going to experience this space.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.083
How's it gonna serve the
functions, the activities?

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:09.940
So it has to be very broad and
so a lot of the best science

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.430
is architectural in character.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:16.190
You don't necessarily invent the materials

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:19.520
or the building construction,
but you put them together

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.260
in a way that opens people's
eyes to new possibilities

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.340
that they didn't see before.

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.756
Just the thing we admire when we say wow,

00:54:25.756 --> 00:54:30.756
that's really good architecture,
that's the character

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.570
that's so important to recognize I think.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.010
- Standing back and seeing the whole.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:40.370
- Yeah, so that's why I say an
education that's very broad.

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:43.552
For example, Einstein who was of course

00:54:43.552 --> 00:54:46.520
the most convenient icon,
especially this year,

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.290
he had a very broad cultural education.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:52.720
His mother was a fine
pianist, so he learned music.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.700
He fell in love with Mozart about age 13,

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.140
he'd studied the violin since six,

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.140
and he said that he never really
began learning to play well

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:05.973
until I fell in love with Mozart.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.493
He said love is a much
better teacher than duty.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.190
It certainly was for him,
not only in the violin,

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:19.190
but elsewhere, and
that's we have to foster.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.020
You see every little kid is a scientist,

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.310
they're just so damn
curious, they inevitably are

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:28.620
and too much of our social
and educational system

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.520
tends to quench this because
oh, the important thing

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.220
is to get the right answer.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.650
Well, that's not the important thing

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:35.830
when you're doing science

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:37.540
because the people don't
know the right answer,

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:42.540
so you're asking instead am I
thinking in an interesting way

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:46.880
and I come up and approach,
so that puts a great premium

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.033
on individual imagination,
just what counts in a poem.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.350
Whereas the image of science
is nothing like that.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.270
The student gets the
impression that there's no room

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.240
for individual scope because you learn

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.780
how to do everything in the right way

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.330
well that means only one way.

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:04.580
There's not only one way.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:11.030
Even in mathematics, the
crucial kind of invention

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.313
comes from people who do it
a different way than others.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:23.380
- Well on that note of hope actually

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.890
for what we will be able
to achieve in the future

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.180
I wanna thank you very
much Professor Herschbach

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.190
for coming back to
Berkeley and taking time

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:33.720
to be on our program, thank you.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.710
- That's been my pleasure.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.410
- Thank you, and thank you
very much for joining us

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.673
for this conversation with history.

00:56:41.673 --> 00:56:45.340
(upbeat instrumental music)
