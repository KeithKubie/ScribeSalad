00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.570
During normal times
in the economy,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.260
the Fed tries to control the
amount of economic activity

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.830
that's occurring by targeting
the federal funds rate.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.340
The fed funds rate.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.900
And this is the
rate that you always

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.670
hear talked about on the news.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.750
And it's essentially
a target rate

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.790
that the Fed wants to see
banks lending money-- lending

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.340
cash to each other--
on an overnight basis.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.030
And we saw already
in the last video,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.500
if the Fed does not like the
rate that they're borrowing

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.170
to each other, and if even
announcing the federal funds

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.992
rate does not cause
the banks to say, hey,

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.450
the Fed's going to intervene
if we don't lend to each other

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.740
at that rate, the Fed
can actually intervene.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.480
It can go out there, perform
open market operations,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.130
and buy, usually
treasury securities,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.680
out from just the
general market.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.590
And what that does is it
increases the amount of cash

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.220
that is in circulation, which
decreases the demand for cash,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.790
increases the supply, and it
should lower the interest rate.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.940
And the Fed usually cares about
getting that interest rate

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.390
within a certain zone,
around a certain target.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.790
And the treasuries that
the Fed normally buys

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.660
are short-term treasuries.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.620
And this is just because
this is less risky,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.440
and sometimes they'll even make
it on a temporary agreement.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.320
They'll say, look, we'll
buy it from you now,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340
only if you agree to purchase
it at some future date

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.320
at a certain price.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.710
And that's called a
repurchase agreement.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590
I'll do a whole
other video on that.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.360
But the whole point of
open market operations

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230
is to set this overnight
borrowing rate.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.020
But they usually deal with
the short-term treasury debt

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.280
because it's safer.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.660
It exposes the Fed to
less interest rate risk.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.780
But you can imagine what
happens if the Fed keeps

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.720
lowering interest rates in
order to prime the pump,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.740
in order to try to
stimulate the economy.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.750
So it keeps lowering the federal
funds rate from 4%, down to 3%,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.580
down to 2%, maybe going all
the way down eventually to 0%.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.010
And the whole time, it's been
doing that by printing money

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.030
and buying short-term
US securities.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.180
And maybe at this point, the
yield curve looks like that.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.560
But maybe that's not enough.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.020
Maybe the economy's
still tanking.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.450
Maybe people aren't getting
mortgage loans still.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.920
So now, the Fed can no longer
do its traditional open market

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.534
operations.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.950
And it will no longer be focused
on just the federal funds

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.740
rate, because really,
it can't go any lower.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.410
It already hit zero.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.870
Short-term overnight borrowing
between banks is already zero.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.980
But if the Fed wants
to inject more cash,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.700
it can now buy different
types of securities.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.470
It can buy treasury
securities that are-- so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.220
instead of short term
treasury securities,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.090
maybe it could be longer
term treasury securities.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.580
So maybe stuff that's one
year out, five years out,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.660
10 years out.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.650
And the point here
would be two-fold.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.080
One, to inject cash
into the system,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.910
to print cash and put
it out there so it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.140
there for people to invest
and for the banking system

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.010
to operate.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.930
But it might be to explicitly
control the yield curve further

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.670
out so that borrowing
costs for longer debt

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.130
goes down, so that the
yield curve looks something

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.860
like that.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.530
Because if it's buying
longer maturity treasuries

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.430
that will lower the yield.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.860
Or they might even start to buy
things that aren't treasuries.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.860
Maybe they'll buy
mortgage-backed securities.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.970
So it makes the mortgage
market a little bit looser,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.500
a little bit more liquid.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.920
And this non-traditional
type of intervention,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.220
where the Fed is no longer
concerned about a target rate,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.210
because the target rate
is already at zero.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.120
Where the Fed is not
purchasing short-term debt,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.160
but is starting to
buy longer term debt,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.041
things further down
the yield curve.

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:36.040
And maybe things that
aren't treasury securities

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.560
to begin with.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.434
Maybe they're starting
to buy corporate debt.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:42.180
Maybe they're starting to buy
mortgage-backed securities.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.070
This is called
quantitative easing.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.810
And there's two
elements to it that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.990
make it different from
traditional Fed open market

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.860
operations.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.890
They are now no longer concerned
about the Fed fund rate,

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.730
because it's already at zero.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.630
The other thing is, is
that they're buying things

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.340
maybe further down
the yield curve.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640
So they're trying to control
the yield curve itself.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.680
And they're maybe buying
less traditional securities,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.500
with the goal of maybe making
those markets a little bit more

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.873
operational.
