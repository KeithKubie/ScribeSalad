00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.300
SUIKA HARO: I'm Suika Haro.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.158
I'm a game designer working
up the next games in Helsinki.

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:20.450
"The Walking Dead, Our World"
is a location-based game,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.690
or when you open the game, you
see a map of your surroundings.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.460
You're playing
everything on location,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.840
and everything
happening the game

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.722
is actually tied to where
you are exactly in the world.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.180
MARKUS MONTOLA: We wanted to
create a real-world game where

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.510
you literally experience
fighting and surviving

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.610
in your own city.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.680
SUIKA HARO: Every one of the
players is in a shared reality.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.590
So you can actually go and
play the game on the street

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.720
with your friend and see
the exact same things.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.050
MARKUS MONTOLA:
Our entire game is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.060
about streets and
cities and maps,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.660
so Google Maps is an
essential platform for us.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.480
With Google Maps, you can use
more and more real-world data

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.040
as a part of your
game, and that will

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.950
help you create the aesthetic of
blurring the line between game

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.632
and reality.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.090
SUIKA HARO: The huge benefit
to using Google Maps for games

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.700
is simply that the data
that you get from the maps

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.860
is incredibly
consistent globally.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.370
By liberating us from needing
to worry about the maps, what

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.340
Google has done has
allowed us to focus

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.950
on innovating the best
possible gameplay experiences

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.668
and the best possible social
elements into the games.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.960
MARKUS MONTOLA: We managed
to avoid quite a bit of tech

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.390
trouble by being able to
trust that the map data is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.070
consistent across
the world, especially

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.620
in the visuals where we can
use the building height data

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.812
and landmarks to make
the game feel more alive.

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:40.020
SUIKA HARO: "Walking Dead,
Our World" and Google Maps

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.817
is pretty much a perfect fit.

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:43.650
I don't think we've
ever been able to create

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.410
the game without Google Maps.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.910
I'm really looking
forward to seeing

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.700
what other developers actually
do with location-based games

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.040
and the Google Maps platform.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.110
The tools that we use
to create these games

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.390
are so much better now
that we can actually really

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.200
focus on the innovation.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.770
I can't wait to play all
the games that developers

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.110
are creating with Google Maps.
