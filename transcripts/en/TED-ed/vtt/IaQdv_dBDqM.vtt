00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.827
In 1987, tens of thousands of people

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:14.257
gathered in Saudi Arabia 
for the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:18.547
But what started out as a celebration 
led to a health crisis:

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.748
just a few days after the pilgrimage,

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:24.818
more than 2,000 cases 
of meningitis broke out

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:28.098
spreading across Saudi Arabia
and the rest of the world.

00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:30.288
The outbreak was so fierce

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.757
that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.957
that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide.

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:43.337
Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges,

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:48.297
three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:52.027
What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:56.087
is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body.

00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:59.877
In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day.

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.777
Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment.

00:01:04.777 --> 00:01:07.977
The disease primarily 
comes in three forms:

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:12.857
fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far,

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:15.017
and what we’ll focus on.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:18.497
People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:22.797
tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air

00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:26.137
when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs.

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:28.457
It can also be transmitted 
through kissing,

00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:32.477
or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils.

00:01:32.477 --> 00:01:35.257
Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:38.137
without showing symptoms
or getting sick,

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:41.977
which helps the disease
spread quickly to others.

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:45.167
Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat,

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.837
they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream.

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:53.197
From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:56.787
--including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier.

00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:01.917
This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain,

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:05.817
and block everything except
for a specific set of particles,

00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:09.097
including water molecules and some gases.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:12.367
But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:17.157
meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through.

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:21.037
Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly
infect the meninges.

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:26.017
This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive,

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:29.207
bringing on fever
and intense headaches.

00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:33.187
As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.807
Swelling in the brain disrupts its
normal function--

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:40.317
causing symptoms like hearing loss 
and extreme light sensitivity.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:45.167
As pressure increases in the cranium, 
it may also make the person confused--

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.887
one of the hallmarks
of the disease.

00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:52.907
A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria start to release toxins,

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:57.237
leading to septicemia,
also known as blood poisoning.

00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:59.427
This breaks down blood vessels,

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:03.777
letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash,

00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:08.097
and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin.

00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:12.237
At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood,

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:17.367
reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.597
That increases the chance 
of organ shut down

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:24.777
--and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death.

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:29.177
That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:34.477
that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:36.547
The longer it’s left 
untreated, though,

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:39.457
the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage.

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:43.967
If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:49.177
--like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up.

00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:54.067
And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death,

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.647
meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss.

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:03.247
So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical.

00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:07.367
That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.217
in its deadliest forms.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:13.507
Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children,

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:17.607
people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:21.567
where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:23.147
In addition to those gatherings,

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:27.117
meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:32.187
that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world.

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:35.707
If you’re concerned that you or someone 
you know may have meningitis,

00:04:35.707 --> 00:04:38.257
get to the doctor as soon as possible;

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:41.687
quick action could save your life.
