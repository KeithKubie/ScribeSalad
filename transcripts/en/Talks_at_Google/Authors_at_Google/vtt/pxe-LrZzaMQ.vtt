00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.870
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Well,
welcome everyone.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.510
Welcome.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.090
So it's a real honor today to
have Vincent Stanley here.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.930
And for those of you interested
in buying his book,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.990
"The Responsible Company," we
have it subsidized in the back

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.630
of the room for, I think, a very
reasonable price of $5.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.480
So be sure and grab one of these
before you head out.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.920
My name is Jacquelline Fuller,
and I run our Google Giving

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.630
Program here at the company.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.750
And I'm just going to give
some brief introductory

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.759
remarks about Vincent.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.730
So I think a lot of us joined
Google because we thought it's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.480
a different kind of company.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.100
And it's a company that goes
beyond "don't be evil" to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.620
actually trying to proactively
use a corporation to do good

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.540
in the world.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.240
And it's easy to lose sight of
the fact that that's unusual.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.330
And that hasn't always been
a meme that existed.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.570
But we've come to that standing
on the shoulders of

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.210
people like Vincent, who really
set into motion the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.950
whole idea that corporations
can go beyond making money.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.590
And corporations can go beyond a
few trivial efforts at being

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.040
socially responsible to actually
making that a central

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.740
part of who you are
as a company.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.560
So we here at Google are really
indebted to the legacy

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.820
that he's created.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.890
So Vincent has been with
Patagonia on and off for 40

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.790
years, since it was founded.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
Actually just this week, when I
was working out at the gym,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.360
I was making a comment about
some workout gear.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.250
And the woman was
standing there

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.380
wearing a Patagonia jacket.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.060
And she said yeah, just
like Patagonia.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.190
You just feel good.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.023
You might spend a little more
up front, but you just know

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:41.890
it's going to last forever.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.000
So that literally happened
just this week.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.640
So I think we're all aware of
the great products that they

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.350
make, and we love
their products.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.410
We might be less aware of the
legacy that they've created in

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.920
the work that not only they do
as a company but the memes

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.560
that they've created
around the world.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.530
So hopefully we'll hear a
little bit about that.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.400
I got to read the book.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.560
And some of the things that
were really interesting to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.240
me-- and it is, for one, the
attitude of humility that goes

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.259
throughout the entire book.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.190
In fact, he says--

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.440
didn't start Patagonia with the
notion of being a really

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.200
responsible company, but you
all were stunned into

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.530
consciousness.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.950
And Vincent played a major role
in creating some of the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.800
changes that brought about
a responsible company.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.170
He also started an interactive
website called Footprint

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.490
Chronicles, which I urge
you all to look at.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.150
They do things, for example,
like being completely

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.660
transparent about their supply
chain, which I think is really

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.130
innovative and a good prod for
the rest of the industry.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.110
So we're really honored to
have Vincent here today.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.400
Thanks.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.650
VINCENT STANLEY: Thank you.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.820
Thank you.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.340
I usually like to start just by
reading the first couple of

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.040
paragraphs of the book to give
an idea of what the tone is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.290
and what our--

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.570
the book was written by Yvon
Chouinard, our company's

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.510
founder, and myself.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.370
And in some ways it's a sequel
to the first-- can you all

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.720
hear me way in the back?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.410
OK.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.090
In some ways, it's a sequel to
his first book called "Let My

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.550
People Go Surfing," which was
both his autobiography and a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.230
laying out of Patagonia's
business philosophies as they

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.400
had evolved over a
30-year period.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.710
This book is a little
different.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.040
And we wrote it not so much
for ourselves, but for our

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.400
friends and allies and for
people who are interested in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.280
going into business and for
people who are in business and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.530
trying to do something
different.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.910
So the book starts out "we were
all still in the earliest

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.650
stages of learning how what we
do for a living both threatens

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.430
nature and fails to meet our
deepest human needs.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.800
The impoverishment of our world
and the devaluing of the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.370
priceless undermine our
physical and economic

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.589
well-being.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.250
Yet the depth and breadth of
technological innovation of

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.460
the past few decades shows that
we have not lost our most

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.350
useful gifts.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.570
Humans are ingenious,
adaptive, clever.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.220
We also have moral capacity,
compassion for life, and an

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.050
appetite for justice.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.340
We now need to more fully engage
these gifts to make

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.100
economic life more socially
and environmentally

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.850
responsible and less destructive
to nature and the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.880
commons that sustain us.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.570
This book aims to sketch, in
light of our environmental

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.400
crisis and our economic sea
change, the elements of

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.470
business responsibility for
our time, when everyone in

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.630
business at every level has to
deal with the unintended

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.110
consequences of a 200-year old
industrial model that can no

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.440
longer be sustained
ecologically, socially, or

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.690
financially.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.030
The co-authors have been
involved with Patagonia since

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.690
its inception nearly 40 years
ago, but it is not the purpose

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.500
of this book to retell our
company's history in detail.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.160
This book, though it draws on
our experience at Patagonia,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.280
aims to be useful to all people
who see the need for

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.630
deep change in business
practices and who work in

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.540
companies quite unlike ours.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.940
Although we mostly address
companies that make things or,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.330
like us, design things made by
others, this book is germane

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.730
to all businesses that offer
a service or to NGOs and

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.550
non-profits that want to treat
their people well and reduce

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.340
the environmental impact
of their operations.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.560
This book is for anyone who
works, not just business

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.860
leaders and managers.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.320
It is also for business students
and other young

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.335
people who want to engage their
best, deepest self in

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:24.210
the working life ahead."

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:32.080
And I kind of go on to tell
the story that we did not

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.840
intend to be a responsible
company.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.660
In fact, we got our start as a
climbing equipment company

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.490
that made hardware.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.060
I think that we were the leading
climbing equipment

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.540
company in the world,
and we had about

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:56.290
$200,000 in sales in 1972.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.290
Every piece of gear that we made
had a burden to it, which

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.050
is that you did not want to kill
your friends or yourself.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.440
So the quality control or the
attitude that we brought to

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.480
our products was
quite serious.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.920
And the whole idea of Patagonia,
what we found that

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.320
the end of the year selling
our $200,000 worth of gear

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.010
with about a 2% profit,
is that we weren't

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.940
getting ahead very fast.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.790
So we decided to create an
irresponsible company.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.620
We would get into the rag
trade was our attitude.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.580
We would sell clothing
to climbers.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.320
We would make a killing.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.980
And it would be so
easy because it

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.900
didn't involve hardware.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.400
It didn't involve any potential
for hairline cracks

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.630
or metal fatigue.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.890
And this would be our passport
to paradise for the future.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.270
So we did.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.340
We got into clothing.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.030
We started importing rugby
shirts, heavy sweaters.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.760
Then we got into the idea of
layering for the mountain.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.250
So we were the first company to
produce polyester underwear

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.620
that wicks moisture outwards and
a layer of insulation and

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.920
then a shell over that.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.060
A couple of things
that sort of--

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.490
we were not concerned about what
the environmental impact

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.880
of that clothing was or even
not so much concerned about

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.090
the social conditions of the
people that made those goods.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.110
But we always had a strong
concern about the environment.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.260
And I think that that has to
do with the people who work

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.030
there, because most people
were a sort of band of

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.810
climbers and surfers, who spent
as much free time as

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.870
they could in the wilderness.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.000
The wilderness, for a surfer,
starts about 10

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.870
yards from the beach.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.730
And the wilderness for a
mountaineer starts about a

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.030
mile in from the roadhead.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.730
And I think what being in the
wilderness does for you, it

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:11.400
exposes for all of us who are
used to living a kind of

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.640
well-managed civilized life,
being in the wild reminds you

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.200
that you're not necessarily at
the top of the food chain,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.850
that you can be at physical
risk, that you're in the

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:29.530
presence of something that is
more powerful than you and

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.690
then also more beautiful than
anything we can make.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.570
And I think that the sense that
you get from being in the

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.920
wild is something that
cannot really be

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.815
explained to someone.

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.420
But it can be shared.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.580
And a lot of the early employees
at Patagonia shared

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.230
this feeling.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.370
So it was very easy
as we developed

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.960
the business to start--

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.100
the owners started to give away
first 10% of the profits

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.960
every year to environmental
causes.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.970
And we focused on grassroots
environmental groups that were

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.490
saving a particular patch of
land or stretch of water.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.960
We gave to people nobody
else would give to.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.150
We then changed that because we
know that accountants love

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.490
to play with profit numbers.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.540
So we changed the figure to 1%
of sales or 10% of profits,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.460
whichever is greater.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.600
And we've been doing
that for 30 years.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.320
And we're due about $600 million
a year this year.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.610
So we're giving away
$6 million.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.200
That was easy for us.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.460
And one of the things I argue
for in the book is that

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.510
everything that we learned
came very slowly,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.650
kind of step by step.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.800
And that one small victory
enabled us to think in a way

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.770
that would make the next victory
possible, mostly

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.770
because we could think
it possible.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.650
So I'd have to go back to even
before we made clothes to a

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.710
major decision we made when we
were still a climbing company

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.780
to explain kind of the origins
of this and how

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.460
it worked for us.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.230
We were known for our pitons
which, for climbers, if you

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:28.840
know that, it was the old
time-tested way of protection

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.800
while you are climbing
a crack.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.370
You'd hammer a piton into the
crack, and then you'd run your

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.040
ropes though it, and it would
protect the belayer.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.810
And each time that you
place that piton, you

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.150
did it with a hammer.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.700
And then to get it out, you'd
tap the piton with a hammer

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.850
and draw it out.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.845
And the problem was that as
climbing became more popular

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:56.090
in the early '70s, there were
only certain routes that were

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.740
wildly popular with climbers.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.190
So you had hundreds of people
going up the same cracks, and

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.090
they'd be hammering in their
pitons, and then they would be

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.010
tapping them out.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.540
And they were ruining
the rock.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.020
They were ruining the climbs
that were kind of the basis,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.240
and the love of climbing
that was at the

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.580
basis of the business.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.150
So what we did is we published
a catalog in 1972 with an

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:24.290
article by Doug Robinson, who's
a Bay Area local, called

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.990
"The Whole Natural Art of
Protection," which pointed out

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.810
there was an alternative to
pitons that the British had

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.530
developed, these little
hexentric-shaped aluminum

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.790
chocks that could be torqued
into a crack without hammering

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.120
and then torqued back
to remove it.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.400
And of course, we came out with
a line of these in the

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.780
same catalog.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.160
And I think we had something
like 87% of our business was

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.860
reliant on the piton market
at the time we did this.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.960
So it was a risky move, even
for a $200,000 company.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.810
There were still 10 of us who
had families to feed.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.000
And the business really
changed--

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.400
I'd say overnight, but I'm in
marketing, so that's an

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.150
exaggeration.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.680
It was about six months, eight
months, before the

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.520
transformation was complete.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.090
But our customers really did
move away from pitons and

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.750
start using hexentrics.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.100
And it really did make a
difference right away on the

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.700
climbing routes around the
country and around the world.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.350
What this did is it gave us the
experience that we could

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.040
actually talk to our customers
this way, that they would

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.770
listen, and that it would
make a difference.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.290
So I'm telling this rather long
story, so when we go into

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.500
the next phase, we're in
the clothing business.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.760
We're 20 years later.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.970
We're quite successful.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.240
We're doing about, I think
at the time, about

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.840
$30 million a year.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.990
We are giving away some money
to environmental groups, but

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.190
otherwise we're a fairly
conventional business.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.450
We open up a new store in
Boston on Newbury Steet.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.030
And we discover after about
three days that employees are

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.950
getting sick--

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.190
stomach aches, headaches--

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.570
and they have to go home.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.590
So we realize there's a problem
with the ventilation.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.080
And we call in an environmental
engineer.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.785
And he fixes the problem, and
says, here's your bill.

00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:26.180
And we said, well, thank you.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:26.760
That's fine.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.320
But what was causing
the problem?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.361
And he says, well,
formaldehyde.

00:14:32.361 --> 00:14:35.650
And the formaldehyde was
off-gassing from the cotton

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.080
clothes in our basement.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.250
And this was the first that we
really understood that our

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.510
softwear business, which was
supposed to be so much more

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:55.390
environmentally benign than our
hard iron business, that

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:01.710
cotton was actually a culprit,
that the chemicals that went

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.460
into growing cotton
at the time--

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.300
about 8% of the pesticides in
the world went into growing

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:18.320
cotton, so really a
pesticide-intensive crop.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.500
And it's less so today,
but at that time,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.560
those were the numbers.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.600
And we were shocked
to find this out.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.660
So we decided to commission a
study of the four major fibers

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.270
we used, which was polyester,
wool, nylon and cotton.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.420
And then we were further shocked
to discover that

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.640
cotton was the worst of the four
fibers, that even though

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.720
polyester and nylon were
oil-based and had that set of

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.640
problems, cotton
was the worst.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.340
There was, unlike with polyester
or with nylon, an

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.530
alternative to
conventionally-grown cotton,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.790
which was to use
organic cotton.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.670
And so we ran a couple of test
programs, and we made t-shirts

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.300
out of organic cotton.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.270
And then we made the
decision to go all

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.130
organic in one season.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.220
We had about an 18-month period
from the fall of '94 to

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.060
the spring of '96.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.661
We discontinued the use of
conventional cotton.

00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:24.790
We were a little premature.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.510
We ended up buying all of the
cotton grown in the San

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.130
Joaquin Valley.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.970
We were praying for rain.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.710
Because if we hadn't had rain,
we wouldn't have had shirts.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.350
And the interesting thing for us
is that in the process of--

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.240
there are two interesting
things.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.530
One is we never could have made
this change if we hadn't

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.430
done the change in hardware
20 years before.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.820
Because that gave us the
confidence that we could talk

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:58.150
to our customers, explain what
we were doing, and not lose

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.930
the business, even though
the price of the

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.070
clothes would go up.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.849
Second, the criteria for making
the change was really

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.430
important to us, because this
was something we could do

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.589
something about.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:21.069
And you know, the Google motto
is "Do No Evil," I believe?

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:27.359
"Don't be evil." We have a
very complicated mission

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.580
statement, but the second
part of it is "Cause

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.030
No Unnecessary Harm.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.820
And the word "Unnecessary" is
key because it enables you, as

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.060
people in business, when you
approach a problem and you

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.550
know that there is a solution,
it gives you permission to

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.410
pursue that.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.120
So we couldn't do anything about
making polyester out of

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.550
nonoil-substances, but
we could make organic

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.350
cotton, and we did.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.630
And that was the second thing
that gave us a lot of

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.190
confidence in terms of pursuing
new activities that

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.900
other people hadn't touched.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.700
We were not a special
group of people.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.320
We were not very bright.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.460
We were not well capitalized.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.480
But I think that with this
background, it enabled us to

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.960
do things that other people
hadn't done before.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.050
I like to talk about that at
businesses, because I think

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.930
it's really true for--

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.780
there's been a progression
since the organic cotton

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.450
change in 1996.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.820
Our most recent kind
of big move was

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.620
about three years ago.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.430
We got together with Walmart
and, issued on joint

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.540
stationary, which is I think the
only letter that ever went

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.570
out in history on joint
stationary from Patagonia and

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.100
Walmart, inviting major players
in the apparel and

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.740
footwear business to get
together to a conference to

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:04.950
form a coalition to evaluate the
environmental and social

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:10.870
factors involved in clothing
and footwear, to create an

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:16.630
index for designers and build
it into the company's ERP

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.960
systems, so that the designers
would understand when they

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.810
were making a choice what the
environmental and social

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.470
ramifications were.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.140
And then eventually to take this
index consumer-facing,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.220
which is still in the future.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.340
But we want to get to the point
where a customer can

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:39.340
take the phone and run it over
a QR code on a pair of pants

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.870
and read what the environmental
health and the

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.370
social health of that
product is.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.700
We invited those companies.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.860
About 16 people came to
the first meeting.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.700
And this was only in 2010.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.230
So three years later, we now
have 82 members of the

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.780
Sustainable Apparel Coalition.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.280
They represent a third of all
of the apparel and footwear

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.940
made in the world.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.990
And the index, called the Hig
Index, has now been developed.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.450
And the companies are beginning
to implement it into

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.700
their design.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.890
I don't know how many years
we are away from having a

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.770
consumer-facing index, but it's
not that far, if we were

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.700
able to develop the meat of
it within three years.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:30.240
This is huge, because if this
is successful, then what

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.040
happens is if you've got a third
of the industry adopting

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.680
this, the rest of the
apparel and footwear

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.010
industries have to follow.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.930
And it has the potential to
make a huge difference in

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.740
reducing the environmental
impact and the social harm

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.980
done in those industries.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.000
And these are two of
the old oldest

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.530
industries in the world.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.930
Apparel is made--

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.760
I mean, the textile machines
are fancier, but it's

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.500
basically made the way it was
150 years ago in Lowell,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.020
Massachusetts.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.020
The only thing I'd like to say
before I open it up for

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.380
questions is to tell you why
I wrote the book, or why--

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.770
Yvon had his own reasons for
approaching the book.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.240
But although I've been with
Patagonia for 40 years, my

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.830
primary vocation
is as a writer.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:26.450
And I think that one of
the things that--

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.540
I had a question--

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.350
I was coming--

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.390
after 40 years around this
company, my question was how

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.090
did the culture survive?

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.330
In a company--

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.810
how had it grown from a company
with 10 employees to a

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.060
company with 1,000 or
1,200 employees?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.570
How had the culture stayed
intact from a company that had

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.620
that $200,000 in sales
to a company that

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.310
now had $600 million?

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.640
And for a writer, the way to
attack that question is to

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.290
write about it.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:03.300
And so that was essentially my
reason for working on this

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.840
book is I wanted to come up
with the answer to that

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.680
question, and then also write
something that would be useful

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.510
to others, particularly
to young people who

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.530
were starting out.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.600
Yvon's primary contribution--

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.220
and it was an essential one,
which is to say, OK, we're

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.410
giving people--

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.580
we're talking about culture.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.740
We're talking in general
about what we view the

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.210
responsibilities of
business to be.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.980
And in some ways, these will
not be unfamiliar to you,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.350
except that we do say that
businesses are responsible to

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.170
nature in a way that other
people might not allow.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.450
But his primary contribution
was the addition--

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.070
he said let's make
it practical.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.960
And so at the end of it,
we have about a 45-page

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.870
checklist, which anybody can use
to go down and look at the

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:02.880
various aspects of business and
say are we composting the

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.950
forks in the cafe?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.130
Are we using LED bulbs?

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:14.220
Are we creating berms
for runoff water?

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.010
So what I'm proud of in the
book is this kind of

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.050
combination of talking about
our own experience and then

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.710
providing some very practical
advice at the end.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.170
So with that, I'd like to open
it up for questions.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.290
AUDIENCE: I had a question,
just on the manufacturing.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:32.960
So I think--

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.630
I always struggle with clothing

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.100
today, where it's made.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.220
I think it's good that it's not
made just in the United

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.110
States, and they're servicing
a global market, because we

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.360
need to grow.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.340
People in other countries
are growing.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.100
But then, one thing I love
about it being in the G8

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.310
nations is they have a lot of
great things in place, like

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.390
there's OSHA.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.330
Just like-- if it's formaldehyde
in other

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.290
countries, well, they can get
a new set of workers to come

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.930
in, because they're so poor
that they have this

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.220
attraction.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.550
So my jacket says--

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.660
I always struggle with when my
jacket says it's made in

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.580
Ecuador with US-based parts.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.330
I feel uncomfortable
with that.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.010
It's not just Patagonia.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:20.760
But it's everywhere.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.670
I feel uncomfortable
with that.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.530
And can you explain your
thoughts and what you're doing

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.620
on where you're making things,
what kinds of decisions, and

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.200
where you're going towards?

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.890
I know skill becomes a big thing
in America, because they

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.680
moved all the clothing
outside.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.530
Really, it's really the high end
has remained here, but the

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.040
middle end--

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.100
they don't have that
many people with

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.132
those kinds of skills.

00:24:46.132 --> 00:24:48.780
There's a new-- one company's
just trying to get it back,

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.190
but they're not so successful.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.100
VINCENT STANLEY: It's a really
good question, and I

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.520
can give you some--

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.430
the answer is a little
complex.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.280
When we started, about half of
our clothes were made in the

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.790
US, and about half
were made abroad.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.400
And we actually made quite a
bit in Hong Kong, which at

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.360
that time produced the best
sportswear in the world.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.020
One of the things that happened
and it was actually

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:19.890
accelerated by NAFTA and some
of the other free trade

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.040
agreements in the mid '90s is
that it really killed the

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.470
American textile industry.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.540
And when the mills moved
away to Asia, the

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.790
sewing tended to follow.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.220
I've been reading some
interesting articles I

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.900
recommend to you folks,
if you're

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.780
interested in this issue.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.010
In "The Atlantic," there was
an article about American

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.450
manufacturing moving
back here.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.460
And there was also one
in "The Economist"

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.900
about two months ago.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.850
And they were talking mostly
about what they call white

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.775
goods-- refrigerators,
that kind of thing.

00:25:58.775 --> 00:26:01.920
And one of the things that was
interesting to me is that

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.360
companies that outsourced their
manufacturing to Asia

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.590
about 12 years ago found that
after about five years, they

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.200
no longer knew how to make
the refrigerator.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.060
They didn't know how
to repair it.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.810
By moving the intellectual
capital so far from

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:25.610
manufacturing, they
lost touch.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.670
The other thing that's happening
is that labor

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.630
becomes a smaller and smaller
percentage of the cost of

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.410
every product made to
the point where--

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.610
one interesting thing I've
read in "The Wall Street

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.280
Journal"-- there is more
manufacturing done in the

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:48.080
United States than at any time
in history, but the number of

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.050
people working in manufacturing
is the same as

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:55.010
worked in 1941, when we had
about one third the

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.980
population.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.230
So the manufacturing that's
coming back to the States is

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.180
not creating jobs.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.670
It's being done far
more efficiently.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:11.290
And there are great advantages
to that, but they're not

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.620
bringing work back.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.610
The second thing in both
articles, they said that the

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.600
apparel industry is not
moving back here.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.310
And that's kind of a
complicated story.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.950
I think smaller companies are
doing some interesting work,

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.100
starting their own factories
in urban cities.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.460
And the factories are decent.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.240
They're not sweatshops, like we
had in the '70s and '80s in

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.870
the Bay Area and in LA.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.330
High end clothing is actually
not made in--

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.860
high end outdoor apparel, when
you're looking at Gore-Tex

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.390
shells and those kinds of things
are made in about five

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.820
or six factories in the world.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.890
And they're not in the
United States.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.590
The capacity to make
that is not here.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:04.080
So my sense is that eventually
the industry will gravitate

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.650
back to where the textiles
are made.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.110
And the textiles could be made
in the United States.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.620
But it will probably involve
some kind of revolution in the

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.810
cut and sew that involves
much less labor.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.450
That would be my forecast.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:26.200
And for us, labor is-- we're not
moving because of labor.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.010
We're not moving because of the
cost of labor, but we have

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.650
to move because of the
availability of labor and the

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.450
availability of skill--

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.430
cut and sew factories.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:40.230
It's a rather long answer,
but that's kind of

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.980
where it is right now.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
over for the talk.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.180
My question is slightly
similar.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.320
I haven't read your book yet, so
you might have some answers

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.830
in there for my question.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.490
So I'm kind of curious.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.250
You were mentioning the trend
of the textiles being abroad

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.400
and how those industries might
be shifting back over there.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.680
I was wondering with Patagonia
being able to build its brand

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.570
for all these years and be able
to start to implement

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.090
these pretty interesting,
socially responsible practices

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.260
along the way and communicating
with the

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.790
consumers you serve in order to
do that, I'm just curious

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.830
what advice you might give
to folks who are--

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.950
or similar companies or
apparel brands in the

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.290
developing economies that have
different types of pressure or

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.095
have different relationships
with the customers they serve

00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:43.440
or the markets that they're
in, how they can also be

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.330
socially responsible?

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.040
Just any thoughts or advice that
you might have on that.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.090
VINCENT STANLEY: It's
a good question.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.800
It's hard to answer
in the abstract.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.520
I was on a panel--

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.600
there was a big trade show in
Munich last week for the

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.910
outdoor industry with the snow
outdoor industry and apparel.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.720
And I was on a panel with
somebody from O'Neill, the

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.845
wetsuit company and also with
these four start-up companies.

00:30:14.845 --> 00:30:16.790
And they were really great.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.530
And two of them were in Britain,
and a couple of them

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.010
were elsewhere in Europe.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.070
And two of the companies
were really--

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.120
from Britain-- were trying to
source everything with "Made

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.870
in Britain" materials.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.900
And they had very high standards
of quality and

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.150
craftsmanship.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.630
I really, really rooted
for them.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.890
But the ways in which we could
be helpful to them would be--

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:47.410
or the advice I would offer them
would depend on what the

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.330
company was making and
what its core values

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.000
were and all that.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.110
It's very, very hard
to answer.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:00.730
There's one thing I told them
that I have any amount of

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.060
respect for anybody who's
starting up a company now.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.280
Because I think when we started
up in the '70s and

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.570
'80s, it was so much easier.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.010
I talked with other old timers,
and we both think-- or

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.950
with the founder
of the company.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:17.040
And he and I both think that if
Patagonia started today and

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.660
made the mistakes we made in the
'70s, we would have been

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.410
out of business.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.616
It's a less forgiving
environment.

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:25.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.390
When you started your talk,
you said that do no

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.515
unnecessary evil or bad things
that aren't necessary.

00:31:33.515 --> 00:31:35.680
I was wondering if you could
walk us through the process

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.860
your company does to determine
if something's necessary or

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.610
unnecessary.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.100
I have this probably false idea
that companies don't do

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.260
anything that they think is
necessarily evil, but maybe it

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.100
drives their profit.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.240
And since you're a for-profit
company, if you're balancing

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.720
increasing your market share
by increasing more shirts

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.150
produced, but you're going
to have to offshore the

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.090
production of those materials,
how do you come to a

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.680
conclusion to say, yes, it's a
little bit evil, but we're OK

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.530
with that amount of evil?

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.780
VINCENT STANLEY: OK.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.240
Forgive me for another
long answer.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.980
We took out, about a year ago,
the Black Friday the year

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.470
before last, we took out an
ad in "The New York Times"

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.720
saying, "don't buy this jacket."
And the jacket we

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.590
featured was something called
the R4, which is a piece of

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.340
heavy insulation.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.960
It's one of the most
environmentally friendly

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.370
pieces we make.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.560
It'll last forever.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.200
It'll last for decades.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.210
It is made of 60% recycled
polyester.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.660
Every product, every Patagonia
product, when you're done with

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.530
it, when it's kind of worn out,
we will take it back and

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.470
we will recycle it.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:52.040
And in the case of polyester,
we can actually melt it down

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.530
and extrude it into new fiber
that's of equal quality to the

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.430
old, which is right in with
William McDonough

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.110
cradle-to-cradle values.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:09.310
But what we pointed out was that
the water use to create

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:14.200
this jacket could provide
drinking water to 45 people in

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:20.680
a day, that it generated 2/3 of
its weight in scrap waste,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.490
that it generated 23 times its
weight in greenhouse gases.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.340
So where I'm leading is I think
it's not just a question

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:37.110
of a little bit of harm versus
less harm is that everything

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.230
that's involved in manufacturing
creates a great

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.100
deal of harm.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.830
And it raises all kinds
of questions about--

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.970
or raises very serious questions
for us about the

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.510
nature and the future the
consumer economy.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.620
I've mentioned I wear a simple
gold wedding band that

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.970
generates 20 tons
of mine waste.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.890
The production of
each gold band.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.480
So when we talk about making
products, once you start to

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.870
kind of pierce the veil and go
deeper into the supply chain,

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.790
the questions get harder
and tougher.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:16.060
And you realize everybody
who's making things is

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.219
culpable in all kinds of ways.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:22.530
So for us, the question is how
to certainly not to do the

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.489
unnecessary harm.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:26.730
Certainly we can make clothes
out of organic cotton.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:31.580
And certainly we make
decisions to--

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.330
kind of following the 80-20 rule
or depending on what new

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.210
developments are in fabrics--

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.400
make a product more
environmentally friendly.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.630
Counter to that is the fact that
nobody wants a piece of

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.090
clothing that is ugly.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.780
Nobody wants a piece of clothing
that doesn't fit.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.469
Nobody wants to wear clothing
for outdoor use that actually

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.540
doesn't perform for
its intended uses.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.170
So we've actually backed off
from time to time on the

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:05.090
environmental benefit of some
of our new fabrics, when it

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.310
turned out that those fabrics
didn't perform

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.220
as well as the others.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.620
So it's really complicated.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.430
VINCENT STANLEY: Yeah.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.985
Nice jacket.

00:35:13.985 --> 00:35:17.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.130
You made some really interesting
points regarding

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.130
the jacket, like you take so
many pounds of whatever to

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.030
generate it.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.830
And all these statistics and
these numbers, you have to

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.600
have people who are
calculating them.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.350
I'm wondering what does that
look like on your team?

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.770
Do you have a team of
sustainability people?

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.960
How does Patagonia go about
getting those numbers?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.700
And just like in general, for
people who are interested in

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.460
that field, what advice
would you have?

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.580
VINCENT STANLEY: There's
two questions in those.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.290
The first one, we
have a very--

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:51.080
until now, we've had two people
internally who handled

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.030
the environmental issues
at Patagonia, and

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.780
we've added a third.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.390
And we purposely keep it small
so that we try and divide that

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:04.080
work up and make it part of the
DNA of the company in all

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.330
of the divisions.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.070
We have not done a lot of formal
life cycle analysis

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.940
work, which is very expensive.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.580
But there are tricks
we can do.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.860
For instance, we can look at--

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.640
our underwear has the same
kind of inputs across 200

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.560
different styles.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.780
So we can calculate the metrics
for that, and then

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.260
apply it to the line.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.950
But what we're going to do now
is we're going to adopt the

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.130
Hig methodology.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.250
And that has been established.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:43.990
Nike developed a tool that was
kind of the ancestor of this.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.860
And the outdoor industry
developed an eco-index that

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.850
was the ancestry of this.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.820
So we'll use an industry-wide
tool, which is going to be

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.410
very useful for the consumer,
because all the companies are

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:58.890
dealing with the same numbers.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:04.130
And that provides kind of
parallel information.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:08.100
And then the second
question is--

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.070
it was an interesting
question.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.480
I was talking to the
sustainability manager at the

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.780
Gap this morning.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.960
And for people who are
interested in the issue of

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.530
sustainability, the main thing
is what kind of work do you

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.600
actually love to do?

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.370
Because we need people who
have an interest in

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.260
sustainability or responsibility
in accounting,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.680
in manufacturing, in IT.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.160
And those things kind
of come first.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.460
The actual core set of
skills comes first.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.550
And then sustainability
comes second.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.160
Kind of the last point,
I've been

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.880
talking to a lot of colleges.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.240
And until five years ago, there
were no sustainability

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.910
programs in schools.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.070
Now they're in every business
school and in

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.790
every design school.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.870
And this is going to make a
tremendous difference, I

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.980
think, in five to ten years.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.960
But for now, most companies--

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.000
Patagonia, in spite of the fact
that we were started by

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.100
climbers and surfers, you
can look at the various

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.650
subcultures in our company.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.360
The people who work in textiles
came out of Duke or

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.200
University of North Carolina.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.150
The people in accounting,
they look different.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:24.500
They came out of MBA programs.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.460
And nobody had any

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.760
sustainability in their training.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.140
So the language of each
profession does not have that

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.830
built in yet into its work.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:38.690
And I think it will be in
another five or ten years as

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:42.510
these people graduate from
programs and then get jobs.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.880
AUDIENCE: I was just curious,
when you were talking about

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.150
how a while ago you went from
giving 10% to 1% and how it

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.440
was very based on grassroots,
smaller companies, what is the

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.310
difference between what you did
then and what you do now

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.870
with the 1%.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.460
I mean, I know there are a lot
of other companies that do the

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.230
1% for the environment
or giving back.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.860
But I mean, there's just such
a plethora of environmental

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:11.960
organizations, grassroots or
larger, such a wide scale of

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.920
ones that actually give back and
ones that don't, I mean,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.060
how do you even begin to
pick different ones?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.120
Or do you hear a lot
of similar ones?

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.260
What's that process like?

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.950
VINCENT STANLEY: We have a team
that awards the grants.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.890
We have a grant application
process, and then employees

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.830
elect people to a particular
team that considers the grant

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.930
applications and then makes
the decisions each year.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.600
We haven't had a fundamental
change in how we give the

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.620
money as it's grown.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.610
But I think now we're
at the point--

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.680
for a while we were giving to
300 different organizations.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.230
And now we're giving
to about 750.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.650
And at a certain point, we're
going to reach a kind of

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.390
plateau where we have to kind of
question and look at how we

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.070
give grants and what kinds
of organizations.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:07.860
But for now, it's been focused
for 30 years on these small

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:12.660
grassroots organizations working
very specifically to

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.200
save or restore particular
habitat.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.360
Thanks.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.770
I'm curious about your thoughts
on third party

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.310
industry certifications.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.300
So you mentioned the
industry-led effort with

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.580
Walmart for sustainability
efforts.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.990
I had thought these were a great
thing, and then recently

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:33.650
learned in one of the factory
fires that happened in--

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.600
I'm not sure if it was in
Bangladesh or Pakistan that

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.270
they actually had been
certified by Social

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.090
Accountability International.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.240
And they had all the proper
certifications, which is a bit

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.080
disappointing, since they're one
of the ones that actually

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.840
seemed legitimate
and independent.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.370
So I was just wondering if you
think this is a good approach

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.540
to having industry compliance
for social and

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.000
environmental efforts?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.060
VINCENT STANLEY: Thanks.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.420
I think it's absolutely
necessary.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.650
But we work with the Fair Labor

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.840
Association to vet the factories.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.710
But it's kind of a problem in
that you are relying on a

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.960
report card system, where you
have people going in and

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.520
auditing practices.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.140
And it's not really systemic.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.220
It's kind of based on a
kind of police work.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.590
And that's how I think you could
get a situation like

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:35.210
that, the horrific fire
in Bangladesh.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.380
It's also a complication.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:44.040
The first question I had about
moving things offshore, the

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.720
larger your supply chain and
the more distant it is, the

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.270
more risk you have with problems
like this or the

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.340
harder and more expensive they
are to deal with it.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.300
So one of the things we've done
is to really condense

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.360
from over 115 factories.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.980
We now only deal with 45
cut and sew factories.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:09.380
So that enables even our work
with FLA to audit more

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.620
frequently or to keep a closer
tab on what the practices are.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.580
But it's not a foolproof--

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.370
third party auditing
is necessary.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.480
It's terrific.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.990
If you didn't have it, companies
would not have the

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:26.880
capability to go in and
do this on their own.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.845
But it's by no means
the total answer.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.490
The Hig Index, by the way, may
help because that includes

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.170
social as well as environmental
factors.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:45.470
And so any time you're making
decisions upfront, you have

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.770
much more interesting and
stronger results than when

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.340
you're dealing with
a report card

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.840
situation on the back end.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you again, one
of the things I really love

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.980
about Patagonia is the
repair policy.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.370
So if my jacket had a hole in
it, the zipper's broken, I

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.570
sent it in, and you
guys fixed it.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.260
How are you influencing--

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.490
from now, it's so disposable,
that you're going back to kind

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.500
of the old way, where
we fix things.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.720
Are you influencing others,
and what is the business?

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.150
Is there any business
around it?

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.000
Why do you do it?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.485
And are you influencing
other vendors to

00:43:24.485 --> 00:43:25.290
just follow your footsteps?

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.760
Because I personally always
tell people--

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.010
I just told my friend today,
you like my jacket?

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.100
It's a Patagonia jacket.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.134
And I said you guys--

00:43:34.134 --> 00:43:36.980
there's something broken and
I return it and fixed it.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:42.390
And so it is more, but I
get a lot longer use.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.210
I'm not sure if it's cheaper
in the long term?

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.795
I don't know how--

00:43:45.795 --> 00:43:48.050
but basically, could you just go
to the original question is

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.100
why do you do it and are you
influencing other vendors?

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.350
VINCENT STANLEY: Thanks.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.420
First, a very quick thing,
if you talk about an

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.650
environmental impact of
anything that's made,

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.870
durability is a major issue.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.150
If it lasts, if it's good in the
first place, and it lasts

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.530
a long time, you're going a
long way to pay back the

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.140
planet for the harm you did in
the making of that product.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.540
So we like to make things
that are long lasting.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.200
And then as part of a-- we have
a program called Common

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.700
Threads in which we look
at the four basic Rs--

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.640
first, reduce consumption;
second, repair;

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.990
and third is reuse.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.070
We're encouraging customers if
you're not wearing a product,

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.670
take it out of your closet,
give it away,

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.500
or sell it on eBay.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.340
And then the last is we take
back anything for recycling.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.770
So repair is an important
function.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.110
It's important for us as
designers to make things that

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.120
are repairable.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.370
And there have been times we've
made some outerwear with

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.890
zippers that's kind
of tough to redo.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:03.390
We've reduced the repair time
from the customer to our Reno

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.280
warehouse to make
sure that people

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.870
pursue that as an option.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.030
Because we found that people,
when we had an eight week

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.370
turnaround for repairs, we'd
end up giving somebody a

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.620
jacket rather than making them
wait that long, if it was a

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.560
new product that
had a problem.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.480
AUDIENCE: I think that's really
great, especially like

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.050
the eBay one.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.370
I think that's really
innovative.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.910
It's like if you look at other
vendors, they don't support

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.030
reselling your good on eBay.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.970
They say, well, no, you've
got to buy it from

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.760
the store brand new.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.960
You can't buy on-- they don't
support a secondary market.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.830
And I thought that
was really bold.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.730
And I think it is really great
for sustainability.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.320
VINCENT STANLEY: Thanks.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.320
We're starting in our stores.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.600
We have a second-hand aisle in
the Portland store that we

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.630
started called the
second home.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.560
AUDIENCE: So I guess I'll wrap
it up with one final question.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.050
So you're looking at Patagonia
as a company, how do you

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.540
promote and continue your
culture as you expand?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.770
And how do you make sure that
employees can work on these

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.010
interesting projects, like you
mentioned the Common Threads

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.690
initiative?

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.380
VINCENT STANLEY: I think--

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.690
I haven't had a chance to talk
to a lot of people here, but I

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:18.320
know that you have your program
about taking 20% of

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.080
the time to work on projects
that you feel personally

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.410
interested in.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.660
And we don't have
a formal program

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.770
like that at Patagonia.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.010
But I think that there's a
strong sense in the culture

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.360
that that's possible, that
people can work on something

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.970
that's very close to them, that
they'll find allies, and

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.580
that they'll get support.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.880
So I think that's an important
element in

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.340
keeping the culture going.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.580
The second thing that's,
I think, very

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.646
important for us is--

00:46:49.646 --> 00:46:51.810
I was talking to some
folks at lunch.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.700
There was a time when the
Chouinards, who own all the

00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.160
stock, I think, were
ready to sell.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.940
And the advantage to them is
they could have solved the

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.080
company for x number of
dollars, created an

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.990
environmental foundation, and
given away a lot more money

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:14.290
every year than we do
now as a company.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.350
But part of the reason they
wanted to keep the company is

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:21.400
because we can be an example.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.180
If we function as a
profit-making company and can

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.720
be respected by other companies
for the work we do

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.900
as a business, and at the same
time we choose to do certain

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.380
things because we get interested
in them first, or

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.120
we're motivated to do them for
reasons that have nothing to

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.530
do with profit, but we can show
that a business can do

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.940
it, that's a tremendous
advantage.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.090
And that's an advantage you
don't get from just having a

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.110
foundation.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.620
So that's really critical
to our mission.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.070
So the first part is build the
best product, cause no

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.240
unnecessary harm.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.680
And the last is use business
to inspire and implement

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.180
solutions to the environmental
crisis.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.950
And so that's why we're
in business.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:09.520
And I think as long as we stay
focused that way, we won't

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.680
have any trouble attracting and
retaining good folks, even

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.340
though our volleyball courts
are not as nice as yours.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:21.765
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:23.960
Well, on that note, Vincent,
thank you very much for

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.330
speaking with us today.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.350
VINCENT STANLEY: Thank
you very much.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.600
Thanks for your questions.
