00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.373
- This season is
so fucking good,

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.941
 it is the best season so far,

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:10.676
 it's gonna be like
 the joy that we need

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.279
in this evil moment in history.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.082
 Welcome to (bleep)'s America.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.785
 - We had infused this new tone

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.919
 throughout this season

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
to reflect what happened
in the election,

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:24.524
 and so we were going
 to be saying his name,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.059
 and talking about him,
 because we felt like

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.061 size:84% position:42%
  these characters, they're
  gonna be talking about it

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.796 size:88% position:44%
 and dealing with it
 just like we are.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.765 size:84% position:42%
  And it also felt right
  to just not say his name.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:33.733 align:start position:0%
 We don't wanna say his name.
 - Yeah, we're just

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.001
sitting around talking about it,

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:37.637 size:84% position:42%
  and we're like,
  "Ecch, ew, gross.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.173 size:88% position:44%
  He sucks. He's so hateful,

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.942 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I don't even wanna
 fucking say his name."

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:46.145
 - I'm sure some people hate
 that we're bleeping his name.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.047 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, I just don't
  think they watch the show.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.415
 - Yes, I don't think
 they watch the show.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't think those
 people wanna see

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.285 size:84% position:42%
  two women be like gnarly.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - They don't wanna
 see two women at all.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:54.587
- (laughs) Yeah.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.822
Get me back to New York,

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start size:88% position:13%
 where everybody
 hates Donald (bleep)

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.058
 - My name's Angelique Clark,

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm the production
designer of Broad City.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.597
 A really fun idea that Ilana
 had was to do a headboard

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
 out of protest
 signs and stickers.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I also put some
 protest posters in,

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.737 align:start size:88% position:13%
you know, just as if
they went and protested,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.306 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then they, like,
 kept the signs,

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.342
 anything anti-(bleep).

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.544
 - You don't know how
 much you need that.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.881
 New York is totally different
 in the winter and the summer.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.082
 - Interesting how
 many different coats

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.550
 you can wear at once.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.452 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The winter's intense,
it's a dark time.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.489 size:84% position:42%
  - We were missing a whole
  other side of the city.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.623
 Could we put the top back up?

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.493
- It's frozen in place. I tried.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.027 size:88% position:44%
  When you have a good night

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.963 size:88% position:44%
  in the winter in New York,
  you're, like, so grateful,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.533
 'cause you're just like mostly
 just working, and drinking.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.001 align:start size:88% position:13%
And drinking just makes
you more depressed.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.537
It's horrible. We deal
with winter depression,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.005 size:88% position:44%
 which is very real.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.942 size:84% position:42%
  Every winter, all
  winter. And fall.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.380 size:88% position:44%
 And, like, uh, the
 end of summer, too.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.183
Well I wanted to do one
more, like, smaller.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:00.153 size:88% position:44%
  We've wanted to experience
  directing, it's awesome.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.654 size:84% position:42%
  We're each directing two.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.123
 It really is, like this final
 puzzle piece is clicking in.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.359
 - You have to be in
 the scene as an actor,

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.061 size:88% position:44%
  but also conscious of the
  whole scene as a director,

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:12.365
so it's different, but
I really like it so far.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.533 size:84% position:42%
  Whether we're in
  the scene or not,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.668 align:start size:88% position:13%
the other person's
always in Video Village

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.670
 making sure the scene
 goes the way we want,

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:19.505
and they're like giving
pitches or thoughts.

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.208 size:84% position:42%
  - And Lilly Burns, one of
  our executive producers,

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.709 align:start size:88% position:13%
 we have such a
 shorthand with her,

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:26.245 size:88% position:44%
 so if we're both on screen
 and one of us is directing,

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.614
Lilly's this, like, set of eyes

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.751 size:88% position:44%
 that is like one of
 us. It's awesome.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:36.189 size:84% position:42%
  - You gonna tell
  'em about Leanne?

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.225 align:start position:0%
  (laughs) Okay, there is
  this Easter egg of a joke.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:42.728 size:84% position:42%
  We walk into this karaoke
  bar to follow this guy.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.932 align:start position:0%
 There's a man singing a
 song that's called "Leanne."

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.536 size:88% position:44%
 - ♪ Leanne, We are Leanne ♪

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.806
- It is a song that we made up,

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
and our music supervisor
Matt FX produced.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.545 align:start size:75% position:25%
- One more time.
♪ Lee ♪

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.981
 - [Together] ♪ Ann ♪

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:06.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
 ♪ I am Lee Ann.
 We're all Lee Ann. ♪

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.121
 Something like that.

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:10.556
(laughs)

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.427 align:start position:0%
 - (laughs) And it plays
 throughout the entire season.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.897 size:84% position:42%
  On the radio, in cabs, it
  plays the entire season.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.131 size:84% position:42%
  - In "Mushrooms,"
  when Abbi's like,

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:22.668 size:88% position:44%
 changing the music
 and, like, nervous.

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.003 size:84% position:42%
  - (sighs)

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:24.870
It goes,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.107
- [Together] ♪ Lee Ann ♪

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.377
 - ♪ Lee Ann ♪

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.248 size:88% position:44%
  - ♪ I am Lee Ann ♪

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.383
 - ♪ We are Lee Ann ♪

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.651 size:88% position:44%
  - (laughs) It's so stupid.

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [RuPaul] Kick fuck me.
Put your fuckin' foot

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.556
in my god damn pussy. You know?

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.027
 - Start again.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.232 align:start size:88% position:13%
 (laughs) This is such
 a dream come true.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.969 align:start position:0%
  Working with RuPaul
  Charles was such a dream.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.972 align:start position:0%
- I think the character is
more stern than Ru actually is.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.308 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - And also containing
 him into, like,

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:03.843
 the manager of a restaurant,

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:07.213 size:84% position:42%
  I've been watching RuPaul
  on TV for my entire life.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.180
 - [Brenda] (groaning in pain)

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.882
- Brenda, I'm so sorry.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:13.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You did it on
purpose, you bitch. Ow.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:17.456 line:0%
 - It's always great
 to see the evolution

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.225 line:0%
 with women in comedy.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.961 align:start position:0% line:0%
  - It's so exciting
  working with these women.

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:25.131
 - I studied her as a
 kid and a comedy nerd,

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.833 align:start size:88% position:13%
she kept throwing in,
like, surprising improv.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.335
 She's amazing.

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.103 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - As fate would have it,
  today we have Shania Twain

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.238 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 as a guest.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:35.074
 - Man, I feel like a smoothie.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - She was so funny,
 she was so down

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.445
to play with herself as an icon.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:40.713 size:84% position:42%
  She like riffs this song.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start size:88% position:13%
- ♪ When there's a spark
you gotta ride it. ♪

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.017
 - ♪ Dow naw. ♪

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.155 align:start size:88% position:13%
- ♪ When you're in love,
don't hide it. Ooh! ♪

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.292
 - [Together] I love "Friends."

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.994
 - I'm such a Chandler.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.862 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - I'm such a Ross.
  - Total Rachel.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:58.364
 Little Gunther, also.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:01.534 align:start position:0%
  Trey Pucker is the lead
  character on "Broad City."

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.336
 The show, obviously,
 is about a trainer

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.004 size:88% position:44%
 and his life and struggles.

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.106 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And yeah, it's a show,
 I think that shows

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.543 align:start position:0%
 what life is like in New
 York for a healthy fit man,

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.245
and two women he knows.

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:14.880 size:88% position:44%
 - You threw a glass
 bowl into traffic?

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.449 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh yeah, done and done.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.417 align:start position:0%
  - When I started, you
  know, it was sort of like

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.121 align:start position:0%
 first wave of post-feminist
 ideas in comedy

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:24.357
and doing work that was
not self-deprecating,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.858
 that was not cliche.

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:28.127
 Each generation takes
 it to another level.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.130 align:start position:0%
  It's really impressive and
  important and exciting.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.966 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - It's good to see
 just how they've grown

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.670
 as actors, as business
 women, as creators.

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:40.172
- There's a feeling on
the set, you feel free,

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.875
 you feel safe, so it's
 a pleasure being here.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.244 align:start position:0% line:0%
 - It means a lot to people,
 and I think it's cool

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:48.681 size:84% position:42%
  to have two women who are
  just fucking hilarious

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.282 size:84% position:42%
  crushing the comedy game.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:51.550
 - It's great because
 the show is written

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.553
 by a small group of us
 who are really close,

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:56.355 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and who are all
 friends, and I think

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:57.556 size:88% position:44%
 when people watch the show,

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.191 align:start size:88% position:13%
 one of the things they
 like most about it

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:00.659 size:88% position:44%
  is how authentic it feels,

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.495 size:84% position:42%
  because Abbi and Ilana
  are really close friends.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.464 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- Broad City was my
first big gig. You know?

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:06.766 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And after that,
 other stuff has come.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:08.768
But, like, I haven't
found a sense of family

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.469 align:start size:88% position:13%
or a sense of belonging
like I do here.

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:11.670
 You know what I mean?

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:13.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
- My love for you is
sometimes inappropriate.

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start size:75% position:25%
I love you.
- Love you too.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.674
- Keep me posted (kiss)

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:16.509
Love ya.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:17.777 size:84% position:42%
  - I love you too.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.512
 - Some people you are
 just destined to meet

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.813
 and fall in love with.

00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:22.148 size:84% position:42%
