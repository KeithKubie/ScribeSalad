SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Good afternoon.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.105
My name is Sridhar
Ramaswamy, I'm

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:18.820
the SVP for ads and
payments at Google.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.520
As you saw in [? Sundar's ?]
keynote in the morning,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.910
the Android platform
has tremendous momentum.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.010
And today I'm very
pleased to tell you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.380
about the next
generation of payments

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.377
that we are going to
be doing on Android.

00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:37.960
Of course, it's 3:00
in the afternoon,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.975
and we wanted to perk you
guys up to start with,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.090
so we thought we would start
by showing a funny picture

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.322
of cute babies or cute cats.

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:50.190
We did a lot of research
and went with cute babies.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
But we realized we could
also use this picture

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.810
to make a really
important point, which

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.060
is last year four times as
many Android devices were sold

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.841
every day as were babies born.

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:10.340
Our activation
numbers are something

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.980
like a million and a
half devices activated

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.010
every single day.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.660
That's, like, some babies
with a lot of phones.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.390
And what's also amazing
about the rise of smartphones

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.950
in general is the
tremendous engagement

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.820
that consumers have
with these devices.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.800
The average consumer takes their
phones out 150 times a day.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.950
That's close to 10
for every waking hour.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.550
And these devices, which
not so long ago were just

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.930
simple things for
making phone calls,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.010
have almost become
extensions of ourselves.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.120
Close to 2/3 of us
sleep with our phones

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.190
right next to our bed.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.940
It's the first thing
I touch every morning

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.320
to turn off my alarm.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.360
And through the day we use our
phones for texting our loved

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.740
ones, looking up directions,
checking up on traffic,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.820
seeing what the weather's like,
being amused and entertained,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.622
buying stuff online,
the list goes on and on.

00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:19.640
And in fact, we are all more
likely to check to make sure

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.090
that we have our
phones in our pockets

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.400
when we leave our home
than we are to check

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.920
for our wallet or our keys.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.360
That's pretty amazing.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.340
But there is one thing that
we do not yet commonly do

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.010
as consumers, and that is
pay for physical purchases

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.779
with our phones.

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:51.690
Four years ago, we
pioneered a technology

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.540
to store payment
credentials securely

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.550
on the phone using a
technology called Near Field

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.980
Communication, or NFC.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.620
We also pioneered a scheme by
which these credentials could

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.670
be securely transmitted to
merchant point of sale devices

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.670
to complete the payment.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.070
We called the
scheme tap and pay.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.840
And we are excited
today because we

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.820
think the overall
ecosystem is at a point

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.370
that these payments can
achieve massive scale.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.130
Why do we say that?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.420
We think the current world is
ready, both at a consumer level

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.340
and at a merchant level,
and these are two really,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.590
really important prerequisites
for any large scale

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.150
change to happen in a
complicated and important world

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.920
like payments.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.530
To start with, on
the consumer side,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.320
seven out of ten Android
devices in use today

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.125
are already capable of
making NFC payments.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.400
These are phones that
are out there today,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.610
being used by people.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.600
And pretty much every
new Android device

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.260
that ships is also
capable of NFC payments.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.340
And this means
that consumers can

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.160
go buy new Android phones
knowing that mobile payments

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.860
just is there.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.850
They come along for the ride.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.070
And then on the
merchant side, there

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.120
are over 700,000
merchant locations

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.610
that can accept tap
and pay payments.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.040
And in fact, here's an amazing
little map of all the locations

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.790
where people are using Android
phones to tap and pay today.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.050
And further, the merchant
ecosystem in the US

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.740
is in the midst of an
upgrade cycle with respect

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.190
to all of their point
of sale devices.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.100
That is going to provide
better security for all of us

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.370
as consumers, but
also these devices

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.740
will be capable of
accepting NFC payments.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.590
We really think that it is the
confluence of a huge number

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.630
of devices-- consumer
devices-- in use,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.450
new ones that are coming out
being capable of making NFC

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.480
payments, and the
fact that there

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.080
is going to be a tremendous
upsurge in the number

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.190
of merchant terminals that
can accept NFC payments that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.625
makes this a right moment
for big changes to happen.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.930
So we've been working to
create support for payments

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.000
at a core platform
level in Android.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.430
And as you heard earlier,
we call this Android Pay.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.550
So Android Pay will be built
deep within the Android

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.510
ecosystem, and it
is going to serve

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.090
as the glue between
consumers and merchants.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.990
And we had a few core principles
that we adopted for Android

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.565
Pay, and those were simplicity.

00:06:29.565 --> 00:06:33.700
It should be really easy
for all consumers to use.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.200
It should be secure.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.900
There's a lot of doubt
and worry that we

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.250
have about the constant
stream of breaking news

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.740
that we all keep hearing.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.400
And there should be
choice for consumers,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.070
in terms of the devices that
they use, in terms of the apps

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.440
that they could use in order
to make these payments.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.630
And Android Pay is
going to be the solution

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.100
both for physical payments at
stores but also for payments

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.480
within the apps that we all
have on our Android phones.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.920
So it's going to solve the
problem of mobile payments

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.710
in a pretty comprehensive way.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.250
I'm very pleased to
welcome Ariel Bardin, who

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.630
is the Product Vice President
for Payments at Google,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.810
and Pali Bhat, the Director of
Consumer Payments at Google,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.510
to tell us a lot more
about Android Pay.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.210
Ariel, Pali?

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.485
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.282
ARIEL BARDIN:
Thank you, Sridhar.

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:31.593
PALI BHAT: Thanks, Sridhar.

00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:32.592
ARIEL BARDIN: Thank you.

00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:36.600
So we're very excited
to be here today

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.210
to share some more
information about Android Pay.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.530
We're going to have some fun.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:46.200
Pali's going to lead us in some
demos, which will all work.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.010
Yes, a lot of--

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.005
PALI BHAT: You've all got to
cross your fingers for me.

00:07:50.005 --> 00:07:51.880
ARIEL BARDIN: We don't
need to cross fingers.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.620
Everything's going to be fine.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.350
PALI BHAT: Yeah.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.780
ARIEL BARDIN: All right.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.613
No crossing fingers.

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:56.610
All right, back to business.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.910
So Sridhar talked about
a few core principles

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.600
that we had when
we designed Android

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.550
Pay along with our many
partners in the ecosystem.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.020
The first is simplicity,
second is security, and choice.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.470
So let's talk through all these.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.570
And let's focus specifically
on the real world, tap and pay,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.640
and we'll talk
next about in-app.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.190
Simplicity.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.730
We want to unlock our
phone, tap, and be done,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.220
and that should be
a very easy process.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.870
And of course, credit cards
and debit cards need to work.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.210
We need to be able to use them
very easily on our phones.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.110
But we didn't want
to stop there.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:40.000
When you talk to users, they
do other things at the store

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.380
when they actually check out.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.650
Some will use a gift card,
some will use a loyalty card,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.550
and some will use coupons.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.560
So we want to take all
of this information

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.210
and pass it during
the tap, make it very,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.760
very simple for users to use it.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.250
We'll start with loyalty.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.230
And Pali will show us a really
cool demo with that machine

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.440
that I'm assuming you're
wondering why it's here.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.860
He'll show us how
we can integrate

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.960
both a payment and
loyalty information right

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.150
within one tap and make it very,
very easy and simple to use.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.060
Let's talk about security.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.600
As Sridhar said, nobody wants
to have problems with their card

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.870
number after a purchase
and worry about it.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.290
So we partnered with
the financial networks,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.890
the payments networks,
to adopt tokenization

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.830
so that we don't have to
store the actual credit card

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.650
information on the
phone, and I'll

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.100
talk about that a
little bit in a moment.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.520
The second thing
we do is we look

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.260
at over 100 signals
with our own risk engine

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.510
before we let a
transaction go through

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.000
and when a card is
added to the phone.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.317
So we've got a
software solution,

00:10:00.317 --> 00:10:02.400
but we don't stop there,
we also look at hardware.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.760
And as you heard in
the keynote, starting

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.910
with the M release
of Android we will

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.810
support fingerprint
authentication

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.360
as well to really bring the
hardware and the software

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.300
together and provide a
great level of security

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.030
for our users.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.296
So the third key principle
that Sridhar talked about that

00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:24.920
was kind of core to
the way we designed

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.090
Android Pay was choice.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.510
In Android, we have a
principal of openness.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.120
We love a lot of innovation.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.035
It's that exciting?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.620
Your phone jumped
out of your lap.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.555
Make sure the credit
card is in it, please.

00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:45.180
So where was I?

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.090
Yes.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.080
So we like innovation.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.452
We want to have open systems.

00:10:48.452 --> 00:10:50.410
Having open systems drives
a lot of innovation,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.300
it's good for users.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.095
Users like choice.

00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:54.595
So when you think
about tap and pay,

00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:56.510
there has to be hardware
that actually supports it,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.950
and almost all phones today--
all Android phones today--

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.560
have the hardware needed
to actually do a tap.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.650
In 2012, we added a layer on
top of that as part of KitKat

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.779
called host card emulation.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:12.820
What host card emulation
did was allow developers

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.730
to access that hardware so
that they could build apps

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.590
on top of tap and pay,
or they could also

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.850
use the hardware
for other use cases,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.494
like opening doors, et cetera.

00:11:24.494 --> 00:11:25.910
What we're doing
with Android Pay,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.950
though, is we're introducing
a new layer, an API, which

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.650
will allow developers-- approved
developers-- to get access

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.980
to the same tokenization
services that we use to power

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.760
tap and pay.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.990
So think of this as a new
layer on top of the raw iron.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.480
What this means for users is
that they can use the Android

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.200
Pay app to make payments--
set up their cards,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.710
pick which card
they want to use,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.930
all that good
stuff-- or they can

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:02.720
use one of approved partner
apps, bank apps, et cetera.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.585
And Pali will be
showing a demo of how

00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:05.835
that'll work in a few minutes.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.770
Now, that's a lot to do.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.360
It's not easy.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.710
And the famous saying
is, it takes a village,

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.660
and it certainly takes
a village in this case.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.570
So let's talk
about all the folks

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.010
that we're working with
across the payments ecosystem

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.240
that Sridhar referenced before.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.650
So first, we're
working with carriers

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.460
to make sure that all users
can get access to Android Pay

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.470
easily.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.750
We're working with AT&amp;T,
Verizon, and T-Mobile,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.210
so that when you buy
a new Android phone,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.320
it'll come preloaded
with Android Pay.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.810
But we don't stop there.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.510
When you walk into
the store, you

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.940
should walk out with Android
Pay set up, ready to go.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.070
So the sales people
in the stores

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.840
will be able to
help users set up

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.750
their phones with
Android Pay, add

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.740
the relevant cards, et cetera.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.630
Now, Android Pay will work
on any carrier's phone that

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.630
has KitKat, and there's tens
of millions of these phones,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.290
and more and more every day, as
the babies illustrated earlier.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.480
The second folks we partnered
with are the payment networks.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.740
And the payment networks
helped us with tokenization,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.870
that I mentioned before,
and what tokenization

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.780
allows us to do is not store
your credit card number

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.300
on the phone, but rather
give it to the networks

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.270
and get back a virtual account
number that we can securely

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.260
store on the phone.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.935
So that's a critical
part of Android Pay

00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:50.387
and how it works, and
this partnership is

00:13:50.387 --> 00:13:51.470
extremely important to us.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.360
We're also working with the
leading financial institutions,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.770
so you can securely use your
existing debit and credit

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.170
cards along with Android Pay.

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:11.300
And actually, before
I go to the merchants,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.360
we have a bunch of
these folks in the room,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.070
and I have a note that
tells me who's here.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.750
So I'd like to see
a show of hands.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.990
This will be like
a trick question.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.470
I believe we have
USAA in the audience?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.190
All right.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:28.481
Thank you.

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:28.980
Discover?

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.490
Yeah.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:32.990
PNC?

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.105
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:37.630
US Bank?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.590
All right.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.818
MasterCard?

00:14:40.818 --> 00:14:42.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:42.042 --> 00:14:45.000
I've seen James earlier.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.700
Navy Federal Credit Union?

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.200
Whoo.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.640
American Express.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.260
I know Nick and
Tony are right here.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.520
Regents?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.830
Welcome.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.328
Bank of America?

00:14:59.328 --> 00:15:01.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.300
And Visa.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.748
I've seen Matt here.

00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:05.041
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:05.540
Great.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.620
So really, a big
thanks to these guys

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.310
for working closely with us for
months now to get us to this

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.834
point.

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:14.500
So we're also partnering
with merchants,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.330
because when you
have your phone you

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.705
want to be able
to go into stores

00:15:16.705 --> 00:15:21.200
and actually tap
and use the phone.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.261
Sridhar mentioned there are
700,000 locations already.

00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:26.135
These are some of the
great partners we have.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.229
So to summarize
the first part, we

00:15:33.229 --> 00:15:35.770
really think that now is a time
that mobile payments can take

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.570
off, and Android Pay and
Android's scale and being part

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.250
of the Android ecosystem
and Android system

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.990
is going to be a great
boost for mobile payments.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.570
And with that,
I'd like to invite

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:54.060
Pali to do a couple of fun,
successful, wonderful demos.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.930
PALI BHAT: Awesome.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.690
Yeah.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.880
Regardless of what
Ariel told you,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.010
you can cross your
fingers now so

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.494
that everything goes perfectly.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:02.160
I'm just joking.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.250
This is all going to work great.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.270
So first of all, thank
you all for coming.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.080
It's a packed house here, of
course, with our partners,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.800
and lots of other folks
who are interested in this.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.270
And I'm super excited
to be showing you

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.900
Android Pay in action for
the very, very first time.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.037
So, very, very excited.

00:16:24.037 --> 00:16:25.620
Can you cut to the
WolfVision, please?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.590
So what you have here
is a payment terminal

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.630
from our partners at
Ingenico, and I'm just

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.470
going to go ahead and charge
myself for something fun.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.960
A specialty cocktail sounds
just right right now.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.060
So as you can see, they
have a cool Android Pay

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.030
logo on the terminal as well.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.770
And I have Android Pay
loaded on this phone,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:03.897
and so all I have
to do to pay is tap.

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:04.980
And this is the best part.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.710
What we did, as
Sridhar talked about,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.010
is we've integrated this
entire process of Android Pay

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:18.000
with paying right into
the Android platform.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.390
And all I have to do to
make a secure payment

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.329
is unlock this device.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.230
OK?

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.790
So it's that simple.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.839
So it's secure, but it's simple.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.580
So what I'm going to go ahead
and do is enter my pattern.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.650
Everybody can close
their eyes now.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.990
It's OK, you can watch.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.560
I'm going to change my
pattern right after this demo.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560
OK?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.090
So now all I have to
do is tap and I'm done.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.730
OK?

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.090
That simple.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.548
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.560
And of course you
get a notification

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.260
right away on your device
when you make a purchase.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.016
So it's simple and it's secure.

00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:08.000
But as Ariel was
talking about, payments

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.600
don't usually end with just
paying with your card, right?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.750
You usually use loyalty cards,
or coupons, or gift cards

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.110
at the point of sale as well.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:23.576
And so we wanted to figure out
how we solve for that as well.

00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:27.290
I don't know about all of you,
but I, frankly, love rewards,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.950
and I never miss a chance to
use a loyalty card or an offer

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.380
to save some money.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.980
And it turns out loyalty
programs are super

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.660
popular in the United States.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.050
At last count, there were
3.3 billion loyalty program

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.490
memberships in the US.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.553
That's a staggering
29 per household.

00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:51.090
29.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.140
So it looks like
there's more than just

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.630
me that loves loyalty
cards and rewards.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.880
So we wanted to help
out with Android Pay.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.170
There has been a problem with
all of these loyalty cards,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.380
is that no one
likes-- including me--

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.670
no one likes carrying
around a bunch of plastic.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.030
So what we've done is taken all
of this loyalty information,

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.190
offer information, built
it into Android Pay

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.870
so it just works seamlessly.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.180
So the best way to
show what I mean

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.190
is to actually do
another live demo.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.000
This time we're going to make it
a little bit more complicated.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.443
So I'm going to get an assist
from our friends at Coca Cola.

00:19:30.443 --> 00:19:32.870
To do that, let me
welcome Michelle,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.579
who's the CIO of Coca Cola
North America, onstage.

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:37.079
Michelle?

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:37.954
MICHELLE ROUTH: Pali.

00:19:37.954 --> 00:19:41.071
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.830
Hi everyone.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.300
I'm Michelle Routh, and I'm
the CIO for Coca Cola North

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.270
America.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.470
And at Coca Cola we want to
bring our Coca Cola products

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.872
to consumers wherever
they want them,

00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:54.830
so we've been building
out a network of vending

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.140
machines across the nation.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.930
In fact, we have
85,000 vending machines

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.630
that are tap and ready today.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.270
In addition, we also
want to make sure

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.130
that we reward our
most loyal consumers,

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.500
so we have created a loyalty
program called My Coke Rewards,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.210
and we've activated that
program at vending machines

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:19.240
to give you one free Coke for
every 10 products purchased.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.580
And My Coke Rewards has
been a huge success.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.310
In the United States, we have
one out of every six households

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.130
are members.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.170
So while tapping and
paying is really easy,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.230
using a plastic My Coke
Rewards credit card

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.790
at a vending machine to
redeem or earn loyalty points

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.520
has been so cumbersome.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.250
So we're so excited
to be using Android

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.130
pay to provide a simplified
user experience for consumers

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.740
to purchase products,
and bring the payment

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.545
and loyalty together as one.

00:20:50.545 --> 00:20:52.420
PALI BHAT: So Michelle,
all this talk of Coke

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.980
is making me very thirsty.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.688
MICHELLE ROUTH: Well,
Pali, why don't you

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:57.491
go get yourself a Coke?

00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:59.240
PALI BHAT: Apparently
one of Michelle's is

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.850
85,000 vending machines is
right here on the stage.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.020
Super convenient, huh?

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.880
It's amazing how we
plan all this stuff.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.030
So let's go and buy it.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.810
I already told you guys, right?

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.420
I love rewards.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.420
So I want to make sure that my
My Coke Rewards card is already

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.320
saved to Android Pay.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.750
So if we can cut to
the WolfVision again?

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.520
Let's just do a quick check.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.600
So I'm going to go to
my Android Pay app.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.920
And, sure, there's a My
Coke Rewards card on there,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.340
and it also tells you
that I have 27 points.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.370
I don't know if
you can see this.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.410
So try to zoom in, and it
shows you 27 points there.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:46.260
That's not quite enough for
actually getting a free Coke.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.490
But at the rate I'm
going, I'm going

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.490
to get there very, very soon.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.070
So why don't we go
ahead and actually

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.230
try making a purchase at this
Coke vending machine out there.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.730
Michelle?

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.640
So if we can cut
to the camera here.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.710
So, Coke vending machine.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.770
It's one of the
85,000 that Michelle

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.950
talked about that are enabled
for tap and pay payment.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.380
So what I'm going
to do right now

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.620
is try to make an
actual purchase.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.639
So just so you guys all know,
this is a real transaction.

00:22:24.639 --> 00:22:27.055
What's going to happen right
now is my payment information

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.500
is going to get transferred
to the vending machine.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.032
It's connected to the internet.

00:22:31.032 --> 00:22:34.000
It's going to actually
authorize my payment right now.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.380
It's a live transaction.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.110
I'm going to go
ahead, make a payment.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.030
And absolutely amazing,
is that it's actually

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.780
passed my loyalty information
as well, My Coke Rewards.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.110
So first time you're watching
a transaction go through

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.940
with both loyalty information
and payment information

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.680
to this vending machine, doing
an authorization in real time.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.370
If you can focus
on this right now?

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.090
So it tells you that
I have 27 points.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.270
It's going to give me
another three points,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.670
and I'm going to be
ready for a free drink.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.710
So this is perfect.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.960
It tells me to select a drink.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.235
I'm going to pick one of my
favorite drinks, the Diet Coke.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.100
Thankfully, there's a
Diet Coke left here.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.210
Perfect.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.940
OK?

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.870
Got my Diet Coke.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.328
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.605
So Michelle, care for a drink?

00:23:34.605 --> 00:23:35.980
MICHELLE ROUTH:
I would love one.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.330
Coca Cola, please.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.020
PALI BHAT: Yeah.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.760
Perfect.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.250
Being the gentleman that
I am, what I'm going to do

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.740
is use my free points
to buy her a drink.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.830
Just don't tell her that.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.830
MICHELLE ROUTH: Well,
Pali we want our consumers

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.250
to use their My Coke Rewards
points they've earned.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.333
PALI BHAT: That's awesome.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:52.560
So let's try this again.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.160
So this time it's
going to be free, OK?

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.170
We'll go ahead, pay again.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.520
It's managed to do it.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.660
If you can focus on
this, it's actually

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.680
authorizing my payment.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.272
And guess what?

00:24:07.272 --> 00:24:11.370
It's asking me if I'm
actually ready to pay for it.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.700
It's actually authorizing
a second purchase, I guess.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.040
Ah.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.620
Here we go.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.445
And I'm 30 points away.

00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:21.790
So I'm ready to select a drink.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.830
It just shows you in
real time what I've got.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.710
You said Diet Coke?

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.305
MICHELLE ROUTH:
Regular Coke, please.

00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:26.263
PALI BHAT: Oh, regular.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.660
Awesome.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.397
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:34.397 --> 00:24:35.480
Regular Coke for Michelle.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.382
MICHELLE ROUTH: Well,
thank you, Pali.

00:24:40.382 --> 00:24:43.660
That was so easy I
think we should toast.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.951
To Coca Cola and Android Pay.

00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:46.950
PALI BHAT: A toast to
Coca Cola and Android Pay.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.061
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.752
Thank you, Michelle.

00:24:52.752 --> 00:24:53.460
That was amazing.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.020
I'm going to leave
my Coke right here.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.000
ARIEL BARDIN: Here,
I'll take it for you.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.958
PALI BHAT: Oh, you're
going to take it from me?

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.180
So the cool part about
this was it showed you

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.320
how simple, convenient,
secure Android Pay is.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.105
When you're buying
a Coke for Ariel

00:25:18.105 --> 00:25:19.830
it's pretty refreshing too.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.880
For him, not me.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.690
ARIEL BARDIN: It's a real Coke.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.980
PALI BHAT: Perfect.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.440
So what I wanted to do
now was-- We already

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.124
demonstrated how simple
and secure Android Pay is.

00:25:33.124 --> 00:25:34.540
I want to switch
to the last point

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.010
that Sridhar and Ariel
talked, which is choice.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.660
We believe it's very important
to enable both consumers

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.300
and our partners to be able
to innovate on the Android

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.730
platform, and so with
Android Pay, what we've done

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:53.100
is we've built this API that
lets our banking partners add

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.820
Android Pay to their own apps.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.130
So consumers have a choice
now of using this Android app

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.020
that I just showed you or are
using their favorite banking

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.510
app.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.110
So to demonstrate
that, I'm just going

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.810
to show you an app from USAA.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:16.050
So I've got a USAA app,
and I have a USAA card,

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:20.870
and I'm going to try to add
my USAA card to Android Pay.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.400
So the home screen welcomes me.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.860
I can check out my accounts.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.790
I actually have two USAA
cards, one from MasterCard

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.640
and one from Visa.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.196
OK.

00:26:32.196 --> 00:26:34.320
This time I think I'm not
going to show you my PIN.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.528
This is actually my bank app.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.390
Don't want to bother
changing that.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.600
OK?

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.060
So as you can see, I have a
USAA MasterCard, a USAA Visa.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.246
So I'm going to try to add my
USAA MasterCard to Android Pay.

00:26:51.246 --> 00:26:54.200
I'm going to touch it.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.320
And guess what?

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.644
Right at the bottom
of your screen,

00:26:57.644 --> 00:26:59.060
you see a simple
message that says

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.850
"Add this card to Android Pay."

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.860
I'm going to select "Add card."

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.240
It tells me I can use this
everywhere, sounds awesome.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.880
So I'm going to
continue, enter my CVC.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.380
Thank you.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.270
OK?

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.750
Just entered my secure code,
and now I'm going to continue,

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.250
accept the terms
of service, done.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.200
I've now activated Android
Pay with my USAA MasterCard.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.320
So that was Android Pay
for in-store purchases.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.920
It's simple.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.640
It's secure.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.220
And we've delivered choice
to both our partners

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.257
and of course users.

00:27:50.257 --> 00:27:51.840
So with that, I'll
hand over to Ariel,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.732
so he can talk about
in-app purchases.

00:27:53.732 --> 00:27:54.940
ARIEL BARDIN: Thank you Pali.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.210
I'll take a break
from drinking Coke.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.784
So we talked about in-store.

00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:01.950
I'd like to talk a little
bit about in-app, which is

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.610
the second part of Android Pay.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.430
So the same principles
apply, simplicity, security,

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.610
and choice, and let's
talk about each of them.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.916
So simplicity.

00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:18.790
I'm sure everybody has
tried to buy something

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.745
in an app, and type in the
credit card number and address

00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:23.870
and all this kind of stuff.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.110
And, you know, my kids can do it
really fast, but I can't do it.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.950
So I want a simple solution that
allows me like with one click

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.089
to be able to purchase.

00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:34.880
So we have to make it
very simple for users

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.860
to enter this
information, but we also

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.010
have to make it very
easy for the developers

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.100
to actually integrate
into their apps.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.960
So those two were
key focuses for us.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.380
And in our current
payments products,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.650
the apps that are
using our solution

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.919
are seeing a 4x
improvement in conversions

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:57.210
by using a very simple flow
which makes a lot of sense.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.280
And all of this comes
together in a simple button

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.875
that you could see at the bottom
there, Buy with Android Pay.

00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:09.250
So as a user,
that's all you have

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.320
to look for, within all
these different apps,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.819
and you know that's going to
be very, very easy to purchase.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.280
From a security perspective,
we take the same key components

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.250
of what you saw for tap and
pay-- network tokenization,

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:30.430
partnering with payment networks
to secure the credentials,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:35.010
we take 100 or more signals, and
we use hardware, starting in M,

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.650
to secure the transaction.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.160
So let's talk about choice.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.950
Today, when app developers
use our solutions,

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.420
they do custom integrations.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.600
And we thought, how can we bring
the Android scale to really

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.640
blow this out and have
many, many additional apps

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.370
to use Android Pay.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.870
So we're very
excited to announce

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:04.110
that we've now partnered
with payment processors

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.640
to make this very easy.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.760
So what this means
is app developers who

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.670
are using Braintree,
Stripe, Vantiv, FirstData,

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.380
or CyberSource can
integrate very simply,

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.256
and in the case of
Braintree and Stripe,

00:30:22.256 --> 00:30:23.630
we've simplified
it to the degree

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.090
that it's literally less
than 10 lines of code that

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.850
can be copied and
pasted into an app,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.100
and Android Pay just shows up.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.180
Between all these
partners, we hope

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:40.040
we will enable thousands of
apps over the next months

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.075
to provide users with
a simple experience.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.900
These are the merchants
that have already signed up

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.660
to enable Android
Pay, and we're very

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.590
excited to keep working with
them to roll out Android

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:00.340
Pay over the next months.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.680
And I think Pali will
now show us another demo

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.299
to keep things entertaining.

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.090
PALI BHAT: Awesome.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.700
Thanks Ariel.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:18.827
So I guess buying
that Coke for Ariel

00:31:18.827 --> 00:31:19.910
has made me really hungry.

00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:24.720
And I guess I'm going to share
a pizza with him as well.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.990
Sounds good, Ariel?

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.220
ARIEL BARDIN: As long as
it's delivered promptly.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.280
PALI BHAT: OK.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.300
So he wants it right away.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.460
So I think the best
way to do that is

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.120
to show you one of our partner
apps, which is GrubHub,

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.560
and order a pizza.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.580
So let's try that.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.810
So I do want a pick up.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.090
Sounds good.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.130
And it's already
detected that I'm

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.880
close to Moscone,
which is perfect.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.210
So I'm going to go ahead
and order something.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.810
Ariel, are you OK with me
being a little picky here?

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:01.750
ARIEL BARDIN: It's
quite all right.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.460
PALI BHAT: So let me try to
order a gluten free pizza,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.320
because I don't
want regular pizza.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.570
So, gluten free pizza.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.510
Looks good.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.100
Well, the first result is
Escape from New York Pizza, five

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.830
stars, only half a mile away.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.140
Sounds perfect, so I'm
just going to pick that.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.210
OK.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.650
Let's see if I can get
a gluten free pizza.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.690
Margherita sounds good.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.830
I'm just going to select that.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.930
Add to my order.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.430
OK.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:45.290
And as soon as I'm
ready to order,

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.840
the button Buy with
Android Pay shows up.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.730
Now let's see how easy it
is to buy with Android Pay.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:56.060
So I'm just going to select
the button and I'm done.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.280
Did everyone notice that?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.260
I just selected Buy with
Android Pay and I was done.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.260
It's that simple.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.711
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.780
So as you can see here, I've
used my MasterCard to pay.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.870
So you see my email address
and my MasterCard here,

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.330
and my payment is done.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.600
Android Pay is that simple.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.100
Now, Android Pay can be used
in all kinds of different apps,

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.100
and I wanted to show you another
example of an awesome app.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.110
This time it's a shopping app.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.050
The app is Wish.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.780
I think you see it.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.010
So wish.com-- really,
really amazing app,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.710
if you haven't tried it-- and
the cool thing about Wish is it

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:51.240
shows you trending deals and the
deals are personalized for you.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.530
So let me show you
another example.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.305
So there's a bunch
of shoes here.

00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:57.230
I don't think I
actually want shoes.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.730
Let's see what else
is trending for me.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.810
Usually it goes along
the top and they show you

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.720
different categories.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.510
So they have a category
for Google I/O. Guess

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.690
they know where I am today.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.139
So I'm just going to pick
Google I/O. Looks like there's

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:17.810
some really cool
deals on Android toys,

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.805
so I'm just going to go
ahead and select that.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.130
It's supposed to be $10, but
it's only going to cost me $1,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.540
and I'm going to expense it.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.070
Don't tell Sridhar that.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:36.156
So I'm just going to go
ahead and pick a collectible,

00:34:36.156 --> 00:34:42.780
and when I hit buy, sure enough,
my Buy with Android Pay button

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.080
shows up there.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.810
But this time I actually want
to pick a different card, OK?

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.320
So I'm just going
to try and see.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.560
It shows me a UI.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.350
You saw the MasterCard I already
used in the previous purchase.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.099
I'm going to try and
pick a different one,

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:03.000
because I have a
Visa card as well.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.881
I'm going to pick a Visa card,
hit Continue, and that's it.

00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:08.380
OK?

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.280
I can place my
order and I'm done.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.810
So absolutely
streamlined and awesome.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.190
The one other thing that we've
been doing with Android Pay

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.570
is thinking about
how we can make

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.040
this experience even better.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.090
We can't have just a one
size fits all experience,

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.340
and in some cases you don't
even want to bother, like,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.410
placing your item in the cart.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.000
You just want to
be able to buy it.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.356
So an example of that is a new
experience that we have built,

00:35:34.356 --> 00:35:37.050
and I'm going to
demonstrate that.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.960
With all this swag
I'm getting, including

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.960
all the stuff I'm collecting
outside, I need a bag,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.250
so I'm going to get that
from the Google Store app.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.020
I'm going to go to
the Google store app.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.340
Sounds like there's a
basic backpack for me.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.920
I'm going to select
the backpack.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.870
Just picked a product, mind
you, and what just happened

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.880
was Android Pay shows up
at the bottom, OK, right

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.000
over the page.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.360
It shows up at the bottom
in integrated apps.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.610
If I want to see what I'm paying
with, I can just swipe up.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.390
OK?

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.720
And I see that I'm playing
with my Discover card here,

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.790
and it's being shipped directly
to me at the Google office,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.386
because this is, after
all, a work demo.

00:36:21.386 --> 00:36:26.331
Now all I need to do is
swipe to pay, and I'm done.

00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:26.830
OK?

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:27.621
Absolutely amazing.

00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:30.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:35.481 --> 00:36:35.980
Thank you.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.660
So that's Android Pay.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:44.460
Simple, secure, and lots
of choice for developers.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.101
Ariel?

00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:46.100
ARIEL BARDIN: Thank you.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.910
So I'm sure at least one person
is asking him or herself,

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.580
so what happened
to Google Wallet?

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.620
Who's?

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.390
OK.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.360
I see Nick here.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.660
So we launched Google
Wallet back in 2011,

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.120
and you could do
tap and pay with it.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.200
We also introduced a Buy with
Google button afterwards,

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.980
as well as a bunch of
other functionality,

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.420
like sending your friends
money, which is great.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.040
We're seeing, by the
way, huge adoption there,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.454
it's a 400 percent increase
in users year over year.

00:37:23.454 --> 00:37:25.870
You can store balance with us,
so if your friend sends you

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:31.290
some money, you can then keep
that as a balance with Google

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.360
and you can use a MasterCard
to purchase anywhere

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.530
you want to spend that
money, and all this

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.349
was bundled into one app.

00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:42.057
So what we'd like to
do with Android Pay,

00:37:42.057 --> 00:37:44.057
and what we'll do over
the next couple of months

00:37:44.057 --> 00:37:46.660
as we roll out
Android Pay, is we're

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.600
going to have one app that
will do the in-store purchases,

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.320
tap and pay.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.330
We'll rebrand the button, as
you've seen in these demos.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.910
But to answer the question,
what happened to Google Wallet,

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.750
we're going to have
a new Google Wallet

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.790
app that will focus
solely on those functions,

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.080
meaning I have a debit card,
I want to send money easily

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.460
to a friend of mine, my friend
wants to collect that money,

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.320
spend it with a debit
card, et cetera.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.910
So all those functions
will be in a new app we're

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.300
calling New Google Wallet.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.544
I assume the 'New' will
drop at some point.

00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:26.960
And so you'll see
that rolling out

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.150
over the next couple of months
with Android Pay rolling out.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.620
So to summarize, we're very
excited about mobile payments.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.720
Google is obviously
investing a lot in this area.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.610
And what's most
exciting is to just see

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.210
how we can work together
across the payments ecosystem

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.570
to really bring simplicity
to users so that they

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.340
can enjoy mobile payments.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.090
And with that I
think we'll wrap up.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.077
Oh, there's more.

00:38:55.077 --> 00:38:56.410
We've got to work on our acting.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.520
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: This is very
much in an experimental section

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.670
of the talk.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.120
We're thrilled with Android Pay.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.420
We are thrilled with the
kind of broad based support

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.510
that we think it
can get, and we are

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.540
very grateful to
all the partners

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.370
who've been an integral
part of coming here,

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.860
and we think there's a lot
that we can get done together.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.780
But we like
challenging ourselves,

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.650
and so we wanted to
ask ourselves, hey,

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:34.930
could we create payment schemes
that didn't even require

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.220
you to take the phone out?

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.490
And as you can imagine,
this can be useful

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.970
in scenarios like
a drive through,

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:47.610
where it's kind of hard to take
the phone to make the payment.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:55.310
And we were motivated by
situations like this one,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.590
that it's hard-- Sorry.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.370
Let's roll the video, please.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:00.870
Thank you.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:01.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.705
MALE CUSTOMER: Sorry.

00:40:06.217 --> 00:40:07.425
CASHIER 1: Nope, didn't work.

00:40:07.425 --> 00:40:08.150
MELANIE: Wait for Mommy.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.815
Hang on.

00:40:12.692 --> 00:40:14.150
MALE CUSTOMER: 83, 4.

00:40:17.066 --> 00:40:20.190
CASHIER 1: Hit cancel.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.440
CASHIER 2: Here's your change.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.315
MALE CUSTOMER: Sorry.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.460
MELANIE: I like to
pay with Google.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.665
CASHIER 3: OK, Melanie,
you're all set.

00:40:30.665 --> 00:40:32.605
MELANIE: Thank you.

00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:33.352
What do you say?

00:40:33.352 --> 00:40:34.060
CHILD: Thank you.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.685
CASHIER 3: Bye.

00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:42.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.940
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: So we
are calling this Hands Free,

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.970
and this is-- It's at an
early prototype stage,

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:57.190
so we've been working with
a few of our partners,

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:02.650
like McDonald's and Papa John's,
to field-test these ideas out

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.880
in the real world.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.900
And here to tell us what Hands
Free can do to the more than

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:14.630
27-plus million customers that
McDonald's serves each day is

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.949
Atif, the Chief Digital
Officer of McDonald's.

00:41:17.949 --> 00:41:18.490
Welcome Atif.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.513
ATIF RAFIQ: Thank you very much.

00:41:24.422 --> 00:41:25.270
Hi, everybody.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.860
It's great to be here,
and thanks to the Google

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.370
team for this opportunity to
participate in a really, really

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.210
exciting new innovation.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.730
My name is Atif Rafiq, and
I'm the Chief Digital Officer

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:37.356
for McDonald's.

00:41:37.356 --> 00:41:39.479
I'm going to spend the few
minutes that I have here

00:41:39.479 --> 00:41:41.210
with you walking
through why we're

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.320
so excited about the
potential for Hands Free,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.160
and why it fits so naturally
into where McDonald's is headed

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.850
as a company.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.710
So let me start by giving a
little bit of background around

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.170
what digital means
to McDonald's.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.920
A lot of folks associate
McDonald's with convenience,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.120
and that is something
we want to perpetuate

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.160
for a long, long time.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.240
Now, we believe that the
definition of convenience

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.900
is changing, fueled by
technologies like mobile,

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.440
and we think it's time to
introduce an entirely new level

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.320
of convenience
for how people get

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.770
their food on an everyday
basis, and that's

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.550
what our focus is as a company.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.940
We're a provider
of every day food.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.650
So the possibilities for
McDonald's to use digital

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.800
as a way to add convenience
are really endless.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.000
We invented the drive-through.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.300
I believe that mobile
will allow us to reinvent

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.170
that drive-through experience.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.450
We're getting into the game
on delivery for mobile.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.840
And imagine being able to
come into the restaurant

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.370
and skipping the line, taking
a seat, and having your food

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.990
brought directly to you.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.110
That is something
we're already trying,

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.490
and mobile is going to be
an important ingredient

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.060
to that experience as well.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.250
Now, using McDonald's may seem
like a very simple experience,

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.420
and in fact it is, but
there's a lot happening there

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.990
when you unpack the
customer journey,

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:15.020
and one of the key steps in
the customer journey is paying.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.330
So behind me what you can see is
Hands Free in action at a local

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.710
McDonald's.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.220
We couldn't bring the restaurant
into the Moscone Center.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.680
They weren't cool with that
like the Coca Cola machine,

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.670
so we had to package it
up in the form of a video.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.690
But as you can see, it's
really very, very simple.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.730
So how cool would it be to step
into a McDonald's and simply

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.640
say, I'm here to
pay with Google.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.870
I think that'd be
really, really neat.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.960
So what you're going to be
able to do is no longer forage

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.500
through your pocket or your
bag to pay at McDonald's.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.510
You simply arrive, convey
your order to the crew person,

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.620
let them know that you
want to pay with Google,

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.380
and Hands Free takes
care of the rest.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.070
The app helps us
verify that it's you,

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:04.000
and we've integrated
our systems.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.550
So once Hands Free securely
charges your account,

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.880
we give you your food
and you're on your way.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.370
It's really just that simple.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.760
So to quickly summarize,
we're big believers

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.210
in the future of
frictionless commerce.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.470
We think that's coming to
the offline world at a very

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:27.840
rapid pace, and we intend to use
that as an opportunity to add

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.407
an entirely new level
to our experience.

00:44:30.407 --> 00:44:32.490
And it's for this reason
that we're really, really

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.190
excited to team up with
Google on Hands Free.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.650
Suffice it to say we're really
excited to be a launch partner,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.760
and we're ready to co-create a
world that's just so radically

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.510
simpler and more convenient
around how you get

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.850
your food on an everyday basis.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:52.918
So having said that, let me
hand it to back to Sridhar.

00:44:52.918 --> 00:44:56.334
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.540
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: You're
going to be rolling up

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.700
trials of Hands Free in select
locations in the Bay Area.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.360
If you'd like to be a
part of it, go to this URL

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.850
and sign up with your email.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.290
And it's time to conclude.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.710
This is been a long journey,
but as I said earlier,

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.130
we are incredibly excited
by what is ahead of us.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:24.200
We think the situation with
consumers, the availability

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.580
of devices that are
capable of making

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.800
mobile payments, the
changes that are happening

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.760
on the merchant
side, and of course,

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.620
the willingness of
the payments industry

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.170
to be great partners in this
change that is happening,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.530
is what I think will
make a big difference

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:45.010
to consumers, and not only
create the experiences that we

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:49.630
saw today, but many more amazing
ones that we have hinted at.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.416
For example, in the
demos that Pali showed,

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:55.225
with reward cards and
loyalty cards and so on.

00:45:55.225 --> 00:45:56.850
So I'm very excited
by the possibility.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.310
I'm very thankful to all of you
for being such great partners

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.117
in all of this.

00:46:01.117 --> 00:46:01.950
Thank you very much.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.300
[APPLAUSE]
