Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.380
Welcome to another edition
of YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.090
My name is Ikai
Lan, and today we're

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.970
going to be talking
about how to keep up

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.160
to date on the Java
API Client Library.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.300
So those of you who have
been following the show

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.570
will know that we have
moved our samples away

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.210
from code.google.com
to github.com.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.590
So why don't we go ahead
and switch to my computer.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.430
Now, if you're going to
 code.google.com/p/youtube-api-samples,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.430
hopefully you're seeing
a warning that says hey,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.530
we've moved to GitHub.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.400
Check us out.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400
And this is what some of our
GitHub samples look like.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.970
Right here, that's
a Java sample.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.510
This is the right page
you should be looking at.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.010
So if we click through
to the Java sample,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.595
one thing that you usually want
to keep up to date-- if you

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.220
want to keep up to
date with new APIs--

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.220
is the version of the Java
API client that you're using.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.010
So one way you can do this
is by looking in Maven

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.660
and looking at palm.xml.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.740
And I'm going to blow
this up real quick.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.380
You'll see that there's a
YouTube version and a YouTube

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.290
Analytics version.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.210
And this is a really
good way to make sure

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.730
that you download code
that will definitely work,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.400
is by copying the samples.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.310
But what if we're not always
keeping the samples up to date?

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.190
What if we release a new
API-- and the samples,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.420
they might lag a few days, but
you need that API right away--

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.480
how do you know what the newest
version of the API client

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.220
library is?

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.180
Well, it's not on the
Java Code Samples page,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.330
but there's a page we have
on developers.google.com

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.670
for the API client libraries.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.610
This is the API
Client Library Home.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.310
And you can get here by going to
 developers.google.com/API-client-library.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.204
And again, you can
always search for this

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:55.870
in your favorite
search engine and it'll

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.050
take you to this page.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.900
And what you want to do is you
want to click through to Java,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.940
Supported Google APIs-- let's
scroll all the way down--

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.789
and you'll see that there's the
YouTube Analytics API, as well

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.630
as the Data API.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
So I'm going to go ahead
and open these in a new tab.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.870
OK, so I'm on the Data
API Client for Java.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.830
I'm going to scroll down and
you can download the client

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.600
library, but
usually the best way

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.980
is probably to use a build
system like Maven or Gradle

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.554
because there's
lots of dependencies

00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:30.720
that the library depends on.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.120
So click on the
Maven tab, and you'll

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.610
see what the Palm configuration
is, so palm.xml configurations.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.110
Now we look here,
it's rev79-1-17-0.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.590
Good, our sample's
up to date on that.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.410
Now let's just make sure our
Analytics API sample's also

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.720
up to date.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.930
Click on Maven.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.110
So rev24.1.17.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.090
24.1.17.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.590
Good.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.160
So this means that
all of our samples

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.460
are currently up to date.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.440
And again, as you're
watching the show,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.170
there's probably going to be a
newer version of the API client

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.920
libraries out.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.420
Don't copy these exact numbers.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.160
Instead, you should go to
 developers.google.com/API-client-libraries/java

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.910
and this will be the right
place to look for what the most

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.742
current version is.

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.200
And this is only
something you have

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.830
to do if you're using a
statically-typed language

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.550
such as Java.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.107
If you're using a language
such as Python or Ruby,

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.190
you don't need to do this.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.540
The Python library automatically
generates the API document.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.260
It automatically
generates the methods

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.140
that you use to make API calls.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.070
So you won't need to
keep as up to date,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.020
but do check periodically
for major releases.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.590
Well, that's all I have
for you guys today.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.250
Thank you for tuning in
for this very short show.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.170
Just wanted to share
some tricks with you

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.310
for all the other fellow
Java developers out there.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.030
All right, take care
and have a great day.
