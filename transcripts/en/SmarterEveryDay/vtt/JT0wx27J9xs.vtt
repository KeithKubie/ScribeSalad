00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
- Three, two, one.

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:05.978
Oh, wow, that was loud!

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:08.270
- That was way louder than I thought.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.990
- Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome
back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.040
Today's question is fascinating.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.620
How hard can you hit a golf ball?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.210
That seems like a really simple question,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.520
but it's very complex.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.890
For example, think about this.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.340
When a golf club is swung
and it comes in contact

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.090
with a ball at some relative velocity,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.360
there's an elastic
collision that takes place.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.220
The ball squishes and then
it uses that stored energy

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.200
to rebound off the club.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.900
Well here's one way to
rephrase the question.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.100
At what point does that
ball no longer return

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560
to its original shape?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.090
It goes from an elastic deformation

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.830
to a plastic deformation.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.190
I'm not good at golf, but I
thought a really fun place

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.710
to start investigating this problem

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.850
is to use the Phantom camera,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.800
and see how hard I can squish the ball.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.773
Oh, yeah!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.820
So for me this is pretty decent contact,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260
but obviously it's not hard enough.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.060
So, it's time to move on to
the Happy Gilmore technique.

00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:12.000
I just hit the ball behind me,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200
how does that even work?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
Number one, I can't swing
this club fast enough

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.430
no matter how much I Happy Gilmore,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.240
and number two, I can't get good

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.960
consistent contact with the ball.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.793
To try to solve this,

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:28.180
I'm working with my buddy, Mark Rober.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.710
He's a YouTuber and an engineer

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.880
and we've teamed up with Wix

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.740
to actually build two separate devices

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.150
to try to solve our problem.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.420
If you don't know who Mark Rober is,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.080
I'm gonna need you to fix that right now.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.480
He's an awesome engineer
who's good at designing

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.160
intricate devices that
answer complex questions

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.270
in an awesome way.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.923
Mark's the kinda guy that
has stuff he designed

00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:48.160
roving around on Mars,
doing science right now.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.490
The first video I watched of Mark's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.340
was a roadkill experiment to see if people

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.100
were more likely to
run over rubber turtles

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.050
or rubber snakes.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.300
You probably know Mark
from his more recent work.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.600
He's the guy that engineered
the glitter bomb solution

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.160
to fight off porch pirates.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.150
I'm bad at golf, and you're good at golf.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.920
- And I'm bad at rockets,
and you're good at rockets.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.150
- I don't know, you did the Mars Rover.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.050
- There's no rockets on my hardware.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.040
- What are you talking about?

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.880
It was like the rocket.
- On my hardware!

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.070
- Oh on your hardware!

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.410
Yeah, yeah, okay, cool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.013
I outsourced that.

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:16.846
- We gonna do this?

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:17.924
- Let's go do some engineering.

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:18.903
- All right, let's do this.

00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:20.436
Anyway, you should totally
subscribe to his channel

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:21.270
because Mark does stuff like this.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.863
A rocket-powered golf club.
- Three, two, one, roll!

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:27.744
(rocket rumbles)

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.832
(rocket wooshes)

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:33.860
- [Mark] Yes!

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.053
- Where did it go? What happened?

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:38.970
- Go, baby!

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.441
- [Trent] That thing is past those trees.

00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.321
- [Destin] No way.

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:45.154
- Yeah!

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.030
- [Trent] It took off.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.213
- That's a cool shot right there, dude.

00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.046
(rocket whooshes)

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:09.773
- Dude, this is respectable.

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:12.490
(laughs) This is legit.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.009
- Three, two, one, go.

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.842
(rocket whooshes)

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:26.673
(laughter)

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.590
- Yeah, baby, yeah, go!

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.210
That rush you get from an
engineering achievement

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.287
actually working is like, ah!

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.654
Look at the flames.

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:41.487
(rocket whooshes)

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.410
- [Destin] It was an
absolutely amazing project.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.243
So obviously,

00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:54.740
go watch the whole video
over on Mark's channel

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.450
but even though we could swing the club

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.420
way faster than the pro's can,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.480
we still didn't come close

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.520
to the mechanical limits of the golf ball.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.280
Instead of hitting the ball with a club,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.810
we're going to hit the club with the ball.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.120
Remember David from the
vortex collision video?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.540
This time I've asked David
to build a vacuum cannon

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.400
that can shoot a golf ball
hundreds of miles an hour

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.910
without using explosives.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.970
Here's how the thing works.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.980
The barrel is just barely big enough

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.560
for the golf ball to slide inside,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.590
so we push it all the way
to the back of the tube

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.290
and we seal up both ends.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.550
If you pull a vacuum on
the inside of the tube,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.100
nature abhors a vacuum,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.770
so if you quickly vent
one side to atmosphere,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.780
all the air will rush into the pipe

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.040
and it'll push the golf
ball down the tube.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.480
This creates stupid fast velocities.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.440
We're talkin' hundreds of miles an hour.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.520
To make it fire even faster than that,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.080
we've put a positive pressure
tank on the back side

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.290
and we pressurize it with air

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.890
so we can fire the golf ball
at over 500 miles an hour.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.140
All right, Mark's about to see the device.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.587
See, pressurize that

00:04:52.587 --> 00:04:56.270
and then we have the vacuum
in the cylinder itself.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.770
And then we have the burst disc in between

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.450
and then once the hot wire melts the film,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.410
then the pressurized air will run in there

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.600
and there's no air in here,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.840
so there's no drag.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.630
- Yeah, that's the big deal here, right?

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.360
'Cause if this was just at 14 psi,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.950
you just have a potato gun, right?

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.610
- [Destin] Right, exactly.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.760
- But it's the fact that there's no drag,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.090
'cause that's like what,
proportional to velocity squared?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.923
- [Destin] It is, yes.

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:21.800
- That's where you get your
massive speed increase,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.740
right?
- Exactly.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.573
So to start off,

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.390
we wanted to take the
stiffness of the club out

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.420
of the equation by using something
that's pretty much rigid.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.134
- [Mark] This looks like a cartoon.

00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:31.050
(laughs)

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.070
It's funny 'cause piece-by-piece

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.330
this is all coming together.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.040
Like at first I just saw the
cannon, then I saw the anvil,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.547
and I'm thinkin' where are we gonna stand?

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.049
And then I look over here, (laughs)

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:45.150
and I see this amazing blast wall.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.130
- [Destin] If we get a vapor cloud

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.132
that comes out here,
this will strip that away

00:05:48.132 --> 00:05:50.779
and hopefully, the ball
will get straight through,

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.630
and then will hit right here
in the center of the anvil

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.040
and record that with the Phantom

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.940
at, what are we at, at
100,000 frames per second.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.698
All right so 100 psi here
ready for the vacuum.

00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:04.948
(rumbling)

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.108
- Three, two, one.

00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:08.941
Oh!

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.897
I heard it.

00:06:27.883 --> 00:06:29.260
- [Destin] Whoa!

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.610
- The amount of compression there,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.913
I've never seen anything like that.

00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:38.793
Are you kidding me?

00:06:38.793 --> 00:06:41.200
- [Destin] I think the
back of the golf ball,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.990
I bet that's the weak part.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.890
We then decided to cut a slit in the ball

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.420
and see if the outer shell of the ball

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.360
was what was holding everything together.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.933
- Okay, three, two, one.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.990
The ball is hot.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.103
- [Destin] Is it really?

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.060
(laughs)

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.447
It's very hot.

00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:10.429
- Yeah.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:11.779
- Look at it, it like...

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:12.803
- It's like a little
mouth and it's like blah.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.058
(laughs)

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:16.470
- [Destin] After that we
decided to cut deep enough

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.530
to damage the inner structure of the ball

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.850
and then see what could happen.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.643
- [Mark] Three, two, one.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.306
(pop)

00:07:24.306 --> 00:07:25.639
- [Destin] Whoa!

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.440
- [Trent] It's movin' the table.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.910
- [Destin] So all these
interesting interactions

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.730
that we're seeing play
out on the golf ball,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.910
that's a result of an area of physics

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.240
called material science.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.570
What we wanna do is we want
to explore that a little bit

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.320
by havin' a little conversation

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.680
about this paperclip.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.100
Let me get this in the vice here.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.020
Okay, cool.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.790
So you know that if you
were to push on a paperclip

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.130
a certain amount, create a force,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.250
it's going to bend back to
where it's supposed to be.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.083
Right?

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.040
That's called elastic deformation.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.370
What's happening is the paperclip

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.390
is storing the energy that
you're putting into it

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.270
and then it's goin' right back
to where it's supposed to be.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.620
But you also know that if
you bend it a little too far,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.500
it's going to move and
stay permanently deformed.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.610
That's called plastic deformation.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.000
Different materials have different

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.530
elastic and plastic curves.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.960
For example, Play-Doh plastically
deforms almost immediately

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.150
when force is applied.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.180
Here you can see the difference

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.590
between the foam practice
ball and a normal.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.730
You can see that the practice ball

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.020
is designed to absorb as
much energy as possible

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.120
so you can practice your swing

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.310
without the balls leaving your yard

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.360
or knockin' out a window.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.070
I decided to shoot both of
these balls against glass

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.840
at a much lower velocity to not break it,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.210
just to see what happens at the exact spot

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.280
where it impacts.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.290
If you play them in sync,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.970
you can see just how much faster

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.160
the golf ball rebounds off the glass.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.820
This is the magic of golf ball design.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.560
You wanna absorb as much energy

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.100
as possible during the collision

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.760
without getting to the plastic zone

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.620
and then you wanna release that energy

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.670
by efficiently and rapidly bouncing away.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.640
From goofin' around with this stuff,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.360
we've learned that golf ball impacts

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.300
will result in an elastic collision

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.890
up to about 300 miles per hour,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.000
which is why it was able
to handle the rocket club

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.680
without any problems, that
was under 300 miles per hour.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.730
But once you get up around
400 or 500 miles an hour,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.710
plastic deformation occurs
inside the golf ball.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.620
By the way, that x at
the end of the graph,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.100
that's the awesome spot,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.900
that's where we're trying to get to.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.900
- [Mark] That's crazy, dang.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.490
- The vacuum cannon can't quite
get these modern golf balls

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.544
up to the failure point, so...

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:39.930
- You do that with an old ball?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.333
- [David] Maybe it'll splatter?

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:42.343
- You think?

00:09:42.343 --> 00:09:45.030
I don't think an old
ball can withstand that.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.094
So where did this come from?
- My grandpa's house

00:09:48.094 --> 00:09:50.860
- It say 1962 - 1987, wear dated 25 years.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.760
I have no idea what that means,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.233
but mechanically it
should be very different.

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:57.844
Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:04.230
[Mark] There's rubber bands everywhere.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.793
This is gonna be fantastic, high-speed.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.550
- [Destin] We now understand
how golf balls work

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.330
but we don't understand the
mechanical limits of a driver.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.800
There's only one way to figure this out

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.460
and that is to shoot a golf ball

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.631
at 500 miles an hour against a driver.

00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:46.714
- [Mark] Three, two, one.

00:10:51.344 --> 00:10:52.177
Oh!

00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:18.180
- [Mark] I mean, that
was not what I expected.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.150
Dang, dude.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.527
Look at that.

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:22.027
- Three, two, one.

00:11:26.024 --> 00:11:26.857
- Yes!

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.070
- [Destin] Jeez, man.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.930
- [Mark] Oh, look at
the club face. (laughs)

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.890
- Okay, so we're gonna do another shot

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.758
but Mark had an idea to
put an anvil behind...

00:11:51.758 --> 00:11:54.550
Genius
- Genius idea.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.190
- The golf club here,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.340
but immediately behind
it we have the anvil

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.730
and the idea is that instead
of this thing moving back

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.030
because it's transferring
momentum into the club,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.420
we're just gonna make
mechanical deformation

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.910
the only way to absorb the energy.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.800
- How amazing would it be if
it bends it way back here?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.910
But it feels like it's maybe more likely

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.220
it's gonna come and bounce back out.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.791
But, dude, what a freakin'
trophy that would be.

00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:20.751
Ball in the middle of that club.

00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:24.022
- [Destin] That would be awesome.

00:12:24.022 --> 00:12:28.205
- Oh! (laughs)

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.020
- Okay, it's Mark Rober,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.340
he can't make a video
without using watermelon.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.300
- Destroying a watermelon.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.832
- [Destin] That's his thing.

00:12:53.832 --> 00:12:56.020
We get a golf ball goin'
stupid miles an hour

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.110
but we do agree it's gonna
go through the watermelon.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.320
- We definitely agree that.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.456
Okay, the question is does it go through

00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:03.470
the tarp on the back side?
- And I say, no.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.030
Farewell little guy.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.380
- [Destin] Three, two, one.

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:09.799
Oh!

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.920
- There is no chunk larger
than like two inches.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.722
- [Destin] Oh, my goodness.

00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:43.350
(laughs)

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.700
- There's watermelon where?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.630
- [Destin] So it came out of the cannon,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.110
through a watermelon, through a tarp,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.210
through a moving blanket, hit that,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.190
and then somehow bounced
over here in this bag.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.653
There's watermelon on the ceilin' outside.

00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:02.020
(laughs)

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.080
- An elastic collision.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.170
All right I hope you
enjoyed this collaboration

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.010
between Mark and I.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.890
We asked Wix if they would sponsor

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.350
this video collab for us
and they were like, yeah.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.340
- Without even knowing very much (laughs)

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.169
the brief was like two
sentences, so props to them.

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:17.810
- We were like rockets and golf

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.730
and I don't even think the vacuum cannon

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.952
was a part of the discussion

00:14:20.952 --> 00:14:21.950
at one point.
- Yeah, we didn't.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.870
- Yeah, so we had to step
it up to make this happen,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.920
so big thanks to Wix.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.560
Wix is a really good way to make a website

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.880
do anything you want.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.890
- [Mark] I have one for all
the builds on my channel

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.310
and including my workbench.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.320
It's really clean.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.090
- [Destin] Yeah, that's
the thing. It's very clean.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.680
You can grab one of tons of templates

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.410
and quickly make a really nice website,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.130
even if you're not that
great at graphic design.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.750
I have created a website.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.583
- [Mark] Have you?

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:44.417
- [Destin] Yeah.
- [Mark] I haven't seen this.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:45.250
- It's basically an omage to Mark Rober

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.760
and all the reasons you should subscribe

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.450
because he's been approaching
the subscriber numbers

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.900
for Smarter Every Day for a long time now,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.880
but I wanna be the reason
that you finally pass me.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.820
- Oh, I see how it is.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.986
So you take credit?
- You see what's going on?

00:14:56.986 --> 00:14:57.819
'Cause it's gonna happen anyway.

00:14:57.819 --> 00:14:58.652
- [Mark] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:58.652 --> 00:14:59.485
So you'll be like...
- Exactly.

00:14:59.485 --> 00:15:02.050
What do you think is on the website?

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.330
For reasons people
should subscribe to you?

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.125
- Just pictures of my abs.

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.375
(laughter)

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.463
- [Destin] Pretty much.

00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:12.996
So wix.com/go/smarter, no joke though,

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.140
I did ThinkerCon's website on wix.com.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.973
Did you know that?

00:15:16.973 --> 00:15:17.806
- I did not.

00:15:17.806 --> 00:15:18.639
- [Destin] The fact that we made

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.610
such a clean, awesome-looking
website on Wix

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.330
got people really interested in ThinkerCon

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.500
'cause it's legit.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.910
I mean, you can tell when
you look at the website.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.743
- [Mark] It was a great looking website.

00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:27.073
I think I even texted you about it,

00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:28.900
like the aesthetic of it is really nice.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.733
- [Destin] That was Wix.

00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:31.160
So if you have a personal
brand that you want

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.850
to get you name out there

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.150
and get somethin' out there on the web,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.940
Wix is a great way to do that.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.760
Go to wix.com/go/smarter

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.070
and you can start your website today.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.560
Big thanks to Mark for comin' out.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.393
This was a blast.

00:15:42.393 --> 00:15:44.250
So go check out his channel, Mark Rober,

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.370
all kinds of builds, engineering stuff,

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.200
a lot more watermelon carnage
than Smarter Every Day.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.900
- This is true.
- So go check that out.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.300
Mark Rober on YouTube?

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.210
That's how you do that?

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.092
- Yeah.

00:15:54.092 --> 00:15:55.170
- I'll leave a link in the description.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.060
You can check out my website

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.350
on reasons you subscribe to Mark,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.340
but I think you know why you
should subscribe to Mark.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.460
It's a big deal.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.978
Anyway, I'm Destin.

00:16:01.978 --> 00:16:04.760
- You're gettin' smarter every month.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.239
Oh, wait is it day?
- Day.

00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:07.175
(laughter)

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.291
Idiot.
- Sorry.

00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:10.541
(laughter)
