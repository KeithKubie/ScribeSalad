00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Today, we are going to do some math -- unsurprising --

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
but we're going to take some things that have been in a Numberphile before and we're going to do a little bit more math with them.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.359
So, perfect numbers -- a bit of a staple of

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.990
recreational mathematics --

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.120
everyone loves perfect numbers -- the smallest perfect number is six. [The] reason we call it a perfect number is because

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.820
it equals the sum of its proper factors.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.140
So 6 is divisible by 1, is divisible by 2, it's divisible by 3, also divisible by 6?

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.899
So I could put six on this list,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.009
but proper factors mean numbers that go into a number

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.400
but aren't the number itself -- in fact, we can remove six from the list and six equals one plus

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.620
two plus three, [this] equals the sum of its proper factors. The next number which this works for is 28,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
because that equals one plus two plus four plus seven plus

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.940
14, which are all of its -- all those proper factors summed together give you that number. You could -- some people

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.030
like to say,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.390
perfect numbers are equal to -- like all of their factors equal twice [the number].

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:11.099
So if I did -- if I was super pedant, and instead of using proper factors I used all the factors, that would give me 56,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
which is twice because we are just adding the number on the end right, so yeah, same thing.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.379
I just -- I ignore that, and just stick with the proper factors. The next one Brady is?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.769
(Brady:) 496? (Matt:) 496! You've been in this game for too long alright. So you've memorized 496 and obviously

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.540
I won't quiz you because obviously you know that it is one plus two plus four plus eight plus

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.590
16 plus

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.860
31 plus 62 plus

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620
124 plus

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.680
248, there we go, all the proper factors of 496, if you add them all together you get

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.300
496 next one is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780
8128 right and so

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.700
that -- and I won't list them all -- happens you get there, you add all those proper factors and equals that number as, it is --

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
carrying on -- and these were all the ones known

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.179
back in the day, and we since found more of these perfect numbers, and they're wonderful.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.718
But the reason we found them is because of our friends, Mersenne primes, which of course [are] another staple of Numberphile

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.839
So let's switch colors. So, Mersenne primes are 2 to the n minus 1,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.750
where that equals a prime number.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.620
So -- so that equals some prime because not all

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.460
2 to the n's minus ones give you a prime, in fact, let's run through a few very quickly.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.380
So if I come over here, these are going to be my values of n. These are going to be my

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.839
2 to the n's minus ones,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.980
As if I start when n is 1 so that's going to be 2 minus 1, that equals 1, is that prime?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.080
(Brady:) No.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.180
Well, there's a whole argument to be had there...

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.500
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't -- generally speaking, no, that doesn't count, ok, let's do n is 2, ok.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.380
So that's 2 squared, that's 4, minus 1 is 3, that is prime, awesome.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.619
Ok next one up, 3, that gives us 7, that is prime, brilliant, ok 4, 4 gives us

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.439
15: not prime. That doesn't work, so as you can see as we go along, some of them work,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.059
31, brilliant! That gets to stay, some of them don't -- 6, that gives us 63, no good,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.450
right, and so,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.540
some, but not all values of n [with] 2 [to the] n minus 1 give us a prime number out the other side, and some people

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.400
like looking for patterns and we call those people

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.529
"mathematicians" and so some people are like: "well, hang on,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.380
this is only working when n is prime."

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.630
Didn't work for one, not prime, two and three work because they are prime, didn't work for four, not prime, prime,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.780
not prime, prime, and so on, and so in fact, if you try it for eight, it won't work, because that's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.420
255, not prime, won't work for nine because that's

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.880
511, which looks very prime-y.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.600
That's got a real prime feel to it, not prime, in fact, when we check in 10 -- people get very --

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.500
I mean, 1023, I mean that looks like it's got a bit of prime going on that. It's not prime.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.560
Next one, 11, 11 is prime and over here is

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.520
2047, right, and that is not prime, not prime whatsoever

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.620
and I think it was divisible by

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.320
23 or something. And so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.330
people look at that

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.480
and go: "well that must be prime", because they see this pattern and think it must work -- doesn't hold, doesn't work for 11 in fact

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.680
well, the next one it works for is not 12 because that's

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.100
4095, which we know is out of here, the next one is 13, which is

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.560
8191, that is prime, that one works, and so, in fact, that pattern, when people spot these prime values of N,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
giving these numbers prime,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.559
Only works in one direction as such okay?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.740
Let me -- let me be very clear with this -- one way we could describe this pattern is, if n is prime,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.580
then 2 to the n minus 1 is prime as well, but that doesn't work,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.799
we just proved that. But we haven't disproved the reverse, and the reverse of a statement is different, so for example

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.810
I could say all --

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.180
all girls can wear hats.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.149
Logical statement, you're a girl, you can wear a hat, right?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.650
But I can't then say, if you can wear a hat, you must be a girl, right,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.650
it doesn't go the other way, right, because you know... (scrambling for words)

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.098
Well the ability to wear a hat is necessary,

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.549
but not sufficient to be a girl, anyway, the point is, right, the reverse is a different story,

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:33.240
and in this case the reverse is true -- if

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.720
2 to the n minus 1 is prime, then n

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.279
must have been prime. So the backwards still [holds], which is why it will still only be the primes, it just won't be all of them.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.519
So I guess these are our friends the Mersenne primes, these are our friends the perfect numbers, so far all very standard.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.030
But then suddenly you realize there's a link, if you look over here in our list before, three

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.419
[is a] Mersenne prime, seven

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.770
[is a] Mersenne prime,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.030
31 [is a]

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.720
Mersenne prime, in fact, we're picking them off in order, look down here

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.060
127 is the next prime and there is a factor of

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.060
8128 in fact,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.080
8128 equals 127

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.560
times -- what's that going to be -- it's going to be

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.600
64...

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.700
Yes, all even perfect numbers -- [I'm] being very careful here --

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:35.889
have a Mersenne prime factor. In fact, that's how we find perfect numbers, whenever a new perfect number is announced -- the most recent one was

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.479
January 2013, the reason we found it, is someone has found a new

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:48.370
Mersenne prime, because the great internet Mersenne prime search is chugging along -- every Mersenne prime has a corresponding perfect number and --

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.440
this is all just the introduction, by the way,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.010
this is the recommended -- you should have done this reading in advance, to be entirely honest.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.520
Well, [what] I'm going to show you is what that link is and prove that it always works.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.569
(Brady:) So now we start --

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.999
(Matt:) Now we start the video, so, are you ready to begin Brady?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.900
I'm gonna need some brown paper for this video and we will get this party started.
