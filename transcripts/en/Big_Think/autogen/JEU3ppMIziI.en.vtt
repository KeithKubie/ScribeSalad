so Jupiter and surrounding moons are
 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.209
so Jupiter and surrounding moons are

and when you do that to a solid object

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689
and when you do that to a solid object
 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.849

warm up the ball before we start playing
 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.220
warm up the ball before we start playing
you want to hit it around a few times

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
you want to hit it around a few times
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.070
you want to hit it around a few times
you are literally warming up the ball

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080
you are literally warming up the ball
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.930

you are literally warming up the ball
how you are distorting it every time you

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049
how you are distorting it every time you
 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.680
how you are distorting it every time you
smack it and then the resilience of the

smack it and then the resilience of the
 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.920
smack it and then the resilience of the
ball pops it back into shape and every

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
ball pops it back into shape and every
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.470

fundamentally different from what's
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.539
fundamentally different from what's
going on in orbit around Jupiter so you

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549
going on in orbit around Jupiter so you
 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.039
going on in orbit around Jupiter so you
have this frozen world Europa completely

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049
have this frozen world Europa completely
 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.720
have this frozen world Europa completely
frozen on its surface but you look at

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
frozen on its surface but you look at
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.610
frozen on its surface but you look at
you look at the surface and they're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620
you look at the surface and they're
 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.780
you look at the surface and they're
cracks in the ice

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
cracks in the ice
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.440
cracks in the ice
they're ridges in the ice where there's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
they're ridges in the ice where there's
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.410
they're ridges in the ice where there's
a crack and it shifted and then refroze

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420
a crack and it shifted and then refroze
 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.339
a crack and it shifted and then refroze
so this Ridge has a discontinuity in the

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349
so this Ridge has a discontinuity in the
 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.300
so this Ridge has a discontinuity in the
crack and it continues in another place

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
crack and it continues in another place
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.960
crack and it continues in another place
so what this tells you is that Europa

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
so what this tells you is that Europa
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.020
so what this tells you is that Europa
cannot be completely frozen because if

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
cannot be completely frozen because if
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.930
cannot be completely frozen because if
it were nothing would be moving you look

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
it were nothing would be moving you look
 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.670
it were nothing would be moving you look
at the surface of Europa the frozen

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
at the surface of Europa the frozen
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.059
at the surface of Europa the frozen
surface they're like ice chunks that are

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069
surface they're like ice chunks that are
 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.759
surface they're like ice chunks that are
like shifted and refrozen and shift it

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769
like shifted and refrozen and shift it
 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.780
like shifted and refrozen and shift it
again it looks just like if you fly over

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
again it looks just like if you fly over
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.170
again it looks just like if you fly over
than the the Arctic Ocean fly over the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180
than the the Arctic Ocean fly over the
 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.360
than the the Arctic Ocean fly over the
Arctic Ocean in the winter these are ice

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370
Arctic Ocean in the winter these are ice
 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.770
Arctic Ocean in the winter these are ice
sheets that are breaking and refreezing

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
sheets that are breaking and refreezing
 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.250
sheets that are breaking and refreezing
all the time it's the same signature as

all the time it's the same signature as
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.330
all the time it's the same signature as
that so all of us are convinced that

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340
that so all of us are convinced that
 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.089
that so all of us are convinced that
beneath this icy surface is an ocean of

beneath this icy surface is an ocean of
 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.909
beneath this icy surface is an ocean of
liquid water and there's no reason to

liquid water and there's no reason to
 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.259
liquid water and there's no reason to
think it wouldn't have been liquid for

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269
think it wouldn't have been liquid for
 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.099
think it wouldn't have been liquid for
billions of years on earth where we find

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109
billions of years on earth where we find
 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.930
billions of years on earth where we find
liquid water we find life wherever we

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940
liquid water we find life wherever we
 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.559
liquid water we find life wherever we
find liquid water we find life even

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569
find liquid water we find life even
 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.009
find liquid water we find life even
places like the Dead Sea why did anybody

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019
places like the Dead Sea why did anybody
 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.440
places like the Dead Sea why did anybody
call it a dead sea because the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450
call it a dead sea because the
 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.539
call it a dead sea because the
microscope hadn't yet been invented and

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549
microscope hadn't yet been invented and
 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.940
microscope hadn't yet been invented and
sure of them maybe there's no

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950
sure of them maybe there's no
 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.759
sure of them maybe there's no
macroscopic vertebrate fishes but

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769
macroscopic vertebrate fishes but
 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.400
macroscopic vertebrate fishes but
microbes have no problems thriving and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410
microbes have no problems thriving and
 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.659
microbes have no problems thriving and
practically any condition under which

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669
practically any condition under which
 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.390
practically any condition under which
you would find liquid water so what this

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400
you would find liquid water so what this
 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.790
you would find liquid water so what this
means not only do we have a source of

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800
means not only do we have a source of
 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.129
means not only do we have a source of
heat outside of the gold

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139
heat outside of the gold
 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.379
heat outside of the gold
zone we have conditions under which life

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389
zone we have conditions under which life
 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.070
zone we have conditions under which life
could be thriving and knowing that this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080
could be thriving and knowing that this
 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.760
could be thriving and knowing that this
is possible has completely broadened the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.429
is possible has completely broadened the
net that we are casting in search for

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439
net that we are casting in search for
 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.029
net that we are casting in search for
life in the universe no longer is it to

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039
life in the universe no longer is it to
 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.510
life in the universe no longer is it to
limit let's find a 72 degree a tidal

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520
limit let's find a 72 degree a tidal
 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.230
limit let's find a 72 degree a tidal
pond and sea life forming there no life

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240
pond and sea life forming there no life
 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.879

is pretty Hardy and if it takes liquid

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889
is pretty Hardy and if it takes liquid
 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.059
is pretty Hardy and if it takes liquid
water weak that may be the other place

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069
water weak that may be the other place
 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.570
water weak that may be the other place
in the solar system that is teeming with

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580
in the solar system that is teeming with
 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.019
in the solar system that is teeming with
some form or another of life so yeah we

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029
some form or another of life so yeah we
 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.119
some form or another of life so yeah we
all want to go to Europa period we got

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129
all want to go to Europa period we got
 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.350
all want to go to Europa period we got
to go ice fishing though because you got

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360
to go ice fishing though because you got
 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.499
to go ice fishing though because you got
to cut a hole or melt a hole you got to

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509
to cut a hole or melt a hole you got to
 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.920
to cut a hole or melt a hole you got to
get there somehow because this sheet of

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930
get there somehow because this sheet of
 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.619
get there somehow because this sheet of
ice by some estimates or several

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629
ice by some estimates or several
 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.469
ice by some estimates or several
kilometers thick and so it'll take some

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479
kilometers thick and so it'll take some
 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.420
kilometers thick and so it'll take some
effort to get through that which we

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430
effort to get through that which we
 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.519
effort to get through that which we
haven't really fully figured out yet but

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529
haven't really fully figured out yet but
 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:27.719
haven't really fully figured out yet but
it's an engineering problem not a

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729
it's an engineering problem not a
 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.929
it's an engineering problem not a
science problem so the clever engineers

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939
science problem so the clever engineers
 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.360
science problem so the clever engineers
should be able to figure that one out

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
should be able to figure that one out
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.010
should be able to figure that one out
and by the way Europe is not the only

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
and by the way Europe is not the only
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.200
and by the way Europe is not the only
one of these moons in the outer solar

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210
one of these moons in the outer solar
 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.079
one of these moons in the outer solar
system that kept warm by these sort of

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089
system that kept warm by these sort of
 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.969
system that kept warm by these sort of
tidal stress forces there are other

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979
tidal stress forces there are other
 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.540
tidal stress forces there are other
moons that feel the same influx of

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
moons that feel the same influx of
 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.019
moons that feel the same influx of
energy so for example IO that's the

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029
energy so for example IO that's the
 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.450
energy so for example IO that's the
innermost moon of Jupiter that suffers

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460
innermost moon of Jupiter that suffers
 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.929
innermost moon of Jupiter that suffers
from this phenomenon even more and that

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:54.939
from this phenomenon even more and that
 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.429
from this phenomenon even more and that
moon is so hot there are volcanoes

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439
moon is so hot there are volcanoes
 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:02.249
moon is so hot there are volcanoes
erupting from within there it is it is

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259
erupting from within there it is it is
 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.279
erupting from within there it is it is
rendered molten whatever solid parts of

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289
rendered molten whatever solid parts of
 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.800
rendered molten whatever solid parts of
that moon there are and so in fact the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810
that moon there are and so in fact the
 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.730
that moon there are and so in fact the
most volcanically active place in the

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740
most volcanically active place in the
 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.990
most volcanically active place in the
solar system is IO one of the moons of

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000
solar system is IO one of the moons of
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.240
solar system is IO one of the moons of
Jupiter and we don't know how to sustain

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250
Jupiter and we don't know how to sustain
 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.769
Jupiter and we don't know how to sustain
life under temperatures that hot so but

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779
life under temperatures that hot so but
 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.600
life under temperatures that hot so but
it's a reminder that if you're looking

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610
it's a reminder that if you're looking
 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.779
it's a reminder that if you're looking
for sources of energy we no longer need

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789
for sources of energy we no longer need
 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.879
for sources of energy we no longer need
to be anchored to a host star in our

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889
to be anchored to a host star in our
 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.250
to be anchored to a host star in our
search for life in the universe

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260
