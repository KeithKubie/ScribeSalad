00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.560
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.830
Now, I'm going to have
differential equations, systems

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.260
of equations, so there'll
be matrices and vectors,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.340
using symmetric matrix.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.950
They'll be second order.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.079
So second order, second
derivative, that y

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.720
is the vector.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.200
And S is the symmetric matrix.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.900
And that's the first
time we've been

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
prepared for the most
fundamental equation

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.480
of physics, of mechanics,
oscillating springs--

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.200
so many applications--
rotating torques.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.320
It's very important
in applications.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.920
The finite element, giant
finite element codes,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.810
are solving equations
like that all the time.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.000
And we don't have a
damping term here, so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.740
it-- or a forcing term,
so it's the null solutions

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.770
that I'm going to look for
to match initial conditions.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.650
I don't have a forcing term.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.519
OK.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.930
So the real central equation
always looks like that.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.720
This is-- Newton's law, is
what this is-- mass times

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.310
acceleration.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.820
So M will be a matrix,
often a diagonal matrix,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.500
telling me the masses.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.590
Remember, I have
n equations here,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.410
so I have n masses,
as you'll see.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.210
And I have, let's say,
a bunch of springs

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.100
connecting those masses.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.390
And then there's a matrix
K in multiplying y itself,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.360
and that's always called
the stiffness matrix.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.820
So, actually, in
applications, the first job

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.050
is to take the problem
and create these matrices.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.820
I'll give you an example, but
let's suppose we've got them,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.150
and how do we solve them?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.870
We look for, as we always
do, solutions where time

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.310
is separate from the vector x.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240
I substitute that
into the equation,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.770
So I get M, second derivative
will bring down the i omega,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.560
twice.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.558
E to the i omega t x, right?

00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:42.180
Plus, this term, K times e to
the i omega t x, should be 0.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.550
So I'm just substituting the
expected form for the solution.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.030
In that form, that
exponential factor can cancel.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.910
And, I see, I have an
eigenvalue problem.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.150
Let me just look at
that eigenvalue problem.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.420
I'm going to put that
on the opposite side.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.825
But what i squared is
giving me minus one.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:09.300
I'm just going to
be left with Kx.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.420
Well, let me put this
on the other side,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.020
because it's got a minus.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.010
And then when I put it
over there, will be a plus.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.800
M omega squared x.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.960
That's an eigenvalue problem.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.810
Here is the eigenvector.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.300
There is the eigenvalue.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.560
Oh, but we have two matrices.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.970
That's something a little new.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.110
Not new to MATLAB however.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.730
The MATLAB command to
find these eigenvalues,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.310
let me call those
eigenvalues lambda,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.420
so lambda will now
be omega squared,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.490
because two derivatives
brought down omega twice.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.700
But we have our two matrices,
so the MATLAB command

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:09.400
would be i of K and M. If you
define the matrices, K and M,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.170
and you call that command, it
will produce the eigenvalues

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.769
and the eigenvectors x
for this, you could say,

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.490
generalized eigenvalue problem,
two matrix eigenvalue problem.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.050
It's got a K, as usual,
and then it has an M.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.740
But many, many times, M will
be a multiple of the identity

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.730
and present no problem.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.310
OK, so that-- this is
the eigenvalue problem

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.980
that we reached.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.830
And that's the command
that would solve it.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.730
OK.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.110
That's the first step,
is to look for solutions

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.960
of that special form.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.330
Now let's do a little count.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.020
How many solutions
are we expecting?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.820
How many initial
conditions do we have?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.210
So we initially, we
give y at 0 of course,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.950
the initial condition,
the position.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.900
But we also give, in a
second order equation,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.270
we also give the initial
velocity, y prime of 0.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.460
And those are vectors,
because those tell us

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.400
the initial condition
of n masses.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.380
And so I have n numbers from
y of 0 and n more numbers.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.450
Two n, all together,
initial conditions.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.880
I'm going to need
two n solutions.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.770
I'm going to need
two n solutions

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.530
to match two n
initial conditions

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.780
and solve the--
solve the equation.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.650
OK, so what do they look like?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.610
All right.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.040
Here, I've gone ahead to
put an application up.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.020
So, again, I'm taking
the masses to be equal.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:03.340
Here are the masses, M, M, and
M. And so I end up with a 3

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.700
by 3 matrix.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.805
I have three unknowns,
n is 3 for this problem.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.880
And I've got 4 springs.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.820
These are springs-- maybe I make
them look a little springier.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.140
OK.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:31.030
And they're connected at
the top to a fixed support

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.210
and at the bottom
to a fixed support

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.230
and they're connected
to each other.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.980
Do you see what will happen?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.830
As I, maybe I, the
initial condition,

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.500
I drag all those masses down?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.160
As my initial
condition, I let go?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.060
Then they will go up
and down, up and down,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.510
just the way springs always do.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.000
And they will solve,
their position

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.250
will be the solution to
my differential equation.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.580
M y double prime
plus Ky equals 0.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.350
So I'm not, I'm just
starting the motion,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.860
and then backing off.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.930
So I'm not forcing--
it's not forced motion.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.010
It's pure oscillation,
pure oscillation.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.860
Right.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.290
But coupled, several
oscillators are

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.380
a couple, that's what's new.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.090
We know all about this equation
when y is just a scalar, just

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.170
one equation.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.470
We know that, and that led us
to the square root of K over M.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.470
That was just a 1 by
1 eigenvalue problem,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.320
and now we will have a 3
by 3 eigenvalue problem.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.630
The mass matrix is simple.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.200
Here's what the stiffness
matrix would look like,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.280
if all those springs
were the same.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.390
Just, I wanted to see
what kind of a matrix

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.180
shows up in the problem.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.180
And time to write
down solutions.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.690
OK, so what are we
remembering from solutions?

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:21.150
We're remembering that
solutions look like this.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.410
I have, but I'll have three
possible eigenvectors,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.830
because I have 3 by 3 matrices.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.136
So that will give
me three solutions.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.659
But I want six because I have
six initial conditions all

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.370
together.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.850
Let me write those
six solutions down.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:50.490
Y, the solution is, sub constant
times the cosine of omega t,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.010
times the first eigenvector.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.290
And another constant
times the sine of omega

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.510
t, times the second
eigenvector--

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.580
times the first
eigenvector, sorry.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.400
The first eigenvector, I
have three eigenvectors,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.280
and for each of them, I get
two solutions, one a cosine

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.910
and one a sine.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.440
And the frequencies,
there would be omega 1,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.930
and you are remembering
that lambda,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.790
lambda is omega squared.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.680
So if I write
omega 1 there, it's

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.870
the square root of lambda 1.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.850
That's the square
root of lambda 1.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.390
So I've got two
solutions so far,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.840
coming from the first
eigenvector at its eigenvalue,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.590
and with the cosine and a sine.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:50.070
And then, I'll also have
for the A2 and a B2,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.720
and an A3 and a B3.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:10:02.700
So I just, briefly, A2, B2 with
omega, using omega 2 and x2.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.300
And then they'll be
an A3 and a B3 using

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.820
omega 3 and the eigenvector x3.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.560
That's pretty stupid looking.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.960
This is what I
meant to represent.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.530
I don't want to rewrite all that
with 2's, and then rewrite it

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.940
again with 3's.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.135
That's what the
solution looks like.

00:10:27.135 --> 00:10:27.635
OK.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.460
How do we-- when we match
the initial condition,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.010
what happens?

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.000
I said t equals 0, right?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.040
When I said t equals
0, the sines disappear.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.210
So it's the A's
that match y of 0.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:54.500
So A's match y of 0.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.180
And when I look at the initial
velocity, the derivative,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.270
the derivative of the cosine
is the sine, and it's 0.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.790
But the derivative of the
sine is the cosine and it's 1,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:15.900
so I'll see that the
B's match y prime of 0.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.800
I'm trying to get the
total count to be six.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.140
So there are three,
three initial positions,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.990
and three A's.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.000
There are three
initial velocities,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.870
cause there are three masses,
and there are three B's.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.370
I get a perfect
match, a total of six.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.640
Six constants, six
numbers to match.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.230
It all works.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.000
OK.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.150
Now, do I want to
try an example?

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.890
Sure.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.260
Let me end with a
particular example.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.400
I better go to 2 by
2 for an example.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.490
So can I do the
same problem 2 by 2?

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:58.500
So my problem is going to
be y double prime plus S--

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.650
there's a K, there's
a division by m,

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:10.160
and there's a 2, 2 minus
1, minus 1 y equals 0.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
That's my equation.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.580
Now, I'm speaking
now, about the problem

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:23.220
with a spring, a first mass
m, a spring, the second mass

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.685
m, and a spring.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:33.550
So two masses, two equal
masses, three equal springs.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.130
That's my equation.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.950
So what's a solution?

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.750
How do I solve it?

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.920
I need the eigenvalues and
the eigenvectors of my matrix.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:49.800
So here's my matrix S. That's
my matrix S. It's symmetric,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.180
it's got physical
constants there.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.750
The stiffness of
the springs divided

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.590
by the masses, k over m, we're
expecting that same k over m

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.440
that always shows up.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.700
And we need the
eigenvectors there.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.430
And what are they?

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:14.130
The eigenvalues of that
are 1 times k over m,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.460
And 3 times k over m.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.970
Cause the trace is 4.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.460
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.930
The determinant is 3.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.740
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.010
Those are the two eigenvalues.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.320
And these are the omega
squareds, remember.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.040
OK.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.620
That's how I start
the system from rest.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.860
So physically I pull
down these masses,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.210
or maybe I push that one
up and pull that one down,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.440
whatever I like.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.720
I hold them for a
moment and I let go.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.800
I don't give them
an initial velocity.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.950
They start from rest,
so the B's will be 0.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:04.270
So y prime of 0, y prime of
0 is going to be 0 from rest.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.900
And that will give me B's are 0.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:19.770
So my solution will
be, my A cosine of,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.680
so the eigenvalues cosine,
I take the square root of k

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:31.100
over m t times the
first eigenvector--

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.420
one of the eigenvectors.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.325
The eigenvectors of
this, probably are 1, 1.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.320
And then the other
eigenvector, and that

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.840
will have a cosine of
the square root of omega,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.600
I have to take the
square root of that,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.380
so that's the square
root of 3, k over m t,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.616
times its eigenvector,
which I think is 1 minus 1.

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:03.520
It's going to be
perpendicular to that one.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.360
I've solved the problem.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.330
The A1 and the A2 are determined
by the initial condition.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.880
Now do you see what's
happening in the motion?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.780
That's the last thing,
last point for this video.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.000
This motion with a 1, 1
eigenvector, the two masses

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.290
are in sync.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.040
They're growing
together, up and down.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.160
That's one eigenvector
of the problem.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.500
And it has a certain
frequency that they

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.710
go up and down-- a square root
of k over m, our old friend.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.080
But also, with two masses,
they can go against each other,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.350
like this motion.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.210
That's coming from
this eigenvector,

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.220
and it happens at
a higher frequency.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.840
So those are going--
the final solution

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.570
is a combination of the
masses moving together

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.980
at a little slower oscillation,
and the masses moving

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.200
opposite each other at
a faster oscillation.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.990
Some combination of those
two is the solution.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.280
And then if we had
three masses, there

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.860
would be three oscillations.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.840
One where all three
are going together,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.870
one where the outside
ones are opposite,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.930
and one where all three
are, I see opposite signs.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.230
It's a beautiful subject.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:37.280
Highly developed, and highly
important applications.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.130
But that's the nicest
solution you could hope for.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.290
OK that's a second
order system, solved.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.840
Good.
