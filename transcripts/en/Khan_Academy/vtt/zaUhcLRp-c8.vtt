00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:01.749
- [Instructor] The function h is defined

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:03.492
over the real numbers.

00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:05.803
This table gives a few values of h,

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:07.496
so they give us for different x values,

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:09.891
What is the value of h of x?

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:11.271
What is a reasonable estimate

00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.261
for the limit of h of
x as x approaches one?

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:18.218
So with the table we
can estimate the limit.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.247
We won't know 100% for sure,

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:22.987
but it's a good way to estimate a limit.

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:26.906
And so what they have here
is these first three entries

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:29.626
show what's happening as we approach

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.240
x equals one from the left,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.637
from values less than x equals one.

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:38.561
So we can see, well what is
h of x for those x values

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.278
as we get closer and
closer to x equals one?

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:44.440
And we see, let's see
what when we're at 0.9,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.357
it's 0.003, it's 3/1000.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:50.258
Then we get even closer to one,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:54.227
then the value of our
function is negative 4/100.

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.005
Then when we get even closer to one,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.477
the value of h is 5/10.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:02.639
So we have this oscillation in sine

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:04.834
and it seems like the absolute value's

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.035
getting larger and larger.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:10.101
Now if we approach from the right,

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.268
we approach x equals one
from values larger than one,

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:18.003
so here's we're
approaching from the right.

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.239
At 1.1 we're at 3/1000.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:23.998
At 1.01, we are at negative 4/100.

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:27.253
At 1.001 or one and 1/1000,

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.481
we are at 5/10.

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.040
So this is interesting.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.497
When you have this oscillation of sine,

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:37.572
you say, "Well maybe we
might be approaching zero."

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:40.596
You know, maybe something
is getting closer and closer

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:42.834
and closer and closer to zero.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:45.105
Maybe something like that is happening.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.324
But what's troubling here,

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:49.007
the reason why I would say
that it's not reasonable,

00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:50.985
it's reasonable to think
that the limit doesn't exist,

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.637
is here as we're getting
closer and closer,

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:55.460
here as we're getting closer and closer,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.254
we're getting for the oscillations

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:59.779
are getting more and more significant.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.524
So actually think of it this way.

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:04.118
As we're getting from the left,

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:05.580
as we're getting closer and closer,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.055
the oscillations are
getting more significant.

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:09.522
And as we're going from the right

00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:10.539
as we get closer and closer,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.028
the oscillations are
getting more significant.

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:17.359
Now it looks like there's a
little bit of symmetry here.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.710
Let me see if I can draw
symmetry reasonably well.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.070
It looks like something
like this is happening.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.126
But this is implying as we get,

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:29.438
as we go to 0.9999, then
we're going to oscillate again

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:32.001
and we're going to get even
further away from zero.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.279
And so we're oscillating around zero,

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.515
but where the oscillations are
swinging wilder and wilder.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:38.466
So we're definitely not approaching zero.

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:41.352
We're not getting closer because
the absolute value of these

00:02:41.352 --> 00:02:43.063
aren't getting closer and closer to zero.

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:45.781
So I would say that the
limit doesn't exist.

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.562
So a takeaway here is when
things start to oscillate,

00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:50.785
you're probably already say,

00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.574
"Okay something fishy is going on."

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:54.851
But that doesn't mean that
the limit doesn't always,

00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.251
it doesn't mean that the limit
necessarily doesn't exist

00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:58.988
just because of the oscillation.

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:01.430
But if it's oscillating around a value

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.773
and as it's getting closer and closer

00:03:02.773 --> 00:03:05.823
the oscillations are swinging wilder,

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.017
further and further away from that value,

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:09.569
then you have to worry.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.778
And that then the limit
probably does not exist.

00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:14.861
Let's do another example.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:20.533
The function h is defined
over the real numbers.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.635
This table gives a few values of h,

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.090
so it's a similar situation.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.610
What is a reasonable
estimate for the limit

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.527
as x approaches three of h of x.

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.912
So let's see as x approaches
three from the left,

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:39.559
as x approaches three from the left,

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.104
it looks like, let's see 2.9,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:42.523
we're at 2/10.

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:46.308
But at 2.99 we go to negative 2/100.

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:50.694
Then a 2.999, we get to positive 2/1000.

00:03:50.694 --> 00:03:53.095
So even though it's oscillating,

00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:56.062
magnitude-wise, we're getting
closer and closer to zero.

00:03:56.062 --> 00:03:58.254
So this is an oscillation that you know,

00:03:58.254 --> 00:03:59.820
it might look like this.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.384
We're oscillating in sine,

00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:03.578
but it looks like we're
getting closer and closer

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.578
and closer to zero here.

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:08.438
So this looks like we might be,

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:10.764
looks like our function
might be approaching zero,

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:13.815
as x approaches three from the left.

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:16.655
Now let's think about from the right.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:19.274
Well from the right, we
see something similar here.

00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:21.247
3.1, we're at negative 2/10.

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:24.170
3.01, positive 2/100.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.337
3.001, we're even closer
to three, negative 2/1000.

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:32.817
And so it looks like we
are definitely oscillating,

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:36.022
but the oscillations are
getting less and less wild.

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:38.863
Their absolute values are
getting smaller and smaller,

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.693
so it actually seems reasonable,

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.199
we're oscillating around zero.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.716
And with every swing as
we get closer and closer

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:45.773
to x equals three,

00:04:45.773 --> 00:04:47.978
the oscillations are
getting smaller and smaller.

00:04:47.978 --> 00:04:49.509
So once again, we don't know for sure.

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.823
We can't prove it mathematically.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:55.388
But from this table it
is reasonable to estimate

00:04:55.388 --> 00:04:57.721
that the limit here is zero.

00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:02.297
Now these other choices are,

00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:04.293
I would call them distractors.

00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:05.501
This one down here is interesting

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.942
because the function is actually defined

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:09.855
at x equals three and it equals four.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:11.761
But this might be a situation
where the limit is approached,

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:12.808
we're getting closer and closer,

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:15.423
but the function is
defined up here at four.

00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:17.697
And this reinforces this idea that look,

00:05:17.697 --> 00:05:20.059
the limit can approach a
value that is different

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.619
from the value that the
function is defined.

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:24.730
That's actually one of
the points of limits,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.768
is to study what is a function approach

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:30.177
even when the function might
be defined at a different value

00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:31.997
or even when the function
isn't defined at that value,

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:35.725
what is it approaching as
x approaches that value?

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:39.743
Now as I said, for this
situation it's not,

00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:41.738
it's reasonable to think
that the limit exists.

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:44.178
I don't have any good
information to think otherwise.

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.502
We don't know 100% sure.

00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:48.032
they put the three here,

00:05:48.032 --> 00:05:50.062
but we're thinking about
what is h approaching

00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:52.010
as x approaches three?

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.516
Now there's no information
here that would imply

00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:55.509
that h is approaching three.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:56.509
And at 0.22,

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:00.758
they're just playing with
the digits right over here.

00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:03.268
But this is getting further from zero

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:05.543
than what seems like what
we're trying to approach,

00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:07.494
so I'd rule that one out as well.

00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:09.974
But the big takeaway here is

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:13.762
if you start to see, especially
on a table or anything

00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:15.391
that as you get closer
and closer to a value

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:16.515
that the function is oscillating

00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:19.330
that should kind of put your
spider senses on notice.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.794
But that doesn't necessarily mean

00:06:20.794 --> 00:06:23.021
that the limit doesn't exist.

00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:25.952
If the swings are
getting wilder and wilder

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.795
as we approach the value that
we're oscillating around,

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:30.742
then the limit probably doesn't exist.

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:33.342
But if the swings, the oscillations,

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.334
are getting smaller in magnitude

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:38.218
as we approach the thing that
we're oscillating around,

00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:39.514
in this case zero,

00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:41.145
then is actually is reasonable to think

00:06:41.145 --> 00:06:42.972
that the thing that
we're oscillating around

00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:44.805
actually is the limit.
