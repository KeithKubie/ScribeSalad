00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.230
We're asked to
complete the square

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.950
to solve 4x squared plus
40x minus 300 is equal to 0.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.240
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.830
So 4x squared plus 40x
minus 300 is equal to 0.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.890
So just as a first
step here, I don't

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.204
like having this 4 out
front as a coefficient

00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:23.120
on the x squared term.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.100
I'd prefer if that was a 1.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.180
So let's just divide both
sides of this equation by 4.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.480
So let's just divide
everything by 4.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.900
So this divided
by 4, this divided

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.710
by 4, that divided by 4,
and the 0 divided by 4.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.720
Just dividing both sides by 4.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.050
So this will simplify
to x squared plus 10x.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.892
And I can obviously
do that, because

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:46.850
as long as whatever I do
to the left hand side,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.440
I also do the right
hand side, that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.570
will make the equality
continue to be valid.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.030
So that's why I can do that.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.280
So 40 divided by 4 is 10x.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.440
And then 300 divided
by 4 is what?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.090
That is 75.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.700
Let me verify that.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.239
4 goes into 30 seven times.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.100
7 times 4 is 28.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.740
You subtract, you
get a remainder of 2.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.660
Bring down the 0.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.720
4 goes into 20 five times.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.430
5 times 4 is 20.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.580
Subtract zero.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.340
So it goes 75 times.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.520
This is minus 75 is equal to 0.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.340
And right when you look at
this, just the way it's written,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.860
you might try to factor
this in some way.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.370
But it's pretty clear this
is not a complete square,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.347
or this is not a perfect
square trinomial.

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:33.180
Because if you look at
this term right here,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.450
this 10, half of this 10 is 5.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.050
And 5 squared is not 75.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.490
So this is not a perfect square.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.957
So what we want to
do is somehow turn

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.540
whatever we have on
the left hand side

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.310
into a perfect square.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060
And I'm going to start out by
kind of getting this 75 out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.560
of the way.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.059
You'll sometimes
see it where people

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:53.786
leave the 75 on
the left hand side.

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.410
I'm going to put on
the right hand side

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.630
just so it kind of clears
things up a little bit.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.810
So let's add 75 to both
sides to get rid of the 75

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.800
from the left hand
side of the equation.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.610
And so we get x squared plus
10x, and then negative 75

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.229
plus 75.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.345
Those guys cancel out.

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:11.970
And I'm going to
leave some space here,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.678
because we're going
to add something here

00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:16.580
to complete the square
that is equal to 75.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.970
So all I did is add 75 to
both sides of this equation.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.880
Now, in this step,
this is really

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.860
the meat of
completing the square.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.000
I want to add something to
both sides of this equation.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.550
I can't add to only one
side of the equation.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.240
So I want to add something to
both sides of this equation

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.370
so that this left hand side
becomes a perfect square.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.410
And the way we can do that,
and saw this in the last video

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.040
where we constructed a
perfect square trinomial,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.660
is that this last
term-- or I should

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.110
say, what we see on
the left hand side, not

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.720
the last term, this expression
on the left hand side,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.210
it will be a perfect square if
we have a constant term that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.050
is the square of half of the
coefficient on the first degree

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.780
term.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.900
So the coefficient here is 10.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.830
Half of 10 is 5.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.200
5 squared is 25.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.574
So I'm going to add 25
to the left hand side.

00:03:07.574 --> 00:03:09.990
And of course, in order to
maintain the equality, anything

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.430
I do the left hand
side, I also have

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.435
to do to the right hand side.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.310
And now we see that this
is a perfect square.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.940
We say, hey, what two numbers
if I add them I get 10

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.920
and when I multiply
them I get 25?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.570
Well, that's 5 and 5.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.380
So when we factor this, what
we see on the left hand side

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.150
simplifies to, this
is x plus 5 squared.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.250
x plus 5 times x plus 5.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.110
And you can look at
the videos on factoring

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.312
if you find that confusing.

00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:39.770
Or you could look
at the last video

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.477
on constructing perfect
square trinomials.

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:44.060
I encourage you to
square this and see

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.060
that you get exactly this.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.060
And this will be equal to 75
plus 25, which is equal to 100.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.290
And so now we're saying
that something squared

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.110
is equal to 100.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.100
So really, this is
something right over here--

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.100
if I say something squared
is equal to 100, that

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.500
means that that something is
one of the square roots of 100.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.630
And we know that 100
has two square roots.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.840
It has positive 10 and
it has negative 10.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.050
So we could say that x
plus 5, the something

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.010
that we were
squaring, that must be

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.220
one of the square roots of 100.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.540
So that must be equal to the
plus or minus square root

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.293
of 100, or plus or minus 10.

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.459
Or we could separate it out.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.250
We could say that x
plus 5 is equal to 10,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.340
or x plus 5 is equal
to negative 10.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.390
On this side right
here, I can just

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.010
subtract 5 from both
sides of this equation

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.990
and I would get-- I'll
just write it out.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.790
Subtracting 5 from both
sides, I get x is equal to 5.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.240
And over here, I
could subtract 5

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.810
from both sides again-- I
subtracted 5 in both cases--

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.330
subtract 5 again and I can
get x is equal to negative 15.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.530
So those are my two
solutions that I

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.320
got to solve this equation.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.230
We can verify that they actually
work, and I'll do that in blue.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.800
So let's try with 5.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.990
I'll just do one of them.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.850
I'll leave the
other one for you.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.450
I'll leave the other one for
you to verify that it works.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.180
So 4 times x squared.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:23.330
So 4 times 25 plus
40 times 5 minus 300

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.860
needs to be equal to 0.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.762
4 times 25 is 100.

00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:28.920
40 times 5 is 200.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.570
We're going to
subtract that 300.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.770
100 plus 200 minus 300,
that definitely equals 0.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.310
So x equals 5 worked.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.330
And I think you'll find that
x equals negative 15 will also

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.120
work when you substitute it
into this right over here.
