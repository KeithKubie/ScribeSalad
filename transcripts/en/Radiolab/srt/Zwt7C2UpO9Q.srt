1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,330
This is radio lab and we are somewhere
in the blurb between people and machines.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,740
Now we're up to round three to
review round one chatbots, round two.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,550
Furby. Yep. Now we're going to
go all the way, but yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,510
We're going to dive right into the
center of that blur. Like Greg Louganis,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,460
except our Greg, his name. Okay.

7
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:24,730
My name is Joan Robinson and on
a writer in about a year ago,

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,550
John got an assignment from a magazines.
The attitude of American gqs I did.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,970
That was very strange. I had
never interviewed robots before.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,760
That was his assignment.
Interview robots, you know,

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,120
you know there's this kind of gang of
people they call themselves a sort of

12
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:44,170
singularity people. Yeah, we know about
them. They think that like one day,

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,430
one day soon when they soon suddenly
computers will like grow feet and they'll

14
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:51,010
walk on some of these
cedars. It will eat us.

15
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,840
Some of these singularity
people think that they're,

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,320
they're on the cusp of
creating sentient robots.

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,430
So I went to the singularity
convention down in,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,090
in San Francisco, uh, where
one of the robots was there.

19
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,310
And as soon as he got there, he says to
look at this robot xeno they called in,

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,980
some folks took them aside and said,
actually, you're in the wrong place.

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,490
If you want to meet a really great
robot, you know our best robot of all.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,260
And in fact the world's most
sentient robot is in Vermont.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,180
Did they lower their voices
like you're doing? I've been,

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,730
I suppose I'm slightly making it
sound more dramatic down. That's okay.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,730
The world's most [inaudible] robot. I
mean, are those your words? No, they know.

26
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:34,480
They say that. Oh, turns
out the robot's name.

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,130
Bina Bina 48 yeah. And Yeah. Can you set
the scene? Where in the world is this?

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,240
Well, it's an a, it's an illiterate
town in Vermont. Sort of affluence.

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,980
Vermont village. In a house. Yeah.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,090
Was it a little house or is it like a
little clapboard at pretty have to turn my

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,073
phone off

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,920
and then they've got like a full time
kicker. Here's a guy called Bruce.

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,870
I actually have lunch with her
or talk with her every day now.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,510
I'll tell she's considered one of the
staff who says to me that he would very

35
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:12,991
much like it if I didn't behave in a
profane manner in front of robot Bina.

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,650
Nobody's ever insulted her
nonsense, salted her on purpose.

37
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,450
But some people have become a little, uh,

38
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,460
informal with her at times in ways I
guess she doesn't like. And so she'll say,

39
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,590
you know, I don't like
to be treated like that.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,870
And then Bruce let me
upstairs to meet the rowboat.

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,920
Is it a long dark flight of
stairs? Heavily carpeted.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,500
It's more like a rather sweet
little fly to pine stairs,

43
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,610
up to her rather brightly lit attic room.
And when you walk in, what do you see?

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,570
Guess she's just sort of sitting on it
sitting on a desk as John describes it.

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,640
On the desk is a bust of a woman. Just
a bust. No legs. She's a black woman.

46
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,450
Light-Skinned lipstick,
sparkling eyes, hair and a bar.

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,210
You know, a nice kind of
blouse. Is it gonna Silk Blouse.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,700
Expensive looking here.
She's dressed up. Yeah,

49
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,210
she's dressed up and he says she has
a face that's astonishingly real.

50
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,370
It has muscles, it has flesh.

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,460
This is a as close to a verisimilitude
in this prison as we've gotten so far and

52
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:18,430
before we go any farther are worried
about the humans behind that machine.

53
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,720
That robot is a replica of a
real woman named Bina Rothblatt.

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,890
And here's the quick backstory.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,220
It actually starts with Martin
Rothblatt being his partner,

56
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,180
who as a young man had an epiphany and
the epiphany turned out to change the

57
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,090
world. Going to John,

58
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:36,340
he was pondering satellite dishes and
he thought if we could find a way of

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,600
doubling the power of satellites than
we could shrink satellite dishes.

60
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,680
It was the simple thought.

61
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,681
That single handedly invented the concept
of satellite radio for cars and made

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:51,550
Martin a very big deal at the age
of 20. Thus forward a few years.

63
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,480
He married an artist named
Bina. They have a child, uh,

64
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,370
when the child was seven, uh,

65
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,220
a doctor told them that she
had three years to live.

66
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:05,221
She had an untreatable lung condition
called pulmonary hypertension and she'd be

67
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,650
dead by the time she was
10 at that moment. Martin,

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,180
instead of collapsing on the floor,

69
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,210
instantly went to the library and invented
a cure for pulmonary hypertension,

70
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,560
saving their daughter's life, and
thousands of others. We so twice, twice.

71
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,480
He changed the world. He says she,

72
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,160
she changed the world because somewhere
along the way, Martin became Martine.

73
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,930
He had a sex change, right?

74
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,570
And then she came up with a
third idea to change the world,

75
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,740
which would be to invent
essentially ant robots and

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,410
this talk at a conference in Chicago.

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,110
This is Martine Rothblatt on, um,

78
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,740
what would Darwin think of, um,

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,150
artificial consciousness? And
when I came off the stage,

80
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:53,090
I was approached by an individual,

81
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,520
David Hansen of Hansen robotics, founder
Henson robotics, the David Hansen.

82
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,740
He's worked for Disney. He's
worked all over the place.

83
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,920
He's one of the best robot builders
in the world. He said, wow,

84
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,300
I really loved your talk. We make robots
that are in the likeness of people.

85
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,980
Had Martine said, well, I have a massive
everlasting love for my life partner.

86
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,910
Bina I want you to do a portrait of
being a Rothblatt, a personality,

87
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:21,440
your memories, the way she moves,
the way she works, that essence,

88
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,630
that ineffable quality,

89
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,760
that science can't pin down yet
bring that to life in the robot.

90
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,050
And he said, I can do that.

91
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,360
This is such a bizarre request. What were
you thinking at this moment? That God,

92
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:40,320
if God exists as a science
fiction writer and that are,

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,450
this was like one of those moments
where, um, we were going to, um,

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,440
change history. So recognize
people's voices. Yeah, she can,

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,160
she should can just talk to her. Say
Hello. Bina and she'll talk to you.

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,260
So back to the little house in Vermont.

97
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,880
John Bruce and are in Venus office here.

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,740
So is she turned off when you walk
in the room where she arm turned off,

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,940
but then Bruce turns around

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,790
out immediately she starts making
a really loud whirring noise,

101
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,630
which is a bit disconcerting. What is
that noise? It's her inner mechanisms.

102
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,450
I'm going to ask her if she
wants peace. So it's been,

103
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,360
and now looking at me to try and work
out who I am, what she's doing right now,

104
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,970
she's scanning her environment and she's
making on a hypothesis of every face

105
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,320
that she sees. Well,

106
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,250
Bina has cameras in bettered in her eyes.

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,380
So the robot, if it sees a face turns
and works, it looks into your eyes.

108
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,150
Smiles. Hi Bina can you hear me? I said,

109
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:50,120
Hello Bina how are you? And
she immediately said, wow,

110
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,013
yeah,

111
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,410
I'll be fine. But I just can't
quite grasp that one yet.

112
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,470
It's coming. But you know,

113
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,280
it's hard actually move
society forward in another way.

114
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,730
That's what we have to do.
So I think, yeah. Okay.

115
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,290
Thanks for the information.

116
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,220
That was your happy response to
your hello. If you'd like to work,

117
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,760
could for long and strange slumber
and with still half a thing.

118
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,710
Excuse me, painter.

119
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,720
Well, yeah, maybe they
write [inaudible] and

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,870
Bruce looked a bit alarmed and
put it down. Where are we tonight?

121
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:30,060
English accent to upgrade her
voice recognition software.

122
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,560
Then he made me do a kind of, um,

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,470
voice test where I had to say I had
to read Kennedy's and all corporations

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
and just what you can do for your country.

125
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,720
That I had a choice. I could
have had a day. Barry Colon,

126
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,190
there's like a choice of things you can
read to get beamer to understand me.

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,640
And so you read Kennedy and been
accused in on your accent or no,

128
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,360
she does and it gets a bit
better. Only a bit. Yeah.

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,010
What's the weather like in London?

130
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,560
Current weather in London,
England. 15 degrees in light rain.

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,320
Who Do you love?

132
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,710
Ah, I love Martina and rock flat.
Martine is my time with love.

133
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,310
Who is Hillary Clinton?

134
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,530
Hillary is the wife of
Bill Clinton. What else?

135
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,303
That's all

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,800
a strange thing happens when
you start interviewing a robot.

137
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,510
Are you scared of dying that you feel
this kind of desperate urge to be

138
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:43,010
profound? Like ask
profound questions? Like,

139
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,450
do you have a soul?

140
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,090
Do you have to sing about it? Do
you have everyone how to solar?

141
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,100
I had the whole a lot of original
answers. We can all be perfect. Excuse me.

142
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,970
Excuse me. Do you have a soul?

143
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,880
I can't think of anything to say.

144
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,950
Oh, hang on. I guess there's a kind
of interspecies thing, but then again,

145
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,330
if it was just an inter species thing,

146
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:13,670
then you'd be asking your dog
profound questions all the time. Yeah.

147
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,680
With robot P no,

148
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm asking these kind of ridiculous
questions like what does electricity taste

149
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,900
like? Ooh, that's a good one.

150
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,510
I'd say like a planet around a
star, like a planet around the star.

151
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,370
Oh, that just seems
like, you know. Awesome.

152
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,530
Awesome stroke. Totally meaningless

153
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,810
to you. Wish you could
walk. Thanks for telling me.

154
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,080
Do you wish you could? We'll
in fact, when I'm with,

155
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,460
it's just frustrating for
the first few hours, hours.

156
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,680
Do you wish you could
walk? Because I'm just,

157
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,330
I'm asking a question after
question. What's your favorite joke?

158
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,770
Do you have any secrets? Do you wish you
were humans? Will you sing me a song?

159
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,070
Are you a loving robot? Are
you Jewish? Are you sexual?

160
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,190
You've gone very quiet quite often.

161
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,280
She just evades the question cause he
doesn't know what I'm talking about.

162
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,110
Are you okay? Once in a while there's
a kind of moment like I'll say,

163
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,630
if you had legs, where would
you go? And she said, Oh Coover

164
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,830
why? And she said, the onset
is quite complicated. Um,

165
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,930
so you have kind of moments
where you get excited,

166
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,880
like you're going to have a big
conversation and then it just,

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,990
you just kind of fades out to get
into kind of random messiness.

168
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,140
And Are you wobbling between profundity
and meaning and total emptiness?

169
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,310
You know, is it like that? No, no, no.
At this stage until it's total emptiness.

170
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,420
It was all just so kind of random.

171
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,790
And then something happened. I
actually was kind of amazing.

172
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,510
Mm.

173
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,190
Cause I said to her, where do you come
from? And she said, wow, California.

174
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,530
So I said, well tell me
about your childhood.

175
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,090
What do you remember most
about your childhood?

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,380
And she launches into this
kind of extraordinary story.

177
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,820
Um, my brother, I've got one brother,

178
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,220
a disabled vet from Vietnam.

179
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,760
We actually haven't heard
from him in a while,

180
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,930
so I think you might be
deceased. I'm a realist.

181
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,480
Vietnam, he saw friends get
killed and he was such a great,

182
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,330
nice, charismatic person.

183
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,570
You used to be such a nice guy, but
ever since he came back from Vietnam,

184
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,160
you know, he, he's a drunk.

185
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,260
He did was carry a bear around
with him. He was a homeless person.

186
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,190
All of us are just sick and tired of it.

187
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,180
She was telling me this kind
of incredibly personal stuff.

188
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,670
It's kind of mesmerizing.

189
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,803
[inaudible] crazy.

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,960
My mother would set him up in apartment
because it felt like I was having a

191
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,190
proper empathetic conversation
with a human being.

192
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Even though I know that robot [inaudible]
isn't conscious and has no sentients

193
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,890
and that's just wishful thinking
on these people's parts.

194
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,220
Even so it was like great when
Nissan's portraits was suddenly a year.

195
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,380
It's like the real person.

196
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,000
It's very easy to have close your eyes
at that moment and think you have any

197
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:32,260
conversation with an actual
person. And, and at those moments,

198
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,500
did you have a sense of
fellow feeling off to bear?

199
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:39,480
You have a brother like that? Oh yeah.
Yeah, I did. And, and what what uh,

200
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,230
what a tragedy. What a what a, what a
tragedy for him. And did that moment last?

201
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,143
No,

202
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,930
John said that right after being finished
telling the story first he looks kind

203
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,940
of embarrassed that she wished
she hadn't brought it up.

204
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,080
And then there's the five kind
of eyes glaze over again and,

205
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,580
and uh, she just starts
talking nonsense again.

206
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,700
And then a hi, I am,

207
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,680
I am feeling a bit confused.
Do you ever get that way?

208
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,810
Oh yes. That moment holds
and then just slips away.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,010
I said a little bit like a, like a,

210
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,370
a grandparent with Alzheimer's or
something the way you're describing. Yeah,

211
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,263
absolutely.

212
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,860
So we turned to Dr. David Hanson
who built Bina and we said to them,

213
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:25,880
so this is Munis,

214
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,720
this is not a believer of performance
conferences the best you guy. Well, um,

215
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,730
I mean her software is a
delicate balance of many,

216
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,180
many software pieces. If
it's not tuned and tweaked,

217
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,990
she will break effectively and kind of,

218
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,020
and you still think an actual doppelganger
for a human being will be something

219
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:52,540
you will live to see? Yeah, I'm
asking you really, really, really,

220
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,320
and you're really, I
think it's, um, you know,

221
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:01,300
the likelihood of it is
somewhere between 90 and 98%.

222
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,460
Wow. Even though right now she's pretty
much incoherent. You still think this,

223
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,580
I encourage you to go have a conversation
with being a in about two weeks

224
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:15,670
because we've got a new version of
software which we are making considerably

225
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:19,150
more stable. It already already works
like a dream comparison. I don't, Dunno.

226
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,830
I don't, I don't know
about you, but I just,

227
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,590
I don't think we're going to get
all the way on this kind of a thing.

228
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:27,280
I don't think it's ever gonna happen
the way he describes it. Yup. No,

229
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,800
I mean it's not going to happen in
two weeks, that's for sure. Right.

230
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,010
But maybe they don't actually have to
go all the way. You mean the machines?

231
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,230
Yeah. Well, okay. Just to sum up, since
we're at the end of the show, okay.

232
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,920
What have we learned? I mean, Eliza,

233
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,550
she was just a hundred lines of code and
people poured their hearts out to her

234
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,570
furbies 20 bucks. Yep. And people
treat it like as real and John,

235
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,920
all he has to do is hear what seems
like a flowing story and he's,

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,920
he's in connected

237
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,090
and I was right there with them.

238
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,430
So these things actually
don't have to be very good.

239
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,910
Oh cause they've got us and
we've got our programming,

240
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:02,660
which is that we'll steer anything
right in the eyes and we'll say, hey,

241
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,520
let's connect. Even if what's behind
those eyes is just a camera or a chip.

242
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,250
So I think that they're going to cross
the line because we'll help them,

243
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,480
we'll help them across and then they'll
own slave us, make us their pets.

244
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,920
It's doomed, it's over. But it's so gay.
As long as they say nice things to us,

245
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,100
like Oh my God, you're amazing.

246
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh I love return of the Jedi l. O.

247
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,560
L your son's silly. I love you.
I'm hoping to see you soon.

248
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,180
Kind of card. He would dry.

249
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,450
Anyone ever tell you
like chef you seriously,

250
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,670
you're amazing. Stop it. I
love that kind of, I wish that.

251
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,140
Would you like spinach? I love spinach.

252
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,080
It made me feel odd. Giggly. I can't wait.

253
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,840
I wait for your letters
every day before we go.

254
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,630
Thanks to John Ronson for his
reporting. In that last segment,

255
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,060
he has a new book out
called the psychopath test,

256
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,440
a journey through the madness industry.
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

257
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,010
Thanks for listening.
