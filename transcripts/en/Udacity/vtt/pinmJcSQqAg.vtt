00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.740
The answer is yes there is a problem. And, and the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.450
problem is that the before the last processor, the last processor

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.930
guy comes and sets the cone back up to N. And

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.610
remember what the last processor is doing, decrementing the count. And

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
if the count is zero, as soon as there is decrement

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.070
of the count and the count is bigger than zero the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.510
other guys are sitting here. They're going to go off on their

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.650
merry way, executing code towards the next barrier. And the last

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.210
processor is, in the meanwhile, fitting the count backup

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.750
to N. But before the last processor sets the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.660
count back up to N, the other processors may

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.120
race to the next barrier. And they may go through,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.450
because they may find that this count has not

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.020
been set to N, yet. And they will find

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.560
that the count is zero, and then they'll fall

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.450
through. And that can be a, another happy situation. Right?
