00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.710
AKSHAY THAKKER: Please
join me in welcoming

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.440
the very wonderful and
talented Lillete Dubey.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.240
Welcome.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.990
Please.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.206
LILLETE DUBEY: Sitting here?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380
AKSHAY THAKKER: Lillete,
welcome to Google.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.630
Have you been to Google
in the Bay Area before?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.700
LILLETE DUBEY: No,
I haven't actually.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.250
I haven't.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.810
No.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.980
I mean, I've been
to the Bay Area,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.000
but I haven't been to Google.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.305
[LAUGHING]

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:33.080
AKSHAY THAKKER: Oh,
so you're missing

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.330
the best part of the Bay Area.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.150
Now, you are done.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.650
This is--

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.399
LILLETE DUBEY: Now, I
have made up for it.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.930
AKSHAY THAKKER: Now, yeah.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.610
Well, welcome.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.570
I am delighted to be here, like
I said, partly because you're

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.606
from Pune.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.275
Could you tell us a
little bit about--

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:50.900
LILLETE DUBEY: Of
course, I have to say

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.940
that it is a very epic moment
for me to be here at Google.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.760
Really.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.560
And I'm not just saying that
because, today like, Durga,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.129
you know, Durga is this
goddess with eight hands,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.570
Google is our Durga.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.310
You know, whatever we
need comes from Google.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130
So it's not just for that.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.870
It's because today,
I was thinking

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.670
a lot about how I would
start chatting with you all.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.200
And I thought of my father.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.750
My father was what is
called a Renaissance man.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100
A da Vinci of our times
in his own way, because he

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.770
was an engineer by profession.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.360
He was a physicist by passion.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.080
His passion was the special
theory of relativity.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.490
When he got married
to my mother,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.400
he told her I have one
mistress, and that's physics.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.310
So don't bother me, because I'm
going to spend a lot of time

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130
with her.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.160
And he used to get every
few years, the Britannica,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.570
as it got updated.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.310
And my earliest memories--

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.610
he had a fabulous library.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.135
He was very fond of books.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:52.410
So there was one sort of
room half-dedicated to books.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.660
We used to get the Britannica.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.920
And I thought of him today, and
I said, what an epic moment.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.240
Dad, you will be
smiling today up

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.610
there, because I'm a Googler.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.130
And he worked till he was 88.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.630
He got cancer when he was 88.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.330
And he had a computer
in his office.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.496
But suddenly, he told
me, I want a laptop.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:13.370
I said, do you even know
how to use a laptop?

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.328
He said, I'll learn it.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:15.560
It's not a big deal.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.120
And we got on to it.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.440
And I remember Google,
because I said, Dad--

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.430
he was very low.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.900
It was a few months
before he died.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.120
I said, do you want to see
what you've done in your life?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.995
Do you want to see some
of your achievements?

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:29.490
He said, how would I do that?

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.570
So I said, we hit Google,
and we find your name,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.110
and we see what you've done.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.960
And my dad gave talks
at Imperial College,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.350
wrote for "Nature."

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.660
He gave talks at King's College,
lots of places, on physics.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.010
So that was the last time I saw
him smile, and I saw his eyes

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.100
light up, because he saw so many
sites on which he was there.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.310
And I remembered him
with great, great love

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.190
today, when I was
coming to Google.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.419
I have to share that.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.960
And the other thing
I wanted to share

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.941
was that my mother, she
was obviously not there,

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:07.940
because she's never printed
anything-- you know,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.870
published anything.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.920
And you get to Google if
you've been somewhere,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.480
you know, on print.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.570
I mean, that's how I
assume it's all collated.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.574
And my mother's
feeling very left out.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.990
And I said, how
do I cheer her up?

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.870
So I said, you
know, Mom, your dad

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.960
was the first FRCP, the
Fellow of the Royal College

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.850
of Physicians from Edinburgh.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.290
And he also--

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.590
Sikh by religion, and
we have the holy book.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.900
And my grandfather
also translated

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.020
the first two gospels,
let's say, of that holy book

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.670
into English.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.930
So I said, I'm sure he's there.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330
So we Googled him.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.160
And in one of the
sites that were there,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.810
he mentioned all his
children, including my mother.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.930
So I said, hey, you're
dead too on the internet.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.944
And she was so thrilled.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.860
She was so thrilled that
her father was there.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.770
So I said before we talk
about anything else,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.330
I have to tell you that.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.980
Because sort of my journey in
my life, which is peculiar,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.459
because I will tell you
about where I come from

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.000
and how sometimes
the things that you

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
get from your parents, which
are very strong characteristics,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.490
also help you to break things
and do things on your own.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.240
So I was remembering my
parents because of Google.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.520
And I said before I talk
about anything else,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.560
I have to thank
Google, because two

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.070
of the best moments of my
dad's life before he went

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.629
were because of Google.

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.920
AKSHAY THAKKER: That's amazing.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.490
Thank so much for--

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.744
you know, it's stories
like these that keep

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:37.910
us coming to work every day.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.150
LILLETE DUBEY: Of course.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.650
Of course.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.770
Of course.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.660
I mean, obviously, we
become like little babies,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.640
dependent on that Google
Map, that Google application

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.290
for almost anything.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.790
So that goes without
saying, but I'm

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.750
talking about a very personal
thing that touched me,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.302
where Google really became far
more than just an application.

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:02.510
AKSHAY THAKKER: Yeah, that
was a very touching story.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.460
Thank you again
for sharing that.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.280
So you studied
English literature.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.080
You know, a few
decades ago, how did

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.610
you convince your
parents to study

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.040
anything that didn't
sound like medicine,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.999
or engineering, or law?

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.456
LILLETE DUBEY: Very
good questions,

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:20.740
because I was coming to that.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.520
That these great parents,
wonderful, wonderful parents

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.450
that I had, were
quite unique also.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:33.101
I come from a very long lineage
of academics and professionals.

00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.600
OK.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.690
So my father was an engineer,
a Lahore engineer, in college

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.340
before partition.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.840
And my mother was a
doctor, a gynecologist,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.890
at Lady Hardinge in Delhi.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.910
And they were both
very independent,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.049
strong-minded, principled,
super intelligent people.

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:53.840
And they didn't get
married in those days--

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
I'm talking about
65, 70 years ago,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.220
till they were in their
30's, which was unheard of.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.720
So they gave me some very strong
sort of values and good DNA

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.390
on many, many, many aspects.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.780
But they were also very
clear that they didn't

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.090
want me to get into the arts.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.500
So my father wanted me to be at
the least a nuclear physicist.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.350
At the very least,
if not go into space.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.670
And my mother wanted
me to be a path

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.740
breaking, you know, sort of a
Nobel Prize winning biologist,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.730
or whatever.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.250
Medicine was her field.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.520
And it was not just her.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.320
You see, her sister
was a doctor.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.730
Her father was a doctor.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.560
His father was a doctor.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.010
And my father-- in fact, when
my father's brother studied

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.780
at Mayo in the
'50s, Mayo Clinic,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.570
and set up the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.350
and the cousins were doctors.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.110
So it was this deluge
of professionals.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.600
And when I said
after school that I

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.349
don't want to do anything
any more to do with science,

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:58.890
I studied science
up to school, and I

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.730
said I don't have that brain.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.170
I have a left brain.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.600
I don't want to use that.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.520
And my father was horrified.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.250
You know, because, you see,
he was so well-informed.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.630
He could talk to you
about your subject.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.380
He could talk to my
mother about medicine,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.960
my husband about economics,
my brother-in-law,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.850
who's a game theorist
about game theory.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.810
So he made everyone feel like--

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.790
that generation was a
generation of people

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.210
with a great deal of
intellectual curiosity

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.390
about-- we become a
generation of specialists.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.760
Not me, more your
generation, which

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.340
is very important, because
depth is important,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.550
and focus is important.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.860
It's so competitive.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.310
But they had a breadth
of vision, my father,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.270
that I haven't seen very
much in recent times.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.130
And it's quite wonderful.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.970
In the sense of, I
remember I was reading,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.419
Arundhati's Roy's book,
"The God of Small Things."

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:56.710
She just won the Booker for it.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.380
She was sort of
a friend of mine.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.670
And I, said you have
to read this book.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.160
He said, well, what do you think
is so great about this book?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.951
Why do you think she
got the Booker for it?

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.660
Or if I said, you know,
Jhumpa Lahiri got a Pulitzer.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.227
He said, well,
what do you think?

00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:09.060
What is the reasons?

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.540
I had given him a reason for
him to even look at the book,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.290
because it was a waste
of time, otherwise.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.670
He never read fiction.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.290
And he loved technology.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.580
He loved new things.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.529
He loved he loved the
cosmos, reading about that.

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:26.070
So he felt there were so many
important things to read about,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.140
why would you bother
reading about literature

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.700
all the time for God's
sake and study it?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.121
So he was very, very
upset because he

00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:34.620
could quote Shakespeare
to me better

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.179
than I could quote it to him.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.679
And he wondered,
why the hell did

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.210
I want to waste five years of
my master's studying literature?

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.091
And he could never
understand it.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.840
And then, you know how
Indian fathers are.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.770
He said, OK.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.854
Then I get a second masters
in mass communication,

00:08:48.854 --> 00:08:51.228
just because I was scared that
theatre may not pay me any

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:51.780
money.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.870
So [INAUDIBLE] luckily,
so I had a lot of offers

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.374
in advertising,
none of which I did.

00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:58.040
He said, OK, you're
getting married now.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.840
You're your husband's
responsibility.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.380
I don't care what you do.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.670
And my mother was more--

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.640
she just gave me
this very strong,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.020
you know, at the sort of strong
matriarchal, very feisty,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.430
independent woman
who endures this.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.764
There were two things I
learned, one from my father,

00:09:18.764 --> 00:09:20.680
from my mother, which
was very important to me

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.290
as a philosophy.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.020
Because after I decided that
I was going to do theater,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.540
I was very silly, because
when I was doing the masters,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.790
my father said, OK, if
you must do something,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.890
you have to excel at it.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.250
Don't do something if you
go half-hearted, half-baked.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.010
Go to Radha, study theater.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.600
Or go to the NSC
and study theater.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.130
Don't do just this sort of
dilettante-ish way of doing it.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.780
So his philosophy was, you
will excel if you do something.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.100
You'll have a chance to
excel only if you really

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.140
work hard and hone your skills
and put everything into it.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.640
And my mother, one thing that
was very important to me,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.002
was that two things.

00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:06.210
One was that she was such
an independent-minded woman

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.126
that when I said, no, I
don't want to do this.

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:09.760
She said, OK, do what you want.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.012
Do exactly what you want.

00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:12.970
In fact, she used to
always tell me two things.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.770
She used to tell me,
you know, in those days,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.490
we didn't have eggs
that we could freeze.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.310
So men, you have to get married,
because you need children.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.550
But otherwise, it's not
that important to have

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.840
men in your life.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.800
I'm sure she's smiling
today, because today,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.260
women are freezing their eggs.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.400
Just go to a sperm bank.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.358
I want that, that, that,
and they just tick off

00:10:35.358 --> 00:10:37.110
all their specifications.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.510
And we're done.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.210
That is true
empowerment, really,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.640
aside from financial
sort of empowerment,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.570
which to me, is the
beginning of any empowerment.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.550
You know, in India, we talk
so much about empowerment

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.240
and women's sort of--

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.550
that they don't have
enough independence.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.530
But it's a very
simple thing to me

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.050
that, in India,
half our population

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.570
is financially not independent.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.290
So a woman takes
so much from a man

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.550
because she simply can't
walk out of that door.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.340
She can't go back
to her parents,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.850
and she has no resources,
no education, no literacy

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.230
to look after herself.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.131
So I think before any
other kind of empowerment

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.380
that we talk about, we just
really, in India at least,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.440
we have to talk about that,
grassroots, getting them up

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.560
there to be able to say, I
will not take this nonsense.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.080
I will walk out of this door.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.800
But my mother, actually, was
I think a very forward looking

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.137
woman, that she said all that.

00:11:35.137 --> 00:11:37.470
And another thing she told
me, which was very important,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.930
which is all connected to
my being in the theater,

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.620
was that, look, never look for
other people and other sources

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.250
of happiness.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.590
Be the architect of
your own happiness.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.690
Everything else is a bonus.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.160
So if your kids love you, great.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.390
Your husband loves, great.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.800
If he doesn't, well, you're OK.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.540
You're OK because you
are the wellspring

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.260
of your own happiness.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.700
So all this sort of combined to
shape me to become what I am.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.846
So anyway, because they were
so strong and independent,

00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:07.470
I also could be strong
and independent.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.870
And I said, hey, I
don't want to do this.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.750
I don't want to be
a nuclear physicist.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.510
But what happened was a strange
thing, which I must share,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.480
because it will happen
to a lot of young people.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.040
That because I did something
that I was sort of impelled

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.240
from inside me to do, I felt
that this was a calling,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.750
the performing arts
was my calling,

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.150
but I was not able
to articulate why it

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.430
was that important right then.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.150
And I used to feel, right
up to till I was 40, that I

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.380
was a bit of a dilettante.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.421
My dad had this thing,
he'd come and see my plays

00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:44.610
and say, oh, Lillete,
well done, well done,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.780
you know, kind of thing.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.450
But it was like, well, if
you must play at all this,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.110
then so be it.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.720
I started doing films.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.112
I well recognized, and all that.

00:12:55.112 --> 00:12:56.820
But it didn't make
any difference to him.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.160
You know, he preferred
my theatre work anyway.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.440
And my mother was
a great beauty,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.510
and all her sisters
were great beauties.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.510
But in our family, it was
like, God gave you all that.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.950
So let's not worry
about all that.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.300
Work on yourself.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.230
So it was a very unusual
kind of a background.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.050
And so I decided
to do what it did,

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.000
but it took me a long time to
be comfortable with the fact

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.900
that what I did had
a lot of meaning,

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.960
had a lot of relevance,
that it was very important.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.670
And very often,
young people, when

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.470
they choose alternative careers,
which are not your engineer,

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.990
doctor, lawyer, computer
scientist, whatever,

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:43.440
the sort of general
well-acknowledged sort of life,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.940
a serious life, earnest
kind of professions.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.870
They feel a little like they've
disappointed their parents.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.390
You know, I mean, today,
sport is recognized

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.670
because it's very paying.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.170
And other professions
are recognized

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.520
because they're very paying.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.300
But let's say 30 years ago,
these people played cricket,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.370
but they were not
earning a lot of money.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.680
So things have changed a lot.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.240
But still, I see
young people who

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.550
are struggling
because this is not

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.890
the profession that their
parents would like them to do.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.310
Not at all.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.910
So then you have to
show your success.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.200
And it's not easy.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.290
A creative career is
the most difficult one

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.980
to even assess success.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.250
You have very easy
yardsticks in other fields.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.440
You know, a doctor has
a roaring practice,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.170
or he earns a huge
sort of amount of money

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.120
at NYU Medical Center, or
you know Sloan, or whatever.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.854
But how do you judge
the success of someone

00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:44.770
in the creative world?

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.030
It's extremely difficult.
And it changes all the time.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.780
Today, you're God, you have
three films that are bomb,

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780
and you're out of there.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.980
You're nobody.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.990
So it's such an elusive,
ephemeral kind of success

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.770
that we're talking about.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.810
AKSHAY THAKKER: Well,
and these days, it

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.660
sounds like the number
of YouTube followers

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.118
and Twitter followers you have
is a good measure of success

00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:07.060
as well.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.680
LILLETE DUBEY: I
didn't even know I o.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.190
AKSHAY THAKKER:
But to your point,

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.290
it does change over time.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.800
LILLETE DUBEY: Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.050
AKSHAY THAKKER: You
did a lot of work,

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.420
obviously, in Bollywood in
the arena, but also in the UK

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.990
and in Hollywood.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.030
How do you compare
the two experiences?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.450
LILLETE DUBEY: It's very simple.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.150
My heart, my soul, my body,
belongs to the theater.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.830
I'm a dyed in the
wool theatre person.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.360
And it's weird, because if you
meet a theater person, when

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.560
I was doing "Marigold, I
met Judi Dench and Maggie

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.980
Smith, who are died in the
wool, 60 years with the National

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.360
Theater in London.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.520
So there is an
immediate connect.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.950
It's a different kind of
binding, bonding, that happens.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.070
So my heart, everything
belongs to theatre.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.260
Because for me,
theater's where it's at.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.440
It's the last pure bastion left.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:05.400
It is still relatively
untainted by commerce.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.790
Now, I tell you a little
bit about my theater work,

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.540
because it's important
in the light of all

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.010
the questions you'll ask.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.140
I worked as an actress
for 15 years, like a diva,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.920
doing all the lead roles with
a person called Barry John,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.250
and had a whale of a time.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.833
And then I started
to decide to set up

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.750
my own company 27 years ago.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.680
So now you know exactly,
like a fossil, how old I am.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.660
And I decided I want to
do that for two reasons.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.470
Also, like I told you, there
was this slow understanding,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.350
why are the performing arts and,
therefore, theater important?

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.810
Why are they important?

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.510
What does art bring to us?

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.030
What is so important about art?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.130
And it was like
an epiphany at 40

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:52.636
for me, that you know, really,
art is what illuminates life.

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:53.760
It's what Shakespeare says.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.040
It's a mirror up to nature.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.820
We all live.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.347
We live a wonderful life.

00:16:58.347 --> 00:16:59.930
There are, of course,
Eureka moments--

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.690
a mathematician proves a theorem
which hasn't been proved,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.150
or a problem that hasn't been
proved for 50 years, or 30

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.650
years, and wow.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.180
It's a Eureka moment.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.150
A runner breaks that
marathon record.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.569
You know, there are Eureka
moments in every field.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.170
But for me, I feel that,
as a whole, the whole body

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.230
of the performing arts, and arts
as a whole, including painting,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:28.339
music, all that, these are the
things that really originalize,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.590
illuminate our lives, you know,
expand our horizons in ways,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.180
which to me, if you ask me what
is divinity, it is the arts.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.490
When we hear a wonderful piece
of music, when we see and read

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.290
an astounding poem.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.220
You know, we come closer to
something which is beyond us.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.490
So to me, it's really
spiritual almost.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.660
And it's something that
absolutely opens up

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.860
dimensions in our mind, which
we don't even know exist.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.460
So I realize the value of it.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.780
And more than that,
the value of--

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.310
you know, we live in
a technological age.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.220
OK, we're going more and
more into that little screen

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.570
for everything.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.670
Jug Saraiya, this wonderful
columnist in India,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.650
once wrote that,
"Many, many years ago,

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.290
that soon, there will
be one small little room

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.650
with a small little man with a
small little smartphone sitting

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:27.390
in a corner getting sex, food,
clothes, whatever he wants,

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.996
you know, in that
small little room."

00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:29.870
In a way, it's funny.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.340
In a way, it's scary.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.280
Because the human experience
is getting so contracted.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.790
So contracted.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.200
And a weird thing's happening.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.340
As much as we are looking for
that sort of the virtual world

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.410
in which we live, and the
digital world in which we live,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.420
we also crave--

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.650
because are ultimately
fireside storytellers.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.070
This is our DNA as well.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.830
So how do we connect
to each other?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.534
Our common humanity is
through shared experience.

00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:02.450
Why do I love theater?

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.533
Because it's not complete.

00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:06.510
If he's not there and I'm
not there, I could be here.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.260
It's not complete.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.790
He's there.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.910
It's not complete.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.900
We need those two
people to connect.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.460
So it's not just theater.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.150
It's music.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.660
It's dance.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.330
But specially theater,
especially theatre.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.690
I can still dance.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.950
You see, for
myself, I can dance.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.240
I can sing for myself.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.920
I can paint for myself.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.970
But can I perform for myself?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.790
No, I cannot.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.370
It has to be you with me
in that shared experience.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.022
And that's the beginning
of our common humanity.

00:19:35.022 --> 00:19:36.980
That's how we start
connecting with each other.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.850
You know?

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.207
And we tell stories, which are
universal, let me tell you.

00:19:41.207 --> 00:19:43.040
When I did a play called
"Dance Like a Man,"

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.290
in New York, the same one
that ran Off-Broadway,

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.400
"The New York Times" had
never covered an Indian play.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.000
And my raison d'etre with
starting a company was I

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.280
wanted to talk about the Indian
voice, Indian English voice,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.950
original voice,
in Indian theater.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.910
Why in English?

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.650
Because then, he can
understand my plays.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.020
He can understand.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.570
He can listen to the
stories, the plays,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.430
that have been written
by our playwrights.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.290
Very often people have asked me
to come, including in America,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.831
why don't you come
in direct to play?

00:20:14.831 --> 00:20:16.840
I said, but then, who
will tell our stories?

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.800
You have plenty of people
to tell your stories.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.090
We don't have anyone.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.580
We have a handful of
people to tell our stories.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.770
They need us to
tell our stories,

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.240
to tell a [NON-ENGLISH]
play, put it out there,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.000
or [NON-ENGLISH],, or
zillions of very talented--

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.490
I remember I did a play once,
and this very, very, very

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.170
well-known group from America
came and, this woman said, wow,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.850
that was fabulous.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:41.960
Who's written the play?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.140
So I said this guy
called Mahesh Elkunchwar.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.580
He's Indian?

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.800
I said, but it's so--

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.610
fantastic.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.276
I said, you know, I
don't know if that's

00:20:51.276 --> 00:20:52.660
a compliment or an insult?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.761
Because the way you're
asking me, it's like, oh,

00:20:55.761 --> 00:20:57.510
an Indian couldn't
have written that play.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.690
She's like, no, I really
mean it's so sophisticated.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.930
I don't think anybody--
so I said, thank you.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.040
You're just putting your foot
in your mouth again, and again,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.250
and again.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.850
You know?

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.230
Just stop.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.950
You know?

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.680
So I realized that's it.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.010
We have to-- so we are,
without being too immodest,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.600
the most traveled
company in India.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.690
We've done 3,000 shows in
India and abroad, right

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.420
from Wellington, New Zealand
to Portland, Seattle.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.274
And all through most
of the countries.

00:21:24.274 --> 00:21:25.440
I haven't been to China yet.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.060
I haven't been to Russia yet.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.760
I haven't been to
South America yet.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.390
A few continents left.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.150
But plenty have been taken to.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.180
And let me tell you the
most interesting thing.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.010
So I did it because not just
that I wanted to platform

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.150
Indian work, but I
wanted to see-- you know,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.500
the Indians have a habit.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.190
And I don't mean this badly, of
patting ourselves on the back

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.270
and saying, fabulous,
that was wonderful.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.160
Especially you go to
see a movie premiere,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.270
they're so hypocritical.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.270
Everything's mind-blowing, and
then they walk out of the room

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.950
and say, oh, god,
it was terrible.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.170
So you know?

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.470
But Indians do that.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.960
They sort of buck each other up.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.950
And they don't really
tell you the truth.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.490
So when you take an Indian play
outside and do it out there

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.550
in Kuala Lumpur, or in Bangkok,
no one's going to be generous.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.550
If it's good, it's good.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.790
If it's bad, it's awful.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.520
So to take a play
about [INAUDIBLE]----

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.990
now, [INAUDIBLE] you know, we
have a caste system in India,

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.364
which is horrible,
which is still

00:22:15.364 --> 00:22:19.800
sort of still in the
fabric of our lives,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.530
which is awful absolutely.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.960
So there were you know
the very, very educated,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.240
the less educated, the
warriors, and then the people

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.915
who clean your houses, and there
were always the untouchables.

00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:31.260
And Gandhi fought against.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.450
And so, it's a story about them.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.470
It's like, a black guy from
Harlem, very, very dirt poor,

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:45.020
marrying an Upper West
Side rich, rich white girl.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.800
You know?

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.450
So for me, that
story was about that.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.910
It was about culture clash.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.570
You know?

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.370
And however liberal
we are, you just

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.690
have to scratch the surface.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.064
And then if your daughter is
marrying someone like that--

00:22:56.064 --> 00:22:58.940
[INAUDIBLE] intellectuals,
armchair intellectuals saying,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.530
of course, we must integrate.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.030
We must do this, and all that.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.110
And then when it comes
into your own living room,

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.450
you can't handle it

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.200
So I was shocked that the play
like this could touch people

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.600
in Kuala Lumpur, could touch--

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.890
the subcontinent's OK.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.410
They understand all
these references.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.600
But for it to work in a Kuala
Lumpur, or a place like London,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.660
where non-Indians were
seeing it, but they got it.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.220
They got all that.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.516
It didn't have to be--
and I don't peddle it

00:23:28.516 --> 00:23:29.640
in a sort of sweetened way.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.160
We talk as we talk.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.770
If I'm Gujarati, I talk
like a [NON-ENGLISH]

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.390
or a [NON-ENGLISH].

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.400
And if I'm a South
Indian, I talk like that.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.367
I mean, clear, but
with an accent.

00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:41.450
And people said, oh, you
can't do plays like this.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.408
Nobody will understand.

00:23:42.408 --> 00:23:44.300
I said, hell, I come to America.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.824
I go hear James Earl Jones doing
"Fences" with a Harlem accent,

00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:49.490
and I have to say,
hello, what was that,

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.850
what was that, what was that?

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.400
I didn't understand
half the play.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.500
But I still loved
the experience.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.022
So we have to
enter those worlds.

00:23:56.022 --> 00:23:57.980
We're not going to give
it to you on a platter.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.301
Come, I will explain what
this means and that means.

00:24:00.301 --> 00:24:00.800
No, no, no.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.091
We're going to explain nothing.

00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:05.060
You come here, you
enter our world.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.020
And then you see the
universality of the stories.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.880
Because like the
"Natyashastra," which

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.780
is a great book,
5,000 year old book

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.760
that talks about the
performing arts--

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.130
I don't think there's an
older book than that--

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.740
talks about the
seven emotions only

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.480
that human beings go through,
the nine [INAUDIBLE],,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.340
so the dance, then
music, then theater.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.410
And I was shocked.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.750
I knew why "The New York
Times" is so respected,

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.640
because when we
performed there, they

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.920
gave us a half page
review on their Arts Page

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.690
on a Friday arts review.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.060
It's like a Bible.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.390
So I didn't know that they
came quietly, they saw it,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.800
they quietly wrote this
review, and it came out.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.977
And my friends in the
theater and in New York

00:24:47.977 --> 00:24:50.060
said, my god, you've been
performing for 20 years,

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.070
and "The New York
Times" never covered us.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.200
So they covered us, and
what was very interesting

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.775
was, I believe it was a very
tough critique, and all that.

00:24:57.775 --> 00:24:59.150
And he gave us a
glowing reviews.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.191
But that's not the point.

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:04.130
At the end of it, he
quoted the "Natyashastra."

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.500
And I said, my god,
this old white guy,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.210
who was like 70 years old, he
really has done his homework.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.449
And he's gone to
the "Natyashastra,"

00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:14.990
and he gave us the
biggest compliment

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.620
I've ever got, because he
said, "The lofty ideals

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.460
of the "Natyashastra" may
be very difficult for humans

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.370
to achieve, but this play
comes pretty damn close."

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.960
And I thought that was such
a marvelous compliment.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.546
And another one important
wrote about how,

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:33.420
you know, you enter this
play, and you think,

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.460
oh silk saris, and Indian
music, and flowers in the hair,

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.420
and about classical
[INAUDIBLE] dances.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.319
And are we going
to get any of this?

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.360
And at the end of the
play, you say, my god, this

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.570
is as familiar to me, this
story with its relationships,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:53.340
and its conflicts, and its
everything, as my kitchen sink.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.620
So that is the idea, that we
open doors of understanding,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.730
we celebrate our
differences, but we

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.380
open doors of understanding.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.370
And in that, art has
such a huge role to play.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.100
Such a huge.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.600
Role sports does, but sports
is more in that arena of,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.620
you know, at some point, we
get a little nationalistic.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.120
OK?

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.037
Let's admit it.

00:26:16.037 --> 00:26:17.370
In art, you don't get like that.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.920
If there's some
wonderful singer--

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.490
I heard a fabulous band called
[INAUDIBLE] from Algeria.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.600
The desert music, the
Grammy award winner.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.430
They just held them
recently in Mumbai.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.620
It didn't matter I didn't
understand their language.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.960
I didn't understand their--

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.990
I understood nothing of the
reference or the context.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.280
But I said, wow, what music.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.410
So it elevates us.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.490
It takes us somewhere else.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.060
It celebrates all
the differences.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.880
But it just brings
us all together

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.360
in such an amazing
way, that I realize,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.800
that's why I love the arts.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.690
That's why I want
to be where I am.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.440
And my theater especially,
not just Indian,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.070
it's also about
exploring subjects.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.740
Again, film is so
determined by commerce

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.890
that, unless it's a very small,
very independent film that

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.390
is exploring something
very explosive, in theater,

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.380
you can do that.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.220
You can do that.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.800
I mean, my plays go
from sexual abuse

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:23.400
to the first main screenplay on
homosexuality, which is still

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.490
a punishable offense in India.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.330
Can you believe it?

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.730
How archaic is that?

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.890
To Gandhi's
philosophy, and how did

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.630
Gandhi had these
out of the box--

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.820
we talk about out
of the box ideas.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.370
Each and every idea of
Gandhi's was out of the box,

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.790
[NON-ENGLISH],,
nonviolence, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.950
Everything, if you examine,
it's a brilliant play,

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.540
it's got many awards.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.180
And when you see an Arab
sitting after the play

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.600
and talking to me about Gandhi,
and it is so fascinating,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.760
and you think this
is a country--

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.740
what would this Arab
know about Gandhi?

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.910
But he's fascinated.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.250
It's fascinating,
because the play

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:04.227
was a play that explored Gandhi,
was sort of the common jewel.

00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:05.310
And there was the Mahatma.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.060
And there were these
debates between them.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:07.710
You know?

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.179
And through that, he said,
you know, you could do this.

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:11.220
He said, I can't do that.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.860
I'm just an ordinary fellow.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.890
How can I do all this.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.280
He said, why?

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.786
One person can
make a difference.

00:28:16.786 --> 00:28:18.160
He said, oh, don't
talk nonsense.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.060
One person can do anything.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.350
And that's how he said, be
the change you want to be.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.320
Because one person can do it.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.940
Two people, what are their
names, who started Google?

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.940
Two guys sat together.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.960
AKSHAY THAKKER: Yeah,
Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.751
LILLETE DUBEY: Yeah,
they just sat together

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:34.955
one day, two PhD students
and said, hey, let's do this.

00:28:34.955 --> 00:28:35.830
And that's all it is.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.538
And you guys know it
better than anybody.

00:28:37.538 --> 00:28:41.150
It's just an idea,
the germ of an idea.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.217
So to have an Arab
talking about Gandhi

00:28:44.217 --> 00:28:46.550
was very strange, with all
their robes and all this out,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.850
and they discussed it
after the play in Dubai

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.040
and in Moscow, they used
to talk about Gandhi.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.560
So it could be
Gandhi's philosophy.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.652
It could be Zen Buddhism.

00:28:53.652 --> 00:28:55.360
I've done a play on
Buddhism, because you

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.940
know zen comes from Dhyana,
and Dhyana is meditation.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.870
And it's founded by [INAUDIBLE]
King, who was so weak,

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.570
he couldn't breathe.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.180
The King was going
to throw him away.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.580
The King was this wrestler
and, you know, very macho,

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.160
and all that.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.060
And he has this little
weakling of a prince who's

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.680
puffing away because
he's a blue baby,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.970
and he says, just chuck him.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.140
We don't need him.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.580
And the Brahmin, who did
the [INAUDIBLE] for him,

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.080
says, no, I'll keep it.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.560
And he teaches him yoga.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.030
And he teaches him how to read,
and he teaches him exercises,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.300
so that he learns and he
creates the martial arts

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:41.460
and becomes a 28 sort of sort
of high priest of Buddhism,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.210
goes there to China,
and they couldn't

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.880
pronounce Dhyana, so it became,
tian, chan, john, zane, zan.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.930
Bu tthe time it hit
Japan, it was zen.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:51.900
You know?

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.110
And I was so fascinated,
because I said.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.520
This is from India.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.380
Nobody even knows this.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.700
And then we did it in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Bangkok,

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.430
that whole belt over there.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.660
And people were fascinated.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.810
And I said, hello, it
all comes from here.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.390
I, mean I'm sorry, but what
can I do if everything just

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.230
started in India?

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.450
The zero came from here.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.830
This came from there.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.146
So the subjects I choose
are very eclectic.

00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:20.646
You know, now, "Gauhar," when
I was doing "Gauhar," everyone

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:27.590
said, a woman in 1902 singing
some old classical Indian

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.600
music, I mean, OK.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.630
So she was the one that sang
first on a vinyl record.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.582
So she made history.

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:35.540
And she was like an Amy
Winehouse of her times,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.377
without the drugs, I think.

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:38.960
Maybe she was doing
opium on the side.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.980
Who knows?

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.140
But she sang.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.120
She composed.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.130
She wrote her own lyrics at 15.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.260
She sang in 20 languages.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.260
She was on, you know,
like little matchboxes.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.670
And whatever kind of publicity
they had all over Europe,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.510
she was huge.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.190
She was a rock star of her time.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.565
And people had
been uninterested.

00:30:59.565 --> 00:31:02.900
They said, well, who was
interested in this thing?

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.691
And it's been such
a huge success.

00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:06.440
Because, of course,
people are interested.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.460
Why wouldn't they be?

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.669
My job is to make them
interested, if I'm interested.

00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:12.168
Then I have to make you-- engage
you-- to get you interested

00:31:12.168 --> 00:31:14.630
in what I'm seeing, and why
I feel it's important for you

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.830
to know this.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:21.860
So it has-- it's the kind of
work one does, also, is like--

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.310
and the chance for me
to be part of theater.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.460
You know, the play on
sexual abuse was, I think,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.070
particularly moving
because it was

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.220
commissioned by
an NGO that works

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.055
with survivors of sexual abuse.

00:31:36.055 --> 00:31:37.430
And when we did
it, we had people

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.730
after every show
coming and crying

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.800
because their own stories
came back to them,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.420
which were very suppressed.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.850
But more than that, men came
to me and said, you know,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.250
I don't think I'll ever
leave a daughter of mine

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.490
alone with a male
servant ever in my life.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.130
Even for like half an hour,
because he was so scared.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:03.500
And then people said,
why only a young girl?

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.790
Even a young boy
can be molested.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.950
So I would not leave
any of my children

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.220
alone with somebody I
didn't trust at all.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.130
So it has a very--

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.020
I don't do only
that kind of work.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.680
But really, if you use
it as a tool of change,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.185
it has enormous power, enormous
power, to transform things.

00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:28.890
And the best theater, which I
hope mine does to some extent,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.890
is that it must make you
look at the world anew.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.660
To examine things
anew, provoke you

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.880
to think about things
in a different way,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.350
to re-examine things, to
understand the world anew.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.390
And the best theatre
does do that.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.930
The best writing does do that.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.310
Art can do that.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:53.070
So then I started realizing the
power of the performing arts.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.880
I mean, they're limitless,
as your field is

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.060
limitless in where it can go.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.770
You know, maybe none
of us will exist.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.950
They'll just be two
AI sort of types

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.380
sitting over here and talking.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.460
But whatever, whatever.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.110
You know?

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.290
So to me, it's that infinite
possibilities of what theatre

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:17.820
can do, what the stage
can be a crucible for.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.510
That is very, very exciting.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.920
AKSHAY THAKKER: So you made a
really good point about theatre

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.990
being a tool to tell stories.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.330
And you've certainly taken
that across the world.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.930
And here in the Western world,
we have a very strong theatre

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.170
culture, very strong
theater scene, you know,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.780
the likes of "The
Book of Mormon."

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.489
Very common name.

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:40.155
LILLETE DUBEY: Well,
I wouldn't use that

00:33:40.155 --> 00:33:41.520
as my top of the list example.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.067
[LAUGHING]

00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:44.650
AKSHAY THAKKER: Well, my point
is, these are very common names

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.733
that a lot of people know.

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.794
Now, theatre in India has a
very-- almost a cult following.

00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:50.710
People follow it, and
then most of the country

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.225
doesn't actually follow it.

00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:53.350
Are you seeing this change?

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.850
Are you--

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.679
LILLETE DUBEY: What do you mean?

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:57.970
AKSHAY THAKKER: Most people,
when you grow up and going

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.830
through India, you don't really
go to theatre or watch plays.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.462
That's not a thing
most people do.

00:34:02.462 --> 00:34:04.420
LILLETE DUBEY: Because
theatre's never been a--

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:04.705
AKSHAY THAKKER: Right.

00:34:04.705 --> 00:34:05.500
And this is my question to you.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.350
LILLETE DUBEY: --habit.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.590
AKSHAY THAKKER: Right.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.715
This is my question to you.

00:34:07.715 --> 00:34:09.219
Are you seeing this
change in India?

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.462
Is this culture growing,
or is [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:11.462 --> 00:34:12.670
LILLETE DUBEY: Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.610
The thing, I think,
firstly, we have

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:20.650
a very strong tradition of
what I call the folk theater.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.389
It's very alive
and very kicking,

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.400
and it's very much there.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.130
But we're talking about a
more urban kind of theater.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.040
So that kind of theater
is definitely growing.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.670
And in some languages-- you
know, India's so diverse.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.830
I don't know any other
country as diverse as that.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.679
I mean, 37 languages,
dialects, god

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.239
knows how many
whatever, whatever.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.960
So I mean, I can't even
count the number of--

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.270
I go down south in
India, and I sometimes

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.520
feel I'm in an alien
country, really,

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.159
sometimes, because
it's so diametrically

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.230
different, the culture.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:58.240
And so what I was saying
was that in some states,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.957
like Gujarat, like
Maharashtra, like let's

00:35:02.957 --> 00:35:05.230
say, Canada, Bangalore.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.880
In some languages, it's
a thriving culture,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.930
theater scene, where theater is
done, like Marathi theater, 30

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.770
plays a month, sometimes 35.

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.270
Double ones on
weekends and all that.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.780
And it's commercially viable,
and people live by theater.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.550
Gujurati is a very
commercial theater.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.299
So it's the Hindi and English
theater which is not so--

00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:31.840
you know, but in a
place like Bombay,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.880
because they have
access, like in New York,

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.302
they can do so
many other things.

00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:36.760
They don't only
have to do theater.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.860
They can be on television.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.860
They can do commercials.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.270
They can host events.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.300
They can a voicing.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.610
They can do films.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.420
They can do web series.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.730
So they're are working actors.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.450
They can do lots
of other things.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.660
But yes, it is not like--

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.260
but let me tell you,
in America also,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.210
it's only the big Broadway
shows that an actor can actually

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.050
live on.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.010
If he's doing smaller
theaters, no way.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.450
He has to do other stuff.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.220
He has to.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.810
It's just that in
a Broadway gig,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.810
he's sure of income for a
year, or so many months,

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:08.860
or whatever, whatever.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.470
But then, again, he's out
there auditioning, auditioning,

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.770
auditioning, hoping to
get that next good gig.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.230
So it's one of the most
uncertain businesses

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.670
in the world, being an actor.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.690
Let me tell you.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.530
[LAUGHING]

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.135
AKSHAY THAKKER:
So you were here--

00:36:24.135 --> 00:36:25.300
LILLETE DUBEY: But
things are changing,

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.550
which is what I was coming to.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.306
A lot of young people are very
interested in doing theater.

00:36:29.306 --> 00:36:31.680
And one of the things we did
do, and I will say it again,

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.620
a little immodestly, is
we were the first to start

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.660
working with Indian writing.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.514
So once that door opened,
you see we always did,

00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:41.680
especially theatre in,
English, which is derivative.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.350
We did a Tennessee Williams,
an Arthur Miller, a Neil Simon,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.320
or of course Shakespeare
and Brecht, from you know,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.870
whatever, whatever, so
many wonderful playwrights

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:52.560
in the West.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.476
And people keep saying,
why don't you do them?

00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:56.750
I said, because the whole
world is there to do them.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.460
I have to do my stuff.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.730
Once in a blue moon, I get
seduced by a fabulous script,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.790
and I do it.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.951
But that's like, one-off.

00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:04.450
You know.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.710
Or I feel it's so
universal, like I'm

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.590
doing a play, which
is about the Iraq war,

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.630
about survivors of the Iraq
war between the two Gulf wars.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.660
And it's just such a
potent piece of theater.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.990
And it's a one woman show,
which my daughter does.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.400
And she's incredible in it.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.780
It's about survival.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.830
It's about violence.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.130
It's about the times we live.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.862
And so it doesn't matter.

00:37:24.862 --> 00:37:25.570
It could be Iraq.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:26.510
It could be Timbuktu.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.954
It could be Bombay.

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:29.370
We've had terrorist
attacks there.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.350
We're having them
all over the world.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.190
So how to survive in
an age of violence.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.290
And women-- because
you see women

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.010
aren't the ones
who perpetrate it,

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.560
but they are the ones
who live with it.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.860
Men go out there
to do their stuff,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.340
to prove themselves, in whatever
way they think they have to.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.620
But the women pay the price.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.460
So these are the stories
of women survivors,

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.980
and how they deal with
a 8-year-old child who

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.900
plays with bullets,
makes chains out of them,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.800
and is very proud of
her little M16 bullets.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.015
Two women, somebody
in exile who's

00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:09.260
staying in London, who's very
upset about what's going on,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.670
but can't go then handle it,
to a painter who compromises,

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.460
who does what she has to
do, but she has to paint.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.170
So she doesn't care.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.020
So you know, those
stories are so universal,

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.680
that all geographical,
social cultural references

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.510
become absolutely irrelevant.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.370
Then sometimes I do them.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.590
But yeah, theater
in Bombay at least,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.110
it's growing exponentially.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.980
But we can never compare it to
film, television, and all that.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.640
You know?

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.865
That's our mistake.

00:38:38.865 --> 00:38:39.740
We keep comparing it.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.390
It's a niche medium.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.150
A play of mine, like
"Dance Like a Man,"

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.680
that I've done 600 shows
of, you multiply that even

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.950
by 1,000 people per
show, how many is that?

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.075
Yeah, that's not very many.

00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:52.574
But movies reach
millions of people.

00:38:52.574 --> 00:38:54.030
In one weekend,
somebody will see

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.130
a movie of mine, which is
at least 100 times that.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.770
So how can you compare the two.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.520
But look at the freedom you have
artistically, creatively, when

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.710
you do work in the theater.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.640
You can do that sort of
work in film as an actor,

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.567
or as a director-producer.

00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:14.400
AKSHAY THAKKER: So two
of your cast members,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.220
Rajeshwari Sachdev and Zila.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.636
LILLETE DUBEY: Are
very much here.

00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:18.553
Three of them are here
from the play "Gauhar."

00:39:18.553 --> 00:39:20.552
AKSHAY THAKKER: Wonderful,
they're in the crowd.

00:39:20.552 --> 00:39:22.410
Could you tell us a
little bit about how

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.120
you decided to cast
them, and that I'd

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.900
like to bring up on stage
chat with them a little bit.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.691
LILLETE DUBEY: Yes.

00:39:26.691 --> 00:39:27.560
Very much.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.800
So I was looking--

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.320
you know, in India,
we don't have

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.070
a concept of training
in musical theater,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.750
because that needs
special skills.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.710
You need to be an actor.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.380
You need to be a good singer.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.660
You need to be
preferably a good dancer,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.360
and have enormous
stage presence.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.790
And that's all, all
rolled into one.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:47.890
Nothing much.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.910
So since we don't have
trained actors like that,

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.940
it's particularly
difficult in India.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.550
Abroad, they go to
drama school, they

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.750
specialize in musical theater.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.600
So it's much easier.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.210
But that didn't dawn
to me, of course.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.450
And the play was written,
actually, not as a musical.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.860
I had done musicals.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.240
This was written
as a play, which

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.140
is a drama about her life.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.920
And we have to
Gauhar, the younger,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.380
up to a certain age, and
then the older Gauhar.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.046
And so, Mahesh, who
adapted it, it's

00:40:22.046 --> 00:40:24.420
from a wonderful book, which
is researched for five years

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.930
by Vikram Sampath on his own
steam at his own expense,

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.467
because he was
fascinated by her.

00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:31.800
I think he was half in love
with this girl [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.450
And he wrote the book.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.400
Then I liked the book very much.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.740
I asked a very very
eminent playwright of our,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.970
who was assigned Academy winner,
Mahesh Dattani to write it

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.230
as a play.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.660
And then there was
this triumvirate talks

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.365
going on, you know,
about, I want this,

00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:48.990
no, I want that, no,
I don't want that,

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.115
and all that sort of thing.

00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:52.136
So finally, we got
the script together.

00:40:52.136 --> 00:40:53.760
And he said, we'll
just play her music.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.010
Now this is, again,
thanks to Google.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.320
So how do we find her music?

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.630
Because she sang in 1902.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.340
And so we Googled her, we went
to YouTube, and found her.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.840
And I said, oh, my god.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.880
Because it was a very
primitive recording.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.070
[INAUDIBLE] records, the
very first records ever made.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:19.290
And she did something, and she
was a fabulously fascinating

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.870
woman on many counts.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.064
I won't go into that.

00:41:22.064 --> 00:41:24.480
But she took up the gauntlet--
she picked up the gauntlet.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.470
Because an Indian [INAUDIBLE]
can go on for three hours.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.070
It's just this one phrase,
which you just keep singing,

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.520
and it's like jazz.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.180
You keep improving,
improving, improving.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.920
And the more of a
virtuoso you are,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.250
the more you will improv
to show your skills.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.990
Because there's just
the seven notes,

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.330
and you're doing all
kinds of things with them.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:52.350
So she had to do that in
two and and a half minutes.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.750
She had to do the prelude,
the central section,

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.310
and the climax.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.800
And all the purests turned
up their noses and said,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.017
this is blasphemy.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.350
You can't do this sort of thing.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.330
And she said, show me the money.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.160
So they paid us, in those days,
I don't know what it would be.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.230
3,000 rupees a
recording in 1902.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.549
What would that be today?

00:42:11.549 --> 00:42:12.090
I don't know.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.632
How many thousands of dollars?

00:42:13.632 --> 00:42:14.715
AKSHAY THAKKER: Google it.

00:42:14.715 --> 00:42:15.506
LILLETE DUBEY: Huh?

00:42:15.506 --> 00:42:16.137
Google it.

00:42:16.137 --> 00:42:20.860
[LAUGHING] So anyway, some
obscene amount of money.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.890
And she said, can be done.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.380
And even her mother
said, what are you doing?

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.040
Our gurus will be very shocked.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.451
You can't do this sort of thing.

00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:29.700
So she said, I have to try it.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.030
I'm going to try it.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.090
And so that's why
she was the first.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.770
Everybody followed suit later.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.730
But she said, I will do it.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.240
So she was a path breaker.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.400
I think it's an appropriate
thing that I found her

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.420
on the net through Google,
and I'm sitting here

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.680
talking about her,
and she, like Google,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.560
was someone who loved new ideas.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.180
You know?

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.950
She kept telling her mother,
they had all these patrons,

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:58.490
these maharajas,
and all, you know,

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.406
who used to call them
for concerts and things.

00:43:00.406 --> 00:43:02.830
And she said the
patrons of the new world

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.737
at the mouths of the New World
would find us our patrons.

00:43:05.737 --> 00:43:08.070
So we don't have to worry
about these maharajas anymore.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.710
This is technology.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.700
This is what's going to live.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.750
You know?

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:15.500
And she says that.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.041
There's a moving moment at the
end of the play when she says,

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:20.010
you know, I went to hear
a concert, and I said,

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:20.920
this is my music.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.680
This guy is singing my song.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.180
And I told everybody,
and they said,

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.860
ha ha, this crazy old lady.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.140
This biddy, how can
this be her music?

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.330
And she said, it doesn't matter.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.760
My name also will be
forgotten, but my music

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.500
will live on that record.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.030
And it will always be there.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.440
And that is why
we're here today.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.910
Because our music lessons.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.820
And we can access it
through technology.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:46.120
So much as I am a great
believer in the human touch,

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.370
and I'm really old-fashioned--

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:51.210
I still prefer smelling
a book, feeling the page,

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.560
all that with my coffee.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.780
I'm not a Kindle person.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.080
But having said
that, technology can

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.800
be used very creatively
in the arts as well.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.300
You know?

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.850
It should not
become a substitute,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.080
and it shouldn't become
packaging or gimmicky,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.050
but it can add a lot.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.850
We've seen it in
so many industries.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.340
I mean, the music industry,
and this, and that.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.540
It brings a lot.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.370
It brings a lot.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.860
And it also reflects our times.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.940
These are our times.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.340
These are technological times.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.834
So even our art should--

00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:25.500
you don't, I have a
friend [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:32.130
Her husband is doing paintings
on a smartphone with a stylus.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.570
And he's doing
these exhibitions,

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.800
and they're selling out.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.840
They're selling
out his paintings.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.920
They not be expensive, but
it's a new way to paint. .

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.940
And it's still art.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.210
So, it's wonderful.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.809
I mean, there's
the installations.

00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:45.600
There's visual art.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.120
There's so much use of
technology now in the arts.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.050
But as long as we don't
lose the human connect.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.400
That's all that's important.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.610
So I had a bit of a problem
because I said, now,

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:57.420
what I going to do?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.434
I need two wonderful--

00:44:59.434 --> 00:45:01.350
I mean, I need a wonderful
cast, because there

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.660
are many other wonderful
actors in the play.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.310
But we need two wonderful
"Gauhars" who can sing,

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:08.370
who can act.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.000
So the younger one was
Rajeshwari Sachdev,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.750
who is very talented
actress, who

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.360
also has cut albums and sung.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.830
And she's a very nice
[NON-ENGLISH] dancer,

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.220
though she's doing
[NON-ENGLISH] in the play.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.860
And she's a very fine actress.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.510
National award- winning actress.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.850
So I sort of zoned into her, and
I said, she's the one I want,

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.210
and she was also very
thrilled with the box.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.820
Now there was the
older "Gauhar."

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.460
And the play wasn't conceived
with music, but I decided no.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.010
When I heard those
YouTube scratchy recording

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.696
and this nasal voice,
I said, my God,

00:45:41.696 --> 00:45:43.830
we're doing her a disservice
if we played this.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.420
People will say,
well, why are they

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.180
doing a play about a woman
who sounded God-awful.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.757
So we're not going to do that.

00:45:49.757 --> 00:45:51.340
If we're going to
present, we're going

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.390
to present her the
best that she could be,

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.340
as she must have
sounded when she

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.220
sang like this at
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.690
concert or something.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.972
So that made my job
even more difficult,

00:46:02.972 --> 00:46:04.680
and then I decided I
want live musicians.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.530
And one of the instruments of
that period was [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.150
which is kind of--
what would you say?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.070
Kind of violin at that time.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.420
So there's very few people who
are playing that instrument

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.970
anymore, and a [INAUDIBLE]
player, and a harmonium player,

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.470
and all that.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.189
And musicians are their
own sort of divas.

00:46:23.189 --> 00:46:24.980
So they say, yeah,
today, [INAUDIBLE] come.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.480
OK.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.660
Tomorrow, maybe we can come,
and all that sort of thing.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.470
So I pulled out a wild
card for the second one.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.280
I had heard her sing, and
she has a magnificent voice.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.160
Really magnificent.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.230
She's a great
[INAUDIBLE] daughter,

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.810
who learned music at
her father's knee,

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.210
where she went at eight
and said she was very

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.920
depressed and extremely sad.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.560
And he said, why is
that, my darling?

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.460
And she said, because
nobody's teaching me music

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.320
because she was a
girl, and all the boys

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.490
were being taught music.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.990
So he said, all right.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.890
We can fix that.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.910
So she started
learning from him.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:06.620
And she's a Sufi
singer, and she sings

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.462
in many, many sort of styles.

00:47:08.462 --> 00:47:10.920
So I'd heard her sing, and I
thought, what a fabulous voice

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.310
she has.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.570
And I know she hadn't acted.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:16.860
I mean, she did something very
small long, long back on stage,

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.440
but she has enormous stage
presence, lovely voice,

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.150
and lovely speaking
voice as well.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.556
And I said, you know what?

00:47:24.556 --> 00:47:25.680
What I'm going to take her.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.220
And everyone, oh, she
has a fabulous voice,

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.390
but are you sure you want
to take her as an actor?

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.860
I said, I want to
take her as an actor.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.280
And she's done a marvelous job.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.690
I mean, she sings, and
it blows your socks off.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.560
But that aside, she's done a
lovely job of the play as well.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.260
So we have these two Gauhars.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.460
And then, we have Danny Sura,
who plays multiple parts.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.740
He's an actor who
moved from London.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.570
He's a trained actor from
London who moved to India.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:55.340
And he plays many,
many roles in the play.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.680
And we have four other actors.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.260
We have two young actresses
who are from here,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.610
from the Bay Area,
who have small roles,

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.820
which we case here,
[? Sukanya ?] and [? Sandra, ?]

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.837
the two beauties
sitting next to Danny.

00:48:09.837 --> 00:48:11.420
And then we have
another person called

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:18.230
Rajiv, who's coming in
tomorrow, and Denzil Smith, who

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.280
plays the father of Gauhar
when she was young and also

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.370
[? Gainsbourg, ?] the American
Anglo-phile sort of engineer

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.060
who went-- he was American,
but he stayed in England,

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.400
so he was more Brit
than an American.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.540
And he went to look
for the big star

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.280
for the gramophone
company, who would

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.956
sing for the first time
on the vinyl record.

00:48:39.956 --> 00:48:41.330
So there was a
great opera singer

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.520
who sang at the same
time that Gauhar sang.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.610
So they both sang in
different parts of the world

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.890
and cut a record
at the same time.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.690
And he comes down.

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:52.190
I was hoping he'd
be here because he

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.100
has a little lovely speech when
he tells us about how he landed

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.540
here, and how that
one record changed

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.030
the history of
Indian music forever,

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.880
that record that she sang, the
first record that she sang.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.992
So it's sort of
connected to technology.

00:49:06.992 --> 00:49:08.450
I was thinking
about it last night,

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.160
and I said, how
appropriate that I'm

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.370
coming to Google with Gauhar
and talking about Gauhar,

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.910
which, actually, at
its base, the play

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:20.850
has the historical
importance of technology.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:21.830
Really.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:25.220
So that was quite
serendipitous, I think.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.480
[LAUGHING]

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.795
AKSHAY THAKKER: Let's
invite them on stage.

00:49:28.795 --> 00:49:30.795
LILLETE DUBEY: Rajeshwari
Sachdev and Zila Khan.

00:49:30.795 --> 00:49:33.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.396
LILLETE DUBEY: Come on them.

00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:40.764
Hi, everyone.

00:49:40.764 --> 00:49:41.680
AKSHAY THAKKER: Hello.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:54.760
So Rajeshwari, you play the
younger Gauhar in the play.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.640
How do you balance sort of
adding your own creative touch

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.057
to his character, while still
being true to the real person?

00:50:02.057 --> 00:50:04.140
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: Oh,
what a difficult question.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.580
As an actor, it is our job
to understand the part,

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.340
and that only comes with a lot
of study about the character

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.250
that you're doing and
she, unfortunately,

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.589
is not in front of us.

00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:18.630
I'm sorry about my voice.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.039
A bad case of laryngitis.

00:50:21.039 --> 00:50:23.330
LILLETE DUBEY: But it will
fine by Saturday and Sunday.

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.406
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: It will
be fine by Saturday, Sunday.

00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:25.906
Yes.

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:30.000
You have to study your part.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.249
It's very good if you have
a living character to play,

00:50:32.249 --> 00:50:33.420
so you can see the person.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:37.650
But we were very fortunate that
Vikram Sampah wrote a book,

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.180
"My Name Is Gauhar Jaan."

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.230
LILLETE DUBEY:
Meticulously researched.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:41.850
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
Meticulously researched.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.810
Every little part.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.540
He tried to piece
together all her letters,

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.160
and what her life
would have been,

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.570
and the society of those times.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.310
It's so well-explained,
so detailed,

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.920
that it was a cakewalk
after that honestly,

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.961
because it is all
on a platter for us.

00:50:57.961 --> 00:51:00.210
LILLETE DUBEY: But also, I
think it's interesting when

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:04.200
[INAUDIBLE] is not there,
it also gives you that space

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.490
to fill those that--

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:07.531
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: That
also works in the script

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:09.870
because, obviously, you
can't put the whole book

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.700
in a two-hour play.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.590
Now, to get that message
across to the audience-- now,

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.130
I have the read book, so I
know where it comes from, what

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.720
we have derived, from where.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.510
But when as an actor,
I'm piecing together

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.240
bits of our life,
there's a lot that I'm

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.940
bringing to that one scene,
which the audience is not

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.520
fully aware of, because
there's a study that's gone.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.420
So that's interesting, trying
to put things in between lines,

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.920
in those moments,
and those pauses,

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.750
trying to add that extra.

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.820
That's always an exciting
journey for an actor.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:44.490
And I think that's process we
have in every part that we do.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:47.070
AKSHAY THAKKER: A lot of us
here in the crowd grew up

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.490
in the indie pop era, and
listening to your work

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.700
was just natural for us.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:58.400
So I know you're recovering
from a throat issue.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.180
So if you're
comfortable with this,

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.010
and if you don't mind singing
us one line of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:03.860
it would be lovely.

00:52:06.435 --> 00:52:07.560
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: My god.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.430
Should I try that?

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.630
OK.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:09.770
I have to take my
director's punishment,

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.440
because she's asked me to keep
my mouth shut till my show.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.080
Save you voice.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.390
LILLETE DUBEY: Not that she's
doing anything of the kind.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.098
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
No, I am, I am, I am.

00:52:16.098 --> 00:52:18.300
[INAUDIBLE] I would
have measured it out.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.170
But I can try.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.440
Maybe I cannot really belt it.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.850
LILLETE DUBEY: Just
a couple of lines.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.270
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:52:47.433 --> 00:52:48.715
LILLETE DUBEY: Lovely.

00:52:48.715 --> 00:52:49.798
AKSHAY THAKKER: Thank you.

00:52:49.798 --> 00:52:51.048
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: Thank you.

00:52:54.287 --> 00:52:56.370
LILLETE DUBEY: I'm going
to make them sing anyway.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.890
She's going to sing less,
because she's done her bit.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.790
AKSHAY THAKKER:
[INAUDIBLE],, you've

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.630
obviously been singing for
a long time in your life.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:09.570
How did you prepare for
this role portraying

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:10.650
a character who has--

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.530
ZILA KHAN: Lillete helped me.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.300
Every step of the
way, she helped me,

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.990
and she helped me open those
sometimes painful, sometimes

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:27.270
lovely visuals in your life that
that women and men go through.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.630
And then she opened--

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:29.880
and she made it so easy.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.780
She is a fantastic
director, because--

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.880
and I'm not just saying
it here, because it

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.380
was very difficult for me.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.690
Singing my concerts,
which I always do,

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:44.010
is a different skill set, as
Lillete had already mentioned.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.590
And the play has its own pace.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.250
When we are doing concerts, we
are doing it at our own pace.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.700
It is my pace.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.980
But a play has its
pace of its own,

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.292
and you have to play along
with the pace of the play.

00:53:58.292 --> 00:54:00.000
LILLETE DUBEY: And
you're part of a team.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.780
ZILA KHAN: And the
part of the team,

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:06.030
the pace of the play, the
back and forth of dialogues.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:10.050
And [? now, ?] everybody
helped, including the boys.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:14.220
And Lillete's way of
explaining direction really

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:20.450
helped me a lot, but I've been
fortunate to have lovely gurus.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.880
My father was an
amazing guru in music.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.600
He used to explain each
and every little thing

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.830
and open it out.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.380
And in my acting, this one.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.870
And this, one this gorgeous
one, who I've enjoyed her talk.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.580
And I'm so proud of you.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.840
As an Indian, as a
woman, it's so important

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.570
to be associated with a
production as fabulous as this,

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:52.530
and in coming here, and
production as fabulous as--

00:54:55.265 --> 00:54:58.305
LILLETE DUBEY:
[INAUDIBLE] She was like--

00:54:58.305 --> 00:55:02.666
[LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE]
OK, no problem.

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:05.160
The music was not,
but I must tell you

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.030
that she worked very hard.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.560
You know, what I loved about
her was that, at this age,

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.780
where you are so, so respected
and admired in your field,

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.910
and you've reached
such a height,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:22.290
to challenge yourself and
risk all that in a new area,

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:24.390
it needs a lot of
courage, and I love that.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:26.100
I mean, I love doing new things.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.740
I love doing new things
to keep myself fresh.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.720
People say, what's the
best thing you've done?

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.237
What's the best
play you've done?

00:55:32.237 --> 00:55:33.320
The best film you've done?

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.280
Firstly, the best
thing I've ever done

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.350
is produce two children
called Neha and Ira.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:38.040
Those are my best productions.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:38.967
ZILA KHAN: I agree.

00:55:38.967 --> 00:55:41.610
LILLETE DUBEY: Two best
productions of my life.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.040
Nothing can compare to that.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.810
But after them, there
is nothing the best.

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:50.790
The minute as a creative person
you say, I have done that

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.450
and that was my best, go hang
up your sandals and go home.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:55.730
It's all over.

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.286
You are constantly-- the
journey's excitement.

00:55:58.286 --> 00:56:00.910
You know, once I've done a play,
I'm thinking of the next play.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:02.340
I'm thinking of the next
thing I'm going to do.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.590
I mean, I love what I've done.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:06.360
It's not like I
disassociate myself with it.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.246
But my mind's ticking on
what I'm going to do next.

00:56:09.246 --> 00:56:11.400
That next high that
I'm looking for

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.830
is when I create the next piece.

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.500
Then I struggle and find
it, and get it right,

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.910
and then it's never right.

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.340
Let me tell you, nothing I've
ever done is, I feel right.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.035
I feel there's so much
that could improved in it.

00:56:23.035 --> 00:56:23.854
No role.

00:56:23.854 --> 00:56:25.270
People say, what's
your best role?

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:29.010
I say maybe if I had done work
like Sarah Bernhardt, maybe I

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:29.600
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.766
I would have done something.

00:56:30.766 --> 00:56:33.700
I want to do all the male
Shakespeare parts myself

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.890
one day, just to
reverse the whole thing.

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:39.390
But--

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:42.860
ZILA KHAN: James Bond, when
Angelina Jolie said, yes, I'd

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.630
love to play James Bond myself.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.356
LILLETE DUBEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:46.356 --> 00:56:47.480
And Sarah Bernard did that.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.940
She was this wonderful
female actress

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.640
who played only the male
parts, Hamlet, and Macbeth.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.990
And says, move over.

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:56.670
I'll show you how to do that.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:04.440
So-- so, you know, to challenge
yourself anew like that,

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.810
and then you are like
a child, because you're

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.250
coming into an area.

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.200
It's like me trying to
become a computer scientist.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.600
I mean, I know nothing.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.270
I become Robert De
Niro, as the intern.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:19.630
But all those guys in the Google
movie, you know, my friend--

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:21.360
what's his name?

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.055
I loved it.

00:57:22.055 --> 00:57:22.680
Those two guys.

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.850
This ripe old age
coming to like, coming

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:27.360
hang out with the Googlers, and
do their thing and all that.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.670
And not scared.

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:29.610
Not scared.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:31.410
So that's what she was.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.890
She was a little Googler who
came to a new space completely.

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:37.050
And everybody, obviously,
was more trained

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:38.640
in a sense than her.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.020
But she was not afraid.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:44.566
She was not afraid to sound like
she didn't know, or anything.

00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:45.690
That's a wonderful quality.

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:47.730
I think that's how you grow.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:52.720
You grow when you keep on
exploring latent things in you.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.170
You know, [INAUDIBLE] leaves
the tech world says, OK,

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.250
enough of that.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.079
Let's get on let's get into
something called theater.

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:01.620
Which you might have
done in college,

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.980
but this is another animal,
if you know what I mean.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.450
So to keep trying new stuff.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:09.660
People say, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.180
Regrets.

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:14.040
Not regrets, but [NON-ENGLISH].

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.660
I said, my gone.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.670
Every year that I
get older, the clock

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:19.570
is ticking louder and
louder and louder.

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.570
And I'm saying, heck,
I've got such little time,

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.650
I want to write a book.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.450
Maybe cut an album one day.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.820
You know, make some movies.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:27.780
Do this, do that.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.290
I mean, maybe I'll
do none of it.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:31.890
But at least the bucket
list is growing that long.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:35.205
So I think that's what
keeps you, creatively,

00:58:35.205 --> 00:58:40.050
the juices flowing, is when
you are not scared to keep

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.970
trying things, new things.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.260
And that's one thing about Zila,
is she worked very, very hard,

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.419
and she was fearless.

00:58:47.419 --> 00:58:49.710
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: But I
think as a producer/director,

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.559
she was the mos
fearless of the lot.

00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:54.100
Because when she called me and
she said, you're doing Gauhar.

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.250
I said, wow.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.750
As an actor?

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:57.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.510
She says, do you
sing, I said, yeah,

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:01.050
but I'm not a classical singer.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.810
I was so scared.

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:05.200
And those days, I was
filming for something else.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.210
Every day, I was
to go to the shoot,

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.590
and I would be
singing on the way.

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:09.840
[INAUDIBLE] But I don't even
know how to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.590
And in the moving cars, I would
OK, [INAUDIBLE],, or something.

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:15.090
So I told her, I
said, I don't know.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:15.870
Yeah.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:18.714
So I said, I don't know how good
I will be in the first show.

00:59:18.714 --> 00:59:20.130
LILLETE DUBEY: You
were very good.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:21.350
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
I don't know how well

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.740
I'm going to pull this off.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.450
But I promise you,
by the 30th show,

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.040
I'll be standing
there and saying yes,

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.160
yes I can do this well.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.260
And maybe I'll get better.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.343
LILLETE DUBEY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:29.343 --> 00:59:30.910
[LAUGHING]

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:36.202
So I wanted them to do a
small song in which, actually,

00:59:36.202 --> 00:59:38.035
they're in costume, and
it's very different,

00:59:38.035 --> 00:59:40.060
and it looks stunning.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.590
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:45.220
But to do just the
last, one last song,

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.160
when it's a beautiful scene
when the two Gauhars, the older

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.610
Gauhar dies-- and the play keeps
going back and forth in time.

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.560
You know, I mean, not
even chronologically.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:59.900
1895 to suddenly
1902, back to 1929,

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.060
back to this, back to that.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.400
Keeps the audiences nice
and properly on their toes

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.730
to figure out what's going.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:08.000
So all of you who are coming
Sunday, I'm warning you.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.300
So at the end when she dies,
it's in a surreal space,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.300
and the two Gauhars meet,
the young and the old.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.750
So your own 22-year-old
meets, or whatever,

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.680
30-year-old, meets
your 59-year-old self.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.020
And we talk a little bit.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.700
So it's that scene at the end,
which is the penultimate scene.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.790
And then there's a little song,
which is one of her most--

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:36.730
when I fell in love with
Gauhar, after I had decided

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.150
to [NON-ENGLISH]
singing this song,

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.740
which she's going
to sing just now.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.540
And it made my hair rise.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.600
And I said, my god, her
song is still being sung.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.389
And [INAUDIBLE],, of
course, rocked it.

01:00:48.389 --> 01:00:50.430
And she was very impressed,
because I went to her

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:52.312
and I said, isn't this
Gauhar Jaan's song?

01:00:52.312 --> 01:00:53.770
And she looked at
me, and she said,

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.930
my god, I didn't know you know
so much about classical music.

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.639
And I said, well, one
knows a little bit.

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:00.221
And then I said I
better bullshit her.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:00.850
I said, no, no.

01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:03.492
Actually, I'm just
doing this play.

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:05.900
[LAUGHING]

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.360
I though there was
something here.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.540
You seem too well-acquainted
with all her music.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.287
So I say, yeah, well.

01:01:12.287 --> 01:01:13.120
I'm doing her music.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.230
That's how I know it.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.610
So it's a stunning song.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.584
And I would love her to sing it.

01:01:17.584 --> 01:01:19.500
I'm not going to-- they
both sing it together.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.833
But because her voice is not OK.

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.810
But she dances the
[NON-ENGLISH] with it.

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:25.120
So you get a feel of
the play, and we we're

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.160
going to get off the stage now.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.180
ZILA KHAN: So I had learned
Gauhar Jaan's [NON-ENGLISH]

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.270
and many thousands of different
kinds of [NON-ENGLISH] from

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:37.850
different [NON-ENGLISH] from
my father since I was a child.

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.210
So when this [INAUDIBLE]
came to me, so

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:45.700
it was quite something that
I've already learned from.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.060
And it's one of the most
beautiful pieces of Gauhar's,

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.920
and I'm so--

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.930
all your pieces that
you have selected

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:56.350
and the songs in
the how of Gauhar

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.620
is exceptionally beautiful.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.930
Shall we start?

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.210
[INAUDIBLE], are we ready?

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:09.870
So now, there's
just the two of us.

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:13.754
Who was the person you
were hoping to meet here?

01:02:13.754 --> 01:02:15.520
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: Ami?

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.480
Where is she?

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.640
Have you seen her?

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.106
ZILA KHAN: She's
right here with us.

01:02:20.106 --> 01:02:25.100
[SIGHING]

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.016
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
She always [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:28.016 --> 01:02:28.940
Here it is.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.560
You have to keep breaking
your heart until it opens.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.304
You have to keep breaking
your heart until it opens.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:49.210
It's opened.

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:50.168
ZILA KHAN: It's opened.

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.580
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: Let's
celebrate the way we know best.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.780
With a song.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.100
ZILA KHAN: Not any song,
but the one we love best.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.900
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: That one?

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.350
Don't you feel sad singing it?

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:04.460
ZILA KHAN: Not anymore.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.410
[LAUGHING]

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.112
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV:
Our sad song.

01:03:12.112 --> 01:03:15.100
Let's make it a happy one.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.080
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

01:06:11.622 --> 01:06:13.229
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:13.229 --> 01:06:14.353
RAJESHWARI SACHDEV: Thanks.

01:06:17.305 --> 01:06:19.430
AKSHAY THAKKER: I want to
bring up one more person.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.590
We have Vinita Belani.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.280
She is a part of EnActe Arts.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.120
She brought this
play and many other--

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.880
she brings many other the
productions here to the US.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.875
So let's bring Vinita up on
stage and hear more about.

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.234
VINITA BELANI: Thanks.

01:06:38.234 --> 01:06:41.250
AKSHAY THAKKER: Hi,
Vinita Could you tell us

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:45.330
a little bit about your
company, and what else is coming

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:47.160
in the pipeline for you here?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.410
VINITA BELANI: Well,
everybody heard Lillete talk.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:51.660
Everybody understands the
compulsion for theater.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.280
Everybody understands
the importance by now.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.430
If you haven't
understood it, I don't

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.490
know anybody who could be
more articulate than Lillete

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.660
on the idea.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.510
And just Lillete started her
theatre company years and years

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:07.680
ago, because there was a vacuum,
there were Indian stories were

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.537
not being told in English, I
said that I have to confess--

01:07:12.537 --> 01:07:14.120
I'm almost embarrassed
to confess this

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.907
after Lillete's talk, that
I am a computer scientist.

01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:19.392
[LAUGHING]

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:25.520
So I lived in the tech
world for a long time.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.070
I did three start-ups.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.950
EnActe is my fourth startup.

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.890
It's very much a
Silicon Valley startup.

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:32.310
We are a talent incubator.

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.020
We are bootstrapped
in the garage.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.645
We went through our friends
and family round of funding

01:07:36.645 --> 01:07:38.950
and now going to a
series A funding,

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:40.650
which is why Lillete is here.

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:44.520
She's our centerpiece
for our gala on Saturday.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.650
So we are using tech,
as Gauhar used tech,

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:56.640
to change the history of music,
in many ways, in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.780
But we are now in the
diaspora of South Asians,

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:08.400
people originally from South
Asian, a significant community.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.010
And we are sitting on
the edge of two cultures,

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.066
the culture that--

01:08:12.066 --> 01:08:13.440
at least our
children are sitting

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.604
on the edge of two
cultures, and we are sort of

01:08:15.604 --> 01:08:17.520
on the edge of two
cultures, which the culture

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.859
that we came from, the
culture that we live in.

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:22.109
So EnActe does a
lot of work which

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:25.620
is layered in
diaspora playwrights.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.890
We are a talent incubator in
all aspects of the theater--

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.790
playwrighting, stage management,
acting, music, dance,

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:34.250
performance.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:37.600
As a female artistic director
of a theater company,

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.700
I feel very compelled to
tell the stories of women

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.370
who can be strong role
models for our daughters

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.366
and for our sons.

01:08:45.366 --> 01:08:47.490
We did a play last year
called "Sound Waves," which

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.350
is the story of [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.210
She was this young
Muslim girl living

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:56.410
in Paris, daughter of a Sufi
preacher, who joined the World

01:08:56.410 --> 01:09:01.920
War II spy movement
because she was

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.370
compelled, even as a
pacifist, to do something

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:06.510
to stop the war.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:07.710
And she got a George Cross.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.920
She was given the
[INAUDIBLE] by France.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.189
Churchill admitted
that she had--

01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:18.000
she had reduced the course of
World War II by at least four

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.729
to six months, just with her
work in the French resistance

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.229
alone.

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:24.540
And even I hadn't heard
about [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.300
So these are stories
that need to be told.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.090
Vikram Sampath, who wrote the
book "My Name is "Gauhar Jaan,"

01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:33.780
is a classmate of mine from
[INAUDIBLE],, also an engineer.

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.680
[LAUGHING]

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.160
Sometimes we do some
things right, right?

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.350
And somebody had
given me his book.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.460
And I said, oh, my gosh.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.850
I wish someone would
write a play about this

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:43.792
so we could do it.

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:46.000
And then we found out that
the play had been written,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.584
and Lillete had done it.

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:49.250
So there you go.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.380
Between this and
there, and "Gauhar"

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.127
is a story that
needs to be told.

01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:54.960
There are many stories
that need to be told.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.180
But EnActe exists because
our stories are not

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:06.930
being told in the
demographic in which we live.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:09.380
We are telling them to
our own people-- everybody

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.740
here in the Bay
Area, for example,

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.990
there is no demographic
majority anymore.

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:16.760
There's a whole
bunch of minorities,

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.030
and all these minorities are
practicing their art in silos.

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:23.900
And we are trying to
break these cultural silos

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:28.790
and give our children an
opportunity to grow and develop

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:30.680
their talent.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.720
For every 10 people
who become engineers,

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.820
there is that one
11th person that does

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.640
want to become an
[INAUDIBLE],, or a [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.030
So where is the training
ground for these people?

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.530
The training ground is EnActe.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:49.220
And here's my two
wonderful trainees.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.330
We're a talent incubator.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.760
We tell stories from South Asia.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.270
We have a lot of fun doing it.

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.787
And we do it in all humility.

01:10:55.787 --> 01:10:56.870
AKSHAY THAKKER: Wonderful.

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:59.931
What's coming next to the Bay
Area that you're bringing?

01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:02.180
VINITA BELANI: Oh, thank you
for asking that question,

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:06.200
because I'm directing
a play that we

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.120
had commissioned by a
Hollywood script writer

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.280
called "My Fair Dude."

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.700
It's a sort of tongue in
cheek, tongue in cheek,

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.210
take on the original
"My Fair Lady" story,

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.620
the Pygmalion story.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.340
But it is set right
here in Silicon Valley.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:27.920
The protagonist is a
young, nerdy engineer,

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.930
living and working
in a tech company.

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:33.110
And he's having trouble dating.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.351
And [LAUGHING].

01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:34.850
See?

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:37.504
Everybody identifies with this.

01:11:37.504 --> 01:11:39.920
And he's having trouble dating
because he hasn't quite got

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.320
the social dynamic straight.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.740
And he gets helped
by a girl called

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.650
Abby, who is the VP of
technology at his company.

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:52.370
She just happens to be
very lesbian, very bad ass.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:58.894
And she takes him in hand, and
she finds him a tutor, who is--

01:11:58.894 --> 01:12:00.310
and I won't reveal
the rest of it,

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.143
because you'll just
have to come and see it.

01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:04.667
But that is a story about
people like you, and my kids,

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:07.000
and everybody who's living
here in Silicon Valley in San

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.470
Francisco.

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:11.620
It's an out and out
slapstick Broadway

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:15.230
musical, song and dance,
hoohaa kind of play.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.200
We do some of those too.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.000
AKSHAY THAKKER: When
is this scheduled to--

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.625
VINITA BELANI: That's
coming up in May.

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:22.210
AKSHAY THAKKER: Excellent.

01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.168
VINITA BELANI: Before
that, we are doing a play

01:12:24.168 --> 01:12:26.710
that we opened in January
in San Francisco called

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.934
"The Party," which is a
very intense and a very

01:12:29.934 --> 01:12:31.600
gut-wrenching kind
of play, because it's

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.230
the story of partition told by
the survivors of partition who

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.214
crossed the line on both sides.

01:12:37.214 --> 01:12:38.630
AKSHAY THAKKER:
Thank you so much.

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.922
Good luck with "Gauhar" and
all your other productions.

01:12:40.922 --> 01:12:42.296
VINITA BELANI:
Yes, and thank you

01:12:42.296 --> 01:12:44.740
for having Lillete and all of
these wonderful people here.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.160
And thank you for
inviting me as well.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.243
AKSHAY THAKKER: Of course.

01:12:47.243 --> 01:12:48.110
Thank you.

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:51.460
[APPLAUSE]
