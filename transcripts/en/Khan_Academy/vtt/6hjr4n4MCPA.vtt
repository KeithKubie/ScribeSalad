00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:02.161
- [Voiceover] I want
to do a quick overview

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.578
of trigonometry, and
aspects of trig functions

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:08.432
that are important to us
as electrical engineers.

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.429
So this isn't meant to be a
full class on trigonometry.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.430
If you haven't had this subject before,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.971
this is something you
can study on Khan Academy,

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.853
and Sal does a lot of good
videos on trig functions

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:20.886
and how they work.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.887
So the way I remember my trig functions,

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:25.387
is with the phrase

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:27.549
Soh cah

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.844
toa.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.191
So this is the little
phrase I use to remember

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.170
how to do my trig functions.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.150
And we draw a triangle, like this,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.567
a right triangle,

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:47.364
with an angle here of theta.

00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:50.779
And we label the sides of the triangle as,

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.856
this is the side adjacent to theta,

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:56.856
this is the side, opposite of theta.

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:02.676
And this side over here is the
hypotenuse of the triangle.

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.093
So this says that the definition of sine,

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:08.020
of theta,

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.336
equals opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.419
Opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:19.439
This phrase here means
the cosine, of theta,

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.473
equals adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:30.210
And the last one here is for the tangent.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.627
It says the tangent of theta,

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:37.857
equals opposite over adjacent.

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:40.369
Opposite divided by adjacent.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.286
Opposite over adjacent.

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:48.135
So, soh cah toa helps you
remember your trig functions.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:51.796
So lets take that idea over here,

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:55.796
and draw a line out, and
make some calculations.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.993
We have a graph here of a unit circle.

00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:05.222
That means the radius of
this is one everywhere.

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:06.634
And what I want to know is,

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.128
here's my angle theta.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:13.211
And angles are measured
from the positive X axis.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.674
Here's the X axis.

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:18.174
Here's the Y axis.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:23.418
Angles are measured
going counterclockwise.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.665
So let's talk for a second
about how angles are measured.

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.131
Angles are measured in two ways.

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.714
Angles are measured in degrees.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:37.251
From zero to 360.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:44.100
And angles are also measured
in something called radians.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.399
And that goes from zero to two pi.

00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:53.306
So these are two different angle measures.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.874
And when you're measuring in degrees,

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:58.303
we put the little degree mark up here.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.136
That's what that means.

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:03.004
Radians don't get a degree mark on them.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:05.706
So if I mark this out in degrees,

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.695
here's zero degrees.

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.195
Here's 90 degrees.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:12.650
Here's 180 degrees.

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:15.676
This is 270.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.876
And when I get back to the
beginning, it's 360 degrees.

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.428
If I measure the same angles in radians,

00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:29.833
this'll be zero radians.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.000
When I get back here it's
gonna be two pi radians.

00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:39.206
Going all the way around the
circle is two pi radians.

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:40.227
That means that going half way

00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:42.894
around the circle is pi radians.

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:47.397
That's equivalent to 180 degrees.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:49.861
If I do a quarter of a circle,

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.944
that's equal to pi over two, radians.

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:58.727
And if I do three quarters of a circle,

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:00.894
that's three halves pi, or

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.690
three pi over two.

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.418
So, we'll use degrees
and radians all the time,

00:04:08.418 --> 00:04:12.062
and we'll flip back
and forth between them.

00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:14.029
So, now let's do some trig functions,

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.244
on our angle theta right in here.

00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:20.347
Let's work out the sine,
cosine, and tangent.

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.739
Now let me give a name to this hypotenuse.

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:24.239
Let's call that R.

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:27.247
And R equals one, right?

00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:30.937
I said this was a unit
circle, so R is equal to one.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.956
And when we calculate our right triangle,

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:36.445
what we do is we drop a
perpendicular down here,

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.101
to the X axis.

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:42.268
And we also draw a horizontal
over here from the Y axis.

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:47.637
This side right here,
of the X axis right here

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:50.556
is the side adjacent to the angle theta.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:54.141
And this distance right here
on this side of our triangle,

00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:55.891
is the side opposite.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:02.200
Okay, and basically there's
gonna be a Y intercept here,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.071
and an X intercept right
here, where those happen.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.662
These'll be some number,

00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:09.995
depending on the tilt of this line here.

00:05:11.154 --> 00:05:12.237
So, the sine,

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.552
of theta, is equal to what?

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:17.552
Is equal to,

00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:19.886
let's look at our definition,

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.218
it's equal to opposite over hypotenuse.

00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:23.385
Opposite is Y,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:29.622
over the hypotenuse which is R.

00:05:29.622 --> 00:05:32.047
If I look at cosine,

00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:32.880
theta,

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:36.707
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:39.567
Adjacent is the X distance,

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:42.567
X distance, and the hypotenuse is R.

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.688
And if we do the tangent,

00:05:49.277 --> 00:05:50.110
of theta,

00:05:51.074 --> 00:05:52.170
that equals what?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.302
It's opposite over adjacent.

00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:57.802
So it's opposite, which is the Y distance,

00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:03.685
over X, the adjacent X,
X is the adjacent, X.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.814
One thing to notice here about tangent,

00:06:09.814 --> 00:06:10.647
Y over X

00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:12.459
is the

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:15.962
rise divided by the run,

00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:19.193
going from this point, up to this point.

00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:20.943
So that is the slope.

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.453
So the idea of slope
and the idea of tangent,

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:29.703
are really closely related.

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:32.277
Just as one small point,

00:06:32.277 --> 00:06:34.077
let's work out, what is one radian?

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:37.854
What's an angle of one radian in degrees?

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:40.587
I can do that conversion
just doing some units.

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:42.504
If we have 180 degrees,

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.371
that equals pi, radians.

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:53.986
So that means that one radian,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.343
equals 180 over pi.

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.335
If you plug that in the calculator,

00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:06.252
it'll come out to 57.3,

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.236
roughly, degrees.

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.865
So, one radian actually is
a little above 45 degrees.

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.608
One radian is 57 degrees.

00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:18.691
It looks about like that.

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:20.802
We don't use this very often.

00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:23.644
Mostly we talk about radians
in terms of multiples of pi,

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:25.566
'cause it makes more sense on this circle.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:29.372
But, just to let you know,
that's roughly one radian.
