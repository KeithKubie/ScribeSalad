&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.006
&gt;&gt; On behalf of the
Library of Congress welcome

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.763
to the 2010 national book festival.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.030
I'm Joe Yonan, the food and travel
editor from the Washington Post.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.570
And thank you for celebrating
the joy of reading today.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.763
Before we start, for those of you
who didn't hear my caveats earlier,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.710
I just want to make sure you know

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.996
that the presentations are being
filmed for the Library of Congress,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.023
for the website and
for their archives.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.756
Be mindful of that.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.303
Don't sit in front of camera
risers to block the cameras,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.676
which I think is that right there.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.410
And please, please take your
cell phones, take the on button,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.223
turn it to the off button.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.823
That would be great.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.290
I have the distinct
pleasure of introducing

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.953
to you Lidia Matticchio Bastianich.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.510
[ Clapping ]

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.080
&gt;&gt; I could probably stop there, but
I really like to talk about Lidia.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.786
So I'm going to say
a little bit more.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.026
First of all, she is one of
those few cooking personalities

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.746
that needs to go by only one name.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.746
I always love that.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.946
And she really at this point
has become, I would say,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.280
America's favorite
Italian cooking teacher.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
[ Clapping ]

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.010
-

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.876
&gt;&gt; She's everybody's mother.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.010
She's everybody's grandmother.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.343
She tells you to watch
closely as you stir the pot.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.010
She tells you to make sure you
heavily salt that pasta water.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.743
She tells you to cook the
pasta until it's just al dente.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.043
Save a little bit of the
water for the pasta sauce.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.710
But while she's telling
you all this,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.710
you don't feel talked
down to at all.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.510
You feel included.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.576
You feel welcome at Lidia's table.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.243
And you can practically smell

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.583
and practically taste every
little thing that she's cooking.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.333
Her accomplishments are too numerous
for me to list here honestly.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.806
I want Lidia to have some time
to talk, but she's the owner

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.020
of several acclaimed restaurants,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.220
starting with Lidia
in New York City.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.350
She's the author of many spectacular
cookbooks, Lu Cucina di Lidia,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.756
Lidia's Family Table, Lidia's
Italian Table, Lidia's Italy,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.576
Lidia's Cooks From
the Heart of Italy.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.080
And all of them showcase
the glorious variety,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.060
depth and beauty of Italian cooking.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.123
Her many public television shows

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.720
and appearances bring the viewers
not just into her own kitchen,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.860
but into the kitchens of
her favorite Italian cooks.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.613
And make sure -- I can speak
from personal experience,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.086
because I was just there recently.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.553
Make sure that the next time you go
to New York, make sure that you stop

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.736
by one of her newest
ventures with Mario Batali

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.436
and her son Joe Bastianich,
the huge temple glorious,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.936
hilarious crowded amusement
park like temple

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.120
to Italian cooking that is Italy.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.760
Lidia has also been honored by the
government of Italy, I have to say,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.540
for being such a wonderful
embassador

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.140
of Italian cooking in America.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.120
I was honored to be at that
presentation a few months ago.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.760
She's a guru of Italian
cooking in America.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.820
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.220
to the stage Lidia Bastianich.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720
[ Clapping ]

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.410
Wow. Bonjourno.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.410
[inaudible].

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.210
It's a pleasure being here.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.810
I really enjoy, I do, the
restaurants and the books,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.513
but I truly enjoy meeting
you, because I know

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.490
that on the other side
of the screen or all

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.963
of my books there is you out there.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.620
And you ultimately connect.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.686
And I'll go back maybe
to the whole history,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.376
but when I did my first book --

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.110
and my first book is Lu Cucina
di Lidia -- it was in 1990.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.326
And I was then a chef of Lidia.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.263
The first restaurant I opened was
in '71, for Lidia opened in '81.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.043
And I was, you know, cooking
the food of my region.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.350
Now, in '71 when I
began cooking, the food,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.076
that was Italian American food.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.546
And by all means, delicious food,
but it was not the food that I ate

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.270
at home or that was cooked in Italy.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.410
And I dedicated a whole
book to that,

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.636
to that Lidia's Italian-American
Kitchen,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.023
this valiant kitchen of adaptation.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
But when I opened for
Lidia, I cooked the food

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.796
of Friuli Venezia Giulia.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.263
And if you are looking at Italy,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.196
in the right-hand corner,
Italy has 20 regions.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.596
In the right hand corner is Friuli
Venezia Giulia, right under Austria.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.063
Now it's next to Slovenia.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.796
So the food is almost
middle European.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.166
So I cook European.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.433
I cook with sauerkraut.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.900
I make goulash.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.100
I make balanchine.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.566
So here I was cooking this
kind of really regional food.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.766
And do I that because
I had this great plan?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.896
No. Because it was what I knew.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.993
I came here when I was 12.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.880
That's what we cooked at
home when I was growing up.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.880
That's what we continue to cook when
we came to America as immigrants.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.590
So as I got really into
cooking or whatever, I said,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.410
I'm going to took Italian, but
I'm going to cook what I know.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.573
And certainly the press followed,
because maybe it was the first look

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.533
into not a homogenized
Italian cuisine,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.476
but a regional Italian cuisine.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.870
And, you know, those
of you that travel,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.230
and certainly by now
it's quite evident,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.106
how really different
all the regions are.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.053
You know, Italy's smaller
than California.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.436
And yet the diversity that lies
within its region as far as food,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.520
as far as product is
just tremendous.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.520
I keep on going back.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.986
I mean, I'm here since 1958.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.483
So it's 50 years.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.750
So I need to go back.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.713
I need to nurture myself
and continuously I explore

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.120
and find new things in
this little country.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.326
So in 1990 when I opened for Lidia
and all the press and everything,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.463
of course, amongst the press
there was a gentleman JJ Goode.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.210
He wrote -- he was a
writer for Gourmet Magazine.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.923
And he said, "Lidia, you
need to write a cookbook."

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.350
And so I said, "but
I'm not a writer.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400
I'm a chef."

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.600
And at that I am a chef
of home cooking in a way.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.693
I always stuck to that.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.320
Even when I went to culinary
school, I felt most comfortable,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.800
and I think you all
relate exactly to that.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.360
How do you make it at home?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.826
How does it happen?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.693
And I think that's some
of the best food anyway.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.700
So he asked me, "how
about writing a book?"

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.463
And I said, "Well, maybe
we can collaborate."

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.910
And we did.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.376
And he interviewed me.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.276
And the book is really about that
region, because I said, "I can't."

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.676
I thought, I said, "okay.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.276
So what am I going to write about?

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.076
Am I going do write about
what I do as a chef?"

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.010
I says, no.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.943
I have to tell them my story,
the food, where it comes from.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.410
And so began my philosophy
of how do I write for you

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.046
so that I can connect so that you
really can transport my flavors

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.020
into your kitchen.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.676
And the book is still being printed,
was the book actually my biography

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.133
in short, and the food
of Friuli Vanezia Giulia,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.390
that region up there.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.190
From then on I went on two books.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.000
Of course, I addressed the
Italian American cuisine.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.246
I addressed the family table,
because I think the responses

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.593
that I got, especially from
TV, is this connection.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.353
Everybody connects to the table
or the missing of that connection.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.806
So the feeling, what a table --
I think that a table full of food

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.233
with family and friends is magical.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.946
It's a place that you
can really connect.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.803
Maybe not enough of it.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.003
And we should really
build that ever more.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.063
And one would say, oh, the cooking.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.440
No. Simple food, a nice salad,
maybe some pasta, whatever,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.730
will bring people together.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.596
But let me tell you maybe why,
because I'm interested in food,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.063
but I'm interested in
all aspects of food.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:21.516
I'm interested in the
story, the history,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.276
anthropology, the sociology,
whatever.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.103
You know, it intrigues me.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.036
So when you're at the table, now,
the one thing that we all must do,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.073
we must eat in order to live.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.780
You must eat to survive.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.020
When you're eating,
you're taking in.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.313
Your defenses are down.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:42.893
You need that food so
that you stay alive.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.333
So there's no argument there.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:47.793
So when you're at the table, when
we're at the table, we are relaxed.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.296
Our defenses are down, and
we are taking in nourishment.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.356
It's the perfect place to talk.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.150
Why do we have business
lunches or dinners?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.393
Why do we do proposals, why do we
do special events around the table?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.826
Because it is a special place
that we find that we can connect

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.803
with each other better,
because our defenses are down.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.270
So just this little -- you know,
that table is really, really --

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.283
especially for young people and for
teenagers, if you take a teenager

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.250
and you say, okay, let's go
upstairs in the room and let's talks

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.750
about drugs, it's on
the defensive already.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.663
But at the table as you're talking,
they're taking all of that in.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.963
So The Family Table was a book
that I addressed specifically

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.713
because of this, how do
you cook for families

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.440
and together and, also, cooking big.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.493
You know, there's a lot of
work in members of the family,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.836
both members at some time, how
do you make, if you're going

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.816
to make a pot of sauce,
how do you make it larger?

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.030
Save it and then that sauce
can be turned into the meal

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.923
for the whole week almost.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.456
The same with soup, making a base.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.056
So that book addressed that.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.763
And then I went back to Italy
and Lidia's Italy and Lidia Cooks

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.046
from the Heart of Italy, which
is my latest book in the series

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.120
that you're watching, is
about the 20 regions of Italy.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.603
Lidia Cooks from the Heart of
Italy, which is the latest,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.230
is maybe the ten less known regions.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.110
And I think it's fantastic.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.643
And I get a lot of comments from
readers and from guests that come

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.270
to my restaurant about how
they relate to this book,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.270
the regions of Italy they didn't
know or the regions of Italy

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.803
that their ancestors came
from Calavia, Basilicata,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.270
Abruzzo, Molise, all of these.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.816
This is the last book.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.163
Now you say, okay, this is the
story of how you got into books,

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.376
but how did you get in television?

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.430
But let's just go back to the
restaurant business as a whole.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.523
So I was very young and in
'71 opened my first restaurant

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.366
with my husband.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.433
I was not a chef.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.300
I was 23 then.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.366
We hired a chef.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.700
I became his pseu chef
for ten years.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.306
And that's where I really
got my kind of knowledge

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.226
of commercial cooking, but I
always retained my personal

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.786
of the family cooking.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.853
The children were born.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.043
Joe was born, Tonya was born
in the restaurant itself.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.463
And they would come.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.596
My mother, she's still
-- those of you

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.463
who watch television still see her.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.596
She's 90. She lives with me
and she's still involved.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.023
So this sense of unity and maybe
family, you know, one would, say,

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.583
oh, my goodness, you
know, that's so hard.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.696
For me it was -- it's a necessity.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.860
It is the Italian way of life.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.610
And we continued, but
it was a blessing,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.210
because I could continue to work.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.143
And my mother would watch the
children at night while I worked.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.490
So as the kids grew up, you know,

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.160
always the thing is the restaurant
is kind of a fun place to be.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.660
You know, everybody's
always having fun.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.393
Everybody is always having a drink.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.836
So I said to my son and my
daughter when she came, I said, no,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.483
this is not what you want to do.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.550
We came as immigrants to America.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.550
You're going to get an education.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.483
This is the land of opportunity.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.256
And then you can really do
whatever you like and move on

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.176
and we'll be very proud of you.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.190
So my son went on to Wall Street,
analyst, college, whatever.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.356
My daughter went on, art
history, PhD from Oxnard.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.290
Ultimately they both worked with me.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920


00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.993
But, you know, I think -- and
it's a very hard challenge,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.973
I mean, when you're a parent.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.773
And if you're young, you're sort of
left steering them or mentoring them

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.640
to go and build their life.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:45.603
When they come back then
as adults, as partners,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.370
it's a different challenge.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.170
But I love every minute.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.570
I still do.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.636
And if I am capable of doing
what I have, it's because of them

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:56.620
and so many other really competent
individuals that I have on my team.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.223
My son got into the business,
of course, in the restaurants.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.416
And we are partners
with Mario Batali.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.923
So all the restaurants we own
with Mario Batali together.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.670
And in Italy we were just
talking, that's a partnership

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.736
between the three of us and
also some Italian counterparts.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.373
And my daughter, on the other hand,
when she came back to the states,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.620
she got married, to have
children, to be close to home,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.820
I sort of pulled her in,
help me do the research,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.593
help me with the books.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.240
So she takes care of a lot of
the books and the television

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.813
and all of those research items.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.360
So the television.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
How did I get into television?

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.226
Well, at this other restaurant
for Lidia, as I said, you know,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.316
all the [inaudible] would come
then for Lidia opening in 1981.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.146
James Beard, Julia Child.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.200
And then all the journalists
would come.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.853
And that's when Julia Child
approached me and said, Lidia --

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.913
"Lidia [in accent] would
you do a show with me?"

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.800
Well, we did two shows in
the Master Chef series.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.630
And I guess the rest is what really
what explains how ultimately I got

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.226
into television.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.960
The producer asked me, "Lidia,
the shows were really good.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.323
Would you consider?"

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.523
And I thought about it.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.923
And, of course, you
know, I'm a communicator.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.123
I love -- and, you know,
just I think, you know,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.906
what I do is something very basic.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.903
I didn't plan it this way.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.036
I love it, but to have
the reaction from you

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.043
like that just drives me even more.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.816
You know, I need to do more.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.216
And I just love it.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.416
I mean, you're getting
energy from me.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.750
I get all that energy back.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.736
And I'm doing what I'm doing
because of all of that energy.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.106
I just wanted to share with
you that it's a two way street.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.620
I wanted to share with you.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.620
And so I said, yes,
but I had two requests.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.730
I said if I could tape the show
in my house and if I could be

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:10.890
on public television, because I felt

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.856
that public television was
the platform [clapping] --

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.203
was the platform for
what I had to say.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.020
I'm happy to say that I'm
still in public television

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.300
and I'm still filming in my home.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.110
So the set that you
see, that's my home.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.940
And I get up there every morning.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.540
Actually, I left there this morning.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.220
Grandma was still sleeping.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.086
There's no more kids now.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.086
So she was still resting.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.086
But I have begun yesterday
the filming of my new series.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.486
So they come in.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.353
And, actually, they take
over my whole house.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.280
And it's four cameras
and all the controls.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.580
It's great.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.566
And that's going to be for the next
series that's coming out next year,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.526
which is Lidia's Italy in America.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.123
And it's about the Italian culture,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.066
the immigrants way back
historical and, of course,

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.990
ultimately all culminating
with recipes as examples.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.480
And I'll be going around
the United States.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.806
I mean, I have done tons
of research, you know,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.133
how important the different ports,
what the Italians bring with them,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.010
I mean, the whole phenomena
of broccoli rabe [audible].

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.793
Fifth generation immigrants
from Sicily, they came,

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.810
and they were missing
that bitter green.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.233
On the trip back brought the seeds,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.633
because broccoli rabe
in Italy grows wild.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.356
And they brought back
the seeds, planted it.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.103
And ultimately the story,
they sell millions of pounds

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.113
of broccoli de rabe,
America really loves.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.763
The same with the artichokes.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.376
The artichokes and those -- the
big farms out there are still ran

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.456
by fourth, fifth generations
of Italians.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.536
So I go and explore
all of these stories.

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.363
And I will be bringing them to you.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.470
That's next year in a book.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.500
But I do have a new project
that I want to share with you.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:23.113
And that is -- which
I'm very proud of.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.053
And that is that I have a children's
book coming out on October 12th.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.070
[clapping] And then I'll let
you ask all the questions,

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.106
because I'm just touching things
to stimulate you in a way to see

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.273
if you have any questions.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.873
The book is Nonna, Tell Me a Story.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.720
And it is the story
of a Christmas tree.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.103
It's a Christmas story.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.050
And with my grandkids,
they all come over and,

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.290
you know, we sort of pile in bed.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.636
And the question is always,
Nonna, tell me a story

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.676
when you were a little girl.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.600
Now, I grew up in a setting, I tell
everybody, with my grandmother.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.553
In the country we had all
the courtyard animals,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.380
goats, pigs, donkeys.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.860
We had it all, all the garden.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.640
But the Christmas was
quite different

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.783
and organic than what is done here.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.350
And what we did is that my
grandfather would go out.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.203
And he wouldn't take the top of
the whole tree, ruin a whole tree.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.223
That wasn't thought of.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.083
Juniper bush or a bush
that was that high,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.440
he would chop that off, bring it in.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.333
And we would decorate it
with apples, with tangerines,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.080
with nuts, with dried figs.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.130
I remember as children we would
make sort of wreaths of bay leaf

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.823
and dry fig, a bay leaf, a dry fig,

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.250
a bay leaf all tied
not even with a string.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.223
There is -- it was called
banka [assumed spelling].

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.070
It's a very pliable strong grass.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.643
And we would tie it.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.443
And the whole tree was decorated

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.843
with that rather than
tencel and so on.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.823
So the story's about that.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.376
And at the end I give recipes
so the many families can do this

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.403
with the children and build
this organic tree at home.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.453
And ultimately those
were our presents.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.220
We didn't have presents.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.553
On La Befana or the 6th of
January the tree gets dismantled.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.313
And those were our
gifts, and we ate them.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.613
Although, I mean, my brother and
I, because we had put also candy,

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.030
caramelle, we would steal the candy
and put a stone in there or a rock

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.386
in there so that the tree looked
good, but we were munching

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.956
at it as it was going on.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.396
The illustrations are great.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.106
It's the illustration of all my
grandkids and myself and grandma.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.510
So it's realistic.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.176
And, also, there will
be a half hour special

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.510
on public television of the book.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.853
So it's an exciting holiday
season coming up for our family,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.013
because we do those things at home.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.293
Now we can share that, also,
outside, maybe touch the children,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.573
get the children involved.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.353
Of course that's everybody's
concern these days.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.060
So I'm going to open up.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.993
We have about ten minutes
of questions.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.460
And please.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.460
Yes?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.830
&gt;&gt; It's such a pleasure
to see you here.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.690
It's great.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.756
My mother is 89.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:33.290
My family is Dutch
from the Netherlands.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:35.663
She survived the hungry winters
in Holland during World War II.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.596
One of the things that
sustained her, she had a book.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.173
She doesn't remember
the author or the title.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.770
It was an Italian family in New
York, and they were preparing

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.030
for a wedding and the
vast quantities of food.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.126
And she would read that at that
time, which may be why my family,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.340
once we were in America, were very
interested and ate Italian food.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.953
As I said, she's 89.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.560
I've learned all my
cooking from her.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.493
She's a wonderful cook,
and she loves your show.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.303
She loves when your
mother comes on board.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.883
She just adores that
and the grandkids.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.086
And she said to me this morning,
because I said I might get a chance

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.690
to speak to Lidia, she
sends you greetings.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.263
And she said, if she still could
cook -- it's beyond her now --

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.000
she would be cooking from your book.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.606
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's wonderful.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.140
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.606
&gt;&gt; Much gratitude to her.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.073
Give her my best.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.140
&gt;&gt; I will do that.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.806
&gt;&gt; Tell her grandma is
90 and still kicking.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.206
She's bossing everybody in that
TV crew, telling them what to do.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.006
So she's spiffy.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.326
So wish her all my best and
much continued Italian cooking.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.220
And as a child, I have
a very clear memory.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.080
I can still hear my mother's rolling
pin going when she was doing pastry.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.493
Do you have a special memory?

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.670
I know you must have many, but
is there something that stands

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.363
out when you were a child that
really clicked you into the food

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.523
that your family was cooking?

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.530
&gt;&gt; If you're talking about
sounds, you know, specifically now

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.433
that you're talking, I
remember a lot of smells.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.800
You know, smell, we have a
large -- as primates, you know,

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.730
we sort of smell for our food.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.760
We look for our food.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.160
So we have a lot of space
reserved for our sense of smell.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.126
And it collects a lot of memories.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.393
So that's why when
you smell something,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.196
it takes you right
back into that moment.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.593
But the sound, you know, what
I remember, I remember sitting

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.966
with a little stool with the goat,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.673
and I would help my
grandmother hold the legs

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.383
so the goat would stay still.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.553
And the way she was milking and
the sound that the milk made

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.880
into the can and all
the froth that came

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.566
out of it and ultimately drank it.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.780
So if you're talking about
sound, that's a sound that sort

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.820
of comes back to me now and then.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360
Thank you.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360
Yes?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.400
&gt;&gt; You obviously researched
all the Italian regions.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.920
And besides your own home region,

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.190
which region for you
has your favorite food

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.846
or a special ingredient or dish
that is one of your favorites?

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.346
&gt;&gt; Right. You know, it's like
saying, what's your favorite child.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.720
I think I love them all, but I think

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.963
that they really change
within the season.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.980
And some regions are much better
than others in certain regions.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.123
So if you're talking about
now going into the Fall,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.716
I would go up to Piemonte,
the Porcini, the truffles,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.253
even Emilia Romagna, that hearty
pasta, a lot of Pachino sauce.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.310
If you talk about summer, maybe just

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.060
like right now, Sicily,
the [inaudible].

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.133
The tomatoes are just wonderful.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.853
So I think that, you know, I travel
maybe with the seasons through Italy

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.920
to find what I really
appreciate and enjoy.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.780
Okay.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.780
&gt;&gt; I've been to your
restaurant in Pittsburgh.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.913
It was excellent.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:55.980
I remember the lamb shank fondly.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.180
So thank you so much.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.313
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.780
Yes, sir?

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.780
&gt;&gt; Having arrived here at age
12, I'm sure there's been a lot

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.446
of trials and tribulations
and influences

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.780
that may have impacted
on where you are today.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.246
Can you speak to that?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.980
&gt;&gt; Yes. You know, I think that
maybe my drive -- I'm challenged.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.346
I always loved to research, to find
new things, but the challenge maybe

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.280
that got me this passion,
this drive is maybe my story.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.066
And I come from an area, now
it's Istria and now it's Croatia,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.966
but it was part of Italy.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.366
And after World War II that part
was given to then Yugoslavia,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:41.593
the new country that
[inaudible] became Yugoslavia.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.366
Yugoslavia was communist.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.766
The iron curtain went up.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.996
The part where we were remained
behind the iron curtain.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.810
We could not speak Italian.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.483
I mean, any boarder situation is
where people are mixed ethnicity.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.123
I mean, I speak five languages
in the sense of, you know,

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.243
all the languages, but
at home we speak Italian.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.183
So we couldn't speak Italian.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.850
I couldn't go to church.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.716
And all of these things
really weighed on my parents.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:12.940
And ultimately in 1958 --
now, I was born in '47.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.360
And this happened between
'47, '48, '49,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.040
that whole division of that area.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.693
And in about 1955, '56 we
were old enough as children,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.626
my parents decided that they
wanted to go back to Italy.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.693
Now, there was a period that ethnic
Italians, when it was divided,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.793
could just -- it was
called the exodus.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.290
And 350,000 Italians,
ethnic Italians

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:44.876
from that area went back to Italy.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.676
My mother was pregnant with me.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.610
So she stayed.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.610
That was why.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.610
So once in about 1955
they decided to go back.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.543
My mother, my brother
and I went as tourists.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.043
They wouldn't allow the whole
family to go back, because they knew

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.443
that they wouldn't come back.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.376
My father literally escaped.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.776
We went to Trieste.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.576
In Trieste we had other family,
because the proximity there is

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.976
so close that you had
family all over.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.976
We reunited with them.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.850
It was difficult to find a job
in those situations, whatever.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.903
And we were settled ultimately in a
refugee camp, political refugee camp

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.200
in Trieste called San Sabba

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.783
for two years while we awaited
an opportunity to migrate.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.076
And ultimately it was
President Dwight Eisenhower,

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:30.500
because even immigration was
stopped in the United States,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.633
that he opened a limited
immigration for political refugees.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:37.980
And we were one of the first people.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.113
We were a young family.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:41.856
So I think coming here,
we were brought here

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.903
by the Catholic charities.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.703
We didn't have anybody.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.636
The catholic charities
found us a home

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:50.703
and ultimately fed
us in the beginning.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.236
So we are a product and,
you know, we became --

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.923
at least I became resilient
in a sense.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.940
I am very blessed, because now I
have two of the greatest cultures.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.190
I came here at 12.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.563
So I feel very American, as well,
but these two great cultures.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.083
But the challenge was, I
think, to prove to my parents

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:13.386
that their decision -- because
they were very nostalgic,

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.503
and I remember my father especially,
he just couldn't, you know, get it.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.170
Did he do the right thing,
bringing here these children

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:23.076
when they were not having anybody?

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.076
So I think we had to prove to them
that they did the right thing.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.116
And it was my brother and I.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.650
And my brother also
really succeeded.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.383
He's an engineer in electronics,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.916
and he has a few hundred
patents for IBM.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:38.790
So I think that that drive
was really on both sides.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.350
Not so much a personal
drive of gain,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.606
but one of really showing our
parents that they were right.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.630
And my mother now enjoys
and she's happy

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.356
and she's part of this success.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.956
So I think that's a deep question.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.510
[ Clapping ]

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.260
&gt;&gt; Hi, Lidia.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:06.993
&gt;&gt; I'm curious to know
how does one decide

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.526
to know what to cook for the Pope?

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.593
What kind of dinner conversation
do you have with the Holy Father?

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:12.963
&gt;&gt; That was really one of
the highlights of my career.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.556
And the point is not
demanding at all.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.426
He doesn't like cinnamon.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840
So that's it.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.773
But it was also decided also
by his confidants, if you will.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.293
The first immediately was a Friday.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.626
And we had 55 cardinals from
all over the United States.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.116
So Friday it was fish.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.536
We did a whole roasted fish.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.243
I did some soup, because I
felt that if he was traveling,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.030
he needed some soup and all that.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.896
And he ate a big plate of soup.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.696
But, you know, he is German.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.316
I come from that area as
I was just saying before,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.583
you know, middle European.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.353
I did some research.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.220
His mother was a chef in Germany.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.766
So he had a palate.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:00.680
So I said, I wanted to come,
because, you know, here's a man,

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.810
it's not about him, it's
about everybody else.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.946
And I don't think he considered --

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.046
I mean, in his position that he
considers so much his feelings

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.036
and his -- so I wanted
to give him pleasure,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.100
maybe recollections again
when he was a child.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.913
So I cooked sauerkraut.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.813
I cooked goulash.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.813
I cooked strudel.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.146
And he loved it all
and he enjoyed it.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:27.880
And I had the liberty to do that.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.580
So at the end -- I don't know
if some of you saw the picture,

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.380
but at the end it was
also his birthday.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.246
We brought him a cake.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.680
And as I brought him the
cake, I gave him a knife

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.813
to cut it and he couldn't.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.846
So I just took his hand
and we cut it together.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.780
And I turned to him and I said,
"Your Holiness, how did you enjoy?"

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:48.996
And he looked at me and
he said, "delicious.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.103
These flavors are my
mother's flavors."

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.063
So I have gotten into him.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.510
[ Clapping ]

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.243
&gt;&gt; Hi. I would just like to thank
you for being on public television.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.410
Growing up, I never had cable.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.223
So I was always watching
you on Saturday afternoon.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.796
And my question is, I see you
judging on Iron Chef America,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.500
but would you ever compete on
it and who would you challenge?

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.146
&gt;&gt; You know, I don't think --
I refuse actually to compete.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.050
It's not my style.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.116
It's not what I do.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:26.916
I don't have to prove anything.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.050
And I am a judge, yes,
you know, objective judge.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.176
I appreciate it.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.836
I watch it, but it's not my style.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.220
I think we are on overtime.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.440
Maybe one more question.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.640
&gt;&gt; Lidia, my wife -- hello.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.400
Lidia, my wife and I enjoy
your cookbooks and the TV show.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.613
&gt;&gt; Can you come closer?

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.183
&gt;&gt; We enjoy your cookbooks
and your TV show immensely.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.243
I have a question for you.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.510
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.243
&gt;&gt; As I'm sure you know, Julia
Child's kitchen is located

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.776
in a museum not too far from here.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.376
&gt;&gt; Many years from now
would you be able to,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.510
if asked, donate your kitchen?

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh, you're honoring
me with this projection here,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.086
but I guess whatever
the future holds.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.903
But I cooked in that kitchen.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.236
I went to visit it.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.776
I filmed in the kitchen
that's in the Smithsonian.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.096
And I visited with Julia.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.100
In her last days she
went to Santa Barbara,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.753
because she was from Santa Barbara.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:24.953
So I visited with her
in the last days.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.753
She was a tremendous influence in
my career as far as the presence

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.236
on television and how she projected
and she cared about her viewers,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.640
not about herself,
and she communicated.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.220
And when I got up there and I
said, you know a lot of chefs are,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.753
I can do this, I can do that,
and it's not about that.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.886
It's about communicating.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.220
And she was very instrumental.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.953
And I looked at her and I
said, that's what I want to do.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.953
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.220
Thank you.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.220
