00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:10.689
It's estimated that 
for every 10,000 bills in the U.S.,

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.178
one of those bills is fake.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:15.111
That may not sound like much,

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:19.958
but it adds up to millions of dollars
in cold hard cash.

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.720
Counterfeit money has the potential
to cause all sorts of problems,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.370
from leaving you short $20
to destabilizing national economies.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.535
But don't worry.

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:32.775
You can help catch the counterfeits.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:36.150
All you need are some simple tools
and a bit of chemistry.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.073
First up, the anti-counterfeit 
detection pen.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.808
The pen looks like a highlighter

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.417
and contains a solution 
of potassium iodide

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:47.939
and elemental iodine.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:50.516
It reveals of the presence of starch,

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.146
which is commonly used 
to strengthen regular printer paper,

00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:57.066
but won't be found in real money.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.819
That's because authentic bills
are made of cotton and linen

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.486
and are threaded with tiny 
red and blue fibers.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:08.332
That material is made by a single,
highly-guarded company

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:10.393
called Crane and Company,

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.190
which has been printing currency

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.386
since Paul Revere asked them 
to help finance the Revolutionary War.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:21.437
The starch in many counterfeit bills,
on the other hand,

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:23.433
is made of two molecules:

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.061
amylopectin and amylose.

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:28.571
It's amylose that gives the fake away.

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:32.421
Its long chain of sugar molecules
connected by oxygen atoms

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.187
forms a helical structure, like DNA.

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:38.879
Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil,

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:43.343
forming a new compound
that leaves a dark mark on the paper.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:47.460
However, in the absence of starch,
there is no chemical reaction

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.343
and the mark will look light yellow.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.262
So if the fake isn't printed 
on starchy paper,

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.808
iodine solutions can't help you.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:59.819
That's one of the reasons 
U.S. bills printed since 1996

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.404
have been chemically enhanced to include
another counterfeit countermeasure:

00:02:05.404 --> 00:02:08.557
a strip that fluoresces under UV light.

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:11.860
That's the same kind of light
used at black light parties

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.747
and airport security lines.

00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:18.096
The polyester strip 
printed with invisble ink

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.275
is just one millimeter wide

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:24.546
and is found in different positions
depending on a bill's value.

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:26.865
If you hold your dollar 
up to natural light,

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:30.816
you can see the amount 
and the word USA printed on the band.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:34.474
But under UV light, 
these strips really shine.

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:39.537
They contain molecules that can be excited
by absorbing certain amounts of energy,

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:43.972
specifically, that given off 
by common UV light sources.

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:47.608
As these excited molecules return
to their original states,

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:52.898
they lose a bit of energy as heat
and then radiate the rest as light.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.079
Energy is inversely related to wavelength,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.314
which means that the longer wavelengths
have lower energy.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.989
So the lower energy light 
given off by the strip

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.584
means longer wavelengths
that fall in the visible range,

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:10.529
and suddenly we can see that 
which had been invisible.

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.584
And if a glowing strip doesn't show up
on a recent bill,

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:16.858
you have a fake on your hands.

00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:20.165
For times when you're not dealing 
with counterfeit masterminds,

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:23.541
looking for simple visual cues will do.

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:26.853
Make sure the portrait 
looks lifelike and not flat,

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:30.317
the seal has perfectly 
even sawtooth points,

00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:32.693
the inked border is unbroken,

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:38.182
and the serial number has precisely 
equal spacing between each number.

00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:41.108
So the next time you come across 
some dubious dough,

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:42.483
have a closer look,

00:03:42.483 --> 00:03:44.224
pull out your iodine solution,

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.597
or take it to a rave

00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:49.330
and you just might catch a counterfeit.
