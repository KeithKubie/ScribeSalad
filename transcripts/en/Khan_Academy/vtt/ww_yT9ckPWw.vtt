00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's find the equation for
the regression line

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.470
that best fits this.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.440
Where the fit minimizes the
squared distance to each of

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.210
the points.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.870
And then let's actually
calculate how good of a fit it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.880
is using an r squared.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.210
And we might have to do that
in the next video,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.360
depending on time.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.700
So just as a reminder, the
line is going to have the

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.870
equation y is equal mx plus b.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.840
And we've shown ourselves that
the slope of this line-- the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.470
one that best minimizes the
squared distance to each of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.320
those points-- is going to be
the mean of the xy's minus the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.120
mean of x times the mean of y.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
All of that over the mean of the
x's squared, or the mean

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.700
of the x squareds, minus the
means of the x's squared.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.070
So one way to memorize it, I
guess, is the first terms have

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.440
the mean of the combined
things.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.860
You're multiplying x times
itself first, then meaning.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.330
You're multiplying x
times y, times each

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.390
other first, then meaning.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.310
And then the second terms,
you're finding the means of

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.760
the individual components
and then multiplying.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
Mean of x, times mean of y,
mean of x times mean of x.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.850
So hopefully maybe that helps.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.770
Maybe it doesn't.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.510
But we can calculate
the slope.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.300
And then the y intercept, b, is
just going to be equal to

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.130
the mean of y times whatever we
calculate here for m, times

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.850
the mean of x.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.370
And we can do that because we
know that the point mean of x

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.470
comma mean of y is going to be
on this regression live.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.150
So what's calculate them.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.340
And you'll see, in the last
example we did three points.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.280
We only have four points here.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.990
But the computations get
more and more intense.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.010
You can imagine what would
happen if you had 10 or 20 or

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.660
100 points.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.690
You pretty much have to use a
calculator at that point.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.030
Or computer, even better.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.530
Or a spreadsheet.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050
So let's calculate m.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.740
And to do that, let's calculate
the components.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.840
So the mean of x-- the mean of
the x's-- is going to be equal

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.520
to, this x is negative 2, plus
negative 1, plus 1, plus 4.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.550
All of that over, we have
four x data points.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.660
These two guys cancel out.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.930
Negative 2 plus 4 is 2.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.250
2 over 4 is equal to 1/2.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.965
Now let's do the mean
of the y's.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.600
We have negative 3, we
have a negative 1.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.460
And then we have a 2, and
then we have a 3.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.300
And once again, we have
four data points.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.860
That guy and that
guy cancel out.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.390
Negative 1 plus 2 is 1.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.460
So this is equal to 1/4.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.210
Now let's figure out the
mean of the xy's.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.020
So x times y, the
mean of that.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.760
So over here we have negative
2 times negative 3.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.040
Negative 2 times negative
3 is positive 6.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.120
Plus negative 1 times negative
1 is positive 1.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.440
Plus 1 times 2 is 2.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.860
Plus 4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.690
And we have four of
these points.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.480
And what is this?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.890
This is 6 plus 1 is 7.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.980
7 plus 2 is 9.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.880
9 plus 12 is 21 over 4.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:36.550
This is equal to 21/4.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.360
And then finally, we want-- I'll
do this in a new color--

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.400
the mean of the x's squared.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.790
And so that is going to be equal
to-- negative 2 squared

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.510
is positive 4.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.280
Plus negative 1 squared
is positive 1.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.830
Plus 1 squared is 1.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.980
Plus for 4 squared is 16.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.640
All of that over 4.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.710
4 plus 2 is 6 plus
16 is 22 over 4.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:15.200
So 22/4 is the same
thing as 11/2.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.610
So now we're now ready to
calculate the actual slope.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.190
Let me do it over here.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.970
Well actually, let me
do it over here.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.910
I want to be able look at
everything we've done.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.595
So this is going to be equal to,
in this case, it's going

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:36.280
to be the mean of the
xy's, which is 21/4.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:47.200
Minus the product of the mean
of x, which is 1/2.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.500
Times the mean of the
y's, which is 1/4.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.440
And then all of that over
the mean of the x

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.200
squareds, which is 11/2.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.840
So we did that.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.270
Minus the mean of
the x's squared.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.960
The mean of the x's,
once again, is 1/2.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.200
And so what is this equal to?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.720
I'm just going to go straight
to the calculator.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.250
I could deal with the fractions,
but this isn't a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.980
review of adding
and subtracting

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.060
and multiplying fractions.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.400
Let's just go straight
to the calculator.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.100
Actually, let me simplify
it before.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.380
It's just too tempting
to simplify.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.630
Let me copy and paste it.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.090
Let's go down here
to calculate it.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.840
And so this is going to be--
maybe I should have used the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.930
calculator, but it's
too tempting.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.930
So what's this on top?

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.440
On top, we have 21/4 minus 1/2
times 1/4 is minus 1/8.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.250
All of that over 11/2 minus
1/2 squared, which is 1/4.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.270
Now, one way to simplify this
right from the get go is

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.320
multiply the numerator and
the denominator by 8.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.410
And that's just to get rid
of all these fractions.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.150
So 21/4 times 8 is going to be
the same thing is 21 times 2,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.380
which is equal to 42.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.570
Minus 1/8 times 8.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.670
We have to, of course,
distribute the eights.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.340
So it's going to be minus 1.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.360
All of that over, 8 times 11/2
is going to be 11 times 4,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.870
which is 44.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.620
And then 8 times 1/4 is
2, so it's minus 2.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.690
So 42 minus 1 is 41.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.000
And then 44 minus 2 is 42.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.130
So the slope is 41/42.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.850
So a little bit less than
a slope of one.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.740
42/42 would be exactly 1.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.260
So our regression slope is
a little bit less than 1.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:04.840
And then our regression
y-intercept, b, is going to be

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.330
equal to the mean of the y.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:17.660
So 1/4, minus our slope, minus
41/42, times the mean of the

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.260
x's, so times 1/2.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:35.070
And so this is going to be
equal to 1/4 minus 41/84,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.170
which is equal to-- let
me just find a common

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.670
denominator.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.050
So let's go over 84.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.460
So what's 1/4 of 84?

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.360
1/4 of 80 is 20.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.070
So this is 21.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.210
21 times 4 is 84.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.400
This is 1/4 of 84.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.520
Yep, that's right.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.790
So it's going to be 21 minus 41
over 84, which is equal to

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.360
negative 20.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.510
Negative 20 over 84, which is
the same thing, they're both

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.280
divisible by 4, the numerator
divided by 4 is

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.310
negative 5, over 21.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.800
So our regression line is going
to be y is equal to

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.460
41/42 x minus 5/21.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.930
And 5/21 is a little
bit less than 1/4.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.720
5/20 would be 1/4.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.980
We made the denominator a little
bit bigger, so it's

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.630
going to be a little bit
less than negative 1/4.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.980
So our y-intercept is going to
be a little bit less than

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.650
negative 1/4.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.169
And then we're going to
have a slope a little

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.145
bit less than 1.

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:46.340
So our line is going to look
something like this.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.730
If I were able to actually draw
a straight line, it would

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.880
look something like
that over there.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.250
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.920
In the next video, we're
actually going to calculate

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.250
the r squared for this line.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.840
How good of a fit is it?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.940
How much of the total variation
in the y values can

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.340
be explained by the variation
in the x values, or by the

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.990
line itself?
