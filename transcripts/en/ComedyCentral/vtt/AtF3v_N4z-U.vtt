00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.237
Once upon a time, Mitt Romney
and his haircut tweeted

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.939
about president-elect
and popular Sunkist soda flavor

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:10.310
Donald Trump "Hitting on married
women? Condoning assault?

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:13.013
"Such vile degradations demean
our wives and daughters

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.048
and corrupt
America's face to the world."

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.217
But after a whirlwind bromance

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.687
where the pair talked about
the secretary of state job

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.056
while dining on-- I don't know--
probably frog legs

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.925
and bald eagle wings,
I don't know what they eat--

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.060
Romney said this to reporters.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.208
He won the general election.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.976
-Oh.
-GAROFALO: Oh.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.945
What a cuck.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.314
-(laughter)
-I'm impressed.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.349
You couldn't actually see
Trump's lips moving

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.685
where he stuffed his hand
up Mitt's ass.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.387
"I lost because it's official.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.389
"Mr. Trump is a better person
than me, okay?

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.058
"I'm... I'm a big baby
who goes poopy in his diaper,

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.293
"and Trump is my daddy.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.827
"What the (bleep)
do you people want from me?!

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.696
"I'm not enough of a monster?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.098
"You want me to go out there
and grab a lady

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.168
"in the bathing suit area
while drunk on caffeine?!

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.237
I have no dignity left."

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.239
(laughter)

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.408
All right, so clearly, clearly,
Trump made Romney say all that,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.143
so if he wants to become
secretary of state,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.178
he has to say that. Comedians,
what are some other things

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.081
Mitt will have to admit
to join Trump's cabinet?

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.984
-Janeane.
-He will have to reveal

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.453
the Mormon who styles
his wigs and murkins.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.722
-HARDWICK: Yes. Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:33.427
Michael Ian Black.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.430
Uh, he'll have to say,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.466
"My carefully cultivated image

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.737
"as an elder statesman
of the GOP

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.874
"was actually
a tinsel-thin veneer

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.577
"I was willing
to shove up my own asshole

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.048
in order to get a job
with a man I swore to oppose."

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.484
-All right, yeah. I think...
-(cheering, applause)

00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:57.584
I mean, that's a paraphrasing,
but yes, points.
