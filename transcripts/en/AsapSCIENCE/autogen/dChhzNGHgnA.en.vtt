00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.290
 All of us are fascinated by muscles and strength - whether we want to be stronger, 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.930
 To feel better, or to look like a superman, there are many proposed strategies and systems 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.630
 Aerobic exercise to reach this result. But what if I told you that this was out of your control, and that 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.220
 Could it be your genetics that hinders you? Conversely, what if there is a secret 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.039
 Can he connect you to superhuman power? 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.239
 The truth is: the size of your muscles is a certain limit. Sure, this may seem obvious when you hear it, 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.769
 But your muscles are under strict control of a protein called "myostatin", which determines 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.320
 Exactly how much size will reach the muscle. This difference varies between people according to 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.510
 Levels of metastatin. Once the muscle reaches this limit, the myostatin prevents any further growth. 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.950
 But if the meostatin itself is limited or not, the muscle will suddenly grow beyond normal limits. 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.700
 This phenomenon was first observed in the "Belgian blue cattle". 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.620
 These cows developed a larger muscle mass 2-3 times than normal cows, and were discovered 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.780
 Later she was suffering from deletion of the GDF-8 gene, which showed that it produced the myostatin. 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.720
 As a result, without any exercise or diet, you own these cows 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.220
 Amazing muscle mass. Similar cases are documented when dogs, mice and even 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.360
 Some cases of human children lack the GDF-8 gene. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.380
 These results have helped scientists understand why muscle mass is easily increased, while others are struggling. 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.810
 Low levels of myostatin equate to a larger muscle mass. In fact, some studies have shown 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 Many bodybuilders have naturally lower levels, or even a complete absence 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.780
 For the histotin gene. If you look at someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger, for being a teenager, 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.060
 It seems to grow muscle naturally. As such, many bodybuilders may owe their success 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.240
 To inherit more than their training or use of real estate. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 In the end, it may be possible to develop drugs that undermine or restrict the meostatin. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
 Of course, this is a double-edged sword; on the one hand, patients with muscular atrophy, 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229
 Or loss of muscle mass due to aging, restore the growth and safety of their muscles. On the other hand, it seems 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.119
 The likelihood of misuse as a performance optimizer is unavoidable. But the possibility of seeing a real big man 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.409
 Sounds fun. In addition, should we consider those who already have low levels of myostatin? 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.750
 That they have an unfair advantage? It's hard to answer 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.540
 Be wary of anyone selling or promoting this non-fixated and unregulated treatment. 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 At the end of the day, whether your meostatine levels are low or naturally elevated, remember 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.959
 This level is optimal for your mechanical and metabolic function. With appropriate exercise 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.840
 And public health, will reach the peak of your unique physiological functions. And though you are 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.690
 You may not be ready to repel a punch like Superman, but you can reach your maximum limits through training 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.630
 And work hard. But, what if you can hit the punches with Superman? 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.989
 Our friend Jake has his program .. answer this huge supernatural question, which 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.580
 You definitely need to watch it. And if you want to know how much of the ... 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
 There is only one real way to do that. Start working. 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.510
