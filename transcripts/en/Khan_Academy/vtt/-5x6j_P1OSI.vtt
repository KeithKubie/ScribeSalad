00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.960
- [Instructor] You are
already likely familiar

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.170
with the notion that a dollar in the U.S.,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.660
a U.S. dollar is not
necessarily equivalent

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.070
to one currency unit in
another country, say one Euro.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.260
And so if you were
traveling to that country,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.650
and you are holding dollars,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.280
and you needed to exchange
those dollars into Euros,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.300
you'd say, well how many Euros

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.080
am I going to get for my dollars?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.490
Or if you were European,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.677
and you had a certain number of Euro,

00:00:24.677 --> 00:00:26.550
and you said how many
dollars am I going to get

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.310
for my Euros, you would be
thinking about the exchange rate.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.410
And it's not just about
if you're a tourist

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.540
or you're traveling,
it's also very important

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.300
if you're an importer and exporter.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.760
If you make, say cars,
in the United States,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.400
where all of your costs are in dollars,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.300
but you're selling them in Europe

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.720
where you're getting your
money in terms of Euros,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.880
and then you have to convert them

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880
back to dollars to pay your costs,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.800
well the idea of an
exchange rate matters a lot.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.790
And so, first let's make tangible

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.580
what an exchange rate even looks like.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.300
And there's many different
ways of representing it.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.580
The first thing to appreciate,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.300
if someone says what's the exchange rate

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.400
for the U.S. dollar, your
next reaction should be,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090
with regards to what other currency?

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.730
So if I said, what's the exchange rate

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.960
of the U.S. dollar with
respect to the Euro,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.080
you could express that as one U.S. dollar,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.080
U.S. dollar, is equal to how many Euros?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.340
And at the time of this video,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.860
it's actually 0.87 Euros.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.350
Now another way to express this is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.350
one Euro, one Euro is equal
to how many U.S. dollars?

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.400
And if you know this first equation,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.900
you can figure out the second one.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.220
You would essentially just
divide both sides by 0.87.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.080
If you divide this by 0.87 you get one.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.450
If you divide one by 0.87,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.273
you are going to get approximately 1.15.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.230
And so at the time of this video,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.900
1.15 U.S. dollars is equal to one Euro.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.400
Or another way to think about it is,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.930
if you took a dollar
and 15 cents in the U.S.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.550
and convert it to Euros,
you would get one Euro.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.570
And there's other ways of expressing it.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.370
You could say what is the
price of a U.S. dollar,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.370
so price of the U.S.
dollar in terms of Euro,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760
in terms of Euro.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.600
So this is, how much would it cost

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.760
to buy one U.S. dollar in terms of Euros?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.550
Well you could just
look at this over here,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.080
and you could say, well,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.880
one U.S. dollar is going
to cost 0.87 Euros.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.320
Or you could say 0.87 Euros,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.320
Euros per U.S., per U.S. dollar.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.340
And if you were to go
the other way around,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.760
if you wanted the price of the Euro,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.760
price of the Euro in terms,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
terms of the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.010
well that would be the
other right way around.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.490
One Euro would cost $1.15.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.450
So this would be 1.15 U.S. dollars,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.350
dollars per Euro.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.110
Now with all of this out of the way,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.290
let's actually do some calculations.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.670
Let's imagine that in the United States

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.220
a yellow box goes for $20.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.800
These yellow boxes are in high demand.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.160
Someone from Europe wants to
buy one of these yellow boxes,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.600
and they need to buy
it for 20 U.S. dollars,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.200
but they only have Euro.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.830
How many Euro would they need in order

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.120
to buy that box for 20 U.S. dollars.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.070
Well if one U.S. dollar
is equal 0.87 Euros,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.690
then 20 U.S. dollars is going
to be 20 times as many Euros.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.650
So we could say $20

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.860
times 0.87 Euro per dollar.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.420
This symbol right over
here is shorthand for Euro.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.130
And so you are going to get, let's see,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.300
that would be 17, approximately,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.530
approximately 17.40 Euro.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.000
And if it went the other way around.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.400
Let's say that red boxes
are available for purchase

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.030
only in Europe for 20 Euro.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.700
An American tourist goes there,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.870
and wants to figure out
how many U.S. dollars

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.850
would they have to convert
in order to be able

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.253
to pay for one of these
red boxes that are 20 Euro?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.260
Well here we see one Euro is
equal to 1.15 U.S. dollars.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So here you would say 20
Euro times 1.15 U.S. dollars,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.990
dollar per Euro, and so
what is this going to be?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.210
This is going to be 20 times 1.15,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.450
which is going to be 23 U.S. dollars.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.850
23 U.S. dollars.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.990
Now another idea, a related idea to this,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.780
is this notion that currencies can

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.570
appreciate and depreciate.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.060
So let's say that the Euro
appreciates, appreciates,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.720
and it always matters
relative to something.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.720
So you say relative to the dollar.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.930
So the Euro appreciates
relative to the dollar.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.700
Come up with an exchange rate

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.790
that would show the Euro
appreciating relative to the dollar

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.323
with this as a starting point.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.370
So one scenario where this is happening

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.810
is if this was where you are starting,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.160
one Euro would now be more U.S. dollars,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.730
more than 1.15 U.S. dollars.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.960
So you have one Euro,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.210
would now be equal to, maybe
it's equal to $1.20 now.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.073
So it's now equal to $1.20.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.480
Now if someone said the
dollar appreciates relative

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.070
to the Euro, then it would
go the other way around.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.330
That might be one U.S.
dollars is now equivalent

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.330
to .9 Euros, or maybe
one Euro, or 1.05 Euros.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.190
And similarly, if someone
says that the Euro

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.190
depreciates, depreciates relative,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.380
relative to the dollar.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.250
That's another way of saying

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.230
that the dollar has appreciated
relative to the Euro.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.980
So this could be a situation where

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.180
if the Euro's depreciating
relative to the dollar

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.560
from this place right over here,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.681
one Euro, one Euro is now
equal to fewer dollars.

00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:39.381
And maybe it's now equal to $1.05.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.900
And with this as a starting point,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.450
this would also be a
situation where the dollar

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.420
has appreciated relative to the Euro.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.430
So I'll leave you there.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.210
This is a primer on exchange rates.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.010
It can get a little bit confusing

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.150
because you're talking for
the price of a currency

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.180
in terms of another currency.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.340
But I encourage you to
keep thinking about things.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.840
Keep doing these little thought
experiments in your head,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.130
and thinking about, okay,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.910
if a Euro is equal to more than a dollar,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.450
if something's worth a
certain number of Euros,

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.540
it should be a larger
number in terms of dollars.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.690
Similarly, if a dollar
is less than one Euro,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.410
if something costs a
certain number of dollars,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.363
it should be a smaller
number in terms of Euros.
