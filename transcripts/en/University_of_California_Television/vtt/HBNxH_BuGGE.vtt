00:00:01.302 --> 00:00:03.719
(calm music)

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.540
- John Heilbron is a great gardener.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
Now this is an aspect of John's life

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.520
that not everyone knows about,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.860
but I see in this audience
a handful of people who,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.580
like myself, have visited
John and his wife,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.060
Allison Browning, in their
home in the Cotswolds

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.780
behind which is a huge

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.433
and impeccably maintained English garden.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.360
And the two of them do it themselves.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.570
I mention this because it's an example

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.080
of talents and accomplishments

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.520
not on the public record that assist

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730
in making John Heilbron

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.410
one of the most universally talented,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.410
accomplished, and prodigiously
energetic people that I know.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.350
Now, John is especially known

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.350
for two themes in his
life that were addressed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.900
by our colleague Bill Lester yesterday

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.110
in introducing John.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.680
One, his eminence as a
historian of science,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.240
his eminence as a scholar, his
achievements as a historian

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.560
that have earned him a place on the list

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.980
of distinguished names that
we find in our program.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.920
A second thing Bill mentioned
that I want to underscore

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.630
is John's long-standing
connection to Berkeley.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.640
Bill mentioned that John had
been chair of the senate here,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.300
had been vice chancellor,
had founded our Office

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.260
for the History of Science and Technology.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.000
Indeed John has had a long term

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.310
and a deeply devoted
relationship to UC Berkeley,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.310
comes back often, and those of us

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.090
that work in OHST have brought him back

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.610
as an emeritus professor a number of times

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.800
and greatly enriched by his presence,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.210
especially the advice that he offers

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.983
to many of us about academic
and administrative issues.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.880
One aspect of John's
connection to Berkeley,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720
which I think has largely been forgotten,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.990
although some of you here who
have been around the longest

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.330
may be aware of it is that John was,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.500
as a graduate student,
a doctoral student here

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.970
of Thomas S. Kuhn.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.150
So he's been involved with distinguished

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.950
intellectual activities on
this campus for a long time,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.693
and I want to comment that
when Tom Kuhn died in the '90s,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.400
John wrote an exceptionally
beautiful and thoughtful

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.640
memorial essay to Tom
in which he described

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.690
the structure of scientific revolutions

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
as holding to the history
and philosophy of science,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.670
a relation somewhat like
an impressionist painting

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.540
to the history of painting

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.870
which is to say that with the structure

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.190
of scientific revolution,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.150
you don't get a lot of close up

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.480
technical detail that you can measure

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.180
but you do get an impression about

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.900
the object of perception
that's really different.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.980
It changes your understanding of it,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.870
a great memorial essay about Tom Kuhn.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.260
I want also to observe that

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.690
when John was Vice Chancellor here,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.270
among his many accomplishments
is not well known

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.090
outside of administrative circles,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.980
and that is that he convened a competition

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.530
among deans and chairs
as to who could write

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.963
the most terse administrative memos.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.653
And John always won the competition.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.910
So we have before us
then a great gardener,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.580
a great memorialist,
a great administrator,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.440
a great teacher, and quite simply

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.520
the best historian of science

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.073
in the English speaking
world, John Heilbron.

00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:43.141
(crowd applauding)

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.480
- Well, in in order that you can calibrate

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.560
these very kind remarks by David,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.856
I must tell you that my
garden is full of weeds.

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:56.856
(audience laughing)

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.890
Yesterday I exhibited certain parallels

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.660
between the physical and
the historical sciences

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.400
in the early modern period.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.480
I begin today with examples

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.210
of the application of physics to history

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.930
and of causes to both

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.740
and proceed to their joint attack

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.000
on the old space timeframe.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.090
I end with applications to the
contemporary Berkeley scene.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.590
Here is what we're going to do today.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.630
You can keep track of my progress

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.750
by remembering the numbers.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.890
So, first, to historico-mathematics.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.830
Jean Mabillon, whom you'll
remember from last time

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.780
as the codifier of the
ancillary historical sciences

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.770
like to repeat the classical slogan

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.580
that geography and chronology

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.370
are the two eyes of history.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.640
Many savants of the late
17th and early 18th century

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.420
brought these two disciplines

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.310
and knowledge of old languages to bare

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.453
on ancient history both
sacred and profane.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.000
The result was an arresting antiquarianism

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.130
that, in order to keep
my accounts in parallel,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.760
I'll call historico-mathematics.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.320
Newton was its most
dedicated practitioner.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.720
Another was Olof Rudbeck, the elder,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.740
Professor of Medicine at
the University of Uppsala,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.250
a distinguished anatomist and botanist

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.903
and the discoverer of
the lymphatic system.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.740
Here he shows himself
practicing his anatomical art

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.083
on the Eye of Geography.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.890
On his right, acting as his
ostensor or demonstrator

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.453
is history's other eye in
the head of Father Time.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.880
They performed before sages,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.060
arranged as if in an anatomical theater.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.350
On Time's right, Hesiod,
Plato, and Aristotle.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.400
On Rudbeck's left, Orpheus,
Homer, blindly looking

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.760
through a telescope, and Plutarch.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.900
In the foreground with their backs to us,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.060
Apollodorus, Tacitus, and Odysseus.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.470
And in the lower right
corner, a perplexed Ptolemy,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.090
the astronomer and geographer,

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.550
apparently questioning the
value of his instruments.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.220
These gentlemen are witnesses
both to ancient knowledge

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.450
and to Rudbeck's great discovery

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.500
which all of them had missed,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.060
that the island of
Atlantis was safe and well

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.470
and known in the modern world as Sweden.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.780
(audience laughing)

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.780
Now the proposition is fairly obvious

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.370
when you compare as Rudbeck did

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.120
the geography of Atlantis
as described by Plato

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.570
with the physical features of Sweden.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.360
No place on Earth better resembles

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.863
the capital of Atlantis than Uppsala.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.590
Consideration of runes
and old Swedish calendars

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.140
and the names and doings of Norse gods

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.400
indicated that writing, astronomy,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.630
and mythology, yay civilization itself

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.600
originated in the north from whence

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.140
precocious vikings brought
it to Greece and Egypt

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.583
a century or two after the flood.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.520
I can't rehearse for you the 2,000 pages

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.040
of ingenious arguments
rich with wild etymologies,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.020
correspondences and
geography and chronology

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.180
and identifications of
personages in classical mythology

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.850
with their Swedish originals with which

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.223
Rudbeck clinched his case.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.470
But the slide gives a
little symbolic guidance.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.500
Rudbeck draws back a flap of Earth flesh

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.270
marked Svíþjóð or Sweden to reveal bedrock

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.190
labeled diorem insula,
the island of the gods,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.233
the birthplace of Saturn and
his dysfunctional family.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.380
Above the scene the great and little bears

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.380
and the polestar symbolize the north

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.920
and the astronomical knowledge

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.740
needed to solve historical problems.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.560
And underneath it all is the concession

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.340
that Rudbeck and his audience are men,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.010
for the words et nos homines
signify, as he explains

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.383
1,000 pages on, that
all of us make mistakes.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.080
Several of Rudbeck's
learned contemporaries

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.030
applauded his "Atlantica",
and a few as learned as he

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.930
in science and history
wrote similar extravagances.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.600
Still, most people who cultivated

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.120
the historical sciences around 1700

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.150
would've taken the slogan
'All of us make mistakes'

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.193
to be the only useful truth
in Rudbeck's huge book.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.250
Isaac Newton's first published work

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.870
was an edition of a book on geography.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.410
His last work, published
posthumously, was on chronology.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.893
Still he did not have
20/20 historical vision.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.400
He accepted Bishop
Ussher's dating of creation

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.760
at 4,000 years before Christ,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.550
and the Old Testament
as a reliable account

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.633
of human history.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.490
This tight timeframe
had the standard problem

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.080
that it could not accommodate

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.980
the extensive pedigrees
claimed by the Babylonians,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.030
the Chinese, and the Egyptians,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.980
or the special problem Newton took

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.670
as his personal historical assignment.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.610
This was to show that the usual dating

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.740
of ancient history which
gave the Greeks seniority

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.570
over the Hebrews in the invention

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.423
of the arts and sciences was wrong.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.290
He labored incessantly to solve it.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.350
Here is one page of his notes

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.330
on his reading of ancient history

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.950
which you see is written
in any different direction

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.910
on an invitation from somebody else

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.463
to something he didn't go to.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.320
To his literal mind, the headstart

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.980
of the old Hebrews and
their easy access to God

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.870
should've made them the teachers
of mankind in all things.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.590
Consequently, despite the evidence,

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.490
Solomon's age must have preceded

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.283
the high civilization of Troy.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.380
Ussher dated Solomon at
3,000 years after creation

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.670
or 1,000 BC.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.840
Hence, Achilles and
the other Greek heroes,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.060
whom Newton accepted as
historical characters,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.333
must have lived in the first
millennium before Christ.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.930
Newton's method of
demonstrating this conclusion

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.530
may be followed most readily

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.130
on this simulacrum of the heavens,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.060
the Farnese Globe, an artifact

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.803
of the second century AD.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.110
It represents the constellations

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.200
much as the Greek Poet
Aratus described him

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.083
around 350 BC, that is 500 years earlier.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.250
Aratus had his information
from the now lost

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.920
writings of Eudoxus who
lived at the time of Plato.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.973
Have you got that?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.513
This is all secure.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.200
The next step is not.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.330
Newton supposed that the descriptions

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.100
of Aratus and Eudoxus
were authentic records

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.490
from the time of the invention,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.410
not the depiction, but the
invention of the constellation.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.403
When was that?

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.870
According to Eudoxus, the
most ancient astronomers

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.440
placed the equinoxes in the centers

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.203
of the Ram and the Balance.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.120
By the time of Ptolemy, however,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.550
when the globe was made in 150 AD,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.470
the equinoctial colure,
which is the great circle

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.040
that passes through the equinoxes

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.550
in the North and South
poles of the heavens,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.943
ran as you can see through
the horn of the Ram.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.810
Using the rate of this displacement

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.260
from the middle of the Ram to his horn

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.853
of the equinoctial colure,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.540
Newton calculated from
his gravitational theory

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.370
and Aratus' description
of the constellations

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.810
that the poet had portrayed the heavens

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.913
as they appeared in 950 BC.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.690
Newton had only to associate this date

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.570
with an episode in Greek history

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.280
that might've required marking out

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.000
constellations on a sphere.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.610
The voyage of the Argonauts
was just the thing.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.570
Tradition reported that Chiron the Centaur

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.630
had taught Jason the use of the sphere

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.713
to find his way to the golden fleece.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.750
Now, Jason turned out to be a very poor

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.160
student of navigation.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.040
On his homeward journey, he allowed

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.240
the good ship Argos to wander
all over Northern Europe,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.033
even onto Sweden, according to Rudbeck.

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:18.460
Rudbeck made his students carry models

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.570
of the ship as he imagined it

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.070
over long distances to
show that Jason's men

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.850
could've made the necessary traverse

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.203
between rivers in Russia.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.140
Being of Swedish descent, you recall,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.410
they're Greeks.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.550
Being of Swedish descent, the Argonauts

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.613
would've been as strong and
tough as Uppsala students.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.530
By placing Chiron's lecture's on astronomy

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.940
50 years after Solomon flourished,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.110
Newton made it possible for the centaurs

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.930
to have learned their
science from the Jews.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.150
At the high cost, however, of knocking

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.230
three centuries out of Greek history

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.810
as understood by Newton's contemporaries

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.233
and confirmed by ancient inscriptions.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.960
Francesco Bianchini who
made the first analysis

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.830
of the Farnese Globe reasoned,

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.930
there he is reasoning,
looking through his telescope,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.030
reasoned independently of Newton

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.640
to date the first celestial sphere

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.900
to the time of the Argonauts.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.600
By taking literally the scale
inscribed upon the globe,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.330
Bianchini obtained 1,275
BC as the likely date

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.560
of the launching of the Argo.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.200
He probably told Newton
about his calculation

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.240
but the great man would
not accept the date

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.840
that agreed with everything else

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.623
known about Greek history.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.540
Now, it turns out that
the best modern date

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.380
for the sack of Homer's Troy

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.980
agrees perfectly with Bianchini's
date for the Argonauts

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.700
who, had they existed, would've done so

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.523
a generation before Priam and Agamemnon.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.760
Incidentally you saw Bianchini yesterday

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.650
at a sale of ancient coins.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.880
I'll let you fine pick out which he is.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.910
He was an important
historian and archeologist

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.440
as well as an astronomer,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.123
a perfect physico-historico mathematician.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.410
Newton was virtually the dictator

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.670
of the Royal Society of London

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.580
for a quarter century
before his death in 1727.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.610
His authority and achievement will explain

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.850
why over half the members of the society

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.450
who responded to a questionnaire

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.730
about their interest in 1718 replied

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:28.510
either physico-mathematics
or antiquities, or both,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.410
whether or not they could do arithmetic

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.563
or decipher a Latin inscription.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.190
In order to prolong his
dominance after his death,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.420
Newton chose as his successor a young man

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.800
named Martin Folkes

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.340
who was enough of a mathematician

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.060
to understand the Principia

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.010
and an expert on old
coins, weights and medals.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.430
Folkes did succeed Newton,
but not immediately.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.930
In the meantime he went to Italy

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.800
where he saw the Farnese Globe

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.940
of which he made a replica and an exact

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.150
planospheric projection.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.460
On his return to England
he exhibited his globe

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.890
to the Royal Society,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.540
and the Royal Society of Antiquaries

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.440
which thus obtained the hardware

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.163
for correcting Newton's calculation.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.880
While president of the Royal Society,

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.550
Folkes also served as
president of the Antiquaries.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.850
His personal union of the two crowns

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.350
of British learning demonstrates

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.270
that the parallels I have been developing

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.670
on the level of ideas had a reflection

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.283
on the institutional plain.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.430
The historico-mathematicians of the Paris

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.217
Académie des Inscriptions

00:16:37.217 --> 00:16:40.180
delighted over Newton's
posthumous chronologies

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.640
of the ancient kingdoms amended.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.630
At last the greatest man who ever lived,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.050
as Newton's countrymen styled him,

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.450
had show himself a true John Bull.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.993
Wrong, wrong, and stubbornly wrong.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.890
I'll not trouble you with the many errors

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.160
lovingly cataloged by Nicolas Freret,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.820
secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.500
who though he accepted
creation in 4,000 BC

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.570
could not credit the existence
of Chiron the Centaur

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.720
and refused to distort Greek history

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.113
to save the reputation of Solomon.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.180
I say only that Freret's argument remained

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.450
within the restricted circle

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.080
of historico-mathematics.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.520
The line from Newton to Freret

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.440
did not produce Voltaire

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.790
any more than the line
from Newton to Folkes

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.780
produced Gibbon.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.910
Mixed mathematics did
not engender true history

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.560
any more than it did true physics.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.490
That is because in both cases,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.923
the philosophy, the causes, were left out.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.653
I come to causes and motives.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.933
The review of Newton's Principia

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:52.350
in the "Journal des
sçavans" was not ecstatic.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.860
It's a good piece of
mathematics, the reviewers said,

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.320
but garbage as physics,

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.500
for physics is a science of causes

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.590
as in the pushy universe of Descartes,

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.450
and Newton expressly forswore
specifying hypotheses,

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.930
that is physical causes.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.230
But as the 18th century wore on,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.340
natural philosophers lost their scruples

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.300
against admitting such
absurdities as distant forces,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.630
and repopulated the bare and Cartesian

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.360
mechanistic world with special substances

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.400
like electrical and magnetic fluids,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.990
the matter of heat and light,

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.520
the matter of heat and fire
and particles of light.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.630
And they calculated, as if they believed

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.940
in gravitational and electrical forces

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.713
that act at a distance.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.740
They restrained their
joined imagination, however,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.750
by subjecting it to the control

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.703
of systematic experiment and mathematics.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.690
Electricity is a good example.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.260
At the beginning of the 18th century,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.650
philosophers considered
it a straightforward

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.020
mechanical effect owing to streams

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.290
of small bits of ordinary matter

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.363
drawn forth from amber,
glass, and cats by friction.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.410
These streams carried light small bodies

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.040
toward and away from the excited electric,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.370
as the rubbed glass was called,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.610
and so brought about what electricians

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.750
described as attractions and repulsions.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.940
By allowing the electrical
matter to contain light,

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.530
electricians could also account

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.480
qualitatively for sparks and glows

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.700
like famous "Beatification" in which light

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.793
springs from the crown
of an electrified saint.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.480
Toward 1750, electricians invented

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.610
the condenser which soon taught them

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.050
that the mechanical explanation

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.550
of electrical effects had fatal flaws.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.220
Their teacher was Benjamin Franklin,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.850
and he's teaching the doctrine

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.600
of plus and minus electricity.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.340
By 1800, a model based on
the gravitational theory,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.730
which is essentially the electrostatic

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.450
still taught in elementary physics,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.260
had replaced the mechanical explanation.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.500
The new model, different
from earlier physics

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.640
in two capital ways.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.580
It was quantitative whereas

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.380
the theory of electrical streams

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.210
destroyed by Franklin was qualitative,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.760
and it was causative,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.053
whereas Newtonian
gravitation was descriptive.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.090
The development in history,

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.360
parallel to Franklinist electricity,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.450
was the combination of narrative

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.810
with its stress on motives and causes

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.384
with systemized antiquarian facts.

00:20:27.384 --> 00:20:29.720
Perhaps it will be
enough to point to Gibbon

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.033
to indicate the type.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:32.957
The great pageant of his

00:20:32.957 --> 00:20:35.220
"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.050
is powered by the
self-interest great persons

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.460
and the indifference of historical forces

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.600
and documented by appeal to artifacts

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.323
as well as to the written word.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.640
In preparation for his visit to Italy

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.572
in 1764 during which he conceived

00:20:50.572 --> 00:20:54.397
his grand project "Amid
the Ruins of the Forum",

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.810
Gibbon studied ancient Roman coins

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.560
and medals assiduously and worked his way

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.363
through Mabillon's diplomatics.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.160
He was as well equipped
with antiquarian knowledge

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.530
when he crossed the Alps, he said,

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.610
as Hannibal's army was with elephants.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.880
The art and science of
the decline and fall

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.100
lie in the use of antiquarian evidence

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.740
along with ancient and modern histories

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.490
and common sense motives to explain

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.320
the triumph of barbarism and religion

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.853
that ended the Roman Empire.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.900
It seems to follow that
Gibbon's famous history

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.800
and a darling physical
science of the 18th century

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.530
are but two forms of the same thing.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.950
The union of similar restraining
and enabling techniques

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.313
with bold assumptions of causes.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.600
After analogies too strong to resist

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.950
brought me to recognize this odd parallel,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.640
I found a golden passage in
Joseph Priestley's lectures

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.940
on History of 1788.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.940
Priestley was the discoverer
of oxygen and other gasses.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.860
Historian, teacher, philanthropist,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.560
unitarian minister, Franklin's friend,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.580
and as an exegete of the New Testament,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.210
a forerunner of the higher critics.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.827
The golden passage reads, quote,

00:22:11.827 --> 00:22:14.177
"Real history resembles the experiments

00:22:14.177 --> 00:22:16.577
"made by the electrical machine,

00:22:16.577 --> 00:22:18.387
"the ground work and materials

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:22.160
"of the most extensive
and useful theories."

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.573
I come to time and space.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.880
Newton accepted the mosaic account

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.220
of the literal truth,
though not the whole truth,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.070
as the literal truth
though not the whole truth

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.880
about the creation and the flood

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.730
Delving as usual more deeply than others,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.530
Newton perceived that Moses had hinted

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.820
at the Copernican system of the world

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.390
in the dumbed down account

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.743
he gave of the Big Bang in Genesis.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.550
So, too, the unleashing of the waters

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.010
of the abyss that caused the flood

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.000
was not the whole story.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.950
As Newton's disciple and
successor at Cambridge,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.980
William Whiston showed the Earth drowned

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.400
as a result of passing
through a comet's tail.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.910
You see this story up here on the left

00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:09.803
with some additional information
I won't bother you with.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.840
Whiston was one of
several savants in Britain

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.540
in the 1680s and 1690s who
worked out histories of the Earth

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.330
and the basis of scraps of scripture

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.340
and heaps of fossils.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.030
They taught that the universal deluge

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.700
deposited the mineralized
remains of marine forms

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.350
sometimes found on mountain sides.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.890
People with historical interest

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.530
often collected fossils

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.230
together with coins and
inscriptions as relics of antiquity.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.900
The two lines of inquiry,
Earth and human history,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.270
acted powerfully on one another.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.180
Everyday observations suggested

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.760
that the Earth's surface had undergone

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.830
important changes in historical time.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.110
Sediments once on the water
had been left high and dry.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.290
Rivers had changed course.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.260
Harbors had silted up.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.640
Erosion, earthquakes, and floods

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.563
had accomplished wonders
over long periods of time.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.430
To increase the available time

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.620
and the variety of effected
geophysical forces,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.450
the date of creation had to
be pushed back indefinitely.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.010
And to do that required demoting
the authority of scripture.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.110
That was done most effectively

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.023
by humanistic considerations.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.817
During the 1670s when Mabillon

00:24:21.817 --> 00:24:23.440
and his group of Benedictines

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.370
worked on diplomatics in St. Maur,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.830
the Orientalist Richard Simon

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.760
worried in his Oratorian convent

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.480
across the river how
to put his discoveries

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.583
about the Bible diplomatically.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.340
Biological analysis of
the text had convinced him

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.890
that the Old Testament, as we have it,

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.870
was the work of many
hands over many centuries

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.030
that Moses could not have written it all

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.650
or perhaps any of it,

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.030
that its original version
may have been inspired

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.830
but none of its surviving text

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.603
met the test of coherence,
let alone of divinity.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.710
The Hebrew Bible in its Greek translation

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.600
were such brilliant patchworks

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.550
that no modern critic could say for sure

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.800
which parts conveyed a divine message

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.133
and which were just good stories.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.590
Simon developed these
opinions with the help

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.400
of a man whose ideas were of anything

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.510
more revolting than his.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.180
This was Isaac de La Peyrère.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.780
Simon met him in the Oratorian
convent outside Paris

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.350
to which Peyrère had retired

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.450
following an extraordinary journey

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.050
through the republic of letters.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.140
In 1655, Peyrère had
published a scandalous book

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.080
arguing the existence of men

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.390
and especially women before Adam,

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.930
a proposition that save the Bible

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.700
from such difficulties of the origins

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.800
of the wives of Adam's sons,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.553
and of the people for whose
information God branded Cain.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.160
By admitting that the Old Testament

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.300
was at best the story of
the Jews, not of humankind,

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.930
historians could accept the claims

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.880
of the Chinese, Egyptians, and Americans

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.830
to an antiquity greater than 6,000 years

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.370
and avoid the problem
of the origins of people

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.920
at the periphery of Europe,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.400
like the Greenlanders on whom Peyrère

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.373
perhaps modeled his pre-Adamites.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.470
As for divine inspiration,
Peyrère observed

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.180
that Moses' description of affairs

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.690
that took place after his death

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.313
was evidence not of
revelation but of bad editing.

00:26:23.855 --> 00:26:28.380
Peyrère's pre-Adamites
created a great sensation.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.640
The general of the Jesuit order

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.870
and the Pope laughed together over it

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.090
until they joined in
ecumenical brotherhood

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.230
with the Jews, Calvinists and Lutherans

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.763
in anathematizing it.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.810
Without much industry, theologians found

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.940
that it contained over 100 heresies.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.790
The Catholics were the first
to lay hands on the culprit.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.570
Peyrère's powerful friends who included

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.760
Queen Christina of Sweden
sprang him from jail

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.020
on condition that he go to Rome

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.580
and apologize to Christina's
friend, Pole Alexander VII,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.990
who had chuckled with the Jesuit general,

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.510
and to convert to Catholicism.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.930
And so he did.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.300
After explaining the Calvinist
permissiveness of all things

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.473
that led him astray.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.450
Alexander was so taken
with his unusual guest

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.020
that he offered him a
benefit to remain in Rome,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.340
but Peyrère preferred to return to France

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.313
and to his job as a librarian.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.510
He continued to talk of his pre-Adamites

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.710
using the subterfuge by which
the Jesuits, in his time,

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.550
taught the heliocentric astronomy

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.990
proscribed by the Holy Office.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.070
To anyone who took
offense, he explained that

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.410
by Copernicus' system,
the theory of pre-Adamites

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.270
did not change the facts but
explained them more easily,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.160
and that consequently in each case

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.500
only a pope could know for sure

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.003
that the belief was wrong.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.240
Peyrère was a gentle scholar
and a very dangerous man.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.740
Not only Simon but the
more redoutbable Espinoza

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.253
made use of his arguments.

00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:03.360
During the 18th century,

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.440
the date of creation gradually receded

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.780
under reciprocating reinforcing blows

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.093
from biblical criticism and Earth history.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.000
Among those who delivered the blows

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.830
were the first popularizer of Newton's

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.120
physics in France, its leading historian,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.203
and his most effective opponent
of biblical literalism.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.933
These three persons were
in fact but one, Voltaire.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.210
Then there were the Comte de Buffon

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.640
who heedlessly helped themselves

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.980
to 75,000 years to allow for
the evolution of the Earth

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.443
and its population by living creatures.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.490
Emmanuel Kant and others who derived

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.750
their solar system from
the coagulation of a nebula

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.980
over incalculable periods of time.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.900
And Johann Gottfried Eichhorn,

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.450
Professor of Oriental Languages

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.990
at the University of Göttingen,

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.330
who treated the Old Testament as a choice

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.223
bit of oriental literature.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.690
The situation around 1800 may be indicated

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.470
by the rear guard battles fought

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.830
by the celebrated Jean-André Deluc.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.663
Who?

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.790
One of the most distinguished
natural philosophers

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.030
of the later 18th century.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.750
Deluc was celebrated for his improvements

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.240
in meteorological instruments
and his descriptions

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.030
of the geology, a word he coined,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.240
of Switzerland and Germany.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.643
But he was also a strict
Genevan Calvinist.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.430
The two qualifications made his career.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.060
Queen Charlotte of England,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.160
a true Blue Stocking
and a religious woman,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.880
wanted someone to read to her in French

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.040
and to teach her natural science,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.453
a philosopher but not a philosol.

00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:43.760
Deluc got this position and retained it

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.180
for 43 years until his death in 1815,

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.023
evidently Charlotte was
not quick at physics.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.290
He summed up his teachings
in five volumes of rambling,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.630
letters on physics and ethics

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.840
aimed at establishing the reliability

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.713
of the Book of Genesis as
a report of human history.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.530
He was too strict an empiricist, however,

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.360
to save the mosaic account of creation.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.080
The flood had destroyed all evidence

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.370
of the early history of Earth and man.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.550
Creation over six days was a metaphor

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.290
for creation over an extended period.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.443
How long extended even
Deluc could not say.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.900
Deluc's discovery that Moses' account

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.030
of the flood perfectly fit the facts

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.570
he had uncovered from
the alps to the hearts

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.420
was good news enough.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.180
With support from Charlotte's husband

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.817
and America's benefactor, George III,

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.730
Deluc wandered through
Germany like a prophet.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.820
He convinced people of his
generation, he was then 70,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.860
but made little progress with younger folk

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.743
brought up on deism laxity
and the higher criticism.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.870
On his way back to
England he heard a group

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.180
of young Brits discussing
religion in a very free manner.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.610
They were completely ignorant

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.270
of the bearing of the
fossil record on the truth

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.330
of the universal deluge.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.157
The queen's preceptor
could not hold his peace.

00:31:04.157 --> 00:31:06.120
"Do you know who I am?"

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.227
They did not.

00:31:07.227 --> 00:31:08.490
"I am Deluc."

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.130
They had never heard of him.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.713
His time was up.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.440
James Hutton, the Scott
who worked out a system

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.980
of geological transformations

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.060
involving only the sorts of forces

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.610
he saw at work around
him, had heard of Deluc.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.800
They had argued over
the vast drafts of time

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.547
that Hutton required to shape the Earth.

00:31:27.547 --> 00:31:30.530
"Time is to nature
endless and is nothing,"

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.763
Hutton wrote in 1788.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.160
This squandering of time,

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.100
this prodigious wastefulness

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.470
was as bad at teaching as
deism to a Swiss prophet.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.150
Deluc was inspired to ever
more powerful arguments,

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.150
but to no avail.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:49.083
Hutton's system became
Lyle's, Darwin's, and ours.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.000
The story of the enlargement of space

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.700
is more easily told.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.260
By Deluc's time, the Copernican theory

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.000
was the common belief of educated people.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.960
Catholic mathematicians
had taught it freely

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.610
since around 1730 when they discovered

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.950
the aberration of starlight

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.500
and its straightforward explanation

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.540
by the motions of the Earth and light

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:14.280
made the stationary
Earth almost untenable.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.150
At mid century, Pope Benedict XIV

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.290
canceled the church's blanket proscription

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.940
against Copernican works,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.633
although Galileo stayed on
the index for old time's sake.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.283
By the end of the century,

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.340
telescopes with achromatic lenses

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.430
and exactly calibrated micrometers

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.780
were searching the sky
for stellar parallax,

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.950
still without success.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.110
Their power of resolution
was a few seconds of arc,

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.900
hence, because the stars
showed no parallax,

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.550
the nearest of them had to be distanced

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:49.200
by at least 5 billion terrestrial radii,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.470
about 250,000 times Ptolemy's estimate

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.530
of the size of the universe.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.740
And since by then astronomers
knew that the stars

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.180
stood at different distances from the sun,

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.610
the universe had become
as indefinite in size

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.393
as with Hutton it was in age.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.790
Thickening of knowledge.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.350
We're not working on Atlantis

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.960
or building up the University of Uppsala.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.870
Rudbeck was preparing to publish pictures

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.380
of every known species of
plant estimated at 7,000.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.330
He'd completed one half his task

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.030
when in 1702 a dreadful fire in Uppsala

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.610
destroyed the wood blocks, plates

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.410
and drawings for the other half.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.300
Lineas took up the work,

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.460
but the discoveries of microscopic plants,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.260
a lot of these from Asia and America,

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.980
novel fungi, animal, plants
and plant-like animals

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.833
had quintupled the
estimated species count.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.610
At the end of the 18th century,

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.120
another 40 years of exploring
by ship and microscope,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.410
the estimate of the
number of plant species

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.200
had risen to 175,000.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.400
But plants were few and easy
in comparison with insects.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.190
John Ray, a naturalist
of the late 17th century,

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.260
mentioned as an indication
of divine creativity

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.290
that 2,000 insect species
lived in Britain alone,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.130
and perhaps 20,000 elsewhere.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.720
Half a century later in
1744, the estimate was 65,000

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.870
derived from raising a
number of plant species

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.200
to 13,000 and awarding
five species of insect

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.033
to each of them.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.950
Or perhaps 130,000 since each insect

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:31.220
has another that feeds
upon it, or better 260,000

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.103
since naturalists had
explored only half the world.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:37.720
Applying these the same calculation

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.270
to the late 18th century estimate

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.460
of 175,000 plants species

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.170
populated the world with 1,700,000

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.883
different kinds of insect.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.960
How graspitall.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.000
A Swedish naturalist tried.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.550
He emerged 16 volumes later

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.183
having surveyed a few sorts of beetle.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.570
The same thickening of knowledge

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.460
occurred in the historical
sciences and humanities,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.110
a century that began with the invention

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.730
of archeology and ended
with that of anthropology

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.380
could scarcely keep track
of books and the (mumbles).

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.160
Already in the 17th century,

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.760
the auxiliary sciences of
history were getting out of hand.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.430
Jean Tristan, a minor aristocrat

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.690
but a major collector published a history

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.680
of the Roman emperors illustrated

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.200
by coins and medals from
his own collections.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.110
He required three volumes containing

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.600
well over a million words.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.270
He spared one of them for colleagues

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.980
who thought they could get by with fewer,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.590
a word with jackass.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.310
Mabillon's successor, Bernard
de Montfaucon was no jackass

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.460
but he had to admit that
even after 20 years of study

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.380
he could not master all the writings

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.603
of prolix addicts like Tristan.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.040
He therefore undertook to sift

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.420
and synthesize for students

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.850
willing to devote two years of hard work

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.040
to learning Greco-Roman antiquities.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.860
His epitome, his brief
text of the central matters

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.120
ran to five volumes in folio

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.513
which he immediately had to
supplement with another five.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.190
And Greek and Roman antiquities

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.670
made up a dwindling fraction

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.350
of items of antiquarian interest

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.400
accumulated in the 17th
and 18th centuries.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.100
Students of the Middle Ages found things

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.710
everywhere they looked.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:24.010
Sometimes their productivity
was breathtaking.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.660
Thomas Hern, an accurate
and dislikeable scholar,

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.920
published a volume of medieval manuscripts

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.010
every three or four
months when in good form

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.560
or rather in bad form.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.700
And a colleague, an older colleague of his

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.757
described his condition and I quote,

00:36:40.757 --> 00:36:43.127
"A great alteration was made in him.

00:36:43.127 --> 00:36:44.387
"His acquaintance took notice

00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:46.197
"of the falling away of his body,

00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:47.937
"the fading of his cheeks.

00:36:47.937 --> 00:36:51.027
"Yet he was very cheerful,
contented and helpful,

00:36:51.027 --> 00:36:52.007
"nothing troubled him more

00:36:52.007 --> 00:36:54.207
"than the intermission of his labors

00:36:54.207 --> 00:36:56.297
"by drinking, sleeping, and sometimes

00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:59.010
"by company he could not avoid."

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.563
Historians have their
exemplary heroes, too.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.900
Yesterday I gave Anglo-Saxon studies

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.010
in his example of the widespread activity

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.130
of English antiquaries.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.650
But despite the Herns
and the Anglo-Saxons,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.670
Britain was not holding its own

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.510
in a deluge of medieval documents,

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.160
or so Gibbons said,
lamenting that his country

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.210
had not produced a Muratori

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.050
who single-handedly
published all the histories

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:29.050
of Italy known to him written
between 500 and 1500 AD.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.230
Then there were German, Franks, Celtic,

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.500
old Icelandic and Slovanik collections

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.790
in the great mass of
ethnographical material

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.800
brought back by Jesuit
and other missionaries.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.683
It remained only to
collect the collectors.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.110
I do not believe that I mentioned

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.610
the appetite of the enlightenment
for universal history.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:53.510
I have time only to
gesture that at 64 volumes

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.680
of an universal history from
the earliest account of time

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.570
to the present compiled
from original authors

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.830
which Gibbon, when a boy,
read as they came out

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.180
as if they were the
adventures of Harry Potter.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.760
And universal history went
through several English,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.890
five Italian, and two French editions,

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.820
and one in German, much
improved by his translators

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.720
between 1740 and 1800.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.356
Its first part devoted to ancient history

00:38:19.356 --> 00:38:22.400
did not break entirely from
traditional sacred history,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.180
although to undermine its fidelity

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.573
by offering 98 choices
for the date of creation.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.680
As polyglot authors were far
from establishment characters,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.640
and they did not falsify their accounts

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.963
to agree with the budget of Bishop Ussher.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.230
The modern part of the universal history

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.550
gives all existing
peoples and civilizations

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.240
a history, though to be sure,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.690
from a British point of view.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.470
The enlightenment invented ways

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.610
to index if not to grasp or curb

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.230
this scholarly productivity.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.880
It invented the review journal

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.970
and the encyclopedia,

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.270
and towards the end a specialized index

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.690
of the papers presented
to learned societies

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.300
which multiply almost as fast as insects.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.110
The famous "Encyclopédie"
of Diderot and d'Alembert

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.550
required 28 large
volumes, 71,818 articles,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.230
and 2,885 plates to do justice,

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.440
or as many thought injustice,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.050
to the knowledge of the mid-18th century.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.000
But they were in different compilers

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.080
compared by Johann Heinrich Zedler

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.730
who completed his "Grosses
vollständiges Universal-Lexicon"

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:34.113
in 64 volumes just as the
"Encyclopédie" began to appear.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.546
As you see, Zedler's work
made for easy reading.

00:39:38.546 --> 00:39:39.720
(audience laughing)

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.790
The arrival of the "Encyclopédie"
did not discourage him.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.270
He plowed on with a supplement

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.240
that would have reached 50 volumes

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.420
had Zedler not departed this life

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.403
in the middle of the letter C.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:57.520
Just before 1800, Eichhorn,
the higher critic,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.660
paused from his impious labors,

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.440
contemplated the swollen
learning of his day,

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.010
decided that it marked
an epoch in civilization

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.320
and determined to celebrate
and document all of it.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.767
He rounded up professors from Göttingen

00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:11.700
and in a few other German universities

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.770
to write the histories
of their disciplines

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.180
from the revival of
learning in the 13th century

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.290
to the end of the 18th century.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.733
The series reached 57 volumes.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.450
The history of history in two volumes

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.350
opens with the gratifying information

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.740
that everywhere in Europe,

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.740
people were studying
history as never before.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.640
Enlightened rulers,
bureaucrats, merchants,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.410
professional men, scholars and students.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.370
The very great activity in the field

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.360
of historical literature, its author

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.840
Johann Friedrich Ludwig Wachler concluded,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.893
is an unmistakable
characteristic of our time.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.100
There were the sort of
differences you might expect

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.120
among the history producing nations,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.350
the French historians being
elegant and political,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.500
the English enthusiastic
but only about England,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.520
the German's vigorous
polyglot and thorough.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.270
But on the whole, in Wachler's opinion,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.330
historical writing in Europe
made up a consistent unity.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.960
That was because, he said,
it incorporated so much

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.970
from other sciences:
chronology, astronomy,

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.080
and geography of course
but also philosophy,

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.640
psychology, anthropology,
linguistics, ethnology,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.343
numismatics, diplomatics and archeology.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.450
History was an important
subject in Eichhorn's Göttingen

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.970
entirely liberated from
his old subservience

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.323
to law and theology.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.100
It was universal and cultural,

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.830
as well as geographical coverage.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.390
Besides professorial chairs
in history, the university

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.080
had an historical institute
and probably the best stocked

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.470
and most readily accessible collection

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.513
of historical books in Europe.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.110
The founder/director of
the historical institute,

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.720
Johann Christoph Gatterer,
who helped promote

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.330
the German translation of the
English universal history,

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.830
kept a careful meteorological journal

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.500
from which he worked out relations

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.630
between human history, the weather,

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.393
and solar/lunar and geographical data.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.590
A once living symbol of the
ties between the physical

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.850
and historical sciences at Göttingen

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:19.497
in the late 18th century
was its first woman PhD,

00:42:19.497 --> 00:42:21.360
Dorothea Schlözer.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.770
As a child, she mastered universal history

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.130
in the several volumes that her father,

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.340
one of Göttingen's leading historians,

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.040
wrote for her and also 10 languages.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.770
She is shown here reading a
book on physico-mathematics.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.520
You'll have to take my word for it.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.540
The natural sciences
covered in Eichhorn's series

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.540
were mathematics in four volumes,

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.210
which would've been many more
if their author had not died

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.250
before he reached the
invention of the calculus,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.713
chemistry in three volumes
and physics in eight.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.030
Eight volumes.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.170
This last performance was
only a little excessive

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.490
for it could be said of physics
as Wachler said of history

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.220
that the very great activity in it

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.010
was an unmistakable
characteristic of its time.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.960
Still the longest and most detailed

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.110
history of physics ever written.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.750
Johann Karl Fischer's
Geschichte der Physik

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.440
contains much the physicists today

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.453
would recognize as their subject matter.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:21.470
I doubt, however, that they
would accept his emphases.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.470
He cited Deluc or often
than Galileo or Huygens.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.030
He did so because he
believed that Deluc's topics,

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.670
electricity, heat, meteorology,
pneumatics, geophysics,

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.910
had not yet acquired firm foundations.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.070
In dealing with them,
Fischer could not play

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.850
the Whig historian, that is write history

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.810
from the standpoint of the victor

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.150
because he did not know
whose contributions

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.060
would prove fundamental.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.660
Therefore, he included
much that modern science

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.883
would consider trivial or wrong.

00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:55.880
"The History and Present
State of Electricity"

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.300
by Joseph Priestley, published
in his definitive form

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.440
in 1775, was another such compendium.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.910
It is written from a close
examination of the sources

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.100
with quotations and exact citations

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.008
just as if it were ecclesiastical history.

00:44:11.008 --> 00:44:13.410
Priestley's analysis of
the historical evidence

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.420
for the doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.150
has exactly the form of
his analysis of experiments

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.890
relative to the equally
undecidable question

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.823
of the number of electrical fluids.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.910
In both cases, the historical approach

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.280
to the current state of science

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.580
had the advantage over the deductive

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.440
in allowing the presentation
of all the facts

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.680
in their original setting,
however contradictory

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.810
they might appear so that
nothing that might prove to be,

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.743
that might point to the
ultimate answer was omitted.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.700
The generation that
followed the professors

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.310
who wrote for Eichhorn's series

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.090
managed to reach provisional agreement

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.690
on many subject left open in the confusion

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.440
of facts and interpretations

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.703
put forward by Deluc and many others.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.960
Johann Tobias Mayer, who
became professor of physics

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.050
at Göttingen in the early 19th century,

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.140
shared the new consensus
on physical principles

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.662
and explicitly disavowed
the historical method

00:45:09.662 --> 00:45:13.363
as confusing to beginners
and generally useless.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.500
But in fields in which
conflicting opinions

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.283
about fundamentals
reigned, he employed it.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.200
Thus, he had recourse
to the method of history

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.173
in present state in his
text book on meteorology.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.450
We may take it as
symbolic as well as pious

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:33.030
that he began his coverage
with the meteorological studies

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.070
by then 40 years old
of Göttingen's deceased

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:39.633
former professor of
history, Johann Gatterer.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.910
I don't lament the time when
a professor of natural science

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.090
could take off a year or more

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.660
to write the history of his discipline

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.130
and when historians were as good

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.123
at meteorology as physicists.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.610
But what I do regret is that physicists

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.070
and historians,
technoscientists and humanists

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.080
now do not know much
about how knowledge was

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.360
and is created in the others' domain

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.350
or how their several disciplines advanced

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.930
by similar steps.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.700
That is not good for the institution

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.423
that nourishes them both, the university.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.150
I don't pretend that there
ever was a perfect balance

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.410
between the natural
sciences and the humanities

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:20.403
in the university.

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:22.990
Through most of the 19th century,

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.450
history and the humanities dominated.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.420
And since World War II, the sciences,

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.453
and engineering, have done so.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.760
Some people see this
ongoing process as a contest

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.910
between purity and prostitution

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.280
to use terms flung
about during discussions

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.293
of the BP project last spring.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.960
By which I suppose they meant a contest

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.730
between research undertaken
for no particular reason

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.673
and research aimed at
utilitarian objectives.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.490
In these lectures, I've tried to show

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.937
that the most basic of
humanities, history,

00:46:56.937 --> 00:46:59.740
and the most basic of sciences, physics

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.760
advanced together in early modern times

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.920
in large part, owing to
pressures to made them useful

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.333
to the wider society.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.730
As university studies, they
try to distance themselves

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.140
from these pressures.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.830
Which, however, eventually
pushed some of them

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:19.143
towards social sciences and
others toward engineering.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.250
One of the great challenges
of research universities today

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:26.690
is to find a proper balance
among the disciplines

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.620
in an environment in which
faculty and administration

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.693
constantly search for money.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.160
In seeking the balance, we must be aware

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.063
of placing too strong on emphasis
on utilitarian objectives.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.890
Among other dangers,
it encourages a subtle

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.080
but potent feedback mechanism.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.070
University graduates,
ignorant of the place

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.300
and function of the
humanities in our society,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.230
are unlikely to want to support them

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.850
through taxes or philanthropy.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:00.780
Decline in social support
translate into loss of prestige

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:04.010
inside as well as outside the university.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.130
Weakness confirms irrelevance.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.780
And the next generation of graduates

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.660
has less interest in
supporting the humanities

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.863
than its predecessor.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.680
This feedback may have been operating

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.960
in our country for some time.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.180
To mention but one indicator, the budget

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.420
of the National Endowment
for the Humanities

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.210
was cut in half in the 1890s

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.910
and curtailed again in the 1990s.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.890
It has not recovered.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:30.350
In real terms, the endowment has about 40%

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.180
of what it had in 1980.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.090
Of course there are many sources

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:36.400
of funding for the humanities

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.200
besides the federal government.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.150
However, the great cuts
in government funding

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.320
over the last 30 years
may be taken as a hint

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.033
at the value assigned to
humanities in our society.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.470
The situation might be ameliorated

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.570
by an approach devised
by James Bryant Conant,

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.530
one of the prime movers
in the mobilization

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.683
of scientific manpower for World War II.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.410
As president of Harvard, he undertook

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.820
to ensure that the
public would do its duty

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.900
and support science after the war

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.233
as it had never been
supported in peacetime before.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.270
Conant proposed to
educate the future leaders

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.503
of the nation, that is Harvard graduate,

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:21.470
in what he called the tactics
and strategy of science.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.240
He had in mind the methods and standards

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.500
of scientific inquiry and
the need for lots of money

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.203
to advance the research front.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.230
We might consider doing
something similar but cleverer

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.320
to make all Berkeley undergraduates aware

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.490
of the intellectual strength
and cultural importance

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.420
of the humanities, and
history of course included,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.040
so that when they take
their rightful place

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.300
ahead of Harvard's graduates
among the leaders of the nation

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:48.960
they will work to reverse the trend

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.713
represented by the continuing
underfunding of the NEH.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:57.520
Such a course could promote
respect for what deserved

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.780
and an informed critical
attitude toward the rest.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.800
That is the intellectual good taste

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.143
described at such length by
Maria Torre 200 years ago.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.430
The course might help to diminish

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.940
a type of segregation on the campus,

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.170
more difficult to overcome
than any that may exist

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.053
between people of different color.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.343
Segregation between the
humanities and the sciences.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.963
If this segregation exist at Berkeley,

00:50:24.963 --> 00:50:28.000
a course of the type
proposed might be subsumed

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.143
in the American culture's requirement.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.930
There is no reason to limit
the course to undergraduates.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.920
The rhetoric in the BP debate

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.900
that reminds me of the
compliments exchanged

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:44.450
between flakiest Baronio suggest
that some faculty members

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.963
and administrators also could
profit from exposure to it.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.030
We may well stand at the
threshold of the development

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.180
of worldwide importance.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.960
Does it not make a good opportunity

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.440
to renew the old partnership

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.240
and refresh the feeling of mutual respect

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.670
which existed when science and history

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.500
once before worked together

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.293
to change a dysfunctional world view.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.460
If Berkeley's energy
initiatives are to make history,

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.720
as the chancellor and the
director of LBL expect

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.950
and no doubt most of us hope,

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.623
the project should
include some historians.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.630
In their different ways,
scientists and historians

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:26.853
both make history.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.461
But the historians will
always have the last word.

00:51:32.461 --> 00:51:34.499
(audience laughing)

00:51:34.499 --> 00:51:37.666
(audience applauding)

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.110
- [Participant] My question was about,

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.480
I guess maybe causation as
distinct from correlation,

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.131
that is these parallel
stories that you were telling.

00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:53.960
To what degree are they parallel

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.860
and where do they engage with one another?

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.930
I heard a common cause in
the pressure to be useful,

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:03.870
but what other sort of either, yeah,

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.240
what other common causes are there

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.280
or moments where they
are actually connected

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.680
as opposed to just parallel?

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.860
- You see, I have nurtured a viper.

00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.233
Professor Riskin is a student of mine.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:19.110
Furthermore, she teaches at Stanford.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:19.943
(audience laughing)

00:52:19.943 --> 00:52:22.507
So perhaps you will excuse me (chuckles),

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:26.810
well, I have to answer to
try to answer the question.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.610
It's a very good question of course.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:34.050
Correlation, parallels,
analogies are not proofs;

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.510
they're merely suggestive

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.950
of further parallels,
correlations and analogies

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.560
which I have tried to draw out perhaps

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.600
at too great an extent.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.410
But if one looks for common causes

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.170
besides all of the usual ones

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.660
for the beginning of
modernity, as I mentioned

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.270
at the beginning of my lecture last time

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:02.830
and tries to get down into more detail.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:06.590
Then one looks at the
intellectual trajectories

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.120
of various actors and then you find a mix,

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.960
a mix of motives as to
why they were able to work

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.690
in both history and in science.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.840
But I don't know what I can
say that is more than pointing

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.100
to the very big forces
which we all recognize.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.090
Now you can get into
somewhat greater detail.

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:36.560
For example, the Protestant
Reformation is trotted out

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.560
as a fourth cause for the
development of modern science

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:46.610
because of some supposed parallel

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:50.440
between the Protestant virtues

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.160
and the qualities supposed
necessary to advance science

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.040
like sobriety and
investment in the operation

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.040
and industry and that sort of thing.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.460
And of course on the other
hand from my lecture last time,

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.270
you will remember that the
efforts of the Protestants

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.450
to trace their ancestry,
to trace Luther back

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:15.230
to the early church did
inspire investigations

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.260
into the church history
in the medieval documents

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.650
which proved important for the development

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.700
of historical writing.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.210
So I would pursue it in that direction

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:29.193
and I would be very happy
if you would join me.

00:54:29.193 --> 00:54:31.470
(audience laughing)

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:35.460
- People with some scientific background

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.310
are very puzzled by, in a way the picture

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.540
you painted of Isaac Newton,

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.350
and I'm wondering whether
you could say a little more

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:48.350
to explain or to some extent this,

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:54.600
his energies that were poured into,

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.560
the energy he poured into studies

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.720
that seem to demand tremendous credulity

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.130
when he was making these
fantastic other descriptions.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.470
I find it completely incomprehensible,

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:12.580
the amount of energy
he spent at Cambridge.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.590
In these studies that you alluded to,

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.853
could you say a little
more to make it credible?

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.910
- Well, I think Newton
thought himself a prophet

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.900
and he took all knowledge as his sphere

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:34.620
and was trying to recover

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.610
what the ancients knew.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:42.870
And he felt that certain ancient texts

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.360
required his particular study,
mainly, or among others,

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.170
the prophecies of Daniel.

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.280
And he spent a lot of
time trying to identify

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.970
events subsequent to the
prophecy that did occur

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.393
with their prophetic description.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.240
That was part of his self
image and to employ an analogy.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.160
From science, you have the quantum Newton.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.160
You cannot have Newton,
the world system builder,

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.600
the mathematician, the
towering mathematician,

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.170
without Newton the prophet.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:29.690
Because they come together,
they are responding

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.690
to the same set of problems
of the time in which he lived.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:40.747
And so for me, it's a puzzle indeed

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.750
to think that a man had the energy

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:47.690
to devote himself with such ferocity

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:51.943
to so wide a range of subjects.

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.890
But I'm not surprised at all that a mind,

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:01.270
as capacious as his, would
have wished at that time

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.393
to undertake such studies.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.820
I decline the terms of the question

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.970
insofar as it implies that we could've had

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.420
Newton or the Principia without Newton

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.740
of the prophecies of Daniels

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.255
or the ancient kingdoms amended.

00:57:20.255 --> 00:57:22.672
(calm music)
