Congratulations on getting your
hands dirty with responsive images.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.110
You're on your way to a workflow,
that allows you to easily

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.590
create websites with high quality
images with as few bites as possible.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.810
&gt;&gt; And in the next lesson, you'll
actually approach responsive images

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.480
using techniques that, well,
allow you to avoid using images at all.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.470
You might be surprised by
the number of options available for

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580
situations where images
no longer seem necessary.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.710
You'll explore some image alternatives
using simple mark-up techniques.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.350
&gt;&gt; See you then.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
