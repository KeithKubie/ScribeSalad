1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.800
Taco?
Yes.
In the seal teams you lead all male teams.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.990
Any leadership difference?
In business?

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.770
We're in the business world with mixed gender or female teams,

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.750
so first of all in the military did work with woman.
There's what?

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.420
There's no women in seal teams,
but there's women that are Intel.

6
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.750
There's women that are in logistics.
There's women in in the,

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.800
some of the logistics support units that go out in the field sometimes.

8
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:31.801
So definitely worked with women in the military and in the civilian sector with

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.140
the,
with echelon front and work with all kinds of women,

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.300
all kinds of women in every level.

11
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:41.140
From CEOs on down to frontline troopers.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.280
And here's the deal.
For me,
it's no factor,
no factor to me.

13
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.020
What's a factor to me is can they do their job?

14
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.530
Do they have an open mind?
Are they humble?
Do they treat people with respect?

15
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.460
Those are the kinds of things that I'm judging.

16
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.330
It's like what we talked about earlier.
I'm judging,

17
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.720
but I'm not judging based on what they are.

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.620
I'm judging on who they are and who they are as a person.
So that's the,

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.880
I I see no real difference.
The leadership,

20
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.890
the way that you lead doesn't change,
in my opinion,
from the,

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.090
from the women I've seen in leadership positions to the men of senior leadership

22
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:26.770
positions.
The,
the way they lead is successful because of the way they lead,

23
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:29.920
not because they're male or female.
And you know,

24
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.070
some of the stereotypes that that you might see out there,

25
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.800
um,
like he,
like,
like for instance,
men are tougher than women or,

26
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.850
or men or women are more emotional than men.

27
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.070
That's just garbage.
Jane,
if you see,

28
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.420
I've seen at least when you get to a leadership position,

29
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.320
I've definitely seen women that were way tougher than than guys were in terms
of,

30
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.690
hey,
we've got to make this move for the company.
Here's what I'm going to do.

31
00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:56.830
Boom.
They execute it.

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.080
And I've seen men that were way too emotional attached to this scenario and ruin

33
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:06.580
it because they're just way more emotional than this stereotypical woman might

34
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.590
be.
So that's why I just didn't,
don't think you can trust them.

35
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:11.200
I look at a person,
not whether they're a man or a woman.
I'm looking at their,

36
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.760
the content of their character for the second time.
I'll say that today.
MLK.

37
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.583
Um,

38
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.480
and now when we start talking about combat,
um,

39
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.170
there's some physical differences that make that make a definite impact.

40
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:27.430
And I talked about on the Tim Kennedy,

41
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:31.600
if you want to hear ever hear me talk about that because yeah,

42
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.230
when you get into some physical things,
men are stronger than women.

43
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.020
And so there's a,
there's some physical limitations there,

44
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.700
but in terms of leadership capabilities in the,
in the civilian sector,

45
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.670
there's,
yeah,
I'm not,
I'm not,

46
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.680
I'm not worried about men and women.
Yeah.
Okay.
Are there some nuances there?

47
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.190
There are.
There are new eds for instance,
who were like,
one you'll hear as,
um,

48
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.250
I'll get asked,
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a female and I'm in charge of these guys.
Uh,

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.000
you know,
how should I act or what should I do?
Well,
cause they,

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.350
they might not like working for a firm,
for a girl.
Right.
And I say,
well,

51
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.760
they probably,

52
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.740
that that guy probably wouldn't like working for a guy either or a free younger

53
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.800
guy or for a guy that got moved from another department.
There's,

54
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.730
it's the same thing.
It's the same thing.
So what are you going to do?

55
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.190
It's the same thing.
I always say be humble.
Listen to what they have to say.

56
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.370
Keep an open mind.
That's what you're going to do regardless.
Male,
female,

57
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.940
whatever.
It just,
you older,
younger,
doesn't matter.
You want it.

58
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.860
The being a good leader,
the principles don't change.
That's all there is to it.

59
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 1>Yeah.
Cause yeah,</v>

60
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:39.130
cause in as an insecure guy getting sick,

61
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.490
getting laid or,
or,
or,

62
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:45.060
or a girl calling shots or whatever will affect them.

63
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.760
[inaudible] but like you said,
if they,

64
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:52.440
if their leadership principles are sound and they're making the right call,

65
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.570
it's going to be obvious that like,
that guy's messing up or you know,

66
00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.370
like he's,
he's,
um,
um,

67
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.880
acting out of insecurity that we're not acting out of insecurity.

68
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:06.060
It's going to be obvious the leadership part,
as long as that sound,

69
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.180
you're going to have success.
Yeah.

70
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.160
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
yeah.
Um,
that's no factor to me.</v>

71
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.020
Yeah.
Next question.

72
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.930
Maybe I should bring some of the female leaders that I've worked with on the

73
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.080
podcast.
You know,
the thing,

74
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.690
the problem with that is there are no different than the male leaders I've

75
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:31.860
worked with,
so I'm sure that there's some,

76
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.690
some women would listen to this and they go,
oh,

77
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:38.250
you don't know how hard it is when x all you don't know.

78
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:39.870
I am.
But that's what I'm saying.
Like though,

79
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.230
good female leaders I've worked with have been like,
oh yeah,

80
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:45.420
that can be sometimes a problem because I'm a woman and here's what I do to

81
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:47.670
negate it.
Because guess what?

82
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.070
The next day I'll be working with a different client and the,

83
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.600
it's a man and he goes,
well,
you know,

84
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:53.250
I have to deal with x and this is how I mitigate it.

85
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.810
So everyone's dealing with x.

86
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.360
Everyone's got some factor that they're trying to overcome and it just,

87
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.273
the good leader,

88
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.660
we'll find a way around that factor or find a way to mitigate that factor and a

89
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:07.780
bad leader won't.
And we'll then use that factor as an excuse,
right.

90
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.220
Rather than just as an advantage.
You know,

91
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.790
there's a huge difference between taking ownership of these problems and saying,

92
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.710
oh,
you don't want to,
here's the issue.
Okay,
I'm going to own that.

93
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:18.420
I'm going to take care of it.
I'm going to find a way around it.

94
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.460
Instead of saying,
Oh,
I'm younger,
I'm older,
I'm a woman,

95
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.130
I'm a man trying to lead these.
It's like,
no,
you're,

96
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.200
you're a human leading another human being.
And so step up and lead,

97
00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:32.880
figure out what the issues are and overcome them.
