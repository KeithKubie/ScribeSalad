00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I want to talk about a strategy for defining the function fill&lt;u&gt;in,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which takes an unfilled formula and returns all the possible filled in formulas.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What do we have to do?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, let's consider a formula, and I'm going to take one that's simpler

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
than one we've seen before.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to take the formula I plus I equals me.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What we have to do then is find out what all the letters are in this formula

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and fill in all possible values for digits for those letters.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It seems like a good thing is to collect all the letters,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and in this particular formula the letters should be IME.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What are the possible digits that we want to replace these three letters with?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Well, we can just iterate through all the 3-digit numbers,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but make sure that we're not duplicating any of those numbers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So maybe we'll start with 123, then 124, and so on, 120, and then 13.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We wouldn't do 131, because we already have a 1 there, so 132,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
13--can't do 133, so 134, and so on and so on.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We just have all these possibilities.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
How many possibilities are there?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Well, there's 10 possible first digits.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Then we don't want to repeat a digit, so 9 possible second digits,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and 8 possible third digits, so that's 720 possibilities.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Not very many at all. It should be really fast to go through all these possibilities.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, what function gives me all the possible sets of numbers in order--so order matters.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
120, for, example is different than 012 or 201 and so on.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What function is it that we give it the list of digits?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
so we want some function F, we give it the list of digits,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and we give it the number that we want, and there are three letters

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in this particular formula, so we want three of them.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What function F takes that and then returns this sequence of all possible sets of numbers?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Maybe it returns it as a tuple or a list or whatever.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The question is what function can do that.

00:02:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it combinations, permutations, factorial, or some other function?
