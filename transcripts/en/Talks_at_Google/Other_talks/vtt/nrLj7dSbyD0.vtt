00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.021
[applause]

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:38.910
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Okay, so let me start
here. I really enjoyed reading your book --

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.091
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Thank you.

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:47.820
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: and as the title suggests,
it focuses on the all pervasive girlie-girl

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.990
culture thatwho targets little girls. So for
those of, for those in our audience that might

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.030
have not already read the book, why did you
choose to write on this topic and what set

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.350
you off on this particular --

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: journey?

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I just have to say first
of all I'm feeling so old media sitting --

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.380
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.170
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: here like she's reading
my credits and I'm saying, "Oh God like you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.060
guys must think I'm a dinosaur."

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.380
So the short answer is I have a daughter and
I was, I think it's really hard to, or who

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.500
notices what's goin' on with kids unless you
have one. So I was goin' along and I had my

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.310
little girl and I was raising her thinking,
"I don't want her to feel like there's anything

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.100
she can't do because she's a girl. I don't
want her to think there's anything she has

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.460
to do because she's a girl."

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.600
And then she went to preschool and, as if
by osmosis, she had memorized within a week

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.890
all the names and gown colors of the Disney
princesses, and I had never heard of a Disney

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.730
princess. And meanwhile we're goin' around
town and I live in Berkley so the waitress

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.060
with the piercings and the tattoos gave her
her breakfast and said, "Here's your princess

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.930
pancakes," and the lady at CVS said, "Here's,
would you like a balloon?, I know what color

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.650
you want," and would give her pink. And finally
we went to the dentist, one of those like

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.290
high priced pediatric dentists, and she said,
"Do you wanna get in my princess chair so

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.520
I can sparkle your teeth?"

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.550
[laughter]

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.400
And I thought, "Honest to God do you have
a princess drill? I mean what --

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400
[laughter]

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.741
is this? And I just did not remember from
when I was a little girl --

00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:15.741
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:19.709
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that every little girl
had to be a princess and be swathed in pink

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.740
for the first four years of her life so, or
five years.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.870
So I went on this journey to try to figure
out what this new pink and pretty meant, when

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.739
it started, why it started, and whether it
was protective of sexualization or whether

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.060
it was priming girls for it.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.750
And I think where it dovetails with what you're
doing --

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.750
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.130
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I mean I look at girls
from infancy to sort of through the tween

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.150
years and the last chapter in the book is
about social media --

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.150
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.200
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: where I take all the wonderful
things that you and Adriana and such say,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200
and squoosh them into --

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.250
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.381
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: this big. But it's I think
part of what's going on with girls in particular,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.099
but all of us in general, is this idea of
the performance culture --

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.099
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.780
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and the ways that I was
looking at girls but I think you could look

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.810
at it from a lot of difference different slices.
T, they learn to define themselves from the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.240
outside in instead of the inside out, which
for girls puts them at a particular set of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240
risks --

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.550
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: but I think is where we
intersect.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.090
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely. I think
one of the things that we are seeing with

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.460
all of this new media, especially the newer
interactive media, is that there is so many

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.160
opportunities for self presentation and one
of the things that [ ]Turkel wrote about,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.770
I think 20 years ago, was what does it do
for your identify identity development, if

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.840
you will, when you have all these opportunities?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.470
And fast forward 20 years, you have Facebook,
for instance, where you can pretty much put

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.139
whatever pictures you want and as Adriana
has shown, onand MySpace, you go online, you

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.199
get feedback, you get validation from your
peers so the question is what does it do for

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.199
their identify identity development. Now --

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.199
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.920
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: one of the things I
talk about in my book is they're kind of at

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.350
the descriptive stage. W, we know what they're
doing. W, we've described what they're doing.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.830
W, we've really no idea how it's impacting
 --

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.199
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: What the implications are.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.213
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: what the impact is.

00:05:24.213 --> 00:05:25.213
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:26.213
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely.

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:27.213
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:28.213
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: In terms of what does
it do for your long term identify identity

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:29.213
development.

00:05:29.213 --> 00:05:30.213
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.310
And I think at this stage then, what is important
for people like you and people like me to

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.419
do is to start conversations --

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.419
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.930
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: so that that implication
is considered. I don't know that we can know

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.791
what it is and I don't know that you can ever
say, -- I mean people always say to me, "Well,

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:48.070
it's not like, it's not like if you wave a
magic wand when you're three, you're gonna

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.640
be sexting when you're 15." I mean that's
not what I, it's not A plus B equals C --

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.900
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: but there's a lot of research
on girls and identity, girls and femininity,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.900
girls and kind of the externalization of sexuality.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.360
And we were talking a few minutes ago about
 -- one of the things that I thought a lot

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.360
about when I was working on this book and
looking at the culture of pink and pretty

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.340
and the culture of connecting dots from like
the animated Disney princesses to the flesh

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.750
and blood ones: MylieMiley and Lindsay and
all of those girls. Now I said then it completely

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.994
went out of my head why I started saying it.

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:28.169
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Let me think about that
for a second, but it was about -- oh it was

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.200
about the difference between sexualization
and sexuality --

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.560
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and that one of the things
as a parent and as a thinker that became a

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.940
guiding principle for me that made some of
the choices easier was distinguishing between

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.759
those two and recognizing that sexuality is
this every very organic thing that we're trying

00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:00.040
to instill in girls that comes from within
that connects you to your desire, that empowers

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.419
you, although I hate that word, to say yes
or say no, that fosters intimacy, that fosters

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:12.280
reciprocity, and sexualization is about performing
your sexuality for others. And one of the

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.030
things when I was doing the Facebook chapter
 --

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.030
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.880
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that I, it's really easy
to look at girls and victimization --

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Yes.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.100
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: but while I was doing this
chapter and we're gonna talk about bullying

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.100
 --

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.100
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.250
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and that sort of thing
and looking at all of that, one of my friend's

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:36.120
son's got emailed to him, he's 14, a photo
by one of his classmates of her naked from

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.240
the waist up. And she called me up and said,
"Oh gosh, I don't know, I mean I'm trying

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.050
to tell my son that girls aren't playthings
and then this girl emails this to him --

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.050
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.601
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and is that, -- what does
it mean? And is there some way that for girls

00:07:53.601 --> 00:08:01.120
that's a sense of, shows a sort of progress
that they could be embracing their sexuality,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.080
feeling better about their bodies despite
the fact that they're now losing total control

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.050
and he could email it like in the shampoo
ad to two friends to two friends to two friends

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.050
 --

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.050
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.440
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: or what?" And when I talked
to researchers and I'd be interested to know

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
 --

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: as a media researcher --

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.940
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: how you think about this,
but when I talked to researchers on sexuality

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:24.199
and desire, what I got back was that, for
girls, that sexual entitlement and sexual

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:31.580
agency were themselves becoming objectified
and becoming the new kind of have to do performance.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.419
You had to project yourself as a sexuality
sexually entitled young woman, but it wasn't

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.760
going back to connect them to an authentic
desire. I, it was just something that they

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.990
were supposed to put out there.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.230
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right, I mean I think
again there isn't a whole lot of literature

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.300
on these issues, but if you look at the literature
on pornography, for instance, individuals

00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.060
who do consume pornography do, -- adolescents
for instance, they do have greater preoccupation

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.890
with sex, they do have more curiosity, and
they're more permissive, if you will, in their

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.890
attitudes.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.200
The question of course is what we don't know
is which is the cause and which is the effect

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.410
'cause a lot of this research is what we call
correlational.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.410
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.600
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: So we know that individuals
who watch a lot of pornography have these

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.170
attitudes as well. What we don't know is,
is the preoccupation with sex causing their

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:27.970
access to pornography or is it the reverse.
So I think all of this objectify, what do

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.230
you call it, what did you say?

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.230
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Is sexual entitlement --

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.230
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Okay.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.230
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: as a performance or is
 --

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.230
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Performance.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.230
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: it yeah.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.230
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I think what it is
doing is that it might have some implications

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.740
down the road in terms of girls' views about
intimacy, their expectations for relationships,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.310
how they carry out these relationships. S,
so I think absolutely. I think as parents

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.470
of girls these are issues to be concerned
about.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.380
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well and boys too. You're
the parent of a boy as well, right?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.720
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right. And I don't
have a whole lot of conversations with my

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.730
son about these topics 'cause he's very private
and he really doesn't like to have these discussions.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:05.940
B, but when I did see the Philadelphia D.A.
prosecuting boys who had transmitted the messages

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.480
that they had received, he prosecuted them
I believe for transmission of pornography

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 --

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.580
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: that's when I had the
conversation. I said, "You know you might

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.839
get pictures from girls, but you really should
delete them." And he looked at me in total

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.080
exasperation and told me, "Mom, I'm not an
idiot." But --

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080
[laughter]

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.321
so I heaved a sigh of relief because it just
seems like a lot of kids when you think about

00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:32.950
these technologies they really don't think
about the implications. There's a lot of over

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.120
disclosure going on --

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.030
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: they forward messages,
they copy and paste their instant messages,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.399
sync messages that they have with friends,
they forward it on. S so they really don't

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:46.040
think a lot about what they do with new media.
So I do think it's a challenge for parents

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.720
and a lot of times parents are not thinking
about these issues as well. So --

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.740
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: one of the things thethat
research has shown at least for the earlier

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.890
generation of chat rooms, for instance, parents
who had conversations with their kids about

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.720
meeting strangers, giving out information,
their kids were much less likely to carry

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.899
out high risk behaviors --

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:03.899
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Hum.

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:07.730
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: online. So that is
something. And when parents didn't have those

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.020
conversations, if teachers had those conversations,
then those kids were significantly less at

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.310
risk. So these conversations that we have
are important.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.190
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well I suppose because
otherwise it's a tacit approval in a way too

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.580
if you don't comment. I mean I know that from
the research on media literacy --

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.260
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that if you don't point
out --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.260
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.760
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: something, then it comes
off as a tacit approval of that thing.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.880
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Correct. I think when
you look at parental mediation strategies

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.290
that is one of the strategies, that you can
use. Now those strategies do work with television

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.520
when you can say, "You're all going to sit
down and watch a show together." But when

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.589
so much of the new media --

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:41.620
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.640
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: use occurs in the privacy
of their bedroom --

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.410
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: or with their little
 --

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.410
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: with their text yeah --

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.519
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: cell phone device next
to them in their bed, how do you then know

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.820
what your kid is even consuming?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.820
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.820
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: You know?

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.820
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Now I'm depressed.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.820
[laughter]

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.820
Now I'm worried.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.329
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I'm glad my son will
be 18 [unintelligible]

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:06.110
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I mean, but it seems like
I also don't wanna demonize the new technology

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.950
and new media because I think there's also
so many things that its opened up and so many

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.500
ways that kids can find affirming --

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.820
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Messages.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.560
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: messages and alternatives
to what used to be a kind of mono mainstream

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560
message ?

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that's really valuable
for them.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.529
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right, absolutely.
I think, for instance, there is literature

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:28.899
that suggests that kids are coming out, gay
teens are coming out at younger and younger

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:33.300
ages. And we do think, for instance, that
access to chat rooms, access to sites where

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.200
they can meet other people struggling with
the same issues has helped them. And it's

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.649
interesting because a couple months ago, you
saw the incident in New Jersey, Tyler Clementi

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:45.649
 --

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:46.649
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:49.200
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: the teen at Rutgers
who was sort of quasi-bullied I guess through

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.970
his roommate's videotaping him.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:56.070
Now it's interesting because here technology
was really the tool by which this individual

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:02.079
was harassed, if you will. But immediately
after that there was that whole YouTube movement,

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:05.019
if you will, about -- I forget the name it's
not coming off the top of my ?

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.019
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: “It Gets Better”.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:07.019
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: “It Gets Better”.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.760
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: “It Gets Better”,
thank you. So again technology can also serve

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.290
as a pathway if you will as --

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.290
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.200
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: you said to open up
these new – these alternative possibilities.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.250
And then when you think about, for instance,
minorities within minorities --

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.250
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.380
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: you think about gay
youth who are African-American or Latino -- these

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.410
individuals I think have even more options
with technology. So I think --

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.700
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.100
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: definitely in terms
of access messages that these new tools are

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.100
a positive.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.100
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.050
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: But like any tool they
can be put to good or ill.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.250
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right, right.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.639
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right. So okay let's,
 -- I just wanna talk a little bit about the

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.730
history again because --

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.730
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Uh-huh.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.320
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: one of the, and the
second chapter where you're talking about

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.290
pink, what was it pink drills, no I'm just
kidding, pink stuffs, pink blocks, and whatnot

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:56.420
that you get for girls. Now this cleavage,
this pink is for girls blue is for boys was

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.420
not always the case --

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.420
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: No.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.790
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: and even 20 years ago
when my daughter was little, I don't feel

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.990
it was as strong as what you're portraying.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.450
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: No, no.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.500
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And in fact I was telling
you the 1950 Peter Pan movie in fact had little

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.950
Michael in a pink jumper.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.950
[laughter]

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:10.950
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And I --

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.430
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah, you wouldn't see
that now. And it's much actually more than

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.160
that. If you go back a hundred years --

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.269
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:22.370
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: all babies wore white,
they wore white dresses --

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.370
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.770
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: because we didn't have
Maytag back then and --

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.770
[laughter]

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.770
we had to boil clothes to get them clean --

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.770
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.700
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: so we didn't like to have
color. S, so there were no colors. A, all

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.600
babies wore dresses. T, they all wear white.
And then nursery colors came in --

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.339
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and they were pink and
blue and then when they were assigned a sex,

00:14:39.339 --> 00:14:43.440
pink was assigned to boys and blue was assigned
to girls because pink was considered to be

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:51.180
the more pastel version of red which connoted
masculinity and the God Mars and strength.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.720
And blue was associated with faithfulness,
constancy, and the Virgin Mary.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:03.070
So even as late as the 1930's, Lord and Taylor,
the New York department store, did a poll

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.800
of its customer base and found that a full
25 percent of its customers still said pink

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.910
is for boys, blue is for girls. And I just
don't think you'd get even one percent --

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.910
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.910
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: at this point.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.910
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: At this point.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.069
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And in addition you have
“Cinderella” and “Sleeping Beauty”

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:21.579
 -- the Disney movies -- they're in blue and
 --

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:22.579
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: It's true.

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:26.029
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I didn't think about, I
hadn't 'til you pointed it out remembered

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:27.970
about is it Michael, Michael's in pink?

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.970
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Michael I think, yes.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.970
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And --

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.970
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: the younger child.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:31.970
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: the little one yeah, the
one ?

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.970
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.639
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: in the little feety pajamas
and somebody sent me pictures of Michael Reagan

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:42.110
in the 1960's wearing an all pink suit. So
I mean if Ronald Reagan's dressed in the same

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.110
thing.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.110
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Thing. [laughs] That
would not happen today.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:50.459
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah. So it wasn't really
until the mid 80s when marketers recognized

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:58.320
the profit making potential of hyper segmentation
particularly with kids, that pink and blue

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.040
fully came into, pink particularly --

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Pink particularly,
yeah.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.720
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: not blue so much, but pink
came into its own --

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.010
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: as being all defining of
girls' younger experience. So it's just a

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:15.521
color, it's just a color, it's a very tiny
slice of the rainbow though. And to me I think

00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:19.780
of this time once when, you know how when
you're driving with your kids and you get

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.620
all the good stuff 'cause they're in the back
seat talking and you're in the front seat

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.019
and listening, eavesdropping ?

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.019
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.390
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and I was taking my daughter
and a friend of hers to go scootering in the

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.470
park and her friend had a pink scooter and
a pink Hello Kitty helmet and my daughter

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:38.080
had a silver scooter and a fire breathing
dragon helmet. And the other little girl said,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.040
"You'reYour helmet's not pink, it's not for
girls."

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.040
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.460
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And my daughter said, "Well
it's for boys or for girls." And the other

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.100
girl kinda looked skeptical and I thought
in that little interaction ?

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.940
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam,: there was so much
going on about what the expectation is for

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:01.209
girls, what the mandate is for girls about
what might happen if you don't follow that

00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:06.329
and just as --. Even as girls are doing better
in so many realms, the pressure to define

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:11.470
themselves through appearance and play sexiness
and just this little pink box that starts

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:17.389
when they're young that gets smaller and smaller
and defines girlhood increasingly through

00:17:17.389 --> 00:17:21.339
pinkness and princesses, and then spa birthday
parties asat four ?

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.339
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:30.480
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and makeovers and the whole
thing. And it's just, it's too narrow. I mean

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.650
I just want my point is to just say it's too
narrow --

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.650
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.650
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and it's getting narrower.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.419
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely. Now I know
you have tried to have those mixed messages,

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:45.419
multi messages that girls can do anything
and I know as a parent of a girl I did the

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:49.419
same thing. But then they come to preschool
 ?

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:51.220
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.200
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: and it's like you've
lost all the ground that you've made. So what

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.919
is it that parents can do and what do you
think that parents can do to combat some of

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:58.919
this?

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.229
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: It's humbling to be a parent
isn't it?

00:18:00.229 --> 00:18:01.229
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: It really is.

00:18:01.229 --> 00:18:04.200
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And I always like to say
that in this book I really present myself

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.769
as a fellow traveler. I'm not --

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:07.430
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.989
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I am inconsistent, I am
hypocritical, I am contradictory 'cause that's

00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:14.159
what it means to be a parent, right?

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:15.570
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.720
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And I'm like not a tiger
mom I'm like a --

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.851
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: dog on four roller skates
mom, I think is what I am. But so I think

00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:27.340
first there's two answers to that.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.340
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.499
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: The first is to understand
why that happens in preschool. And what happens

00:18:32.499 --> 00:18:39.289
is that kids don't understand the whole penis
vagina thing. And let's just for the sake

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:43.139
of it can we just for the sake of this conversation
say a penis makes you a boy and a vagina makes

00:18:43.139 --> 00:18:47.729
you a girl, even though that's not universally
true? So let's just go with that, okay?

00:18:47.729 --> 00:18:51.320
So they don't get that and they think that
you could grow up to be either a mommy or

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.529
a daddy and you basically wanna stay what
you are. And so if a penis and a vagina doesn't

00:18:56.529 --> 00:19:01.989
make you a boy or a girl, what makes you a
boy or a girl? Well barrettes. B, barrettes

00:19:01.989 --> 00:19:05.749
make you a girl, . Wwearing a princess dress
makes you a girl, and so that's why when your

00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:12.529
daughter hits three, you suddenly cannot wrestle
her into pants because she needs to say, "I'm

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:15.159
a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl."

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:19.929
So it's natural for kids to do that. I, it's
natural for them to start segregating by sex.

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:20.929
 --

00:19:20.929 --> 00:19:21.929
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:27.239
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Iit's natural for them,
much as I hated to hear it, to go for stereotypical

00:19:27.239 --> 00:19:33.220
toys. And the difference in toy choice is
one of the biggest gender differences across

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:41.080
the entire life span and it's universal. I,
it's true when they do tests on monkeys. Boys

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.580
go for the balls, girls go for the dolls.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.380
That said, so that's very humbling to me as
a feminist writer --

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.519
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:53.859
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: everything I've been fighting
against for the last 30 years apparently can't.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:59.429
But that said there's also a lot of research
on the neuroplasticity ?

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:00.429
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:05.590
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: of preschooler's brains
and the ways that the inborn differences --

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.590
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:14.249
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: between girls and boys
when left to flourish in their separate cultures

00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:16.780
become big gaps. Lise Eliot writes a lot about
that ?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.780
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.629
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: in “Pink Brain, Blue
Brain”. And so any time kids play across

00:20:21.629 --> 00:20:30.879
sex, it is healthy and important and good
for them cognitively, psychologically, emotionally,

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:33.269
and for their future relationships.

00:20:33.269 --> 00:20:36.350
And so when the market is hyper segmented,
when your daughter is sitting there in her

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:44.169
pink room, in her pink dress, reading “Pinkalicious”
with the pink Scrabble set that says f-a-s-h-i-o-n

00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:50.690
and I swear to you that exists, and the pink
Monopoly set where the hotels and the houses

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:59.279
are replaced with boutiques and malls, -- that
exists, -- it's very hard, it's very hard

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:05.519
to make those, to reach across those lines.
And I didn't know that. W, writing this book

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:11.200
that was one of the things that was most surprising
to me as a parent that, it really changed

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.479
how I thought of my daughter's friendships.

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:18.279
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: But you know it's interesting
'cause I think new media really given an opportunity

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:22.590
for [ ] girls to somewhat break away from
some of those chains because some of our early

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.549
research in chat rooms found that for instance,
and you know of course chat rooms are pass?passe

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:32.559
now, but girls were making many more requests
for partners than boys. At the same time --

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.021
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: What does that mean?

00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:42.129
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Meaning back in the
day when you went into chat rooms, one of

00:21:42.129 --> 00:21:44.240
the things we found was very common was these
conversation attempts to find someone to talk

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240
to.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Oh, oh, right.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And oftentimes they
then went away into a little private --

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.240
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: message room. So when
you look at it what you found was that girls

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.960
actually made, although boys made many more
explicit sexual comments and this is something

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.139
you expect, you also found that girls made
many more partner requests. And so it almost

00:21:57.139 --> 00:22:02.979
seemed like this new environment if you will
back then which was new, where you had a certain

00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:05.659
amount of dissemination if you will --

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:06.659
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Uh-huh.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.440
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: let girls get sort
of get away from those more traditional gender

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440
roles.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: It emboldened them.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.440
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: It emboldened them.
Yep.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.110
At the same time what's really interesting
is you also see regular gender patterns illustrated.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.259
So for instance when blogs were very popular
 --

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:18.259
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:19.690
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: they were overwhelmingly
female.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.940
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Way back when, last year.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.970
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Way back when, yes.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.970
[laughter]

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.989
You know 90 percent female --

00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:26.989
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:22:26.989 --> 00:22:28.749
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I was pleasantly surprised.
The boys would start the blogs but they just

00:22:28.749 --> 00:22:29.750
would not go back to them.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.529
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: But aren't blogs kind of
like keeping a diary? I mean that's such a

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:33.529
girl thing.

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:36.101
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Exactly. And that's
the thing, what we have found repeatedly is

00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:40.059
that traditional patterns of play and TV preference
get --

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:41.149
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Replicated?

00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:44.570
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: exemplified online.
For instance, Patricia and myself, back again

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.050
in the 90s, wrote this chapter about Barbie
Fashion Designer.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.050
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.409
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: This was a video game
marketed by Mattel and it was one of their,

00:22:52.409 --> 00:22:54.679
there was a big girls game movement --

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:56.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right, right, right, right,
right.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:57.009
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [ ]. Brenda Laurel
started --

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:58.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.909
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Purple Moon and a bunch
of other companies. All of them failed pretty

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:01.909
much.

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:02.909
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yep.

00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:04.979
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: The only one that was
as successful as it was, was Barbie Fashion

00:23:04.979 --> 00:23:05.979
Designer --

00:23:05.979 --> 00:23:06.979
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:23:06.979 --> 00:23:09.489
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: in a pink box with
Barbie on the cover and what you did was you

00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:13.009
went into the game and you made different
outfits for Barbie.

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:16.359
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right. And that's what
you do on the Disney Princess site now. If

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:20.159
you go on except that we love Mulan in my
house --

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:21.450
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.960
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: On the Mulan page it says
something like, "Come back later," or [laughs]

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960
 ?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: "We didn't do anything
on this page" ?

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:36.659
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: because they don't sell
Mulan swag. But they all have the same game

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:37.659
 --

00:23:37.659 --> 00:23:38.659
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:41.700
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: where you go on to whichever
princess you pick and she says, [speaking

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:48.879
in a very high voice] "Oh, I just realized
I didn't pick out my outfit for the tea party"

00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:53.009
or the fair., " Would you please do it for
me?" And then there's these predetermined

00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:54.009
script --

00:23:54.009 --> 00:23:55.009
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:57.351
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that the kids follow and
they pick bomp, bomp, bomp. It's like so,

00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:59.309
it seems so anti-creative --

00:23:59.309 --> 00:24:00.309
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Robotic almost.

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:03.720
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And that's one of the things
that's concerns me about the, and I did wanna

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.169
get back to kind of your what parents can
do thing, but I was looking at this research

00:24:07.169 --> 00:24:10.460
on doll play and the way that the sales of
 --

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.460
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:17.070
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: dolls have plummeted as
the enchantment with online dolls has grown

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.070
 --

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.070
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.070
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and they had, and I don't
know if they were just tryin' to be inflammatory

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.539
but they had quotes from girls saying things
like, "I like to play with online Barbie better

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:27.559
because I don't have to make things up and
it's really hard to imagine how I would play

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:33.251
with this doll if I have to make things up."
And I mean what is that?

00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:37.330
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: You know I think you
have to, there are, as great as technology

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.710
is and I know I'm at Google so I'll be careful
 --

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.710
[laughter]

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.620
but as great as it is, I think there are some
definite downfalls. So for instance I think

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.179
I've heard kids saying they like paint online,
for instance, color online. And you have to

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:56.059
wonder if that's taking away some of the creativity.
The other thing I've noticed is what we say,

00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:57.080
"Always connected, never alone."

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.080
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.760
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I mean kids., I'm on
a university campus. T they're in online and

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.700
they're on the phone. My daughter is walking
across buildings and she calls me. It's like

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.749
this almost never have this ability just sit
down, sit back, reflect, and observe people.

00:25:09.749 --> 00:25:11.600
And you have to wonder about those lost opportunities
 --

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.380
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: if you will, for interaction,
for observation, for growth if you --

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.380
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: For loneliness --

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.410
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: For loneliness.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.570
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: solitude.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.090
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And that's not, solitude
is a good thing --

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.090
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.090
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: once in a while.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.149
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well I'll tell you I struggle,
I mean I don't know about you guys, but I

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:28.210
start out sometimes where I'll be sitting
with my daughter and it'll be ten minutes

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.379
'til swimming lessons ?

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:30.379
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:31.379
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and she'll say, "Mom can
I have your iPhone?"

00:25:31.379 --> 00:25:32.379
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [chuckles]

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:35.279
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And I'm like, "No, um-um.
You sit there and be bored." And I think,

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.770
"Why am I imposing boredom --

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.770
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: when it no longer needs
to exist. Is that a good thing?" I mean I

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:42.749
really struggle with right now with the notion
of boredom.

00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:43.749
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:25:43.749 --> 00:25:49.139
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Is there a value in it
or is it just an obsolete concept? I mean

00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:50.761
that's getting further afield but this is
the stuff that I --

00:25:50.761 --> 00:25:51.761
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: That's an interesting
 --

00:25:51.761 --> 00:25:52.761
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that I think about.

00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:54.630
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: it is 'cause I often
told tell my kids when I was growing up we

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.489
had black and white television, one channel,
and I grew up in India so started at six ended

00:25:59.489 --> 00:26:00.489
at eight.

00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:01.869
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Can I offer you a cane?

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:02.869
[both laughing]

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:03.869
You must be ancient.

00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:08.899
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And it was great and
I read a lot and I don't think where, it seems

00:26:08.899 --> 00:26:12.730
like there's nothing new to do, . Oour kids
are getting bored. So I mean I think that

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.250
is an important skill to develop as parents
I think to encourage almost.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.570
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I guess. I don't know but
I also see in this thenthing that parents

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.849
feel sort of disempowered by all of that to
sort of cut it off.

00:26:22.849 --> 00:26:23.989
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:26:23.989 --> 00:26:27.679
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: To just say, I mean I had
this almost an argument last night in an event

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:32.979
that I did about saying no to something that
your daughter wants. And I was just like well

00:26:32.979 --> 00:26:36.210
so what if she wants it, just say, "no." She
said, "Well how to you explain that to her?"

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.309
I said, "I don't."

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:38.369
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: No is no.

00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:40.029
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Just say, "No."

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:41.029
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [ ]

00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:43.529
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Why is that so hard. Well
that is and I mean in that way ?

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:44.529
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [laughs]

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:47.169
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I'm with her. L like just
say "no" to the fifteenth princess dress --

00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:48.169
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:49.169
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: she really doesn't need
it.

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:50.169
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Yeah.

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:53.509
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: But when I think about
what parents, that said, I had this moment

00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:59.169
in the Los Angeles airport a few years ago
on the Southwest corridor where there's a

00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:08.240
newsstand. A and for about three years they
had a rack of dolls called Ty Girlz. I always

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.919
called it "Girls with a Z" which always indicates
a sort --

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:12.919
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Huh.

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:17.769
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: diva girls power to me.
I am woman see me shop kind of girl power.

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:18.769
[laughter]

00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:22.999
And so Ty Girlz dolls are like you guys know
what Bratz dolls are? They're like Bratz dolls

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:28.349
but plush, so they're like Bratz dolls meets
Groovy Girls. And my daughter she was four

00:27:28.349 --> 00:27:33.969
years old andwhen she saw those and just went,
"Mom, can I have one of those?" And I just,

00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:38.820
this is one of these moments where I'm hypocritical,
inconsistent, and contradictory, I just something

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:45.460
in me snapped and I just went, "No. No, you
are never, ever, ever getting one of those."

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.690
And she said, "But well why not?" And I said,
"'Cause they're inappropriate." And she's

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.259
like, "But why are they unappropriate?" And
I just had this moment where I thought, "I

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:56.589
don't wanna scream ‘Bbecause they're slutty
that's why,’" at my four year old.”

00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:57.589
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:58.589
[laughter]

00:27:58.589 --> 00:28:02.259
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And I just got so dang
sick of these teachable moments. You always

00:28:02.259 --> 00:28:05.570
have these teachable, you're supposed to use
these as teachable, I mean I don't want my

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.429
whole life to be one big teachable moment
for my kid --

00:28:08.429 --> 00:28:09.429
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Absolutely.

00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:13.789
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: but I also felt suddenly
like I was put over this barrel and that I

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:18.520
was being pushed into this position that was
untenable where I was being asked, where I

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:26.779
was being forced to say, "No," all the time
and believed that that was going to result

00:28:26.779 --> 00:28:31.589
in my daughter thinking she had more choices.
And that's not gonna work.

00:28:31.589 --> 00:28:36.119
So at that moment I sort of had this epiphany
and realized I have to find things that I

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:43.129
can say, "Yes" to whether it's online or off
line that reinforce that desire she has to

00:28:43.129 --> 00:28:50.149
celebrate being a girl in a fun and joyful
way that is not linked with appearance, with

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:55.139
pre-sexualization, with sexualization, with
hyper marketing, and that put me on a totally

00:28:55.139 --> 00:28:59.489
different path. And it's some work, but on
a different path as a parent to just think

00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:06.889
more in a bigger and more creative way about
alternatives that would, I like to say that

00:29:06.889 --> 00:29:09.700
would fight fun with fun and be just as good
for her.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.940
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right. I think it's
interesting what you're saying because I think

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:18.259
all of these media choices, new media, Disney
Princess, all of them really have impacted

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:20.679
family relationships, family dynamics.

00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:25.059
If you look at new media, for instance, kids
are often the expert. Now I think it's changing

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:29.149
as the younger generation, as they become
parents themselves, but if you look at a lot

00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:35.479
of families with teens and pre-teens almost,
the kids are ahead, going ahead in terms of

00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:38.830
the technology. And so to some extent they
do set the conversation; I think they are

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.830
the experts.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:45.139
And it's interesting to think about a situation
where your traditional family roles are reversed.

00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:46.139
Historically ?

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:47.139
&gt;&gt;Pegggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:48.710
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: parents have always
been the ones with the information and the

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.250
power, if you will. And that's not, it's become
must more egalitarian.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.649
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Oh, very interesting. So
what do you do about that?

00:29:54.649 --> 00:30:00.789
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I don't know. I think
it's again as a parent I guess, it's interesting.

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:04.009
I think the challenge really is to keep up
with the technology --

00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:05.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:30:05.009 --> 00:30:06.009
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I suppose, I don't
know. What do you think?

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:09.249
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well I find, I mean we're
in a room with really techno --

00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:10.259
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:12.929
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I mean you guys are all
so, you're techno people.

00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:14.749
[laughter]

00:30:14.749 --> 00:30:17.299
But when I talk to --

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:18.299
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:19.669
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: parents like me --

00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:20.679
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:26.010
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: they don't think about
technology as integrated in the same way into

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.010
their lives --

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.010
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:32.090
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: So they think about it
as this other thing in their kids' lives and

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:41.089
they're really focused on TV or movies or
toys, but the online stuff is still kind of

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.089
hazy ?

00:30:42.089 --> 00:30:43.089
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:30:43.089 --> 00:30:47.269
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: both in terms of what's
its impact is and also just the nature of

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:55.549
the marketing changes. I mean I was writing
that kids under six can't distinguish between

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.630
advertising and programming.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:58.630
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.849
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well that's irrelevant
now because it's the same thing when you're

00:31:01.849 --> 00:31:02.849
online.

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:03.849
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:04.849
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: It's embedded, none of
us can distinguish ?

00:31:04.849 --> 00:31:05.849
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:08.059
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: between advertising and
entertainment anymore. So that's a whole new

00:31:08.059 --> 00:31:13.039
 [ ], but I guess we think -- we meaning me
and not all of you --

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.039
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:18.549
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that online identity is
a separate thing and almost a contained thing

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:19.549
 --

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:20.549
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:26.839
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: not that it's an extension
or an integration with your off line identity.

00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:29.539
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: But you know I think,
and that's a very interesting perspective,

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:34.669
but if you look at the developmental literature
and what we have found at our own center and

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:39.139
as well as research coming from other areas,
is that actually there's a lot of connectedness

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:44.940
between online and off line worlds especially
for young people. And so I often think people,

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:50.100
reporters will often call me and say, "Is
this virtual world versus the real world?"

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.100
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.950
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: And I always ask them
 -- I said, "Who are we to say what is real?"

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.950
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:59.269
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: For a lot of young
people the distance, if you will, the psychological

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:03.599
distance between themselves and what they
do with these new technologies is very fluid.

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:08.809
And what is not real to us may be very real
to them --

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:09.809
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Exactly.

00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:12.570
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: and I think that there
are those historical covert effects, if you

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.450
will, where you're gonna see different generations
react very differently with these new media.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.539
But again I think the challenge then as you
say is what is it that we can do as parents.

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:26.990
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right. And I think, I mean
to me I kind of liken it to when I was a kid

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:31.659
and I'd take my mom's Shoppers Charge which
was the credit card that we had in those days,

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:33.041
and hop on the bus and go to the mall --

00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:34.041
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:38.059
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and that was where I negotiated
my identity and that was where I sort of played

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:42.700
with these different ideas of selfhood and
acted it all out. And my mother didn't go

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.490
to malls. T, that was not something that existed
when she was, because I'm from Minneapolis

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.779
and we had the very first mall --

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:48.779
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [chuckles]

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:54.119
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I would like you to know,
and I went to that mall. And it almost feels

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:59.019
to me that it's useful to look at the online
world as the new mall --

00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.089
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:04.059
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: for kids, that it's where
they're negotiating identities, where they're

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:06.009
meeting peers, that's where they're meeting
strangers --

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.009
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:08.009
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: that's where they're encountering
projectsproducts, that's where they're sort

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:11.549
of hitting our contemporary world and trying
to figure out what it's about.

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:15.049
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I think so. I think,
for instance, you see a lot of exaggerated

00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:20.259
behaviors as well; it is widening their network.
So I like to think about Facebook as widening

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:24.659
your networks, giving you opportunities to
interact with more people than you could have

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:29.609
than before with just your face to face contacts
and maybe even the telephone.

00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:35.989
I think the bigger question to me is are all
of these widened networks, if you will, is

00:33:35.989 --> 00:33:38.019
it making us spread ourselves thin?

00:33:38.019 --> 00:33:39.019
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:44.029
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Is it, are they the
same, I mean having a few relationships that

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:45.429
you invest in in depth --

00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:46.429
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:48.539
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: are they giving you
the same, are they gonna be giving you more

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:54.879
support than say a wider set of networks where
you are more intimately getting in touch with

00:33:54.879 --> 00:33:55.879
them --

00:33:55.879 --> 00:33:56.879
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:33:56.879 --> 00:33:58.539
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: but then now you have
more opportunity for support and resources?

00:33:58.539 --> 00:34:02.019
That's I think to me that's the big question
with some of these new --

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:03.679
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well right and, and and
 --

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:04.679
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [ ]

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:05.970
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: the invisible Adriana who
we keep talking about --

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.042
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: She's here , she's
 --

00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:08.042
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I know, but she's not on
camera.

00:34:08.042 --> 00:34:09.042
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: No.

00:34:09.042 --> 00:34:10.042
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I mean she's here, but
she's --

00:34:10.042 --> 00:34:11.859
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right, exactly.

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:15.539
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: in the back blushing, yes.
I mean I don't know maybe you wanna talk about

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:21.039
this, but you'reyour research on branding
and narcissism was really interesting. Do

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:28.440
you wanna talk, do you wanna come up here
and talk about that for a minute? Come up.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440
[pause]

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:36.529
'Cause I've, I mean your research was among
the most meaningful pieces of information

00:34:36.529 --> 00:34:51.669
that and perspective shifting pieces of information
that I learned about so --

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:52.669
&gt;&gt;Adriana: Yes, so --

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:53.669
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Have a seat.

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:54.669
&gt;&gt;Adriana: So --

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:55.669
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: You can't just stick to
the format, right?

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:56.669
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:57.669
&gt;&gt;Adriana: Well --

00:34:57.669 --> 00:34:58.669
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: This is Adriana Manago.

00:34:58.669 --> 00:34:59.799
&gt;&gt;Adriana Manago: So I'm a graduate student
at UCLA at the Children's Digital Media Center.

00:34:59.799 --> 00:35:07.150
Yeah, so I guess one of the first cities we
did was with MySpace so that was back when

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.339
MySpace was the it social networking site.
And a lot of it's just qualitative but we're

00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:13.609
trying to figure out [chuckles] some, we've
also done some now correlational studies of

00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:15.710
kind of relating to the last question you
said.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:21.860
But one of the first things that struck us
was this idea of identity and how one creates

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:27.930
a sense of self in an absence of physical
reality. So one of the things, I don't know

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:32.099
if you're talking about this, was creating
social legitimacy. So the more people that

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:36.640
are commenting on the kinds of things that
you're posting, the more that it gains a sense

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:43.089
of reality as least through consensus building.
So that's something that we're interested

00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:44.089
in.

00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:47.309
But as you mentioned as well there's this
fluidity from on and off line and so often

00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:48.660
participants in our cities talked about that.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.660
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.720
&gt;&gt;Adriana Manago: You can't be this completely
different person --

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.319
&gt;&gt;Adriana: it's not like, yeah, so when we're
talking about Facebook and social networking

00:35:53.319 --> 00:36:00.569
sites it's not so much about promoting some
kind of false identity, but maybe it's an

00:36:00.569 --> 00:36:03.140
opportunity to craft your ideal identity ?

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.140
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.500
&gt;&gt;Adriana Manago: and manifest into some kind
of social reality, the kinds of people that

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.500
you hope to be.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:15.020
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right. And I think
this continuity is something that we have

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.520
really found in our research that young people
in particular really seemed to bring the same

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:23.380
kinds of themes and issues and people into
their online lives as in their off line contacts.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.140
So I think that's ?

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.140
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.140
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: really the interesting
 --

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.359
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah, well what interested
me about your work was the ways you described

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:33.730
young people crafting identity ?

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.730
&gt;&gt;Adriana Manago: Um-hum.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.630
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: externally as opposed to
creating it internally and shaping it based

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.640
on the response of their 622 BFF's --

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640
&gt;&gt;Adriana Manago: Um-hum.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.721
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and hitting the like button
or whatever. That's a really new, I mean kids

00:36:46.721 --> 00:36:51.519
have always cared about what others thought
and whether they're wearing the right clothes

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:57.200
or whether they're popular, but that invisible
audience that was in their head is now actually

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.000
present and in a certain way 24 hours a day.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:11.690
And when, and then for girls in particular
that involves negotiating this fine and ever

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:18.849
shifting line between being sexy but not too
sexy because they get positive feedback right

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:22.400
in their identify if they're sexy, but then
negative feedback if they get, if they tip

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400
over the invisible line --

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Into too sexy.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.470
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: into too sexy. So it's
that same old negotiation that girls have

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.019
always gone through but now in this very public
online way. And all of that I just found that

00:37:33.019 --> 00:37:34.019
really fascinating.

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:38.220
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: One of the things I
wanted to ask you was if you look at the number

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.240
of women engineers, for instance, --

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.240
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Uh-huh.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.380
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: which it's still flat
and it's been flat for --

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.380
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Zippo, yeah.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: and it's still like
eight --

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.760
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Seven percent or yeah.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.579
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Maybe 20 percent or
something and it gets, the gender cleavage,

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:51.840
if you will, gets even worse as you go for
the longer spectrum. So my question is how

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.510
do you think these, I know you went to a lot
of different places as you wrote this book

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.410
and in your investigation you went to the
American Girls show, [ ] the store, and you

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.789
went trade shows ?

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:02.180
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.950
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: . How do you think
 --

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.260
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Toddler beauty pageants.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.390
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right, the beauty pageants.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.430
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: so you don't have to, Mylie
Miley Cyrus concerts --

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.430
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.430
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: so you don't have to.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.430
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Yeah, right.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.430
[laughter]

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.710
I mean how does all of this, how does it set
girls on these more traditional pathways,

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.030
if you will, and why it is maybe, this is
not always, this sort of cleavage that you

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.030
see is not necessarily the piece --

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.030
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.030
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: everywhere.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.030
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: No, no, no.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.030
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: I was telling you,
for instance, --

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.030
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.000
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: in India we have many
more women engineers than you have here, certainly

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.780
not as few as you but many more. So this --

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.460
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well, I didn't really think
about it in terms of, well I guess I did sort

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:48.490
of in terms of traditional paths, I was looking
more at not so much at their career choices

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.490
and such --

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:50.490
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.140
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: though that said, there
is some interesting research on that that

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.859
I talk about when I'm talking about the princesses
because I'm sort of saying, "There's no research

00:38:57.859 --> 00:38:59.300
that says if you play princess --

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: you gonna have an eating
disorder or --

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.539
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: you’re gonna grow up.
B, but there's a lot of research about the

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:07.819
impact of feminine stereotypes --

00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:08.819
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:39:08.819 --> 00:39:09.819
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: on girls and women --

00:39:09.819 --> 00:39:10.819
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:16.339
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and that the exposure to
feminine stereotypes encourages the embrace

00:39:16.339 --> 00:39:20.809
of them for both girls and women. And there's
always these like, I always wonder who funds

00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:25.210
these studies; I hope the person who did the
study isn't watching us but --

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.210
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [chuckles]

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:33.619
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: so there's like, I was
looking at these studies of basically stereotype

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:41.410
vulnerability. So they would take like college
age women and men and divide them into four

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:47.519
groups and put them into dressing rooms in
a mall. And then they would dress, they would

00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:52.440
have one group of the women and one group
of the men put on a bathing suit and the other

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.220
groups of women and men put on sweaters.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Oh, I see.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.660
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and then they would have
them take a math test.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.680
[laughter]

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.900
That's what I like to do in a bathing suit.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.900
[laughter]

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.349
And they found, low lo and behold, that for
the men it didn't make a difference what they

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:07.470
were wearing, how they scored on the test.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:08.470
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.470
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: For the women, those who
were wearing a bathing suit, their performance

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.470
was depressed.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:14.470
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:21.130
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And so that would indicate
that a consciousness of body and feeling a

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:27.630
consciousness of stereotype and all that,
depresses women's performance in non-traditional

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.630
fields.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:33.240
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Yeah, because when
you look at college campuses you have what

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.280
is, there's so many more women coming to colleges.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.859
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: If you look at MIT,
for instance, look at the acceptance rates,

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:44.369
if you will, they're very different for males
versus females. So there's no question that

00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:45.369
there are more --

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:46.369
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein; No question.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:48.450
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: women at colleges,
but you still have the difference.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.019
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well and there's so much
to celebrate in girls' lives right now. I

00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:54.210
mean they're doing wonderfully on the playing
field --

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.210
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.580
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: they're in leadership positions,
they're going to college at greater rates

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.580
 --

00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.580
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Rates.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:05.750
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: than young men. And so
as a parent and as a journalist I found it

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:13.020
intriguing and confusing to think that this
existed side by side with the fact that the

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.420
pressure to define themselves through appearance
 --

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.420
Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.369
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: had not abated and was
actually growing younger. So even as that

00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:27.359
was happening, you had little girls in elementary
school since 2000, the rate of girls who say

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:30.940
that are more concerned about their body than
their school work, their weight than their

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.940
school work --

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.940
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.440
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: has gone up. The percentage
of girls wearing eyeliner or mascara at ages

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.099
eight to twelve has doubled since 2008. I
don't know why the percentage of girls, eight

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:46.339
year olds wearing eyeliner or mascara is not
zero. Walmart just rolled out, -- did you

00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:52.220
guys see this at Walmart last week, -- rolled
out age defying line of cosmetics for eight

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.220
to twelve year olds?

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.220
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Oops.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.220
[laughter]

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.930
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Oh yeah. I am serious.
And so right you guys all go, "Ah," right

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:06.150
so this is the thing though is that we all
go, "Ah," and a year from now those kinds

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:10.460
of trend setting girls will start wearing
it, and two years from now some more girls

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.990
will start wearing it, and five years from
now we'll be saying it's natural for girls,

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.619
as they said in the Wall Street Journal article,
to want a little enhancement when their they’re

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:21.740
eight and not wanna leave the house for the
playground unless they're wearing the right

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.710
lipstick color.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:29.210
So that's how things sort of migrate down
and become naturalized rather than natural.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:35.019
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right. Now I just wanna
shift gears just a little bit. I know your

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:39.569
book is about girls, but what do you think
just in terms of your observations, what about

00:42:39.569 --> 00:42:41.569
boys? How do you think they're getting impacted?

00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:42.849
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well --

00:42:42.849 --> 00:42:43.849
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: by all of this.

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:46.300
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein; like I said, I mean I think
it's really detrimental to boys when they

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:56.450
can't play with girls, when they feel excluded
from girl play and the taboo against boys

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.150
who choose to do things --

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.150
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.119
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: or appropriate colors that
we consider to be feminine in our culture

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:08.049
right now, still remains huge and I think
that both speaks to the sort of depth of homophobia

00:43:08.049 --> 00:43:09.049
 --

00:43:09.049 --> 00:43:10.049
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Um-hum.

00:43:10.049 --> 00:43:15.180
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: and also the idea that
when girls choose to do something that we

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.230
consider to be more masculine, we think of
it as reaching upwards.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.230
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Right.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.880
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And when boys do something
that's considered to be feminine we think

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.279
of it as a loss or as reaching downwards , an
inferior thing, and we don't want them to

00:43:28.279 --> 00:43:31.631
do that. And that's why the worse thing a
boy can still call another boy is a girl.

00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:32.769
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Is a girl.

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:36.940
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: So I think that reveals
something really important and it's sad. I,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:42.170
I mean there's a lot of things that used to
be considered to be gender neutral like art,

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.450
music, that are now considered to be kind
of for girls.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.450
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: For girls.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.780
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And so those are great
losses for boys. Plus boys are gonna grow

00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:01.080
up presumably and work with and even possibly
marry these princess girls and do you guys

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.220
wanna work with and marry --

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.220
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Simpson.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:08.049
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: princess girls? You know
that you can now, there are Cinderella, that

00:44:08.049 --> 00:44:10.019
you can get married in a Disney princess wedding
gown now?

00:44:10.019 --> 00:44:11.019
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: [chuckles]

00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:12.019
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: They have them for grownups.

00:44:12.019 --> 00:44:13.019
[laughter]

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:17.690
I'm kinda hoping they do like next is the
Snow White coffin, t. That's what I'm waiting

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.690
for.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.690
[laughter]

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.690
[ ]&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: And we should probably
take a few questions, it's getting late.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:21.690
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Take a few questions
 --

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.690
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.690
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: now.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:28.069
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I didn't mean to make you
stay here if you don't want to. You can, but

00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:30.109
you don' have to.

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:31.109
[pause]

00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:33.170
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Anyone have questions?

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.170
[pause]

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.680
&gt;&gt;female #1: This is a follow on to something
that Peggy Orenstein said that was very interesting

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:44.680
discussion. So why don't we worry about male,
this actually is, well anyway you started

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.369
talking about this, but I wanna take it a
step further. Why not worry about male stereotypes

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:50.369
as negative?

00:44:50.369 --> 00:44:57.870
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Oh I think there's, it's
a perfectly legitimate thing to be concerned

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:03.170
about. And there's a great book called “Packaging
Boyhood” that I recommend to parents of

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.980
boys. I just happen to have a daughter so
my book's about girls.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:13.359
&gt;&gt;female #1: A follow on to that, w. Why aren't
we putting equal effort into getting boys

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:19.400
to do traditional female roles? It seems to
me that the liberation of women and their

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:27.369
freedom to go to school, have wonderful careers,
really depends on men learning to do their

00:45:27.369 --> 00:45:34.519
share at home with childcare, parenting, housework,
and so forth. But yet why aren't we talking

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:35.519
 --

00:45:35.519 --> 00:45:36.519
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Well that --

00:45:36.519 --> 00:45:37.519
&gt;&gt;female #1: more about that?

00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:38.519
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: gets into my second book.
[laughs]

00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:39.519
[laughter]

00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:42.359
I mean two books back, two books back, I wrote
that book. I, it was called “Flux” and

00:45:42.359 --> 00:45:43.359
it was --

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:44.359
&gt;&gt;female #1: Sorry I missed that.

00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:47.000
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: That's alright. It was
looking at women's choices and men's roles

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:56.329
and it was really clear in that book that
couples who shared household and professional

00:45:56.329 --> 00:46:03.109
labor more equally were happier, that their
kids were doing better. I mean there was some

00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:08.779
great --, and the women I interviewed who
were in the work force and thriving and doing

00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:17.190
well and feeling like they could excel, had
almost universally husbands who were equal

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.490
partners in the home.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:24.690
So yeah, but then I would go and like I went
to talk to a group of medical students in

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:31.589
Philadelphia at U Penn, female medical students,
and they had just come back from a like a

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:37.670
panel thing for them on how to balance work
and family with their medical careers for

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:38.670
women doctors.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.210
And I said, "Wow, that's really great. That
must have been real interesting. How many

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.430
men were there? How many of your male classmates?"
And they just kinda looked at me like I just

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.440
dropped from the planet Romulus and just said,
"None." And I said, "Well. O oh I get it.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.849
T they're gonna have their own panel later,
right."

00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:54.849
[laughter]

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:55.849
"No."

00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:56.849
[laughter]

00:46:56.849 --> 00:47:01.039
And I thought that, I just thought like what
do they think is gonna happen when they get

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:06.500
married to those guys, which presumably they
will. And so yeah, I mean that's absolutely

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:12.549
vital and yeah, again it was a different book,
but, but yeah.

00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:13.549
[laughter]

00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:14.549
[pause]

00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:24.190
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, I was just wondering if you
could talk a little bit about what you think

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:29.730
about the Computer Engineer Barbie which uses
kind of these princessy, girlie troupes tropes

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:33.520
to promote something that's traditionally
not. Like --

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.400
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right. Ah, Barbie, Barbie,
Barbie, Barbie, yeah.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.589
Barbie's so quaint now compared to Bratz and
Monster High. S, she's like --, it’s got

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:51.060
me beggin' for Barbie. I'll tell you one thing.
Y, you can't find her anywhere. You try to

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.250
find Computer Engineer., I mean it's almost
irrelevant because you can't find her in Toys

00:47:55.250 --> 00:48:00.460
R Us. Y, you can't find her at Target. Y,
you have to like go to a specialty place to

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.289
find Computer Engineer Barbie,. S she does
not really exist.

00:48:05.289 --> 00:48:06.720
[laughter]

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:15.400
Yeah. So Barbie used to be all kinds of things.
L like in maybe the early 80s she had a real,

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:21.819
 -- actually Barbie's supposed to be a teenage
so it's a little weird, but she had all these

00:48:21.819 --> 00:48:29.220
careers and I think that she did serve a certain
fantasy purpose in that.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.309
And then as her audience drifted younger because
she's part of like the kids getting older

00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:40.519
younger marketing construct, she was originally
for nine to twelve year olds. And then she

00:48:40.519 --> 00:48:45.660
drifted younger so now girls are kind of done
with Barbie by the time they're about six.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:53.450
And as that happened her, the fantasy changed
and she became much more fairytopia Barbie,

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:58.900
mermaid Barbie, and stopped being career Barbie.
Now she's just basically a baby doctor. T,

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.420
that's what you can find. A, and a fashionista.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.819
So I don't know. I it's one of those sort
of ambivalent things is that meeting girls

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:10.650
where they're at and encouraging them to do
something that might not ordinarily do or

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.329
is it locking everything into that pink box
and you could probably argue it either way.

00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:18.380
But either way, if they're gonna make a Computer
Engineer Barbie, I would like to have seen

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.480
her in a store just once.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:24.530
I don't know. D do you have a feeling about
her?

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:31.445
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: No, actually no. I
guess it's the same thing that we saw with

00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:34.430
the fashion designer too, I mean it's, they
have the icon that they then try to parlay

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:39.829
into other domains, but really I think what
you're getting at is you have to have this

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:44.170
midpoint meeting, if you will, between the
kids' interests and what's being marketed.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:48.990
If they don't take the trouble to do the marketing,
then you're not gonna see it in the store

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.150
and it's not gonna have much of an effect
either way.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:58.460
But it's really interesting, I don't if you
saw the New York Times had a story two days

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.559
ago that Disney's now going to maternity wards.

00:50:01.559 --> 00:50:06.460
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I'm actually mid working
with NPR on this on a commentary. Yeah, yeah,

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.710
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.329
Well, yeah.

00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:15.180
Do you know what we're talking about, Disney's
they have a new line called “Disney Baby”

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:21.619
that is, -- they're modeling it after the
success of the princesses. And what they've

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:28.869
realized that they have a big hole in their
consumer products that they're not, they don't

00:50:28.869 --> 00:50:32.619
have anything, they have not hooked the zero
to three year old crowd yet.

00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:41.369
And so they are going into maternity wards
and going into hospital rooms of women immediately

00:50:41.369 --> 00:50:48.530
after birth and giving them a free Disney
stretchy, those things that babies wear, and

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:53.339
signing them up for the Disney Baby email.
And the executive in charge of this who is

00:50:53.339 --> 00:50:58.569
the same guy who invented Disney princesses
said this is a beach head for the newborn

00:50:58.569 --> 00:51:02.240
market that they are intending to expand out
from. So --

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.759
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: It's only nine ninety-five.

00:51:05.759 --> 00:51:08.249
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: It's only nine ninety-five.
You can make your child into a billboard within

00:51:08.249 --> 00:51:09.589
12 hours of her birth.

00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:10.589
[laughter]

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:13.260
Yeah. You're on it, you're on it. You can't
get 'em yet. If you go to the site, you can't

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.559
quite get 'em yet, . Iit's gonna be a little
while. But they're gonna have eight, it's

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:20.710
gonna be yeah, yeah. So I don't know.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.569
In other countries, you are not allowed to
market, I mean this is not exactly marketing

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:29.059
to children it's marketing to adults to turn
them into marketers for children. And at the

00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:35.869
most vulnerable time in your life, so that
your child will wear the Disney onesie and

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:38.779
go into the Disney princess or whatever the
boy equivalent phase might, but they don't

00:51:38.779 --> 00:51:42.900
really have, they haven't hooked boys in the
same way. And then go along to Hannah Montana

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.259
and go along to High School Musical, and whatever's
going on at that time.

00:51:45.259 --> 00:51:48.700
[pause]

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:54.869
Other countries don't allow marketing to children
under 12. And they certainly wouldn't allow

00:51:54.869 --> 00:52:01.710
marketing to people right after they have
given birth. So I think there's a point where

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.560
we gotta put out feet down on that, or foot,
our collective foot down so.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.411
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Do you want one --

00:52:07.411 --> 00:52:08.411
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: One more question.

00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:09.411
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Sure.

00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:10.440
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Yeah. You guys have to
go to work, right?

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.440
[laughter]

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440
This is your job.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.670
&gt;&gt;male #2: So I was wondering what you think
about how much of this is trying to fight

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:23.200
something that you find to be specifically
pernicious versus just how much of it is a

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.069
parent feeling like they want their child
to do one thing and the world wants them to

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:33.309
do another and through every phase of the
child's life, you basically are sometimes

00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:36.700
capable and sometimes under powered to do
it?

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.769
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Can it be both?

00:52:37.769 --> 00:52:38.769
[pause]

00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:39.769
&gt;&gt;male #2: Sure.

00:52:39.769 --> 00:52:44.779
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I mean why not both right?
I mean you have a magnitude of marketing and

00:52:44.779 --> 00:52:48.140
channeling towards your kid, I mean it's like
the difference when you were saying before

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:53.789
the one TV channel. I, it's the difference
between having five TV channels and a black

00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:59.529
and white TV and having a satellite dish.
And that is a lot of messaging, a lot of marketing

00:52:59.529 --> 00:53:06.119
in an unprecedented way to little kids, and
probably more to girls than boys 'cause girls

00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:09.339
and women are bigger consumers.

00:53:09.339 --> 00:53:15.809
So I do think that's pernicious and I also
think that we're in constant negotiation with

00:53:15.809 --> 00:53:21.261
our kids about what they want versus what
we want for them, and sometimes those things

00:53:21.261 --> 00:53:26.730
dovetail and sometimes they don't. And from
a marketing perspective, there's always an

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:33.140
attempt to say that magnifying desires is
somehow less coercive than instigating them,

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.060
 . Wwe just gave them what they wanted. I
don't really buy that.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:43.319
But I think you do have to have the conversation
with yourself and your fellow parents and

00:53:43.319 --> 00:53:50.960
your community and also start laying the groundwork
when your kid is small for what comes in the

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.309
house and what doesn't and what your values
are, so that when they get older and you are

00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:59.309
in more active negotiation with them conversationally
as we all will be, as all adults always will

00:53:59.309 --> 00:54:03.630
be with children, you can have those conversations
in an intelligent, useful way.

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:04.630
[pause]

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:09.539
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible] Follow up so a little
background: I have two daughters, ten months

00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:15.490
old and two and a half years old and I'm just
at the beginning of this journey. My approach

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:20.999
has always been you only say no to the things
that are really wrong. So unless you can actually

00:54:20.999 --> 00:54:25.019
explain to them why it's wrong, you don't
say no because then they'll learn, "Oh you're

00:54:25.019 --> 00:54:29.590
just saying no." So I want to be able to set
myself up to have the right impact on them

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:30.760
when they're 15, 16 --

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.760
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right, that's what I'm
saying.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.760
&gt;&gt;male #3: when things are actually dangerous
 --

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Right.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.019
&gt;&gt;male #3: and so I'm not going to fight the
battles now because I don't wanna alienate

00:54:37.019 --> 00:54:38.769
myself --

00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:39.769
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Um-hum.

00:54:39.769 --> 00:54:40.769
&gt;&gt;male #3: as an authority figure.

00:54:40.769 --> 00:54:42.220
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: I guess I would say a couple
things to that though. One is your child also

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:46.140
has to get used to you laying down rules and
accept that you are the authority figure who

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:52.059
does that. And you can't always. Y, you will
find when your children get a little older,

00:54:52.059 --> 00:54:57.069
if you wish you could explain everything maybe,
but you're not gonna. Y, you cannot explain

00:54:57.069 --> 00:55:01.150
it. Sometimes you just can't. S, sometimes
it's either you can't because it's too hard

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:05.990
cognitively for them to get it. Like if you
try to say, "Oh honey, you don't really want

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:11.329
that Disney princess Cinderella toothpaste
because they're just trying to shill you into

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:16.029
buying some more toothpaste that you don't
really want." They're gonna hear that, ; they

00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:17.339
hear, “Cinderella! Toothpaste!"

00:55:17.339 --> 00:55:18.339
[laughter]

00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:23.670
And there are great minds and billions of
dollars trying to tell your daughter that

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.960
these are the things that she wants and that
isn't really a free choice at that point.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:35.900
And that isn't really letting her make the
choice or letting her make the decision if

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.359
you don't sort of set out some rules and some
ground rules and some values for her, the

00:55:40.359 --> 00:55:42.289
marketplace raises her for you.

00:55:42.289 --> 00:55:50.289
So I think you do wanna have, you don't wanna
say, "No, no, no, no." You wanna say yes judiciously

00:55:50.289 --> 00:55:54.470
and like I said you also wanna provide alternatives.
Like for instance, one that I always like

00:55:54.470 --> 00:56:02.769
to say is when my daughter was little, we
read a lot of child friendly Greek myths and

00:56:02.769 --> 00:56:07.099
so rather than being a princess, a Disney
princess on Halloween, she chose to be Athena,

00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:12.680
the Goddess of War and Wisdom. Athena wears
a really cool outfit and she's got a different

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.970
vision, a different idea, a different message
about femininity that would not be out there

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:22.930
in the marketplace if we were just shopping,
but is really worth her hearing and knowing

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:27.289
about. And that was about finding something
that I wanted her to know about and say yes

00:56:27.289 --> 00:56:30.779
to rather than just responding and reacting
to the things that were out there.

00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:35.700
And similarly the kind of tsunami of pink
and sparkle was getting on my last nerve.

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:41.410
S so we went out and got a stack of cheap
white T-shirts when she was I don't know four

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:48.119
or five and a lot of dye, and we temporarily
ruined my washing machine and we made a whole

00:56:48.119 --> 00:56:52.989
range of colored T-shirts for her together.
And what was great was that then she went

00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:58.430
to school with them and they were things she
had made and she felt really good about having

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:04.279
this unique experience of making her own clothes
and that sort of gave them a cache and a mystique

00:57:04.279 --> 00:57:08.559
that other kids picked up on and also gave
her the experience of being an individual

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:14.040
and a creative individual and not just, "I'm
a girl so I wear pink."

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:23.109
So I think there's ways that you can say no
while saying yes and that that's part of your

00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:24.220
job when kids are little too.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.359
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.869
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: But what?

00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:28.009
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]

00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:31.880
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: Nature abhors a vacuum.
And I think, and honestly I think that part

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:38.259
of the reason this has happened is that as
women, we have talked a lot about feminism

00:57:38.259 --> 00:57:42.430
and public achievement and such with our daughters,
but we haven't really wrestled with femininity

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:46.460
much and what that means to us and what that
means to them. And nature abhors a vacuum

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.230
and the marketplace ran in and filled a the
breach. So --

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:57.690
&gt;&gt;Kaveri Subrahmanyam: Yeah, [inaudible] as
parents we really have to set the limits and

00:57:57.690 --> 00:57:58.690
[inaudible].

00:57:58.690 --> 00:57:59.690
&gt;&gt;Peggy Orenstein: And start the conversation.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:00.690
So thank you guys so much for having us.

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:01.690
[applause]

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:02.690
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Thank you guys.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.691
[applause]
