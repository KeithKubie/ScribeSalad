&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.790
&gt;&gt; Hey, everybody,
let's get started.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.830
My name is Sasha; I work here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.420
Hey, guys.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.720
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.020
&gt;&gt; What school are you guys with?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.320
&gt;&gt; Halioma [phonetic].

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.620
&gt;&gt; Halioma; I knew that.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.920
And what grade are you in?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.220
&gt;&gt; Fifth.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.520
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.820
Have you guys been here before?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.120
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.890
&gt;&gt; Well then, welcome,
for the first time ever.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.970
So I have a weird question, so
who knows what day is tomorrow?

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.380
You're in fifth grade; you know.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.060
&gt;&gt; Presidents Day.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.270
&gt;&gt; What date?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.570
&gt;&gt; May -- I mean, [inaudible].

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.190
&gt;&gt; We're not there yet.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.490
[Laughs]

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.790
&gt;&gt; March 1st.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.250
&gt;&gt; March 1st; and what is
March, what month is March?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.640
I'll tell you, it's
Women's History Month.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390
So to celebrate that
-- starting that month,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.840
we have a very special guest today.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.180
So this right here is a renowned
scientist, Dr. Svetlana Kotliarova.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.690
I know, that's a hard name.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.080
She has a very interesting life.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.290
So she was born in Russia, and
studied in Tokyo University.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.130
Tokyo is in what country?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.430
&gt;&gt; Japan.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.730
&gt;&gt; Japan, yes, way more confident.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.520
All right; and that's where she
got her PhD in humans genetics.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.330
And then she worked as a cancer
researcher right here in Bethesda,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.640
Maryland, a couple
minutes down by Metro.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.220
She currently works as a
scientific review officer

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980
for the National Institutes
of Health,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.260
and she'll tell you a
little bit about that too.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.900
She has completed a lot
of award-winning research,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.280
and has written about her findings

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.590
in very important scientific
journals.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.380
So you can tell she knows
a lot about science,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.950
and she is really excited
to talk to you about it.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.510
So let's welcome, everybody
clap, Dr. Kotliarova.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.940
[ Applause ]

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.240
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: All right;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.630
thank you very much for
such a warm welcome.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.890
And I just want to make
sure everyone hears me well.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.320
On the back you can hear me well.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.190
If you don't hear, you just
shout it, "We don't hear you."

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.360
Okay? All right; so you
can just call me "Dr. K."

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.280
for short so that everyone
can do that, right?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.580
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.880
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: Okay.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.710
If you have a question, so
raise your hand and we'll try

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.670
to answer all the questions
you have.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.520
If we don't have enough time,
you e-mail me your questions,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.450
and I will try to answer them.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.140
Yes? You have a question already?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.660
[Laughter] Yes, please?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.290
&gt;&gt; So oh, we have [inaudible].

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.610
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
You do Sam's Club?

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.650
So you know a lot about science?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.700
So who loves science?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.970
That's great.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.560
I'm so excited.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.010
[Laughs] So --

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.880
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] projects to do.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: Okay, great.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.270
So if we will have enough time,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.230
in the end we can also
can do some cool stuff

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.840
with the equipment
that we have here.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.140
How about that?

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.440
&gt;&gt; Yes; that is [inaudible].

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.240
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: So
-- okay, you have a question?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.650
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.740
Lava lamp; which one, this?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.170
So this is just water and I
put some water color in that.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.550
But let's talk about
this closer to the end

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.610
when you can do something
with it, okay?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.510
All right; so [foreign
language], what did I just say?

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.050
Did anyone understand?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.120
No. What language was that?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.750
Do you --

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.080
[ Overlapping Comments ]

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.860
Who said Russian; yes, good guess.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.350
So I was born in Russia, and
I just welcomed you saying,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.850
"Good morning," [foreign language].

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.500
And I was born just in the
kind of middle of Russia.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.890
So this is Moscow.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.880
Who knows Moscow is
the capital of Russia?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.890
Okay; so Moscow is
the capital of Russia.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.450
You also have another Moscow here
in the US, maybe several of them.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.530
So and I was born here
in Ural Mountains.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.050
And the nature there
is so beautiful.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.960
And I like to watch like
water flowers, butterflies,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.190
and caterpillars, some

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.990
of the insects I was
scared of so like spiders.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.010
And still I don't like them.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.470
So and but the life, all the
beautiful creatures, attracted me

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.210
and I was interested how we have
all these different forms of life

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.390
and how they all function,
so what makes them alive;

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.600 position:56%
I was interested as a child in this.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.530
And this is some places
from my home place.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.680
This is the natural -- oh, sorry,
national hero or Bashkir people.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.530 position:56%
So Ufa is the capital of the Bashkir
Republic, which is inside of Russia.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.500
And this is the national
costume of the Bashkir people.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.580
And as I told you, there
is very beautiful nature,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.410
so you can see some of them.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.930
Ufa is a big city; it's
more than a million people.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.990
But there are a lot of
beautiful nature places outside,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.720
and some beautiful buildings also.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.350
This is a church.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:24.170
And my family, we lived
in the suburbs of Ufa.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.260
It was quite a poor area.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.730
I didn't think about
this when I was a child,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.160
but now I realize about that.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.620
So this is -- so it doesn't work?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.030
Okay. So we lived in this house.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.280
So it was a small apartment, one
bedroom apartment, three windows.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.980
Here is where my family lived.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.840
And we had three people.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.160
So here is, me and this is my baby
sister, and I also have a brother.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.030
And this is my mother.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.900
And so I was a girl like
you, so about the same age.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.040
And this is one of the
two dresses that I had;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.840
and another was probably washing.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.320
So [laughter] in the -- and
we didn't have -- for a --

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.540
I remember the times when I
didn't have a washing machine

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.870
to wash the clothes,
and washed them by hand.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.570
And we never had a drying
machine, so I put the clothes

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.190
to dry just using the
air, natural air.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.980
And this is my school where I
loved to go, because there was

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.950
so many interesting stuff.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.330
And you already told
me you love science.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.990
And so this is what I
started liking at school,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.660
especially when we started learning

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.940
about general principles
of life, like genetics.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.980
Has anyone heard about genetics?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:05.330
Okay, I see some hands;
that's great.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.370
So we'll talk about this
a little bit more later.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.540
Oh, okay, now it works,
so the three windows.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.090
[Laughs] So this is my
path around the globe.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.200
So I was born in Ufa,
you already know.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.930
If you see it anytime in
your life this picture,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.270
you know where it is, it's in Ufa.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.630
And I went for my studies
to Novosibirsk.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:37.690 position:56%
And I told you already I love to go
to my school, to be with my friends,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.460
to learn interesting things.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:48.410
And It was kind of hard for me
to choose what I wanted to do.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:54.160
I already told I loved biology,
but to go to study biology,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.470
I'd have to go out of my home city.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.330
So I was kind of scared about that.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.790
And I thought, "I also
love English."

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.000
So due to some reason, my
parents put me into a school

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.450
where I studied English
from the 2nd grade.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.570
I thought, "What a strange
idea my parents have,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:19.620
because I don't see any people
speaking English around me.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.540
I never saw anyone traveling
abroad, why should I know English?"

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.340
But standing here today, I
say if I didn't know English,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.430
I wouldn't be here with you
today, not enjoying your company.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.270
So it pays to listen to
your parents when they say,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.580
"You have to learn something."

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.450
One day, you will realize
that it was good advice.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:52.130
So and I was thinking, "Okay;
maybe I go to my local university

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.590
and study English,"
because I, believe it

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.400
or not, started to love it.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.950
First I was like -- I didn't
know why I'm learning it,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.320
but then I loved it.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.310
And then my cousin came
and he said, "Why would you

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.580
like to translate people's
thoughts?"

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.090
So this was the only application
that we could think about just

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.270
to translate something
from English into Russian.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.360
"You go ahead and you
bring your own thoughts.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.400
You like science, do
something, do science.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.500
You have your own ideas,
try them, test them."

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.330
And I said, "Okay; maybe
I'll go and give it a try."

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.520
And we didn't have SATs
like you have here.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.560
I just had -- if I wanted
to go to some university,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.320
I would go to university
and do my exams right there.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.430
And I couldn't go to many places.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:59.420
Usually, university will
have entrance exam in August.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.370
And the best universities also
to give another chance to people,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.730
they did entrance exams in July.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:13.700
And so I went to Novosibirsk,
which was very good in science.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.400
They have good science
measures there.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.140
And the exam was in July.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.770
I said, "Okay, if I fail
it, I go back to Ufa,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.920
and go to my university
and study English."

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.080
And then, believe it or not,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.730
I passed the exam,
and this was my path.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.440
And one more good thing
happened in Novosibirsk,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.760
I studied there and
I loved the studies.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.850
First it was general studies
about all the biology,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.290
and then very specific studies
studying about molecules of life

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.270
which is called -- molecules and
biology, how would you call that?

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.660
What would be the science?

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.360

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.270
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
Molecular biology,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.610
study about molecules,
biological molecules.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.110
And one more thing happened there.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.090
I met my best friend,
and my husband,

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.660
and my life supporter
for all my life.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.470
And he is sitting here,
Dr. [inaudible].

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.380
[Laughs] [Applause] So
he has also some stuff

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.590
that he can show you in the end.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.450
So he's also a scientist.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.420
So and then we went
together with my husband

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.740
to Japan to continue our studies.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.370
So what's another good thing about
science is that it's international.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.600
You can work anywhere
around the globe.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.250
You collaborate with all the
researchers around the globe.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.460
And I did my research in
the University of Tokyo,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.460
and I got my PhD degree
in human genetics there.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.960 position:56%
And then I worked a little bit more,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.550
and traveled to many
scientific conferences.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:10.440
This is another thing that is cool
about science, that you can travel

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.830
and present your research.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:19.340
And we loved so much
how the research is done

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.490
in the United States.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:28.510
And eventually, we came to the USA,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.050
and to the National
Institutes of Health.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:39.360
This is the biggest research
institution in the world.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.180
And you have it just 30
minutes from here on the Metro.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.070
So you are all the lucky ones.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:54.510
So and I'm working now in the
Center for Scientific Review

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.450
at the National Institutes
of Health,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.720
which is for short
I will call "NIH."

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.040
So can anyone tell
me what science is?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.340
Okay.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:13.670

that you figure out,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.630

that you make -- make --

something that you create

you create, that's very good.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.020
What's that?

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.460
&gt;&gt; When you want to do
science, you have to start off

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.070
with your topic question.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.810
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: Yes,
yes, very good; very good.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.930
And you have an idea,
and you want to test it.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.410
This is part of science.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:25.000
So it is the way you learn about
how things work in the world.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.650
And you explore the world.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.000
So this is what science is about.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.650
And there are many different areas
of science; fields of science.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:43.140
So someone already said about the
question, so how science works.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.830
So first you need to
have your question.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:57.460
And how do you call the question
in scientific words; a hypothesis.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.290
You've heard this words, I'm sure.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:08.230
So you can have just a question,
"I'm interested what happens if --

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:18.230
" or, "If it is -- if I do this,
I believe I will get this."

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.800
So it can be different ways
of approaching science.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.040
And then you do what
to test your hypothesis

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.460
to your question; you
do something, yes?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.760
&gt;&gt; You do your experiment?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.200
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
Exactly; you do your experience.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.700
And for the experiment, you need --

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.000
&gt;&gt; Money?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.340
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: Some money;
[laughter] you need some stuff

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.140
to do the experiment,
right, you need your object,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.850
you need your device, you
need protection device.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.730
And then you will do your check.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.550
You will get some result.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.480
You need to analyze the result.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.040
Then you will develop your
understanding and your theory.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.390
And you need to share that.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.030
You put your -- you
will write a paper.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.340
So scientists need to think.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.680
Scientists need to
do interesting stuff,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.470
and also to write; so
see how many skills.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.510

all these skills?

&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
School, that's right.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.150
And you put your knowledge
into the library,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.600
and then before you
ask your question,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.520
you may want to also check,
read some books and see,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.360
"Has anyone before we
asked this question?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.670
Did they get an answer?"

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.730
Because in science, you
want to know an answer.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.620
And if someone already has
an answer, you say, "Okay,

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.030
I like this answer," or, "No, I
think the answer may be different,"

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:10.930
and you do your experiment, so
and you develop new technology.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:16.630
All right; so the best thing

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.810
to understand what scientists
do is to do an experiment.

idea that it's the air in the peel

the air in the orange.

about these are smaller and lighter.

going to sink at the bottom.

They will both sink?

Okay.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.280
&gt;&gt; I think that both of them are
going to sink, because the one

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.140
with the peel doesn't have as
much strength as the other one

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.240
that has that much strength.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.540 position:56%

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.210
that it doesn't have
this big protection,

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.390
so the peel is thinner, that's why?

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.960
Okay, you.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.730

to sink, because they both look

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.350
like they are lighter
than the water.

sink because it doesn't have a peel?

And -- okay, and -- yes?

&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] because we thought
that they both were going to sink

because they would be lighter
than the peel -- I mean the water.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:57.660

the other one went down,

protection [inaudible].

ones still have protection?

Okay; and you.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:15.300
&gt;&gt; The one without the peel is
[inaudible], so the water's going

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:25.310
to go in the hole and it's
going to bring the orange down.

yes; that's all good answers.

And you?

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.270
&gt;&gt; I think [inaudible] because the
surface is matching the surface

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.510
of the water and it's keeping
it stable so it would stay up.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.400

the surface of the water?

&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.740

peel helps the orange or Clementine

to stay on the surface of the water?

Yes; this is exactly
what it does, fluoride.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.560
And that fluoride protects
your tooth enamel from decay.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.170
This is what's found at the
National Institutes of Health.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.740
Who likes to go to the
doctor and get vaccines?

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.940
Oh, not too many.

&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: Exactly.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.650
And some of these vaccines,
for example,

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.970
for hepatitis were developed at
the National Institutes of Health

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:47.890
to make you healthy so that you
do not get sick from these germs.

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:53.780
And you heard in the news
like last year or something,

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.790
or about two years ago
that there was Ebola.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:03.510
And NIH worked to eradicate
Ebola virus.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:10.920
So NIH also made a
sequence of human genomes.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.970
So read all the letters
in your genome;

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.050 position:56%
and we will talk about this shortly.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.290
So there is a huge center
at NIH that fights cancer.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.700
So these are the institutes at NIH.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:34.210

you will find that there is someone

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.390

like allergies, there could
be allergy on the skin, right,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.800
that could -- it could be studied,
then, in the Allergy Institute.

It's also the skin, right,
but it also affect --

it's a systemic disease so it
could be also different institutes

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:31.250

institutes could study that.

If things don't works, so if

to answer your question.

is that you are going

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:13.140
to get one of these books.

So I just wanted also to let
you know that there are some --

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:25.370
as you told me, you go to get
your degree in the college

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:29.580
to be a scientist, but you
can get a masters degree,

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.980
you can get a PhD degree.

But there are some cool science jobs

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.710
that do not require a
very advanced degree.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:41.430
And some of these, you can be
an environmental technician,

you, test if it's good water.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.230
A sonographer can look
inside the body

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.230
and check whether everything
is fine there.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:56.900

a biomedical engineer to make an arm

So previously, like
in the old times,

science was mostly men things;
so mostly men were scientists.

And she's a very famous
scientist, because she was the one

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:35.760
who found the structure of
the main molecule of life.

&gt;&gt; DNA?

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.840
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: DNA.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.140
That's great, you know.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.510
Wow. [Laughs] And remember --
and can you imagine that many,

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.540
many very good scientists,

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:59.540
very bright scientists were solving
the puzzle of the DNA molecule,

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:06.620
how it is formed, how it can be
replicated from cell to cell.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.830
So in the cell, we have
the nucleus inside.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.980
And all the DNA is
inside this nucleus;

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.270
and how it can determine
who you are.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:26.400
Every one of us have
the DNA in our cells.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.770
So DNA, as I told you,
is in this nucleus.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:45.320
But it is very, very long;
they're about a 6-foot tall person.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.640
And you if put all your DNA
from one cell, it is so long.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.380
One string of DNA is very long.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:50:01.300
But it's very, very compactly
organized inside the cell.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:06.000
So and how do you think
how many letters are there

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.290
in the genetic code.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.590
So there --

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.890
&gt;&gt; Eleven.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.190
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: You know,

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.850
26 letters in the alphabet
to make all these work.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:21.420 position:56%
But how many letters do we have in
our cells, like in our genetic code?

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.330
&gt;&gt; Four?

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:26.910
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
Who said four; great.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:29.290
So we have these four letters.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.780
And I need two volunteers.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:39.100
So you didn't come yet;
come please, and you, yes.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:45.610
So can you tell me how these
letters can be organized?

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:49.440
So they go together.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.540
So this is the pattern.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:57.990 position:56%
So there is only one way how these
letters can combine with each other.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.290
Can you figure out?

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.590
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.950
&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova: And
this is always the rule.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.850
Yes, that's correct.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:12.220
This is always the rule that
we have a letter T goes with A,

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.700
and letter G goes with C.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.690
And we have only four letters
in our genetic alphabet.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:24.270
So and this is how we go
together, how they're organized.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.590
And then this molecule
will be twisted.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.920
So you saw the picture
of that, right?

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.450
It will be twisted, and twisted,
and twisted so it becomes very,

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:41.620
very small, so that it
can get inside the cell,

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.920
inside the tiny nucleus.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.440

&gt;&gt; Svetlana Kotliarova:
What made me like science?

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:14.460
So actually, I like -- started
liking science when I was a child,

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:20.560
like as I saw like the plants,
the insects, the animals,

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:28.030
I always bring some animal --
like some animal, like the dog,

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.920
some cat from the street
to my house;

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.910
I like all the living creatures.

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:39.360
And when we started
studying genetics in school,

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.760
this is when I thought it's
so cool it has also math laws.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.870
If you heard about Mendel,

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:53.300
Greg Mendel who made the
first genetic experiments.

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.320
This is so logical.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.600
And it can explain how things work,

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:07.200
how all creatures are
working, how we are made.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:12.350

very fascinated in science.

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.970

were you when you started

you liked science?

I was; so thinking about science,

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.750

from when I remember myself.

went to university what area
