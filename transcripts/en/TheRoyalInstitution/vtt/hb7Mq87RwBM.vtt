00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580
You might think that the
combination of science and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.910
sport together is a relatively
new thing, but actually

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.080
they've gone hand in hand ever
since humans first started

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.860
playing games.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.720
To ensure fairness, they would
draw a line in the dirt.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.620
But to improve things and
ensure continuity

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.070
year-on-year, they cut two
grooves in a marble sill.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.800
You would stand on the sill
and put your toes in the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.020
groove before you started, hence
the saying "toeing the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.830
line." It's one of the earliest
examples of sports

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.940
technology, and something
you can still see today

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.190
at Olympia in Greece.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.950
Fast forward through history
and we crash into the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590
Industrial Revolution.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.020
And for the first time, the
average worker had a little

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.780
bit of disposable income,
but there were

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.390
huge numbers of them.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.890
And thanks to the new labour
laws they also had the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.660
Saturday afternoon off, so what
to do with that time?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.180
And the answer lies here in
Sheffield's Kelham Island

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.280
Industrial Museum, and on the
fantastic shelves over there.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.600
So 19th century Sheffield was
a huge manufacturer of

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.300
cutlery, of hand tools,
and of cannon shells.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.940
So at lunchtime on a Saturday
afternoon, the whistle would

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.620
go on the workers would clock
out using the clocking

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.110
machines over there.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.670
They would then go down the pub
for a couple of hours, and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.390
then pass through those
turnstiles there into the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.080
football matches.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.300
And that's why, traditionally,
football starts at 3 o'clock

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.890
on a Saturday afternoon.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.300
The story is all there
on these shelves.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.050
I give them feedback
that helps them

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.980
achieve their goals.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.760
And that's the goals for that
session, the goals for that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.560
training cycle.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.800
And ultimately the goals that
will get them towards elite

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.870
performance, and hopefully
an Olympic medal.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.170
So we've got the video of Ben.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.665
This is the high-speed video
linked to the force plate

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:36.970
data, and we can play
the video through.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.190
Oh, wow, I love that.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.040
You can see the line projected
on screen.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.430
And if the line's longer, he's
pushing harder, and depending

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.265
on what direction the line goes,
that's the direction

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.605
he's pushing into the towers.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:50.485
So here, for example, you see
he's pushing back quite hard.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.000
The drivers for this technology
have obviously been

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.040
interaction with computers,
gesture recognition, the sort

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.850
of thing that kind of normally
happens in a living room.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.000
With sports engineering, we
can model a whole sport.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.200
And we can use it to push the
physical boundaries of the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.450
discipline.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.960
Is it cheating?
