00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.059
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop where today we're going to be building a brilliant board a light-up announcement board

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.410
That's easily visible in daylight, or dark the supplies for this build are very simple

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
We have just a scrap of wood board that was about 1 inch thick before it was planed

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.198
We've got a sheet of acrylic plastic 8 inches by 10 inches a set of poster lights

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.409
Which is a string of battery-powered LEDs and some wood glue?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.449
We've also got some liquid chalk markers, which we'll use for writing on our board once

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.039
It's complete you may have also noticed that there is a table saw on the workbench with me and that is what we're going to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.340
Be using to cut up this board

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.069
We're going to be building this board in a little bit of a strange order because to get some of the exact

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.739
Measurements we have to cut a piece and then measure it

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.550
using our clear piece of

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.119
Plastic as a guide for what width to move on to so the first step is going to be cutting a long strip off of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.149
One edge of this board with our blade tilted at an angle

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.309
Our blade is going to cut the board at an angle so we want to set our guide to a point where we have about

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.378
1/2 of an inch on the bottom being cut that will of course give us a wider amount at the top

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.170
that is what the angle does

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.409
We've now got our board and the piece that we cut off of it, which fit nicely together of course

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.079
But the other advantage of cutting it at an angle like this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.629
Is we can now flip that piece upside down and when we line it up with the edge? We get one continuous

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.629
Angle from one piece into the next that's what we're after after cutting off that first strip

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
We can now cut our board and the strip down to the width that our brilliant board is going to be

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.250
It's going to be based on this 8 by 10 sheet of acrylic so we can make our board 8 inches wide

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.119
Let's measure that off on both of these pieces and cut them on the chop saw

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.500
Let's cut a second eight-inch piece off of our trimmed bit

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.179
Now here is why we

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.049
Wanted to cut these two pieces before we cut the rest of our board we want to be sure that these two pieces

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.309
Perfectly sandwich the acrylic board that's gonna be in between them, so let's take our acrylic board sandwich it between the two thin pieces

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.920
We've cut and now we can line it up on the base and measure exactly how wide we want the base to be?

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.439
Now this line along the top of our board indicates where we want the highest portion of our angled cut to go

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.048
So to figure out where we want the whole slope

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.360
let's line one of these other pieces up and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.639
Mark that along the edge of our board this should help us line our saw blade up. Just where we want it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.069
With that side

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.759
Cut we should be able to sandwich our plastic board in between our two top rails and have it line up. Just right

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.470
To make a nice continual sort of pyramid shape that's looking at excellent

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.350
We'll be using this string of battery-powered LEDs to light up our board and those need to shine through this piece right here

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.319
So in order to do that we need to drill a lot of holes to let a lot of LED light through this

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480
LED string is super basic

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.170
It just has a battery box with a switch that goes from off to flashing to on and this string of 20 LEDs

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.439
This is designed to be used as a decorative element

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.369
Around some sort of poster that you would make for a school project or something like that

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.799
But I think what we're using it for is a lot more fun

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.700
We're gonna want to drill 20 holes in a line down the middle of this piece of board

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.929
So let's measure off where those go get the right size drill bit and throw it on the drill press

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.119
To get all of those nice and lined up

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:53.089
One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 beautiful

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.539
Got the holes drilled now, let's just sand down to get rid of any of the burrs on the top

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.228
Our string of Lights is lining up nicely to fit into the holes that we've just drilled into our block of wood

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.288
But we can see that when we start putting all of the lights in place

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.799
We have quite a bit of extra wire looped at the bottom

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.389
Let's add two more rails of basically the exact same size and shape

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.848
Onto the bottom of our board this will continue the same slope that we had before

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.889
While leaving enough space that we should be able to conceal the wires entirely inside

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.889
We've still got quite a bit of wood left on our original board

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.489
So let's cut off another strip at an angle and then cut that to the right length

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.329
We've now got two rails that will run along the top of that block and to the O run along the bottom

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
I'll start by gluing the two bottom rails on and once that's dry. I'll move on to the top rails

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.970
All right looking good

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.620
The word fits in and back out

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:47.149
We've got our little pyramid going now these pieces are all together and before we install our LED lights

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.609
Let's take some measurements to cut out a base piece

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.389
We've got the rest of our board which already has our angled cut on one side

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.788
So we just need to measure where to put it on the other side

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.449
Now of course we don't need this whole block back to the chop saw

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:18.079
With our base block cut we now want to install our lights before we glue that down, otherwise. We'll never get those in there

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.299
Now to make this fit we just need to take all of these wires and sort of press them down

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.199
Into the gap there's plenty of space in between our two side runners. We just need to make all the wires

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840
You know agree?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.038
All right now that we've got all the wires just sort of pressed in there

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.408
Let's add some glue onto the sides and then fit our base block down on there and clamp it in place

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.639
That's a good-looking base the lights turn on they are entirely contained within the structure

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.459
That's just what we want to see let's clean this up

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.079
Just a little bit, so let's take some sandpaper and bring these edges down to one smooth plane

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.409
I don't want to leave this wood colored

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:18.569
So I'm gonna tape off some of the exposed openings and a little bit the light strip inside and then hit it with some black

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.569
paint

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:41.409
Our paint is dry. Let's peel off the tape and attach our switch to the back of it

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.199
We want our battery case to be somewhere that we can easily access it to change the batteries and to turn the switch on and

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.869
Off this battery pack comes with these two pads of sticky foam tape with a protective backing

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.680
We should be able to peel that off and stick it on to our base

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.059
Now let's try and take this extra wire and fit it back into the empty space

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:05.990
inside

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:11.740
Now we've got our eight inch by ten inch sheet of acrylic plastic and this has a protective film on both sides of it

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.340
Let's peel off one side, but not the other side just yet the bottom of this sheet of acrylic is pretty nice and smooth

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.930
It's not perfectly clear

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:25.359
But it's really close and we want to leave it that way so the light can easily shine into the board the other three sides

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.360
However, we're going to sand

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.120
Not only are we gonna sand the very edge?

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.919
But we're also going to sand a little bit of an angle which will help it be a lot more visible if you're looking at

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.919
the front of the brilliant board

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.629
With the edges sanded let's now wash off our board using water and a soft cloth

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.189
We want to make sure that we aren't using anything that will scratch the surface of the plastic

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.559
Because any scratches will show up with the light

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.869
And there's not going to be a good way to get rid of them at

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.859
This point we need to take our chalk markers and decide what we want our sign to say

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.109
Be aware that when this fits in the very bottom of the board isn't going to be visible so make sure your design

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:08.599
starts above the level of the base I

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.390
Left the sticky sheet on the back of this piece of acrylic so that I can easily lay it down on the table without worrying

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.459
About scratching up my sheet in the future

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:28.699
I'll have to be sure that I always lay this down on a nice soft clean surface

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.729
So I don't scratched up, but for now we're ready to peel off the back. Let's take our board and fit it into our stand

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.950
Now these markers are pretty opaque so of course this sign is visible in the daylight

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.020
But the real advantage is that when it's dark you can turn the light on and it's visible in the dark, too

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.020
But let's turn out the light and see how this thing looks

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.440
Jarvis Culpeper

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:10.729
You can use these signs for all sorts of things menus, business signs, announcements, or even just the fun night light

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.969
Hey guys. Thanks for watching if you're not a subscriber yet
