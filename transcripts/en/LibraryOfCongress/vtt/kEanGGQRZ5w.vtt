&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.220
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: My
name is Colleen Shogan,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.640
I'm director of national
and international outreach

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.340
at the Library of Congress and
it's my pleasure to welcome you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.070
to the seventh Annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.650
As you know, the national book
Festival is brought to you

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.930
by generous donors and sponsors,
we just want to take a moment

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.890
to thank them before we start
particularly our cochair

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250
David Rubenstein.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.340
You too can become
a donor or a sponsor

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.590
of the National Book Festival,
the instructions for donations are

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.790
in your programs, also on your
phone app and online at LOC.gov.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.350
Before we begin with
just a few announcements

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980 position:56%
if you have your cell phones please
power them off and at the conclusion

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540
of our program we will be taking
questions from the audience

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.510
at one of the microphones.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.500
This afternoon it's really
a distinct pleasure of mine

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.250
to be joined on stage
by Dr. Ronald White,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.550
the author of American Ulysses.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.300
Previously, he's written many
books on Abraham Lincoln,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.890
on Lincoln's leadership and also on
Lincoln's rhetoric but today we're

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.920
to talk about Ulysses S Grant.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.340
If you haven't read the book
yet I can commend it to you,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.610
it was terrific and it's 827 pages

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.280
and I was telling Dr.
White beforehand,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.850
I raced through all 827 pages and
you don't hear that very often.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.500
Given the recent national
conversations about the legacy

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.070
of the Civil War, I can't think
of a better person to hear

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.080
from this afternoon at the
National Book Festival.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.820
So the kick us off, as I
said about your biography,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.890
you spent years working
on Abraham Lincoln

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.660
but most recently you spent
seven years working on Grant.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.560
So can you tell us why the
switch from Lincoln to Grant?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.640
&gt;&gt; Ronald White: I give
my editor the credit,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.520
we were approaching 2011
2015, the 150th commemoration

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.620
of the Civil War, you said
you've written on Lincoln,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.420
don't you think Grant
is due for an upgrade?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.000
&gt;&gt; Shogan: There you go, so we're
going to talk about Grant today,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.120
start us out in his early life.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.050
For example, how and why
did he come to West Point?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.970
&gt;&gt; White: Well, first
I wanted to emphasize

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.260
that the early life is important
but publishers are rushing

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.240
into print biographies but
from my perspective many

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.780
of them skip very quickly
over the early years.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660
I like what Grant says,
he said the reason

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.920
that I do not read biographies is
that they do not tell the story

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.850
of the boy who becomes the man what
Grant called the formative period

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.150
of life.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.050
Think of your own life 16,
18, 20, 22 years of age,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.940
how important that was, so the
traditional biography skipped

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.260
over West Point from my
perspective too quickly.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.360
So I spent a week at West
Point, I gave a convocation

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.940
at West Point a week ago
Tuesday because I think that was

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.440
so important on Grant's life 5'1"
tall, a hundred and 15 pounds,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.380
17 years old he arrives at West
Point and it really is formative

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.150
in shaping who he becomes.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.790
&gt;&gt; Shogan: One of the distinctive
contributions in your biography

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.750
of Grant is that you focus his
relationship with his wife, Julia.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.920
You quote a lot of their letters
back and forth to each other

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.120
and what do you think, what does
that bring to your treatment

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.780
of Grant that perhaps other
biographers haven't focused on?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.260
&gt;&gt; White: I came early to believe
that Julia had been minimalized

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.630 position:56%
or marginalized too often that's the
story of women in these biographies.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.850
Julia kept all of Grants letters,
a funny incident was I live

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.050
in Southern California
and a friend who's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.620
in the movie industry approached me

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.370
and said this would make a
great television miniseries.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.620
So I was all ears and he said
let's get together I said okay.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.040
So tell me some of the most
important things you can

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.340
about Grant.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.830
I said I want to tell you about the
marriage between Ulysses and Julia,

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.900
what a wonderful marriage and
then I noticed a frown on his face

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.430 position:56%
and he said that will never do, that
never do and I said, what you mean?

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.340 position:56%
He said well it's all based on
internal tension, I said what, what?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.450
So I sent him the first
few chapters and he said,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.650
don't you see the internal tension?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.730
Grant's family was
strongly antislavery,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.690
Julia's father owned 30 slaves,
Grant's family would not come

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.530 position:56%
to the wedding because he was
marrying into a slaveholding family,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.530
Julia's father gave her four
slaves as a wedding gift.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.030
So young people think it's only the
two of them but Grant had to figure

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.690
out how he was going to navigate
a marriage with a father-in-law

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.650
who had such different views in his
own but at the end of their life

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.150
in the White House people would
come upon them now holding hands

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.840 position:56%
like bashful lovers, they did have
one of the great American marriages.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.190
&gt;&gt; Shogan: Grants served as a
quartermaster in the Mexican war,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.890
do we see any signs of early
brilliance in him in this period?

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.270
&gt;&gt; White: He bristled against
being the quartermaster,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.360
this for him his perspective
took him

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.180
out of active duty
sometimes broke through that

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.570
and did participate
especially in a daring episode

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.630
in the war of Mexico in Monterey.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.210
I think he had the latent
qualities of leadership

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.760
and Gen. Zachary Taylor picked
him to be the quartermaster

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.790
because he saw Grant's ability to
organize, to think about the fact

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.710
that you have to supply an army
in a very difficult terrain

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.580
and this would come to the fore
later on, Grant didn't see it

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.050 position:56%
at the time but he had to supply an
army in the Civil War often marching

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.780
where there're no supply lines,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.490
especially in the battle
of Vicksburg.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.150
&gt;&gt; Shogan: One of the popular
conceptions of Grant is

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.390
that he had a problem with
alcohol, that he was an alcoholic

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.060
and you do treat, you do
discuss this in the book

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.820
about how he departs the Army in
his first, the first departure

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.730
of the Army in the first
instance, but then in the remainder

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.460
of the book, that simply goes
away, there's not an emphasis

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.120
on Grant being an alcoholic or
having a problem with alcohol,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.100
do you think that is a
popular misconception

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.180
of Grant, can you comment on that?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.690
&gt;&gt; White: It is a popular
conception,

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.430
misconception I was struggling with
kind of many pieces of the puzzle

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.500
and one of the pieces
was Grant's drinking.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.260
I think Grant didn't drink,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.040
I don't think he was an
alcoholic or a drunkard.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.100
When he was posted to the
Pacific coast away from Julia,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.430
away even from the second child he
never seen, he fell into drinking,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.690
I'm convinced he did,
but the story is mixed,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.220
different people give
different reports.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.380
Grant wanted Julia with him, when
Julia was with him he did not drink

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.560
and so I think as he moved
forward into his adult life,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.880
the drinking fell by the
wayside, but drinking was a way

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.280
that his comrades in the
military would try to put it down,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.430
this guy that his meteoric rise
they kept the story alive oh,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.290
he's a drunkard.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.310
&gt;&gt; Shogan: One of the most
surprising elements in the book,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.380
when I was reading it, I
almost couldn't believe it,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.950
I am almost dropped the book
was that for a brief moment

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:35.580 position:56%
in time Grant was a slave owner, can
you tell us how that came to pass

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.330
and how he swerved this if all
with his abolitionist father.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.080
&gt;&gt; White: The slave that he
owned William was given to him

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.250
by his father-in-law, he helped
him in his farming in Missouri

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.790 position:56%
and if one is fortunate to visit the
U. S Grant national historic site,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.170
the Park service site near
St. Louis, their film,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.140 position:56%
their new film begins with the story
of Grant manumitting the slave.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.470 position:56%
Grant characteristically never talks
about it, he was down in his luck,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.810
had almost no money, this slave
could've brought him a thousand

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.360
dollars which was a lot of money in
those days, but he freed that slave

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.430
in 1859, he could not, I think bear
any longer to be a slave owner.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.610
&gt;&gt; Shogan: When the civil war
breaks out, Grant is working

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:26.150
for his father's letter good store
in Illinois, why does she decide

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.550
to rejoin the military
on the side of the union?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.900
&gt;&gt; White: Well, very
quickly he does decide that,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.770
he's the only West
Point graduate in Galena

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.880
and the first letter he writes is
to his father-in-law Frederick Dent

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.610
and he tells him that
he must join this war

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.340
and that this war will
mean the end of slavery,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.190
he then quickly writes a
second letter to his own father

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.240 position:56%
and he says this war will decide who
are traitors and who are patriots.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.690
I am a patriot and he steps
forward, there's no question

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.820
but the question will
becomes, where can he serve?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.550
This becomes a more
difficult part of the story.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.190
&gt;&gt; Shogan: How does Grant evolve
or change during the Civil War

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.640
and what characteristics or
characteristics do we see in Grant

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.980
that demonstrate why
he was so successful?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.220
&gt;&gt; White: Grant had what I
would call latent qualities

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.460
of leadership not brought out
during his days at West Point,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.060
not really brought out in
his first military postings,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.510
they begin to come to the
surface when he leads people

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.380
across the Isthmus of Panama
when he's posted to the West

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.210 position:56%
and his people are dropping in hours

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.820
from cholera he alone
steps forward the sort

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.420
of supervise not just military
men but women and children

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.420
across Isthmus of Panama.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.100
I think if I were to give one word

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.580
to what it would be
the word determination,

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.750
Lincoln called it pugnacity,
when he finally assumes command

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.940
of all the Union forces and
enters into Virginia and is stuck

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.130 position:56%
in this terrible place called the
wilderness Lincoln says to his aids,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.040 position:56%
if any other general had been in
this situation he would've been back

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.200
on the other side of the Rapidan,
back towards Washington DC,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.040
it is Grant's pugnacity
that wins determination.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.430
&gt;&gt; Shogan: Another special
relationship, I'm just following

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.040
up on this that you talked about
in the book is the relationship

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.670
between Lincoln and Grant, how
do you think and why do you think

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.570
that Lincoln was able to
recognize this tenacity in Grant

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.460
when others didn't see it?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.500
&gt;&gt; White: Well Lincoln had
made a habit of visiting all

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.760
of his generals or actually having
them visit him, he couldn't do

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.640
that with Grant because
Grant was in the West,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.470
but he saw from a distance
Grant's qualities

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.710
as a Western man not presumptuous,
not asking for too much,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.940
not complaining, the funny
story is with Grant's drinking,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.240
Lincoln the teetotaler
heard the Grant was drinking

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.770
and Lincoln says well let's find
out what he was drinking and give

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:05.020
that to all the other generals
and so they found a kind

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.870
of a relationship of
mutual admiration.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.560
In fact Lincoln is kind of
funny here, he finally says

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.750
to Grant Ulysses, don't tell me
your plans I can't keep secrets,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.750
I trust your plans, you carry
them out and I will support you.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:25.690
&gt;&gt; Shogan: You do a very good job,
a terrific job in the book talking

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.290
about the military
campaigns that Grant engaged

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.330
in during the Civil War
and as someone like myself

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.240
who is not a military
historian very easy

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.830
to understand the campaigns
particularly the maps

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.400
that you enclosed in
include in the book,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.360
we can't talk about all
the battles but I wonder

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.360
if you could tell us a story after
the Battle of the Wilderness.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.420
So this is in May of 1864 and Grant
comes to a very momentous decions

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.580
across worlds even, and he
tells us about that and how

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.460
that affects the continued
prosecution of the civil war.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.460
&gt;&gt; White: Well, remember
Grant had come from the west

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.930
to lead an Eastern Army

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.310
and the Eastern Army
was suspicious of Grant.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.170
You've been successful in the West
but you've never faced Bobby Lee,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.470
you've never faced Bobby Lee.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.260 position:56%
So Grant assumes command, the troops
are not quite sure whether he's

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.950
up to the task, he
enters into the wilderness

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.760
which is a scrub oak forest
about 4 or 5 feet tall

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.240
where suddenly he realizes that his
cavalry horses are of no effect,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.100
artillery is of no effect,
they didn't use the term

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.680
but friendly fire begins to take
place, men lose their location

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.900 position:56%
and begin to shoot at each other and
the force catches fire and men begin

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.610
to burn to death and they shoot
themselves before the fire

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.280
suffocates and kills them.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.090
So after two days Grant had
suffered 18,000 casualties

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.290
and a general arrives in his
camp and says I know Robert E Lee

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.990
and he's going to do
this, that the other

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.700
and Grant was a very quiet man
suddenly raises up off his haunches

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.250
and said "I am tired of hearing
what Robert E Lee is going to do,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.630
some of you seem to think is going

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.860
to turn a double somersault
and land on our camp."

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.600 position:56%
So the next morning Grant says we're
going to march this next evening

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.320
but don't give the word out,
I've walked the wilderness

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.350
and Grant comes down this
remarkable road it's 8:30 at night,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.040
he's riding this huge
horse Cincinnati

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.620
and that the troops are gathered
around, what is he going to do?

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.790
And he comes to a junction, he
will either turn north and retreat

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.890
for the fifth time of the Union
Army back towards Washington

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.450
or he'll turn south.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.160
Fortunately we had an artist
there that evening with pencil

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.590
and he describes what
happens and Grant gets

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.200
to that junction still there
today and he turned south

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.820
and the men throw their hats and
begin to cheer, and they begin

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.080
to sing at the singing
Army, aren't we glad

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.550
to get out of the wilderness?

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.860
And that's the moment that
Grant had won the command

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.440
and the respect of this Union Army.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.680
&gt;&gt; Shogan: It's a terrific story,
it's a very momentous point

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.600
in the book, very dramatic
and the way you,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.900
I loved the way you tell it.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.020
To fast forward into Grant's
political career often also

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.110
conceived I think in some
ways in a negative light,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.680
you do talk about the
various scandals

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.720
in his presidential administration,
you don't shy away from that,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.470 position:56%
but you having a different treatment
of it because you included a chapter

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:28.120
about Grant's use on Indian
policy, you also have a chapter

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.020
on Grant's war against the Ku
Klux Klan and I wanted to know,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.950
do you include those
chapters in the book to try

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.790
to give a more holistic view of
Grant's political career perhaps

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.970
to mitigate some of
the preconception

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.810
of his scandal ridden presidency?

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.340
&gt;&gt; White: Well, many
of the biographies

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:52.030
of Grant treat him much more as the
Civil War general in some ways pass

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.180
over the presidency, the scandals
all took place in the second term

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.750
and my conviction became that that
second term unfortunately began

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.050
to define both terms.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.120
So let's look at both terms, in
his inaugural address in 1869

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.300
for the first time an American
president says we must address the

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.430
Indian question, we've treated the
Indians in this country immorally.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.610
Grant did not campaign but he
went West all the way to Denver

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.930
and he came back with
a recognition, hey,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.320
the real problem is not the
Indians, it's the settlers.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.640
Now he's arrayed against
both Sheridan and Sherman,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.500
against his own army colleagues and
he calls a meeting within two weeks

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.100
of the leaders of all the Christian
churches to say we must put

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.640
in place a new policy

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.230
for the American Indian
that treats him fairly.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.400
I was much surprised by what
he did with the Ku Klux Klan.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.030
He came kind of late really into
his own antislavery position

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.210
but as the Republican
Party was really retreated

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.290
from reconstruction, Grant stepped
forward to defend the rights

00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:00.430
of the African-American, voter
suppression was alive then and now,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.860
and the voter suppression then was
perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.010
in alliance with the
Democratic Party,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.200
they wanted African-Americans
not to vote,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.730
we think Barack Obama was
the first president elected

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.340
with a nonwhite majority, not so.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.400
Grant won easily the electoral vote
but he only won the popular vote

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.970 position:56%
because 400,000 African-Americans
voted for him and so the Klan wanted

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.000
to stop African-Americans in voting

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.060
because they knew they would vote
overwhelmingly for Republicans.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.630
So one of the most exciting stories
is I think Grant was the last

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.750
president to stand up
for African-Americans

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.800
until John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon B. Johnson

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.630
and African-Americans knew
this and they rallied to him,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.680
Frederick Douglass was a tremendous
campaigner for Ulysses S Grant,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.980
he really believed in him.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.130
&gt;&gt; Shogan: The last question
after I finished the book,

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.530
the book is terrifically as I said
before, terrifically well-written

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.720
and very well researched
and I finished the book,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.380
I still felt as though Grant was
a little bit illusive for, to me,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.070
I couldn't quite figure out
exactly what made him tick,

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.900
but I just read your book and
you spent years researching

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.460
and thinking about Grant.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.860 position:56%
So I wanted to ask you, is Grant
illusive still to you or do you feel

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.170
like you really understand him?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.260
Well, first Colleen, my approach
to biography is what I call

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.160
from the inside out, I think often
we focus on politics and military

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.450
and we focus on what a person did
so I thought I knew about Grant

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.850
when I started the biography
he was obviously central

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.100
in my Lincoln biography and
after about a year I came

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.510
to my own conclusion I
don't really know the man,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.140
I don't really know the man,
and then towards the end

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.930
of the book I came to this
conclusion Grant was an introvert,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.770
there wasn't that terminology
in the 19th century

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.980 position:56%
that Susan Kane wrote this great
book called Quiet in which he argues

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.610
that extroverts win in our society.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.850
So Grant wasn't a good public
speaker, he was an extrovert

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.390
but he was a great writer, he
was also a very good listener.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.940
Introverts are often better
listeners than extroverts are,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.230
but it was hard to get
inside of an introvert

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.340
because he didn't fully reveal
himself, the reason the letters

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.680
to Julie are so important is he
reveals himself to her in a way

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.790
that he doesn't to anybody else.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.590
So he is certainly elusive but

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.570
but he's also this remarkable
person who, if I had one phrase

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.950
to call upon, I would
call it the moral courage

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.830
of a man is what I think
commends him to a modern audience.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.440
&gt;&gt; Shogan: Thank you, I know
you had wanted to read excerpts

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.190
from your book and I
think we have time to do

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.980
that before we take questions.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.990
&gt;&gt; White: When you write a
prologue you think for a long time,

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.510
how would you begin a book, how
would you introduce readers?

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.110
People know about Abraham Lincoln

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.720
but most people do not know
very much about Ulysses S Grant.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.220
"The man of middle height
accompanied by a young boy arrived

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.470
at the crowded Baltimore in Ohio
Railroad station in Washington

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:07.750
on the cold crisp morning,
it was March 8, 1864.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.200
He hailed a carriage and
asked the driver to take them

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.800
to Willard's hotel at the northwest
corner of Pennsylvania Avenue

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.020
and 14th St. only two
blocks from the White House,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.930
the man in voice stepped from
the carriage and walked directly

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.360
to the front desk,
the man 42 years old

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.000
and wearing a travel stain
duster asked for a room.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.890
The clerk sniffed brusquely,
did not the visitor know

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.730
that in wartime Washington few
rooms are available especially

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.780
at Willard's the finest hotel
in the nation's capital?

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.840 position:56%
The clerk dallied then informed the
travelers he could give them a small

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.280
room on the top floor, that would
be fine the man said softly.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.090
The clerk asked the guests
to sign the hotel register,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.310
when the clerk turned
the register around

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:01.990 position:56%
and read the signature U.S Grant and
son Galena Illinois, he turned pale.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:07.680
He gasped Gen. Grant, why
didn't you tell me who you were?

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.920
[Inaudible] more closely
the clerk could now see

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.200
that underneath the duster mostly
hidden was the blue uniform

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.540
of a union officer, Grant typically
almost always wore a private's

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.030
uniform, never a general's uniform.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.440
The clerk is seeing
posters portraying the hero

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.780 position:56%
of the West everywhere in Washington
suddenly attended he learned

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.550
out that he was reassigning Grant

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.110
and his son the parlor Suite
6, the best in the hotel.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.060
Indeed the same suite Abraham
and Mary Lincoln had stayed

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.440
in three years earlier when
they arrived in Washington.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.540
Now that he knew who was
standing in front of him,

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.080
the clerk handed Grant a sealed
envelope, the general opened

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.620
in finding an invitation to join
President Lincoln at a reception

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.220
that evening at the White
House as the guest of honor,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.660
because he had not served in the
Eastern theater of the Civil War,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.450
curiosity about Grant punctuated
conversations everywhere.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.410
Many knew the outline of his rise
to fame but still they wondered

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.040
out loud, who was he,
how would he succeeded

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.810
when so many union generals had
failed over the past three years,

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.350
why have the president
elevated him to the position

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.150
of the lieutenant general?

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.770
The first man since George
Washington to hold that rank,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.530
why had Lincoln tapped him to
come from the Western theater

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.970
to lead all the Union armies?

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:38.180
Humility and modesty are not en
vogue today, this is the story

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.200
of a the man, who is humble, who's
self-effacing, who didn't say

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.910
as modern celebrities would
say, don't you know who I am?

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.670
Grant would never have said that,
he simply accepted the room,

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.600
small room at the top
floor of the hotel,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.370
I thought this was the
best way to introduce him."

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:03.780
[ Applause ]

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.760
So we have plenty of time for
questions from the audience,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.200
we'll ultimately start over here.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.900
Very interesting presentation.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.160
I'd like you to comment on two
different aspects if you would

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.810
of the personality,
getting to know Grant.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.040
Number one, if you could comment

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:31.310
which I believe is the order number
ten, alright where the first time

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.070
in American history where
US citizens who happened

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.920
to have been Jews worked, he banned

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.910
from the territories
under his control.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.770
So that's one aspect.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.780
The second, if you could comment
again, his personality, well,

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:53.220
post-presidency the man was
bankrupt in tremendous debt,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.450
yet his moral obligation where,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.650
he insisted in paying
back all his debt rather

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.880
than letting them slide
by, even to the extent

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.930
of selling his sword to do so.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.670
&gt;&gt; White: Thank you
for both questions.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:15.540
So order number 11, it's December
1862, Grant is very concerned

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.690
that the people in
Washington do not understand

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.920
that they are allowing
trading to take place

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.300 position:56%
which is benefiting the Confederates
and many of the traders are Jewish.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:30.330
So he offered, he promulgates
this order to stop Jewish traders,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.180
Julio refer to this later
on "that awful order."

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.200
Lincoln will overturn it and
so there's a recent book called

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.810
when Grant expelled the Jews,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.610
but what happens is I think the
key ingredient we should look

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.960
at as readers is, are
they willing and able

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.700
to admit their mistakes
and to learn from them?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.430
And the Jewish author suggested
Lincoln did, that Grant did.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.600
That he recognized the terrible
mistake he had made and that Grant,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.550
when you continue the story
would appoint more Jews

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.320
to his administration
by far than anyone else,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.590
that he became a great friend
of the Jewish community,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.120
that he was present at by
invitation at the installation

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.350
of the first Jewish
synagogue in Washington,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.450
that he recognized the mistake
he made and made amends for it,

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.510
he felt terrible at
what he had done.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.870
He changed his whole attitude
toward the Jewish community

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.170
as a result of that.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.370
Part of the story made him
really angry was his own father

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.190 position:56%
who was always trying to benefit
from Grant's position had been hired

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.310
by a Jewish company in
Cincinnati and was there

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.460
in the South doing this
trading and he told his father

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.440
to stop this, what are you doing?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.640
Second story is, Grant
at the end of his life,

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.850 position:56%
there were no presidential
pensions, he had traveled the world,

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.910
he had made some money and
so he invested the money

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.430
in his son's Wall Street firm.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.630
His son was a partner, the
other partner was involved

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.860
in a Ponzi scheme and on
a particular day in 1864,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.590
Grant came to Wall Street to
learn that he lost every penny,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.830
he went home he had $81 to his
name and this is why he will end

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.230
up writing his memoirs which he
didn't want to do because he had

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.470
to find a way to provide
for Julia after his death,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.810
he was dying of cancer when he
started writing his memoirs.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.760
&gt;&gt; You stressed the importance
of the formative years,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.450
would you be able to compare
Grant's experience at West Point

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.270
versus Lee's experience
at West Point.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.710
Grant is so clear that this is a
war of patriotism versus traitors,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.630
Lee having a different
view and then the issue

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.200
that Mrs Grant I gather
invited Mrs Jefferson Davis

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.890
to give a dedication to his tomb.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.190
&gt;&gt; White: Yes.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.120
Thank you for the question.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.590 position:56%
Lee was the rock star at West Point,
the only West Point graduate never

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.730
to have a demerit, they were
of a different generation,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:04.750
Lee graduated almost
20 years before Grant.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.590
Grant didn't do so well at West
Point, he was 21st out of 39

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.010
and in his memoir, he
says I must apologize

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.260 position:56%
and I thought, why did he apologize?

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.070
West Point was an engineering
school,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.940
the language for military study was
French all the military literature

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.550
coming out of the Napoleonic
war was French

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.280
and then Grant says I spent
my time reading novels.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.120
So I looked in the library
records of that time

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.530
and there were no novels, novels
were the sitcoms of that day

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.230
and as a strict Methodist that was
his Christian upbringing they would

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.840
have been scandalous or spirialist,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.670
but I think great writers are
invariably great readers and I want

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.150
to find out, what did Grant read?

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.390
He tells us what he read
and that became a key

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.850
for me the Grant was a person
of intellectual curiosity

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.940
and imagination and
his reading was a key

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.070
to understanding to who he became.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:03.810
&gt;&gt; If Grant was alive right now,
what do you think he would say?

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.730
&gt;&gt; Shogan: That's a good question.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.520
&gt;&gt; White: Well, early on when
Grant as Colleen reminded us was

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.870
in Galena he went down
to Springfield to see

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.940
if he might find a position in the
Union Army and he wrote his father,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.140
he said "I will never participate
in the kind of trading and ambition

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.200
that these military officers
are in, that's not who I am."

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.690
When he wrote to Sherman
after being elected president,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.700
he said "I was forced into it,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:41.140
in spite of myself we need more
humility, we need more modesty,

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.720
we need the ability to say I
was wrong, I made a mistake,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.880
I'm willing to change" and that's
the vision for American leadership

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.640
that I think Grant helps us to see.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.930
&gt;&gt; Being a career teacher with
especially history, you know,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.810 position:56%
we discuss American presidents often
and Grant practically is grouped

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.150
with the Warren G Harding,
unfortunately in terms

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.200
of our worst presidents,
like you said probably mostly

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.520
because of the second
term, my question is,

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.680
in terms of the reconstruction
policy during his two terms,

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.950 position:56%
what kind of successes and failures
that he have, in terms of, you know,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.340
if you can place in the context

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.150
of that whole reconstruction
period especially in terms

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:30.290
of of how he tried to help empower
the freed black men who were trying

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:35.440
to basically restore some
semblance of order in the South

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.240
after the Civil War of course
some the whites were not having

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.540
that but...

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.840
&gt;&gt; White: Yes thank you.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.440
Well, Grant is actually rising,
I participated for the first time

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.620
in the C-SPAN 2017 presidential
survey, it was the third survey

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.150
of the 21st century and each of
these three surveys Grant is rising

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.670
as people recognize this, and
there's 10 different categories

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.280
by which you rank a president
and the highest category

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.420
for Grant is social justice.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.620
He should have even as
higher as rank number 10

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.440
of all the American presidents
and that's because of his standing

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.490 position:56%
for the rights of African-Americans.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.560
So Grant comes into reconstruction
with a very deferential position

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.330
as a military officer, he's
subservient to political officers

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.350
but then he recognizes on
sadly under Andrew Johnson,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.320
he can't take that position, he
can't cooperate with Johnson.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.810
So he begins to be more
politically astute to participate

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.890
with Republicans in Congress,
to stand with them on the 13th,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.890
14th and 15th amendments, but then
as they retreat, he won't retreat

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.460 position:56%
and the Republicans were even saying
"well, let the South handle this,"

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.020
no, no, no he said, we
have to deal with this.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.250
So I think that's one of
the finest moments of Grant

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.750
when he steps forward to defend
the rights of the freed man.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.500
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you about Grants
changing military reputation,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.810
really because of, of course after
1865 he is the hero of Appomattox,

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.620
the one who won the war and
it continues and sometime

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.160
around the start of the 20th
century, he becomes the butcher

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.370 position:56%
and so on and now which I think it's
the correct interpretation is his

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.860
military reputation
seems to be recovering,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.920
could you tell us why
there was the change,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.460
I mean there's different
thoughts on that.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.760
&gt;&gt; White: Yes.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.380
Well, the downturn of his
reputation came about because

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.080
of what we call the lost cause,
this was the view propagated

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.920
by Confederate generals and
southern newspaper editors

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.290
that the best cause actually lost

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.240
and the only reason the South lost
was that they were overwhelmed

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.550
by a numerical superiority of the
Union Army, the industrial might

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.680
of the North, and that
butcher Grant who was willing

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.820
to just let his men
be killed compared

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.930
to the gallant Robert E Lee.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.790
Well for 50 years we've
known that that's not true,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.930
but it hasn't seeped into
the popular imagination

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.950
that Grant's casualties one by
one are actually less than Lee.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.240
I've been informed by the fact

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.150
that since writing the
book I've become a friend

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.620
of Gen. David Petraeus,
in a week ago Tuesday he

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.850
and I together did a convocation
at West Point and Petraeus says

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.460
without question Grant is the
greatest American general.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.760
On what basis?

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.660
He said you judge a general
by three categories, strategy;

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.730
the overall sense of
what you're doing.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.270
Operation; you're combining
your leading in multiple armies,

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:31.180 position:56%
and tactical a particular battle and
he said Grant is A+ on all three.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.050
So Petraeus said to the
cadets at West Point,

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:39.310 position:56%
I read Grant in preparing for the
surge in Iraq and I told my generals

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.420
in Iraq to read Grant, he is
the great American general,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.780
the only general who is
an A in all three areas.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.250
So this is been, from this,
I'm not a military expert

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.630
but this is fascinating,

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:55.910
Grant's reputation now has
really eclipsed Lee or any other,

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.170
Eisenhower, any other
American general.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.320
&gt;&gt; I have a follow up on
the young reader's question,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.080 position:56%
so how do you think Grant would feel
about honoring confederate generals,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.330
statues like the debate
we're having right now.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.580
&gt;&gt; White: Good question.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.240
Well, first of all Grant
defended Robert E Lee

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.380
when Andrew Johnson wanted to try
him for treason, he said you need

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.580
to realize first of all he is
not a traitor and secondly,

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.050
he is what Grant called the
spiritual leader of the South

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.160
and the way we treat Robert E
Lee will be the way he hoped Lee

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.550
would respond.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.080
Now Grant didn't live to
see the monuments built

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.320
and the first monuments were
actually built in cemeteries

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.250
as the greatest generation
of that century was dying,

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.380
wives and especially daughters
wanted to put into the cemeteries,

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.920
the the men who had been
important that their sons

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.560
or fathers have served under them.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.080
Only later 1890s, even the 20th
century were the monuments raised

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.390
in southern cities and these often
were, we want to tell you who's

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.730
in charge, this is white
supremacy, this is Jim Crow.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.860
So there's two different things,
I think some of these deserve now

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.330
to be put into museums
and not on streets,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.300
but this a very complicated
issue and we have

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.520
to remember the historical
reason that this came into being,

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.910
I wish we did have a
monument of Long Street

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:31.440
who was Grant's greatest friend
because he became a follower

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.040
of Grant and a Republican
advocate of reconstruction

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.030
and a scalawag, a bad
guy in the South.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.540
I wish we did have monuments to
African-Americans who were leaders.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.460
So we had very selective
use of monuments.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:53.540
&gt;&gt; I heard a very disturbing story
about Grant's son at West Point,

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.680
that he was a leader of
the bullies against the one

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.400
or two African-Americans young men
there, and I just want to know,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.480
how that jived with Grant as
the father of this young man

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.950
and how did his influence

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:16.270
in his family not seep
down to his children?

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.300
&gt;&gt; White: Yes, you're
telling a correct story

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.890
that Grant's son was involved,
his oldest son Frederick

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:27.700
in a bullying episode against
African-Americans and you're right

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.880
to ask how does this seep down,
because at the end of Grant's life

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.660
that he writes this note to
Julia, he's dying of cancer,

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:38.640
he will finish his memoir
three days before his death,

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.090
he can't speak this to Julia, he's
too emotional so his toxin is coded

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.630
and she will find it after his
death and he says to her, he said,

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.160
you know, "it wouldn't bother
me a bit if I discovered in any

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.330
of our children was lying on
a bed of pain in a near death,

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.340 position:56%
what would bother me the most was if
they separated from the moral values

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.700
that you and I have
attempted to teach them."

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.830
So actually that later careers of
all the children are quite good

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.540
but that's an episode that
is right there is no way

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.260
of explaining it, yeah.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.610
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you had any
views about why there seems to be

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.210
so much interest in
Grant during our time,

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.980 position:56%
I read Jean Edward Smith's biography
which I thought is wonderful

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.820
and then not long after I completed
it, I saw that you have written one

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.090
and I read your other
books about Lincoln

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.330
and I saw the wonderful reviews
of this book and so I had

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.200
to read your book as well and
not more than probably a few days

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.410
after I purchased your book, I
realized that Ron [inaudible]

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:44.570
and I just wondering what,
if you have the views

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.160
of why the biographies
of Grant during our time?

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.700
&gt;&gt; White: Well, David McCullough
has said well that, you know,

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.200
I think we want to
sort of recover people

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.170
who for various reasons have
been under the, under the radar,

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.110
so he did a wonderful job with
John Adams and Harry Truman

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.000
and so Grant seems to be one
of those figures that it's time

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.370
to recover perhaps the
celebration or commemoration

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.770
of the Civil War 2011, 15 that's
long after Jean Edward Smith's book

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.740
but that's also kind of put
Grant back in the spotlight.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.400
The Grant in a strange interesting
story, the Grant papers which were

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.770
for many, many years of Southern
Illinois University are now

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:29.300
at Mississippi State University,
Grant has returned to Mississippi.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.260
So and it's fascinating
the president

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.220
of Mississippi State is just
thrilled to have the Grant papers,

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.260
they are building a whole new
Florida library for this you know.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.520
So there's a lot of things
that kind of converge in here,

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.610
that are kind of giving
a fresh impetus

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:44.860
to take a look at Grant again.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.090
&gt;&gt; The question I was
going to ask you already,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.580
answer with the other question.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:59.550
So I'm just going to follow up
and say, when you have histories,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.120
when you're writing a new
history about something

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.360
that has had many history books
written, are you grappling

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:12.150
with the history of his histories
and also when that stories changes

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.860
over time as you explained,
how do you see your role

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.740
and how do you grapple
with the history aside

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.730 position:56%
from the popular notion of the time?

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.030
&gt;&gt; White: Good question.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.170
We call this kind of, in the
history discipline Historiography

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:33.580
and so yes different figures
are viewed in different ways

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.830
in the climate of opinion
of that period

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:41.710
and there was a wonderful biography
that won the Pulitzer Prize

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:46.630
in the 1980s but it was written
in the era of the antiwar,

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:51.740
anti-Vietnam period, and so
that was not a time to lift up,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.360
will we ever again elect a general

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.840
to be president of
the United States?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.830
Our experiences of
Vietnam and now Afghanistan

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.360 position:56%
and now Iraq have made us, made some
of us at least kind of jaundiced

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:10.010
or wondering about the military,
and so you have to be very aware

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:14.030
of the Historiography but again
I feel that in every generation,

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.220
there's an opportunity to
take a fresh look at figures.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.090
So 20, 10, 20, 30 years and now
will be new books on Lincoln

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.860
as well there should be, and
our own questions perhaps

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:29.010
and our own political culture
may force us to see persons

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:34.150
in a different light than
maybe earlier generations did.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.290
&gt;&gt; One comment.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.620
At Gettysburg there's
a statue of Longstreet,

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:44.960 position:56%
it's a very unique statue and he
looks like he's this huge guy riding

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.280
on a hobbit horse so I think
the South did it to him again.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.880
My other question is after
all this is said and done,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.420
why did Grant not have Meade at
[inaudible] courthouse with him?

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.720
&gt;&gt; White: Very good question.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:07.280
When Grant came East to lead all
the Union armies, Gen. George Meade

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.330
who had won the victory at
Gettysburg was the commander

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.140 position:56%
of the Army at Potomac and Meade who
was known as old snapping turtle,

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.280
he had quite a temper,
wrote a letter to his wife

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.590
in which he said I'm sure
that Grant would replace me,

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:26.030
I'm sure he will bring someone
from the West to be my replacement,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.620
and he was so surprised
that Grant did not and many

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.300
of Grant's colleagues said
you got to replace this guy,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.270
he doesn't do this, he
doesn't do that and Grant said

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.510
but he does do this and so

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.700
when Grant wanted Sherman
promoted one more time,

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.260
he wrote to the secretary of war

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.250
and said you will not promote
Sherman unless you promote Meade.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.630
So Grant was very magnanimous
and very affirming

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:54.070
of his own commanders,
why Meade wasn't present

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:57.360
at Appomattox is a question
I'm not really able to answer,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.630
I don't think I take it as
a negative because he went

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.980
out of his way to affirm
Meade so many times.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.400
&gt;&gt; Hello, just regarding his
presidency, do you have anything

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.290
to say, I haven't your book
if you have anything to say

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.870
on his appointment of Anthony
Comstock as postmaster General

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:21.390
which I think probably is worst
thing he did, Comstock was sort

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:27.760
of a Newt Gingrich of the time
and then he would, yeah he boasted

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.820
that he resent 16 railway cars
a full of people to prison just

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.590
for having such things
which considered pornography

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.170
or condoms or anything like that.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.230
So he like took over, he became
America's censor and did,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.870
and Grant as far as know
did nothing about it and,

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.140
was there any blowback do
you know that he'd say,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.270
what a mistake he made
or anything like that?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.440
&gt;&gt; White: Well, Cabinet officers
were often as much nominated

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.620
by various constituencies as they
were chosen by the president.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.150
So the constituencies might be
geographical or we need someone

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.900
from Pennsylvania or we need
someone from Massachusetts

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.630
or we should have someone
from Illinois.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.730
If you want to accuse Grant one

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.610 position:56%
of the most puzzling parts another
piece of the puzzle was if Grant was

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.110
such a good judge of character
in the military and he was,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.320
why was he not such a good judge
of character in his cabinet?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.970
And he often was not, in his
military he gave people the lead

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:29.140
to let them do what they wanted
to, Ambrose Burnside for example

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.120
who failed miserably twice,
when Ambrose Burnside came

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.300 position:56%
to command the Army around
Knoxville, Grant went out of his way

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.260
to say to him and that he amazed
Burnside and he said, I trust you,

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.090
I believe you know
what you're doing,

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.470
you know more about this than I do.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.450
So Grant gave great authority
to his core commanders.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.120
He did so in many ways
to members of his cabinet

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.530
and unfortunately people
he shouldn't of trusted

00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.010
and he should've micromanaged if it
were and so we have to fault them

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.710
at times for not understanding
fully,

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.960
he also had a deep DNA of loyalty.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.010
So people who had been loyal to
him, he then became loyal to them

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.900
and he should've looked
more closely.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.540
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:20.470
about presidents we never hear
anything about, is Hayes, Harrison,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.400
Pierce, Grover Cleveland.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.930
Is it really possible that there no
great stories there or is it simply

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:31.030
that the publishing industry
won't publish books about people

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.810
who are perceived to be failures.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.600
&gt;&gt; White: Both.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.990
I'm sure there are great stories,

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:40.570
I mean Candace Millard wrote
this wonderful book on Destiny

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.030
of the Republic and the
story of James Garfield,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.910
now she does this one little
way, she always does it

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.750
where she has alternating stories
about that, he's doing great things

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.190
and the physicians are killing him

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.540
by the way they're trying
to treat his wounds.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.940
So Garfield if he had lived
probably would've become one

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.490
of our better presidents.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.570
So I think that our
stories out there,

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.710
I mean there are various often
presidential present series

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.390
where people try to lift up these
ones, I'm not prepared to sort

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.060
of say, well of all these
this is the next one

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.050
but yeah I think we need the press
from time to time take fresh looks

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.730
at these people, yeah good comment.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.120
&gt;&gt; Shogan: We have time
for one more question.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.420
&gt;&gt; White: Okay.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.720
&gt;&gt; Grant in both his army career

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.030
and also the presidency had
trouble dealing with people

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.230
who were horse trader types
political bend and economic bend,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.990
can you talk a little bit
about how his inability to deal

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:40.300
with those individuals ranks
relative to his overall legacy.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.960
&gt;&gt; White: Good question.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.430
My tipping of the balance
I think is try to point

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.020
of the very positive things
that Grant that as president,

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.910
but I didn't want to
minimize what he didn't do,

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.120
I also think another factor in
this perhaps was that Grant did not

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.740
like confrontation maybe this
is another quality of introvert,

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.510
I'm not quite sure, and so he
didn't like to confront people

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.120
and he probably should've
confronted.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.870
Now sometimes he did, I
mean William Rosecrans

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.030
who probably would've been voted
most likely to succeed in his class

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.140
at West Point why Grant
did confront him

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.260
and did let other people know
Rosecrans is not the person

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.300
that should be leading our
Army whether wherever he is,

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:28.560
but Grant should have been more of
a leader in this but that to me,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.350
because when Grant retired
from the presidency in 1877,

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.130
he could've won a third term,

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.350
the scandals in his day did
not diminish his popularity,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.820
he was incredibly popular, he
almost won another term in 1880,

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.540
he came very close to it when
he came back from his world tour

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.440 position:56%
and if he had went to the convention
floor as Julia urged him to do,

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.510
he would have won the
nomination over James Garfield.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.290
So I wanted to say,
how did the people

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.660
of his day assessed the scandals

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:03.320
and assessed his overall
popularity and achievement?

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:08.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shogan: Dr. White will be signing
books downstairs on the Expo floor,

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.270
