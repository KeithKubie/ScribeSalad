WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.040
So He'd come back here where you see you at another case. Oh, in this early. Oh,

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.380
what is, what are those? Hairs are stride muscle. Oh,

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.450
that's muscle closest I can, the closest thing I can say is, uh,

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
the muscle dries out. So we get stringy and shredded. Okay. Where are we?

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.560
Let's actually, let's just start from the beginning. Okay. So, so we are in,

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.650
what, what room is this again? We're in this special procedures room. Okay.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.190
Pima county office of the medical examiner.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.560
And what we're looking at here is a case, uh, mostly skeletal remains.

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.390
So we have, uh, we have a skull, we have a few, we have some parts of the spine,

10
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.170
spine it looks like. And then just to add all three,

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.180
all three major bones of the lower limb. So the two, five bones,

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
the femurs and the two tibias and the to a fibrillate. We know,

13
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.340
we know it's the male, he's an adult. Okay. 20 to 30 to 40 year old, uh,

14
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.810
uh, migrant. It came in in late January,

15
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.811
early February and animals found him maybe 50% of his skeleton is missing his

16
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:05.884
upper limbs.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.800
And his pelvis and most of his spine are missing in his hands and feet are

18
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:12.400
missing. We have evidence here that a vulture was feeding,

19
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.490
was feeding on the person. I don't know if this is,

20
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.760
it's a beetle that's a domestic beetle. It's called a hype beetle.

21
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.530
There they're found globally.

22
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.520
And these Hyde beetles specialize in eating dry hard tissue.

23
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.890
So He's, he's still leading. Yes, he is. Wow. He was in the body bag.

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.920
He and his colony would have been on the body wow. In the body bag. And, uh,

25
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.840
although we try to get most of them off during our exam,

26
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.910
you can see there's lots of little crevices where a single bug could, could be.

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.260
Wow. Oh, wow. That's so, yeah. Wow.

28
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.690
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.630
<v 2>I'm Chad. I'm Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.</v>

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.410
And today we present the final episode of our border trilogy with Redis.

31
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.440
There's lots of Nasir and Tracy Hunt, and this is episode three,

32
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.870
which we're calling what remains.

33
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.070
<v 3>Yeah. Okay. So just to catch everyone up, here's a lot of, uh,</v>

34
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.680
the person I was just talking to, his name is Bruce Anderson.

35
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.000
He's a forensic anthropologist.

36
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.210
At the Pima County Office of the medical examiner in Arizona,

37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.240
which is aware when they find a body of a unidentified migrant in the Sonoran

38
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:27.190
desert. That's where they bring them.

39
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.990
And Bruce had been working there, you know,

40
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.590
on and off since the 1980s.

41
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.770
But he told me that it was only in the early two thousands that he started

42
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:36.940
seeing, you know,

43
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.910
just more and more and more of these migrant bodies being brought in

44
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.030
<v 0>and we're just crushed by the weight of all the dead and all the missing persons</v>

45
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.050
reports and uh, you know, you're,

46
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.240
it's like working a mass disaster when people are still dying and planes are

47
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.920
still crashing around you and you,

48
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.220
you throw your hands up in the air sometimes and you just think once again to

49
00:02:57.221 --> 00:02:58.054
stop

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.090
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

51
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 3>and it hasn't stopped. The number of bodies found last year.</v>

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.930
It was in the same range as the year before the number of people crossing.

53
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:09.570
It did go down after Donald Trump's inauguration,

54
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.190
but traffic is basically rebounded.

55
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
So people are still coming through the desert. They're not being deterred,

56
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.470
which made us wonder, is deterrence,

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.740
that fundamental idea behind our current border policy?

58
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.340
Is it even possible now? In some ways, that's a policy question,

59
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.720
which we talked about in our last episode, but it's also a human question.

60
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.090
Is Jason still there? I'm still here.

61
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.120
And that's what led us back to the person who we started this whole journey

62
00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:42.320
with. The anthropologist Jason Deleon. All right. Can you hear lots of too?

63
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.140
I sure can't. Good morning. Oh, good morning. Fantastic. Well,

64
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.330
I feel like maybe we should just start off where we left off,

65
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.190
which is that you were going to tell us the story of, of Maricella.

66
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.540
Sure. Um, when was this, by the way? This would have been July,

67
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.980
June of 2012. Okay.

68
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.690
So we had been about two weeks into the pig experiment and this is a series of

69
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.860
experiments where Jason and his team, mostly students, uh,

70
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.730
looked at how pigs decompose in a desert in order to understand how people be

71
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:14.660
composed in the desert.

72
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.440
And it wasn't until about two weeks into this experiment where we were out

73
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:23.420
hiking one day with a group of about nine people down in southern Arizona.

74
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.920
And so on this particular day on this trail that I had hiked many, many times,

75
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.790
a student had run ahead to check stuff out and was taking pictures of us.

76
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.960
As we were walking up this hill,

77
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.080
<v 4>he turns around, starts yelling at us, he says, Hey, you got to come up here.</v>

78
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.850
Something has happened. So I threw my backpack down and at race up this hill.

79
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.430
And by the time I get up there, I see that,

80
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.110
that he's kind of staring at this body that's just laying face down in the,

81
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.750
in the dirt on this, on this trail. Like a fully intact body. Yeah.

82
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.640
A woman's body. You could tell it was a woman because she had long hair. Um,

83
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.550
you know, she's wearing camouflage clothes, stretch pants,

84
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.420
women's running shoes on. She's got a scrunchie around her wrist.

85
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.040
But the rest of it, I mean, her body was incredibly bloated.

86
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.400
I mean to the point where it looked like it was about to, um,

87
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.500
to pop from all of the gasses that had built up inside of her, her body cavity.

88
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.530
I didn't know what to do at this point. I mean, you know,

89
00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:21.950
this student's start walking up. I mean, these are young students.

90
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.360
We had someone in the group who was 18, 19. For some of the students,

91
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.530
<v 3>first time they've seen a dead body, one of them was crying.</v>

92
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.900
<v 4>I tell everyone, I say, hey look,</v>

93
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.800
you got to go sit down and give me a second here to figure out what,

94
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.650
what it is we're going to do here. So first he called the police.

95
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.230
We did that and then we've kind of had a conversation,

96
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.680
are we going to photograph this person? Are we going to record any information?

97
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.330
Is this, are we still doing research right now?

98
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.150
<v 3>And Jason decided, yeah, we should, we should document.</v>

99
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.640
<v 4>You know,</v>

100
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.130
we took some notes down gray to green discoloration about what she was wearing,

101
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.790
brown to black discoloration of arms and legs. Took some pictures of the body,

102
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.160
her fingers. I've started to curl,

103
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.700
her ankles are swollen to the point that our sneakers seem ready to pop off.

104
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.830
There's a steady hissing of intestinal gases.

105
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.340
And then it just got to the point where I was like, okay, this is enough.

106
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.720
I don't want to do this anymore.

107
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.670
<v 3>And so they covered her with a blanket because Jason noticed the birds circling</v>

108
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:16.650
overhead for Turkey vultures.

109
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.190
And so at that point they just sort of sat down and waited for the police to

110
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:24.840
come. The sheriff, an hour went by, two, three, four,

111
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.950
just waiting with the body.

112
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.470
It was about five hours in that a sheriff and three border patrol agents show up

113
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.670
and they had hiked three miles to get to Jason with a stretcher.

114
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.000
And so they bring the stretcher, um,

115
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.260
the sheriff puts on gloves, he asks them a few questions like,

116
00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:44.940
did you guys put the blanket on there?

117
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.130
And then they roll her into this white body bag. And as the authorities do that,

118
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.340
Jason, because she was faced down,

119
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.840
Jason gets to see her face for the first time.

120
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.680
And so he writes a paragraph in his book and it's pretty gruesome,

121
00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:01.920
but I'm gonna, I'm gonna read to you the paragraph that he,

122
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.610
he writes about in his book as her body turns,

123
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.230
I see what is left of her face.

124
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.830
It is frightening and unrecognizable as human.

125
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.310
The mouth is a gnarled purple on a black hole.

126
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.350
<v 4>Obscure red rest feature. These jurors,</v>

127
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.770
I can't see her eyes because the mouth is too hard to look away from.

128
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.030
The skin around the lips is stretched out of shape as though it had been melted.

129
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.580
Her nose is smashed in and pushed up.

130
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.160
She died face down and the flesh on the front side of her skull has soften and

131
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.710
contorted to fit around the dirt and rocks beneath her.

132
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.820
The scene is a pastiche of metallic gray and Pea Green.

133
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.220
Whatever beauty in humanity that once existed in her face has been replaced by a

134
00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:47.100
stone colored ghoul stuck in mid screen.

135
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.460
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.940
<v 3>it's a look you can never get away from. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.530
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

138
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.610
<v 3>after this thing had happened and it really just shook me in a lot of different</v>

139
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.910
ways. Jason says he just couldn't shake the question.

140
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.410
Who was this woman? How did she end up face down in the desert?

141
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.570
So that night I remember Jason Calling me, Jason called a friend of his,

142
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.570
a woman named Robin Ryan Nikki and being really clearly shaken and you know,

143
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.810
asking for advice, Robin actually runs this nonprofit in Tucson called

144
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.080
the Colibri Center for Human Rights Calibers Center for Human Rights.

145
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.410
And they do a lot of work with the missing and with bodies that had been

146
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.920
recovered. So Jason tells her, look, we've today we had this, this thing,

147
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:36.560
we found this person out here and could you help us id her.

148
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.253
Now the thing is,

149
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.490
Robin's office is actually in the medical examiner's office.

150
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:48.491
So that means that just down the hall from Robin is the Guy we met at the

151
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.160
beginning. Bruce Anderson, a couple hundred people,

152
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.440
or at least bones of a person are in here.

153
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.870
So Bruce is working on the medical examiners side.

154
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.110
So anytime an unidentified migrant body comes in,

155
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:05.190
Bruce tries to piece together who this person is looking at the dimensions in

156
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:08.660
the shape of the skull and markers, robustness of the bones.

157
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.590
I like looking at the length of the bones or the density of the bones by the non

158
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.430
fusion of these separate bones.

159
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.400
Looking at whether some bones in the body or fuse teams gather,

160
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.230
which is something that happens right after puberty.

161
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.490
Bruce can actually figure out approximately what age the person is, what gender,

162
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.450
height, weight. And in the case of the woman that Jason found,

163
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.490
her body was surprisingly in relatively good condition. So pretty quickly,

164
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.270
uh, they were able to determine, you know, she's probably in her thirties,

165
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:40.270
she's five foot before they were actually able to get fingerprints from her as

166
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:45.070
well. Meanwhile, on the other side, on Robin's side.

167
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.430
Wow. So each of these tabs is a person, is that right? Yeah,

168
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.450
she's dealing with hundreds of missing persons report all day. Every day.

169
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.560
She spends her days taking calls, going through voicemail

170
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.370
<v 5>full of relative searching. I'm looking for my uncle.</v>

171
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.650
He disappeared in 2010 or I'm looking for my daughter, she crossed, um,

172
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.420
two weeks ago. We haven't heard from her yet

173
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.980
<v 3>and she's also getting tips from different people,</v>

174
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.390
different aid organizations and it's actually one of those calls that leads to a

175
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:15.690
break in the case of the body that Jason found.

176
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.620
<v 5>Huh. Okay.</v>

177
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.600
So this is an email from me from 2012 hi Jason.

178
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:23.910
Just a quick update regarding the woman that your group found.

179
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.140
The case number is 12 1567 and as of yet she's not been identified.

180
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.050
<v 3>Robin tells Jason that she got a call from an aid organization that had spoken</v>

181
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:37.370
to a guy who had crossed the desert with a big group of people around the same

182
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:41.240
time and around the same area where Jason found the body.

183
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.470
<v 5>He said that he had recently left behind to fellow travelers who were in serious</v>

184
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:46.490
medical distress.

185
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.120
<v 3>He's had, one of them was an elderly man,</v>

186
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.040
70 years old and the other was a woman maybe from Guatemala or Ecuador,

187
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.690
late thirties early forties.

188
00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.020
<v 5>It isn't certain that this group is related to ml 1215, 67,</v>

189
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:04.040
but it's highly likely I will contact Guatemalan and Ecuador and consulates

190
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.170
regarding new missing persons cases

191
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.760
<v 3>and eventually using all the information that got gathered,</v>

192
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.570
Robin was able to determine that the body that Jason found,

193
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.280
it's the body of a 31 year old Ecuadorian woman named [inaudible]

194
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.723
<v 5>Maricela Aki Poi. Yeah.</v>

195
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.350
<v 3>Maricella Zag. We yes. Um,</v>

196
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.710
Robin gets in touch with Jason and tell him Jason and asks her,

197
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.310
I would just would appreciate if you could, um, you know,

198
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.470
help me at all connect with this family.

199
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.693
<v 6>Mm MM.</v>

200
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.920
<v 3>Does that request would oddly enough lead Jason to New York City.</v>

201
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.270
That story in just a moment.

202
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.023
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.560
<v 7>Hey, it's me from Cincinnati, Ohio.</v>

204
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.570

208
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.090
We are back with the third installment of our border trilogy. What remains.

209
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.190
And when we left Jason,

210
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.170
along with Robin from the Kolibri Center had managed to id the body of the woman

211
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:27.220
he found in the desert.

212
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.160
And so now he was trying to get in touch with her family.

213
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.290
I don't know when people disappear when they die in the desert.

214
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:35.680
I think that the families make up lots of stories went through people's heads.

215
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.050
And so I was hoping that if I could find this person's family,

216
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.660
I could at least say, this is what it was like when we found her. Um,

217
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.300
this is what we think had happened.

218
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.590
So Robin was eventually able to get Jason to contact information for Marty

219
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.960
Stella's brother-in-law, who we'll call Fernando.

220
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.780
And I make the awkward phone call that says, Hey,

221
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.320
I'm the person that found mighty cell on the desert. Um,

222
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.780
and I would like to come and see you if that's possible.

223
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.010
<v 8>Turns out Fernando actually lives in New York City,</v>

224
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.120
but he had spoken to Maricella just before she left.

225
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.160
And when we heard his story, we decided, okay,

226
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.110
we've got to send a reporter Tracy Hunt. You're here to talk with him.

227
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.730
<v 9>Oh yes.</v>

228
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:21.280
I went to visit Fernando at his apartment in Queens.

229
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.900
He lives there with his three dogs, friendly guy, little shorter than neat,

230
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.580
neatly dressed. He's got, you know, dark hair longer on the top,

231
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.290
shorter on the sides. And

232
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.580
when I got there, he,

233
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.560
he pulled out a bunch of photos and Maddie Cela and molecule.

234
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.970
So this is their marriage, their wedding photos. Hey

235
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.200
[inaudible] she was his brother's wife.

236
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.710
They look so young where they 19 and again name [inaudible].

237
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.920
So in this picture that Fernando showing me, it's his brother and Marcella,

238
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.750
they're in a church and they're posing at the alter cheese in a white setting

239
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.550
gown and her hair is long and dark and shiny and she's got kind of like an oval

240
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:13.690
shaped face. And um, you know, she, she looks beautiful,

241
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:15.940
but even though it's her wedding day,

242
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.120
the thing that struck me is that she's not smiling,

243
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.140
not even a little bit is she, was he like, was she serious like that?

244
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.710
<v 8>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

245
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.680
actually that's part of the reason why my mother said she didn't like her as

246
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:33.520
much in the beginning. [inaudible]. She said,

247
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.790
you know, she always has an angry face zone.

248
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.970
She looks like somebody who doesn't have a lot

249
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.340
<v 9>friends. And on top of that,</v>

250
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.480
Fernando says she also had a habit of getting his brother in trouble.

251
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.431
<v 8>[inaudible] you know,</v>

252
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:51.160
she would tell my brother to sneak out of the house to go see her.

253
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.340
Last few years, I think dancing parties were permission, you know,

254
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.080
those kinds of things. But

255
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.090
[inaudible] she eventually won the family over. She helped out at home.

256
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.390
She treated my mom really well, especially his mother. [inaudible]

257
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.580
actually, I think my mother loved her more than she loved us.

258
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.780
[inaudible] Fernando's brother, they got married.

259
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.290
They ended up having three kids, two boys and a girl.

260
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.520
Marcella had a job in a factory that made kind of fit jeans,

261
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.640
I think Levi's and Fernando's brother.

262
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.670
He would go around to different villages selling sodas and they just kind of

263
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:38.570
really managed to make ends meet. They were living real rough at the time.

264
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.290
I mean going when I went to the house and saw where they had lived. So Jason,

265
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.020
after he connected with Fernando,

266
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.370
he actually ended up going down to Ecuador to meet Marcella's family before she

267
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:52.880
had left. I mean they were living in a one room plywood,

268
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.150
Shaq with a dirt floor and animals running,

269
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:59.900
running through the house and you know, and she had told her, her relatives,

270
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.140
she's like, look, my kids are literally starving here. So

271
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.310
[inaudible] at the time I wasn't able to help out as much financially because I

272
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:13.340
was also helping build a house for my parents where they were also going to go

273
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:14.174
live.

274
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.830
And so I wasn't able to support them as much or help out with things like school

275
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.180
[inaudible] and so, you know, which she really wanted to do, you know,

276
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:25.460
in order to like send your kids to school and all that.

277
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:26.690
She really wanted them to have,

278
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:30.710
which she never had to go new Canada cause she never had anything.

279
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.220
And so that was really the pressure that she was under.

280
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.860
So Fernando says in 2012 he called home

281
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.970
[inaudible] one time when I call home,

282
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:46.880
my mom said that she wanted to talk to me. So I said, okay.

283
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.540
Marisol got on the phone and she told me that she wanted to come here.

284
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.620
She told him that she and his brother, they want it to follow in his footsteps,

285
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.340
that if they could come to New York like he had, they could make money,

286
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.270
send it back home and help out their kids. But that was the only way.

287
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.330
And immediately Fernando was like [inaudible] no can, no can.

288
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.180
Absolutely not.

289
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.480
So Fernando told her no,

290
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:17.690
because he didn't want her to go through the same thing.

291
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:22.691
He went through 10 years before when I had gone to [inaudible] 2001 he was 17

292
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.511
years old.

293
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:31.511
I'm about to turn 18 and his aunt was about to go to New York and she convinced

294
00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:38.060
him and his parents that if he went to New York, he'd be able to get a job,

295
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.110
make more money,

296
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.490
and support his family and from there have a better life to have things we

297
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:48.170
needed. So my father thought about it and gave his permission,

298
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.370
but he told not to stay here too long.

299
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.460
<v 9>And so he used his grandfather's land as collateral and took out a loan for</v>

300
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:59.490
$12,000 $12,000 yeah.

301
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.050
Do you know what the interest rate was on the loan? 10% 10% yeah.

302
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.990
So one thing that a lot of people have talked about is the fact that prevention

303
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.910
through deterrence,

304
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.070
it professionalized the human smuggling business because not only the,

305
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.370
these migraines need, you know,

306
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.850
guidance from all these south and Central American countries.

307
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.310
They also need guidance through the desert.

308
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.370
So now you have the smuggling business that's more expensive and also more

309
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:26.934
dangerous.

310
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.710
<v 8>Oh No. [inaudible] yes.</v>

311
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.200
So the [inaudible] told us that 15 days maximum to get here.

312
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.980
<v 9>Fernando says he and his aunt took a bus from Ecuador to Peru and then from Peru</v>

313
00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:40.150
they flew to Panama.

314
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.680
<v 8>And those are going to the [inaudible]?</v>

315
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.040
<v 9>No, got an another bus.</v>

316
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.270
I is he into base eight equitable somewhere in Costa Rica.

317
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.270
<v 8>I remember the path and really mountainous. There was river, all that.</v>

318
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.720
<v 9>This bus pulls over and the coyote who was with them at that point just said,</v>

319
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.770
<v 8>okay, you have to get off here. [inaudible] and [inaudible]. When we got out,</v>

320
00:19:02.771 --> 00:19:06.820
they took our luggage and they threw them on the ground towards the river and

321
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:07.241
they said,

322
00:19:07.241 --> 00:19:09.970
you have to cross the river and someone will find you there and signal to that

323
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:10.804
person.

324
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.070
[inaudible] we were left there like that with my aunt saying, hold on.

325
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:22.090
That wasn't the deal. The deal was to take us all the way to Mexico and cars,

326
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.740
but from that point [inaudible] when we started crossing mountains on foot

327
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.250
[inaudible], that's when horrible things started to happen.

328
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.080
<v 9>From that point on, they were packed into the trunks of taxis,</v>

329
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:35.520
hidden and basements,

330
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.530
chicken coops and hut totally filled with rats and three months into this

331
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:41.364
journey,

332
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.110
a journey that was supposed to take just 15 days somewhere in Mexico.

333
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.750
Fernando says that he and his honor are taken to this rundown. Hacienda,

334
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.440
this just sprawling ranch house inside the ranch house.

335
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.860
<v 8>IBM merged. They don't see it as in Quanta personas. I, yeah,</v>

336
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.970
they were more than 250 people there at those babies have yet knows from all

337
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:08.400
over the world, 10 years Central Americans from every country,

338
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.290
from all over South America, America,

339
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.080
<v 9>there's all these rooms filled with people.</v>

340
00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:17.890
And Fernando actually says that there were all these armed guards all over the

341
00:20:17.891 --> 00:20:18.724
place.

342
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.900
<v 8>Nobody was allowed to leave</v>

343
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.650
[inaudible] and so we were um,

344
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.430
cause you miss instead of [inaudible] Penn in there for about a month, went into

345
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.890
[inaudible] [inaudible] some pedal. And while he was there,

346
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.950
this part I didn't tell Jason what happened to me there. I email,

347
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.710
I was on the [inaudible] main thing. I was abused sexually.

348
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.620
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

349
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.230
<v 9>Fernando says that he was sitting outside of the Hacienda when they,</v>

350
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:48.160
with his aunt,

351
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.290
when a group of men approached him and told him that he had to go inside with

352
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:58.180
them. And he said no, that he was fine sitting there, you know,

353
00:20:58.181 --> 00:20:59.014
outside

354
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.720
<v 8>[inaudible] can only let me sit on another mic.</v>

355
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.770
[inaudible] begged me to hurt them to please not abuse me or do anything to me.

356
00:21:09.771 --> 00:21:11.600
And they said, no,

357
00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:15.110
don't worry that that they only wanted to ask some questions inside,

358
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.700
but that that wasn't what they wanted.

359
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.320
<v 9>They told Fernando, look,</v>

360
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.430
you can come at this now or you can come at this later after we beat up your

361
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.180
aunts.

362
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.920
So finally Fernando relented and went with them and when they got inside the

363
00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.660
Hacienda, they went into a room

364
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.280
<v 8>[inaudible] and once we were inside [inaudible] I was out on the me.</v>

365
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.890
He raped me three times

366
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.830
and Kamasi's like six

367
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.700
[inaudible]. After that I went to etomidate. I just wanted to die.

368
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.160
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

369
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.300
<v 9>after a couple of weeks,</v>

370
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.010
Fernando and his od finally got out of this Hacienda and they start their trek

371
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:04.080
into the desert. Fernando,

372
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.210
things that he went through the same desert that Monticello would try to cross

373
00:22:09.211 --> 00:22:10.044
10 years later,

374
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.100
he's actually caught by the border patrol and held for about a month before he

375
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:18.480
manages to bail himself out of detention and make his way to New York.

376
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.430
And Fernanda says he shared all of this with mighty Selah except his own rape.

377
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.410
But he did tell her that migrants do get raped. See that?

378
00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.420
He's seen it happen that he knows it happens.

379
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.140
<v 8>[inaudible] when I told her all of that,</v>

380
00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:36.480
she said none of that would happen to her.

381
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.620
She knew how to defend herself and you know if she had to, she would hit people

382
00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.410
<v 9>and then he told her you might have to go without food or asleep outside,</v>

383
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.693
but

384
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.090
<v 8>okay [inaudible] get that.</v>

385
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.630
She said that didn't matter that all that mattered was getting here because the

386
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:53.890
kids are the ones that matter most.

387
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.790
Any sacrifice made is where worth they for your kids

388
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.660
<v 9>and then he doesn't talk to her anymore. That's,</v>

389
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.810
that's actually the last phone call they ever have because he thinks that if he

390
00:23:05.811 --> 00:23:08.000
cuts her off, maybe she'll just give up.

391
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.890
But she goes to one of her brothers and her brother says that he would only pay

392
00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:15.500
for her to go, but he's not going to pay for her husband to go.

393
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.230
When you found out that she was going to come by herself,

394
00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:20.520
did you tie to tell your brother, look, she, he, she,

395
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.830
you shouldn't let her come here by yourself. Come at all. Sure.

396
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.580
<v 8>See [inaudible] yeah. Yeah.</v>

397
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.390
I called my brother said that there wasn't another option and that he wanted to

398
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:32.141
go first,

399
00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:37.141
but her brother had put the condition that she go first and because they didn't

400
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:39.130
have another option. She said she would go

401
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.810
<v 9>in May of 2012 Maddie cellar left Ecuador about three weeks later.</v>

402
00:23:44.811 --> 00:23:46.700
Right before she walked into the desert.

403
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.290
Marisella sent her family a message on Facebook. She told them,

404
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.160
I don't know how I'm going to get there, but I am going for my family.

405
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.110
God willing, I will get there.

406
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.430
<v 8>When did you finally hear that actually happened to her? A</v>

407
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.790
[inaudible]. Someone called me. Yeah,

408
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.820
I knew you told me they were from the consulate and I said, okay.

409
00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:12.410
Finally she's been found and then they told me you're the UK.

410
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.080
[inaudible] was dead and they didn't know what they exactly,

411
00:24:19.081 --> 00:24:21.870
she died with that she'd been dead for about a month except

412
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.420
[inaudible]. It was just really

413
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.480
difficult. Wondering if I'm going to do more damage than, than good bye.

414
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.580
Bye Bye bye. Calling to meet these folks.

415
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.560
<v 3>Eight months after Marcel is death.</v>

416
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.240
Jason came to New York to meet Fernando and he brought with him the pictures of

417
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.810
Marcel, his body that he took when he, when he found her in the desert,

418
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.301
<v 8>you know,</v>

419
00:24:48.301 --> 00:24:51.690
he was like just right now show me the photos and I was just dancing around that

420
00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:53.370
for for over an hour.

421
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.320
[inaudible] and Jason warned that the photos were really upsetting.

422
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.550
It was so many like that,

423
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.780
but I said that it's okay to show them to me and I give him this book of photos

424
00:25:06.781 --> 00:25:10.860
that I've printed out and it's got pictures of this shrine that we built for her

425
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.210
in the desert.

426
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.860
It's got pictures of my students who were there and then eventually it's just

427
00:25:16.861 --> 00:25:19.140
pictures of like the back of her head. So it's her hair,

428
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.170
it's some of the clothing is hits her hand.

429
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.470
[inaudible] I saw all the photos and the truth is that it told me two pieces to

430
00:25:28.471 --> 00:25:32.790
see or imagine everything she had to endure in the desert.

431
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.480
<v 11>[inaudible].</v>

432
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.190
<v 8>She tried to keep going, dragging herself a</v>

433
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.060
[inaudible] brought me photos of how she was found in her body outstretched,

434
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.120
trying to keep going.

435
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.450
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

436
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.120
<v 9>before Mary cell, his body was sent back to Ecuador.</v>

437
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.420
Fernanda decided they should have it sent to New York. First

438
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.900
<v 8>don't say is, I'm say you're</v>

439
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.950
[inaudible] so when I talk to my family, I said, you know,

440
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.430
her dream was really to arrive here and so I thought at least we can fulfill

441
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:23.140
that dream with her body by your

442
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.710
[inaudible] to be able to have to have a wake for her here.

443
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.360
<v 9>They held awake at a funeral home in Queens.</v>

444
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.130
Almost a hundred family members and friends came to celebrate Marcella's life.

445
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.800
They were told to keep the coffin shut.

446
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.010
<v 8>The next day</v>

447
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.630
<v 9>her body went back to Ecuador.</v>

448
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.390
Fernando had to stay in New York because he knows if he were to go back to

449
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:55.560
Ecuador, it would just be way too hard to try to come back to the United States.

450
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.660
He says that, you know, right now he's just trying to fulfill a promise

451
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.060
[inaudible] promise that I made to Marcella's body when it arrived here that I

452
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:07.560
was going to look after her children.

453
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.640
I was going to try to give them what she had wanted for them.

454
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.070
When you think about that conversation,

455
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:20.370
do you think that there's anything you could've said that would have made her

456
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:21.204
stay

457
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.370
[inaudible] told her what could happen along the way?

458
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.570
[inaudible] I thought that would be a way of deterring her.

459
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.230
[inaudible] no, no, no.

460
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.540
<v 11>A</v>

461
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.070
[inaudible] [inaudible]

462
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.340
<v 3>and it's worth pointing out. Uh, you know,</v>

463
00:27:55.341 --> 00:28:00.050
I mean more generally prevention through deterrence as a, as a, as a strategy.

464
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.730
It hasn't deterred people from coming to the u s either. Uh,

465
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.760
the annual budget for the border patrol is roughly three point $5 billion bigger

466
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:14.981
than it was in 1990 we have about five times as many border patrol agents and

467
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.270
yet the number of pupil immigrants living here,

468
00:28:20.271 --> 00:28:24.980
undocumented has more than tripled during that time from three and a half

469
00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:26.630
million to a body.

470
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.370
11 million and more people are coming every year, every day.

471
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.130
And more people are dying along the way.

472
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.000
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

473
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.750
<v 12>yeah, look, we'll do it here. About a year after Maricella</v>

474
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.400
<v 3>died, Jason got a call from her family</v>

475
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.600
<v 12>again. Do you want, um, do you want maverick or iceman? Yep.</v>

476
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.100
And get the name of the drones guys are top gun thing.

477
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.910
<v 3>Another family member had disappeared in pretty much the same place Maricella</v>

478
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:03.500
did.

479
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.280
<v 12>So which is this? I think that's, that's maverick Navarik I'm going back to the,</v>

480
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.840
to the Arizona desert basically because Marcella has a, um,

481
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.010
had a cousin who,

482
00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:17.930
a 15 year old cousin named Jose [inaudible] who disappeared almost one year to

483
00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:18.890
the day that she died.

484
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:28.690
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

485
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.560
<v 12>um, I was able to kind of triangulate based on interviews with people who he was</v>

486
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.500
with and with information from, um,

487
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.170
from various folks where we think he went missing. I mean,

488
00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:39.200
I told his mom that I would not stop looking and um,

489
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.630
it took me a couple of years to figure out a, to, to, to, to do that.

490
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.220
Um, but right now it's, we'll go back and we'll use these drones and,

491
00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:48.490
and see what we can come up with.

492
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.010
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

493
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.430
<v 12>and you know better than anyone who, what happens to bodies in the desert now?</v>

494
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:06.040
I think, I mean,

495
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.940
why are you still looking for him or why, you know? Yeah,

496
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.640
as callous as that question sounds. I guess for me,

497
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:16.870
part of it is I just don't know what else to do. If you feel so hopeless.

498
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.190
I told his mom like, I won't, I won't stop looking for him.

499
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:23.800
I'll do whatever I can, whatever little thing that I can do.

500
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.520
And if I can't find him, well maybe I'll find somebody else

501
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.080
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

502
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.370
<v 12>mad at me now. So we will was,</v>

503
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.610
it's getting mad at me cause it's run out of batteries.

504
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.920
<v 10>Well do you want to do one more?</v>
