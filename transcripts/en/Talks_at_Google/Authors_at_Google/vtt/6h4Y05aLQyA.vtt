[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.990
ANGELA FORD: Thank you.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.630
Let's get right to it.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.990
The Obsidian Collection--
the term obsidian

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.070
comes from a volcanic rock.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.630
It's a dark glass
that's formed when

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.170
lava and dirt, certain
explosions, all of that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.790
come about.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.168
So there are lots of
obsidian around Hawaii

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:26.960
and other places where
there are volcanoes.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.370
I love the name because I think
that's what black culture is--

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.210
beautiful, black, shiny formed
from high pressure, heat, et

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.320
cetera.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.570
And that's what we're doing--

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.910
The Obsidian Collection, we're
collecting the black archives.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930
But more than just that,
we're digitizing them

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.180
and making them available
for younger generations.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.040
And as I started the
project just a little bit

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.080
over three years ago, we were
asked, why are you doing that?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.560
There's already archive groups
that are collecting history,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.630
the universities
are collecting it,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.910
and we got that big, beautiful
new black Smithsonian in DC,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.170
so why do you need to form
The Obsidian Collection?

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.510
And I think I can best
communicate that in telling you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.390
about my love of football.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.380
Now, I know.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.370
It's going to work
its way back around.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
But I love football.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.000
I love Chicago Bears football.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.010
And I can tell you, from when
I was five to seven years old,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.260
my dad's friends
would come over,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.470
we had a giant floor
model TV, and they

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.360
would let me get the
beer and they would

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.770
let me empty the ashtrays.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.590
Now, this is the
late 60s, early 70s,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.500
so beer cans were
made of what I would

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.910
think was solid titanium
steel and the ashtrays

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.590
were these huge
ceramic platters.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.360
So my responsibility
was important.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870
I remember the
screens being green,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
there being white
lines on the screen,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.630
people would crash
into each other,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.670
and then my father
and his friends

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.580
would either cheer or jeer.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.840
And it was football.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.447
And I love football.

00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:16.280
Now, fast forward, I
started seeing football

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.220
throughout my life and I
know how football works.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.320
The X's and O's line up, then
they crash into each other.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.320
And then somebody
throws in a yellow towel

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.290
and then people stand around
like this and then they wait

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.840
and then the guys in the stripes
come out and do some things.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.670
And then they either say
this way or they say that way

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.490
and then you cheer or jeer.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.640
Now I've been watching
football my whole life.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.740
I would argue with
you that I love

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.450
football just like
any other American

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.570
and I love the Chicago Bears,
I'm a native Chicagoan.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.380
But imagine if I was the
curator of the Chicago Bears.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.230
I would put together an
exhibit and it would be

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.700
all of the collisions, right?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.980
Because that's what
they kind of do,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.330
they run into each other a lot.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.990
They line up, and then
they run into each other.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.320
And then somebody
throws the towel--

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.580
I've seen it.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.600
So, what I would do is I
would have an exhibit of all

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.760
the collisions.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
And then I would have another
exhibit of the towels,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
because they went from
a mustard and then they

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.870
started being more yellow--

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.560
I do remember that.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.520
And then I know in some
of the bigger games,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.640
they pour containers
of water on each other

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.780
at the end of big wins--

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.520
I do know that too.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.220
It doesn't make a lot of sense,
but that happens in football--

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.080
and I love football.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.570
So one of my exhibits is going
to be all the coolers of water

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.390
dunking on people because
that's football to me

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.640
and I love football.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.680
Now, somebody who actually likes
football would go to my exhibit

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.940
and inside of 15 seconds
they would go, what is this?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.940
And this isn't football,
there are layers to football

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.600
and there's a whole ecosystem
and culture around football.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.899
And this isn't football.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.860
And that's what happens with
a lot of African Americans

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.170
that walk into an exhibit
and go, what is this?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.970
It's people who just
focus on the collisions.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.780
So you just hear picket,
protests, slave, struggle--

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.580
and it's like, look, there
are layers to this thing.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.770
This isn't the sum total
of the black experience.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.080
And just like me with
football, and this is true

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.730
because that is my
understanding of football,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.820
I would say, well,
explain football to me.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.940
And then people who
know football like Luke

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.930
you just don't know football and
you can't be in charge of it.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.910
It's OK that you
think you love it

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.570
or whatever your association
is with it, that's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.270
not the sum total of football.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.210
And I remember my
senior year of college,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.750
the Bears went to
the Super Bowl.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.270
And I watched it with everybody
and again, they lined up--

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.850
I don't know what
the problem is,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.330
because that's what happened--

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.550
they lined up, there was a
snap, somebody ran this way,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.420
they ran into each other,
somebody threw in the towel.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.060
This is what I
see and I love it,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.920
but I loved
everything around it.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.850
I'm football adjacent.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.410
I should not be in charge of
telling the story of football.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.120
So, it was then when one of
my friends said after we won--

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.400
I know we won, I do know that,
that we won that Super Bowl.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.870
One of my friends
said, who do you

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.980
think is going to be the MVP?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.240
I didn't know what an
MVP was, but everybody

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.700
burst into conversation
and they started

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.280
discussing these plays
and these little nuances

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.703
and all of this other stuff.

00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:15.370
And that's when I
realized, I don't know

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.110
what they're talking about.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.690
And that's how black culture is.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.290
You can be adjacent
and you can love it,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.640
but there's a lot
of layers to it.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.730
And it's important that there
be an independent, free-standing

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.800
organization run by black
people to curate that story.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.464
Because we can walk
into an exhibit and go--

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:44.890
I get it, it's a protest,
struggle, a slave,

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.820
it's a lynching--

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.680
it's like that's
all that's there.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.510
So it's important for us
to take the narrative back

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.400
and that's what The Obsidian
Collection is doing.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.410
So, we started with
The Chicago Defender.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.000
Now, many people
know, and I don't

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.208
want to preach to the choir,
but The Chicago Defender

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:07.030
started in 1904 and it's
essential to black history

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.160
because as we were
freed as slaves,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.310
people wanted to
start migrating away.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.810
And The Chicago Defender was
different from other newspapers

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.070
and they took the initiative
to actually start getting

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.470
these newspapers down south.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.080
So they partnered with
the Pullman porters

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.770
and the Pullman porters were,
in a way to make extra money,

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.210
they were distributing
and selling

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.090
the papers when in down
south, it was kind of frowned

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.030
upon for black people to
actually even read, let alone

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.350
get the scoop on where to go.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.840
So The Chicago Defender actually
helped show black Americans

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.840
what was going on in
the rest of the states,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.110
where they should go,
where safe passage was,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.980
what to dress like when you
come up north, what to wear,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.840
all of those good things came
through The Chicago Defender.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.830
And The Chicago
Defender had sold--

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.200
the original family from 1904--

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.190
sold the paper in about 2007.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.660
The theory was that all of the
images were taken by the family

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.000
and then some were given
to the library, some

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.760
to Getty, et cetera, and there
weren't that many images left.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.520
So, when we came
there, we thought

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.160
there were going
to be 10,000 images

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.010
and we found actually 250,000
images in this one room.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.960
And what happened
to me was you can't

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.830
see 250,000 images of yourself
and ever be the same, right?

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.580
So it was like being bit
by a radioactive spider.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.480
We said, we got to get
this information out.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.220
And I've learned
through my own child

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.180
that young people get everything
through the smartphone.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.012
So, when I was telling my
son about some of the stories

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:51.470
and some of the
things we found, he

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.630
would go right to a
smartphone and say, well

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.400
that's not in here.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.220
And are you spelling it right?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.200
And I remember in
my own naivety,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.770
I thought when the internet was
invented that everything was

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.102
automatically on the internet.

00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:09.560
Like, well now it's
on the internet

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.730
now through some kind of magic.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.900
What I came to learn was
we weren't digitizing

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.500
the black newspapers, the
black photojournalists

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.650
weren't getting-- there just
weren't specific platforms

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.280
to get the information
out there so that younger

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.380
and future generations
can immediately access it.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.127
So, that's one of
the things we started

00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:34.210
with The Chicago Defender.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.500
The Chicago Defender
was our first effort

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.550
and now we have a lot
of black newspapers

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.600
in the queue to share their
images so we can get them out,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.500
so that everybody can see them
and tell fabulous new stories.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.250
So, John mentioned, we have
a wonderful partnership,

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.660
our first immediate platform
is through Google Arts

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.630
and Culture, who we met through
the Black Googler Network.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.000
And we started by just
putting up some images.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.270
Now, these are just three
of a quarter of a million.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.900
And so I narrowed it
down, you're welcome.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.170
But the first image I like
a lot because it's just

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.060
one of the secretaries
when The Chicago

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.110
Defender moved their offices
into the South Loop of Chicago.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.730
That's an important play.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.930
That story is on the Google
Arts and Culture Obsidian page

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.390
and it's a series of images.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.330
But just being able
to accomplish a feat

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.852
like that back in those
days, and then there

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:36.310
were printers in the basement
and all of those other feats,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.160
those are the kind of
plays that we would

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.440
discuss amongst ourselves.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.860
That's the narrative of
how we see ourselves.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.650
Aside from just the newspapers
and the photographers,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.620
we've got small community
archives joining us.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.470
And so the other picture,
the opposite one,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.530
is of Fred Hutchinson
with a plane.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.430
Wonderful story of this guy
who wanted to fly planes,

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.540
but as a black man in the early
1920s, that was a non-starter.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.750
But his family was
a family of means,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.600
so his father bought
him an airplane.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.100
And so he learned how to
fly by starting the plane,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.630
getting in it, and
flying it and landing.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.710
You know, that happened.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.967
And that was a small plane,
a single engine plane.

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:31.300
But he wanted to learn how
to fly a commercial airplane,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.060
so he moved to Canada and he
joined the Royal Canadian Air

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.680
Force where he learned.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.870
Then he eventually
moved to Haiti

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.760
and opened up a
black flight school.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.440
But by then, we were
entering World War

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.277
II and America had
decided we're going

00:11:44.277 --> 00:11:45.360
to need some black pilots.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.130
So he actually became
a flight instructor

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.900
for the Tuskegee Airmen.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.710
So, that story is from
Shorefront Legacy Archives.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.020
They've been
collecting the history

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.190
of the black people who lived
on the Gold Coast in the 1900s.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.760
That's a story that doesn't get
told, but it was a lot of them.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.540
And that was 120 years
ago, but we were there too.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.140
So, Shorefront has a
great archive and now

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.750
the Obsidian platform,
they've joined us,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.370
and we'll be able to get
those stories to the world.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.910
The one in the middle, it's
just one of my favorite photos

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.130
because it's just black boy joy.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.990
I raised a black son in
Chicago and the kids have fun,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.360
but that's not the narrative
that's in the mainstream.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.650
But my life was
fun, my son's life

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.080
was fun-- if he says
it's not, he's lying.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.960
It was amazing.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.820
I was an awesome parent.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.050
But we've got a ton
of images like that.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.550
This is one of my
favorites and this

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.190
is helps me communicate that
I'm not doing this alone

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.930
because I'm not an archivist.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.102
They will let you know that.

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:54.560
That's a postgraduate
degree industry,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.440
I am not an archivist.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.220
I am not a historian, they
will let you know that too.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.630
And that's a PhD process.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.170
So, what I am is a storyteller.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:08.110
But I've aligned with experts
and we're creating new experts.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.320
This picture, the man
with the hat is Joe Lewis,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.000
he's a famous boxer.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.740
And I knew he was a boxer
because when I was a kid,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.690
we drink Joe Lewis milk.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.530
And on the cover, he
was posing like this

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.867
and he had on boxing gloves,
so I knew he was a boxer.

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.950
I didn't know he was one
of the most famous boxers

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.620
ever, blah, blah, blah,
but that's Joe Lewis.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.060
The guy in the middle--

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.980
Judge Duke Slater.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.340
Duke is the first
African-American lineman

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.260
to play in the NFL.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.200
And that story doesn't
get that much coverage.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.730
I will spare you--

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.345
long and short, in
the NFL in 1926,

00:13:46.345 --> 00:13:47.720
he's got one of
the best records,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.160
it was just broken
recently by a Chicago Bear.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.110
But the NFL let five
black people play in 1926,

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.980
then they hokey pokey-ed it back
and said, no, no black players.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.370
So it went down, it was five,
then it went down to zero.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.450
So, he was the first head coach
and formed the Chicago Negro

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.880
All-star football team.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.830
And after he retired football--

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.483
and there's this long
story about that,

00:14:14.483 --> 00:14:16.150
but we'll get those
narratives out there

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.350
because it's a good story.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.500
In 1928, he actually
got his law degree.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.320
So, after he retired
from football,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.140
he became an assistant
district attorney

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.220
and then he's the second
elected judge in Chicago.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.643
That is an important
part of our narrative,

00:14:32.643 --> 00:14:34.060
we've got to get
those stories out

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.230
there so that this
is second nature.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.820
But the picture in the
defender archives, on the back

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.080
it was written Judge Duke
Slater and Joe Lewis.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.110
So I put that on Google Arts and
Culture, that's it, those two.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.700
So, one of my friends
called me who's

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.620
60 and he said, why don't
you credit the other guy?

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.740
Now, people of a certain
age know who that is, right?

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.150
You know that is.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.710
I didn't know who that was.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.010
And it wasn't
written on the back.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.870
Because you know
my love of sports,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.620
but I won't bury the
lead too much longer,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.240
that's Jackie Robinson.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.290
Now, I only know one
image of Jackie Robinson

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.107
as the one that's on the
trading card when he was 24.

00:15:17.107 --> 00:15:18.690
And so my friend
said, I going to need

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.565
you to write Jackie
Robinson's name up there.

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:25.110
And I said, but it doesn't say
Jackie Robinson on the back,

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.970
and that's not how
you're supposed to do it.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.490
You're supposed to record
the history that is accurate.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:34.230
And he said, you
know, Ang, anybody

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.910
with a pulse of a
certain age wouldn't

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.550
have thought to need to
write Jackie Robinson's name.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.440
So, I will tell
younger people, it's

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.650
like if you had 100
pictures of LeBron James,

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.930
you wouldn't feel the
need to make sure you

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.670
wrote his name on every page.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.030
But fast forward 50
years later, some child

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.790
that has not been born
yet is going to go

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.010
wasn't no name on there.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.540
So, we threw that out.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.940
So, I asked five other
people who were over 60,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.940
do you know who this is?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.140
And they were looking
at me like, is this--

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.640
because you know
who that is, right?

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.420
And I was like,
well, I'm just trying

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.868
to see if you know, you know,
before we actually put Jackie

00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:14.910
Robinson's name on there.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.270
But the other beauty about
this photograph is these

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.210
were three captains of sports--

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.810
boxing, football, and
baseball, and they

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.050
were actually playing
golf because Joe Lewis

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.830
made serious inroads
into Pro-am and the PGA.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.630
And so this, for black people
who know sports better than I,

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.600
but you know, I know football,
these kinds of stories

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.070
and these pictures--
they knew they

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.750
were taking an iconic photo.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.793
And we've got to make sure that,
not only do we get the photo,

00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:50.460
but we've got to get
the elders involved

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.560
to make sure we get the
good intel on there.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.640
Because I know everything else
really well except sports.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.080
But we also have added more
than just photo journalism

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.790
and history.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.130
Fashion and beauty
photographer Ernest Collins

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.970
loaned us 120 images that
we put up for Black History

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.240
Month this year.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.510
So, on our Google
Arts and Culture page,

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.310
we've added a lot of
fashion and beauty

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.329
specifically because
that's part of our history.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:23.230
The key part of that is we also
want to alter the metadata.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.940
So when you go and Google
black man in Chicago,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:32.250
primarily what's being populated
are news outlets and crime.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.920
So you only get images
from 1940, if you're lucky,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.020
but you mainly get crime.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.290
So it's important
that as The Obsidian

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.200
uploads all of this metadata
onto the internet when

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.530
you type in black man,
black woman, all this--

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:51.000
we're going to be populating
it with hundreds of thousands

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.750
of images that are not the
collisions, because that's

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.110
already been done.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.480
So we're picking the real
intricacies of the culture,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.120
the layers to this game.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.325
So let's get back to reclaiming
the Chicago narrative

00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:08.700
and let's talk
about Bronzeville.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.240
I'm going to go over what
a lot of people know,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.570
maybe others don't.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.188
But this is one of
my favorite photos.

00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:16.980
So we don't own this
one, this was actually

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.420
owned by the
Library of Congress.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.290
And it's completely royalty
free, it was shot in 1940--

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.240
about 1941.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.730
And to most of
us, this is the go

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.040
to photograph for Bronzeville.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.060
But this was just a
photographer coming

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.660
to hear another narrative
about how Bronzeville was,

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.240
but he just stopped
five ordinary boys

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.740
who were on their way to
Sunday school and said,

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.770
take a picture in
front of this car.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.480
Because that's what
Bronzeville looked

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.800
like if we're
writing this story.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.680
This is just another
day in the life,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.060
everybody dressed like that.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.953
All of the images from
my childhood, that's

00:18:53.953 --> 00:18:54.870
what they looked like.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.080
So, Bronzeville was
called the black belt,

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.330
but there was also a
restrictive covenant.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.160
So, as we were moving in
droves from about 1916

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.170
forward, 1916 and 1948,
it was a law on the books

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.690
that black people could
only live in a specific area

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.880
and that was called the
restricted covenant.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.460
So we all piled
into Bronzeville.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.790
It's not the Bronzeville
proper today, it's about seven

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.320
of those neighborhoods and it's
a big part of the South Side.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.050
So, with the black
belt, somehow we

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.400
had three hospitals,
six newspapers, 1000

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.700
small black-owned businesses,
2000 people worked

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.170
in the numbers game, and we
were three times more densely

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.430
populated than the
rest of Chicago.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:50.460
So if you picked a certain
series of blocks in North Side,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.230
there'd be 20,000 people.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.700
That same we have
footage in Bronzeville--

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.200
60,000.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.580
So we were piled in.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.560
But it wasn't what the narrative
I've been reading kind of

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.130
leads us to, it was vibrant.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.390
So we had the Jones department
store, we had the Palm Tavern,

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.210
we went to the
theaters, we had clubs--

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:19.070
Bronzeville was really
extremely exciting, populated,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.970
and vibrant.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.180
I'm stunned at this
current narrative

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.470
that kind of implies--

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:29.270
again, just collisions of I
don't know, they came here

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.620
and gosh, we got to help them.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.250
And it's like, wait you're
leaving something out.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.710
So we've got to get that online
so you guys can go to it.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.620
What I love about the youth
culture is somebody puts

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.140
out a fact, you guys
clap back so fast

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.150
with all kinds of
facts and links

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.850
and hyperlinks it's like
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.570
And so we've got to get
this information digitized

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:57.170
so that you can clap back
against these negative stories.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:01.280
I don't know if it's that
they are black adjacent

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.780
or if it's malicious.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.260
I don't know, but the
truth will set us all free.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.250
And easy, quick access to
the truth will get us there.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.470
So, I'll leave the
clap back to you guys

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.380
because I can't text
that fast, but we'll

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.200
get the information out there so
that you can have access to it.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.120
But I was trying to figure
out, how did we do all of that

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.290
without all of this help that
has become the new narrative?

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.020
Like, oh my goodness,
if we don't help them

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.840
by eliminating their
entire culture,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.340
then they won't be helped.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:39.890
So, what we also did was form
what we call the Elder Circle.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:45.320
And we started talking to
people from Bronzeville,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.620
we started interviewing and
filming them and talking

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:56.690
to them getting the nuances
of what's happening in Chicago

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.760
and what happened
back in those days.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.740
Now, the guy in the corner is
not of that same generation.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.400
He's Nathan Thompson who wrote a
book called "The Policy Kings,"

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.950
and actually, we'll be
doing a documentary,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.220
we'll be doing film--

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.580
there's a lot that
will be going on

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.050
that we'll be explaining
why Bronzeville was vibrant.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.200
And it was mainly because
of the number runners.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.760
Now, I'll say this--

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.280
because I don't give that story
away because that's coming--

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.990
but essentially,
those were the guys

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.800
who ran the numbers which
is like the lottery.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.770
I think it's important
when I'm telling the story,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:41.610
I'm starting a
narrative of 1746,

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.360
the New York General
Assembly had a lottery

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.640
and they built King's
College, which went on

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.920
to become Columbia University.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.380
So when somebody else
is telling the story,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.100
a lottery is acceptable.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.000
But when we did
lottery, it became

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.160
thuggery and illegal and
illicit and all of those things.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.940
That's why it's important to
drive your own narratives.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.330
But the policy kings
lived in the community

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.488
and they actually
invested in the community.

00:23:07.488 --> 00:23:09.530
And if you want to just
open up a small business,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.130
you would get a small business
loan from a policy king

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.720
so that's how we were able to
be vibrant and self-sufficient.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.930
So, I want to make
sure that we get

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.910
that information to you guys.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.750
So that's kind of
the overview of what

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.750
The Obsidian Collection
is and why we're doing it

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.800
and what it is.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.090
So, to take that forward, I am
going to invite my colleague--

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:42.160
my young colleague-- who has
been amazing and bold in that

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.530
she is one of the
co-founders of The Tribe,

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.740
and they are a digital platform
that speaks to millennials.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.870
I'll say this, when
I saw it, I was

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.880
like, I don't know who
some of these people are.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.490
My son was like, oh I know
who all these people are.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.620
And he immediately
joined the tribe.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.080
I've joined it too, but I'm
going to bring Morgan up

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.090
to the stage.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.536
So let's give Morgan a hand.

00:24:02.536 --> 00:24:04.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:08.780
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.490
ANGELA FORD: Thank you.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.210
So, first I want
to ask you to tell

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.035
everyone what is The Tribe?

00:24:18.035 --> 00:24:19.160
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: Sure.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:25.130
So, The Tribe is a publication
and production company

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.610
with a mission to reshape the
narrative of black Chicago.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.220
And we were born
out of resistance

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.787
to the dominant
narrative of Chicago--

00:24:34.787 --> 00:24:36.495
the dominant narrative
of black Chicago--

00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:37.220
ANGELA FORD: Right.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.887
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
--which is that we

00:24:38.887 --> 00:24:40.710
are a violent,
throwaway community,

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.560
and especially black
millennials and youth,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.980
that we are not
invested in or that we

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:52.460
don't care about black
lives which is a gross lie.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:58.320
So I did a crazy thing and I
said I can't take it anymore.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.600
I can't continue
to watch the news

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.290
and see black bodies
on the ground.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.960
I can't continue to
read the newspapers

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.830
and see sensationalist headlines
about what the body count was

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.120
this weekend.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.730
And I called one
of my best friends

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.390
who I went to Northwestern with
and I said, what can we do?

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.850
She's a journalist
and I talked to her

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.690
and I said, why don't you quit
your job at your newspaper,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.690
move back to Chicago, and write
about what you care about.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.707
And that's what we did.

00:25:31.707 --> 00:25:32.915
ANGELA FORD: Is that Tiffany?

00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:34.130
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
That's Tiffany, yeah.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.463
ANGELA FORD: Because what I
love about you guys' logo is

00:25:36.463 --> 00:25:40.610
it's forward, it's
progressive, it's young,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.700
and it's, I guess, The Tribe.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.200
Why did you call it The Tribe?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.780
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: We
needed it to feel communal

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.530
and we wanted black Chicago
to feel like, this is ours.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.555
We are finally taking
back our narrative.

00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:55.580
ANGELA FORD: I want
you to talk about--

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.215
that's Tiffany,
that's in the middle,

00:25:58.215 --> 00:25:59.840
and tell me who the
other gentleman is.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.070
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
That's David,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.720
he's our web developer
and designer.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.670
So he's the one that
came up with that logo.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.230
And it's funny
because I actually

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.910
pushed back with him on it.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.757
And then he said, I thought you
wanted to do news different.

00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:12.590
And I was like, you
know what, you're right.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.670
We're not going to look like
your typical mainstream media

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.630
platform.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.350
This is going to
look like a movement,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.190
we're going to brand it,
it's going to be a lifestyle.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.690
Yeah.

00:26:22.027 --> 00:26:23.360
ANGELA FORD: Well, that's great.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.760
One of the things
when I met Morgan,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.310
I was so moved by
the entrepreneurship.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.880
It reminds me of all
of the entrepreneurship

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.800
that I've learned in the
archives and in the history,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.860
but one of the things
I wanted to make

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.430
sure everybody understood, one
of the platforms you guys did

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.840
was Chi Vote.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.148
Can you tell us about that?

00:26:43.148 --> 00:26:45.440
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: We're
a small collective, really.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.070
There really is three of us.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.330
And so many people think that
we're this huge conglomerate,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.970
but really we hire
freelancers and we

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.330
hire black voices to
help tell these stories

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.168
about black Chicago, but
at our core we thought,

00:26:59.168 --> 00:27:00.710
there's no way that
we're going to be

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.530
able to take on the
elections with all the

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.200
5 million candidates
that there are.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.530
So what can we do?

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.410
So I said, why
don't we reach out

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.210
to other independent
platforms and say,

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.860
can we come together and
amplify each other's stories

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.990
so that we're not
duplicating the same efforts

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.830
and then create an
election guide together?

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.838
And that's what we did.

00:27:22.838 --> 00:27:25.130
So we reached out to the
Better Government Association,

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.360
Chicago Reporter, The
Daily Line, Block Club Chi,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.090
Southside Weekly, a
bunch of organizations

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.060
to put together this
nonpartisan election guide.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.027
So it's chi.vote.

00:27:37.027 --> 00:27:38.110
ANGELA FORD: That's great.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:43.280
What do you think that
The Obsidian, the platform

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.370
that we're building, which
should launch later this year,

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.882
how do you think those tools can
help what you guys are doing?

00:27:50.882 --> 00:27:53.090
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: Well,
we have the same mission.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.330
It's all about reshaping
the black narrative.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.180
Black youth are not being told
the truth about who we are.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.120
It's not taught in schools.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.240
There's no way for us to
find some of this information

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.117
really until we get to college.

00:28:07.117 --> 00:28:09.200
When we get to college,
that may be the first time

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.260
that we start reading
texts by black authors.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.140
So when I think
about the news and I

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.780
think about 100
years from now, what

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.750
are people going to
go to reference what

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.430
black Chicago is right now?

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.640
Can you really look
at the archives

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.090
of The Tribune or
anywhere and say

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.450
this is a full picture of
what black Chicago is when

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.280
the majority of
that is going to be

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.800
headlines about who was slain?

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.003
So, we see The
Tribe as someone--

00:28:39.003 --> 00:28:40.670
and The Obsidian
Collection-- as someone

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.700
who can step in and say,
here is a more holistic,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.730
multifaceted view of
who we are as a people.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.860
ANGELA FORD: That's great.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.270
I think what I was hoping
to make sure we accomplish

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.890
is that people can get involved
and follow The Tribe and all

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:58.470
of that.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.850
But tell me one
of the fun stories

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.190
or one of the important
stories that you guys

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.640
covered as The
Tribe that mattered

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.190
to you-- that sticks out,
because I know they all matter.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.565
MORGAN ELISE
JOHNSON: Sure, sure.

00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:14.530
So we have a series on
our site called Out West.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.460
Tiffany, who is the
co-founder of The Tribe

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.190
and the Editor in Chief,
she's from North Lawndale.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.690
It's--

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:21.905 --> 00:29:23.870
OK, West Side.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.670
But, you know, everybody talks
about the stories of the South

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.500
Side because there's so many
kind of vibrant, middle class

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.520
communities.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.610
But people just leave the
West Side of the dialogue

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.970
completely when it
comes to west Chicago.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.180
And so we wanted to
focus on a series

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.200
that talks about Tiffany's
roots to the West Side

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.330
and also the great migration and
that journey to the West Side

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.990
and why the West Side is kind
of like the city's forgotten

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.370
stepchild.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:59.480
So we actually journeyed
to Mississippi together.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.940
We found out, Tiffany and
I, that our families are

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.670
both from Bolivar
county and so we

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.670
went there to kind
of discover the past,

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.470
and isn't very
fascinating story.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.150
If you look at this series
about us as young people

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.300
discovering who we
are by retracing

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.100
the roots of our grandmothers.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.330
ANGELA FORD: So you use a lot
of things more than just text--

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.768
you use videos and you
create documentaries.

00:30:26.768 --> 00:30:28.310
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
Oh, absolutely.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.990
So my background is
that I'm a filmmaker.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.730
And so while Tiffany is your
more traditional journalist,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.640
I'm coming in like no, we're
not doing this the regular news

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.510
way.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.150
I don't care about
the 24-hour news cycle

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.470
and what's trending on Twitter.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.080
Let's do more
long-form stories that

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.050
are going to matter later on.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.480
So I use my documentary
film background

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.840
to create documentary
series, multimedia stories

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.260
because in this day
and age, not everyone's

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.310
going to read the text.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.740
But you need something that's
going to go on social media,

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.860
grab their attention.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.110
So we like to use audio, video,
all different types of mediums

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.950
to tell stories.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.380
ANGELA FORD: Wow.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.920
OK, well I think we
covered everything

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.960
that we wanted to
talk about today

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.030
and we can open it up to
questions if anybody has any.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.950
AUDIENCE: As I sit here
and listen to you guys

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.200
both present, I'm
filled with goosebumps

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.860
in terms of the power of
both of your platforms

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.383
to tell news stories for the
African-American experience.

00:31:33.383 --> 00:31:35.300
I want to thank you guys
for this presentation

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.450
and just really appreciate it.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:36.710
Thank you.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:37.760
ANGELA FORD: Thank you.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.093
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:31:42.062 --> 00:31:46.780
AUDIENCE: How have sponsors
responded to your site?

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.710
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
Actually, very well.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.100
I keep it real with people
when I'm selling The Tribe.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.140
Nobody's going to tell
stories about black Chicago

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.870
like we can, until they
start hiring black people.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.090
So that hasn't
happened, so we're

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.610
going to be your best
voice for telling stories

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.310
about black people.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.930
Yeah, so they really
come to us because they

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.570
want to reach our audience.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.960
I mean, black millennials
are coming into buying power,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.830
everybody's interested in that.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.561
So, yeah, people
really approach us.

00:32:19.561 --> 00:32:22.420
AUDIENCE: Along those lines,
how can we best support you--

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.872
both of you-- and
your organizations?

00:32:24.872 --> 00:32:26.696
ANGELA FORD: You go first.

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:30.630
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: Money,
money is always the answer.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.230
I wish there was another
answer I could give you,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.650
but we have the creativity,
we have the education,

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.530
we have a conglomerate
of creatives

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.250
who are ready and can't
get hired at legacy papers,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.820
so yeah.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.560
If we have money, we
can tell more stories

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.580
and that is the best
way to help us out.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.426
If we can talk afterwards
if you're interested.

00:32:53.426 --> 00:32:56.120
ANGELA FORD: Oh my
gosh, I love her.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.540
Because I want to
say, ditto to that.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.990
But gosh, I just love these
young people because that said,

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.440
I think my generation would
have said the exact same thing

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.743
in so many more words.

00:33:09.743 --> 00:33:11.660
I would have stretched
that out to about seven

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.180
or eight sentences.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.450
But-- with my formal
education and all that--

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.700
but I think that's what we're
going to be reaching out

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.336
for that as well.

00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:25.100
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
so much for being here.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.090
What kind of conversations
are happening with teachers

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.242
and with the CPS
system to kind of help

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:33.700
with these gaps in the narrative
that you're talking about?

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.535
Because it's obviously such
a crucial piece of this.

00:33:36.535 --> 00:33:39.190
ANGELA FORD: Well, I appreciate
you asking that because both

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.390
of my parents were teachers.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.200
And so I know way more about
teaching than football,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.430
but one of the things that
we're doing at The Obsidian

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:52.652
is we're going to be creating
educational content as well.

00:33:52.652 --> 00:33:54.610
But the interesting thing
about education right

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.010
now is it has
gotten very narrow,

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.910
people are teaching to
very standardized systems.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.390
And it doesn't
leave a lot of room

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.720
for extra curricula that way.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.360
But the charter school
system is coming up

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.090
and even they, I've already
been talking to them,

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.230
it's just a very narrow space.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.760
But we're working with
virtual reality and some

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.560
of all these other
things so that when

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.600
that relaxes a little
bit-- because I'm

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.940
excited that the places like
Google and these big tech firms

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.850
are moving away from
these traditional,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.969
narrow requirements
and that's allowing

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.260
for a lot more creativity.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.909
We feel like with
these platforms,

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.790
we can get the knowledge
and information out

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:47.270
even if it doesn't come through
organized curriculum systems.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.239
So we're just going
to keep creating

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.580
and then you young people
just keep inventing.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.310
Just when I figured
out this tool, now

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.160
everything is on the virtual.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.510
So we're going to get it there.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.950
And then we'll get the
information out there

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.075
because you guys are
taking in information

00:35:01.075 --> 00:35:02.490
in so many different ways.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:02.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.078
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
Let me add on

00:35:04.078 --> 00:35:07.270
to that because I love talking
to teachers about education.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.900
I think we need to
totally reframe the way

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.030
that we teach about history.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.560
And I always tell this story--

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.800
I remember being in about
seventh or eighth grade

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.800
and my social studies
teacher wrote on the board

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.070
in huge letters,
Manifest Destiny.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.070
And we're literally
talking about the US

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.710
going through and
stealing everybody's land

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.450
and just massacring people.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.390
And we call that section in
history Manifest Destiny.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.930
So I need for teachers
to start teaching

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.300
from the point of
view of the oppressed

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.790
and if the title of
the text in history

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.930
sounds like a comic book,
then it's probably wrong.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.400
And we need to like, reassess
what we're teaching our kids.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.765
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:57.076 --> 00:35:58.630
AUDIENCE: Hi, first
of all, I want

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.900
to say that from my perspective,
you nailed it on football.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.270
What's the problem?

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.358
That's what I see.

00:36:05.358 --> 00:36:06.316
ANGELA FORD: Collision.

00:36:06.316 --> 00:36:09.040
AUDIENCE: But
seriously, exactly.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.380
I'm Maudelyne Ihejirika.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.310
I'm both a columnist
for the Sun-Times

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.050
and president of the
National Association

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.220
of Black Journalists.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.620
And I just want
to say that, more

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.510
of a comment than
a small question,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.420
and that is that I'm blown away.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.280
I'm blown away.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.320
I've heard about your project,
I've read bits and pieces,

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.800
but today just sitting
there in the few minutes

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.750
that you went over
some of the photos,

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.750
you told me stories
I didn't even know.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.920
And yeah, I think
I know everything.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.080
But I'm saying as
black journalists

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.470
and as veterans, we think we
pretty much know the history,

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.690
but there were pieces
of history you told me--

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.180
just little small photos--

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.480
the one about the guy who--

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:54.980
Fred?

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.630
Is it Fred?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.338
ANGELA FORD: Yes.

00:36:56.338 --> 00:36:58.600
AUDIENCE: Oh my god,
I've never heard of him.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.370
I was like--

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.300
I made a note, go
look him up, you know?

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.950
ANGELA FORD: And
his grandson turned

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.930
those archives over
to Shorefront Legacy,

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.740
his grandson still
lives in Evanston

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.630
and turned that
archive over, yeah.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.100
AUDIENCE: That's amazing.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.670
And then, just to say,
Morgan, of course.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.420
Hey Morgan.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.880
I am so, so proud of Morgan and
she and Tiffany and her team,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.000
they just are, they're stars
they're NABJ stars here

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.740
in Chicago.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.210
The one thing I
wanted to ask you

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.550
is so, as I sat here
listening to it,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.490
I was struck by how do I--

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.400
I mean, besides telling
the story of The Obsidian

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.240
Collective--

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.400
how do we share those photos?

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.110
I mean, in terms
of when you think

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.200
about copyright, and
like if the Sun-Times,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.040
if I wanted to do a story with
a gallery of these photos,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.722
how are they being
allowed to be shared?

00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:48.430
ANGELA FORD: I'm glad
you asked that too.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.500
So, we've got lawyers, right?

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.600
And so I've learned a
lot about copyright law,

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.930
but a big part of The
Obsidian Collection platform,

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.940
we're building a very
expensive website, yeah--

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.910
that is going to be a
quick access to licensing

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:13.090
and permissions, so that it's
going to rival the other stock

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.660
photo images out there, as
well as a platform for viewing

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.845
and pleasure and enjoyment.

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:18.498
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:20.290
ANGELA FORD: But there
will be quick access

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.130
and that is a
revenue share model,

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.280
so that the owners retain
ownership and then can

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.000
monetize.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.670
What it does is
it allows revenue

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.470
to go into these small archive
groups that need those dollars,

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.090
and then it makes it available
for you to tell the stories.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.270
Because the Schomburg
library, which

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.000
gathered all of the
Harlem information--

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.070
the reason Harlem is
written more about

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.350
than Bronzeville
was, is because you

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.020
had access to the information.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.330
The Schomburg actually
gathered up all the images

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.580
and then you could go in
there and license it and tell

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.630
all these stories.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:02.110
That hasn't been nearly
as easy in Bronzeville.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.610
I do the licensing and
permissions for the Chicago

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:06.600
Defender right now.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.620
And we've negotiated with
movies, documentaries, books--

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.880
but it's very manual,
it's voluntary,

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.180
and it is not scalable.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.250
So we're making that
as a revenue stream

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.440
for black legacy
newspapers that own

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.230
their archives, the
photographers, and the archive

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.830
groups.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.020
OK good.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you ladies
so much for your information.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.920
It's going to be
beneficial to all.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.180
So, my comment slash question
is in the form of money,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.450
since you mentioned that.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.720
And so my question
is, have either

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.640
of you thought about any
type of fundraising efforts

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.030
in order to not only get your
information out there, but then

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.537
also collect funds
at the same time?

00:39:54.537 --> 00:39:56.120
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
Right, The Tribe

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.720
is actually celebrating our
second anniversary right now.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:03.650
So we'll be having a huge
fundraiser on April 12th.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.785
So, yeah, you'll be getting
all of that information.

00:40:06.785 --> 00:40:09.290
ANGELA FORD: Thanks, and
we don't have a fundraiser

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.660
scheduled, but we will.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.860
It's going to be as new
collections join The Obsidian,

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.350
our hope is to, as
we welcome them,

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.000
to have a fundraiser
to celebrate.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.440
Because the digitization
takes time, treasure, money,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.700
all of those things.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.160
So that's our
strategy, thank you.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.290
AUDIENCE: I was
going to ask you,

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.330
you're here in Chicago so the
Chicago Defender is available.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.850
But what about the other black
newspapers across the country?

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.590
Can you give us
an example of what

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.140
it's like going into
the bowels of whatever

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.970
to find this material?

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.560
And is some of it
destroyed, is it

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.220
salvageable at the
other newspapers,

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:52.210
say in Lincoln, Pennsylvania
or Amsterdam News in New York?

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.640
ANGELA FORD: Yeah, so that's
a phenomenal question.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.370
When we started with The
Defender, the first thing I did

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.962
was start talking to
other black legacy papers,

00:41:00.962 --> 00:41:02.920
just to kind of see where
they were so we could

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.087
mirror what they were doing.

00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.590
And nobody was doing it.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.160
As journalism
institutions have shrunk,

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.520
the first thing you kind of
put on the side is the archive

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.490
and you maintain the journalism.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.540
And then when things are sold,
different people have them,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.040
different people
feel they own them.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.380
So we've got the lawyers
sorting all that out.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.070
But we've got like
eight legacy newspapers

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.910
in the queue that want
to join The Obsidian.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:35.600
But most philanthropy
is local, so in terms

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.970
of rolling them in and
getting them digitized,

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:43.910
those are very specific to
the local community aspects.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:47.180
And we're looking at
partnering with local HBCUs

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.940
to partner with their
library science departments

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.320
and get some of
their labor going

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.230
and get this whole thing
kind of, this big obsidian

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.970
circle, which is the logo--

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.235
obsidian circle.

00:41:57.235 --> 00:41:59.610
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: I can
add on to that a little bit--

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:00.230
ANGELA FORD: Oh, sure.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.897
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
--about archiving.

00:42:01.897 --> 00:42:06.590
Again, we do see The
Tribe as a future source

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.640
for these types of materials
because so many newspapers

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.510
and publications have laid off
photographers and people who

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.360
take videos and
things like that.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.980
And a lot of
millennials and youth,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.120
we get our news from our
phones and from really kind

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.260
of like tabloid sites on
Instagram and Twitter,

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.540
like The Shade Room
and things like that,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.170
where it's not real news and
it's people just aggregating

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.020
materials.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.110
So it's very
important for us to be

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.250
very persistent in going
out and taking new images

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.825
and capturing what
Chicago is today.

00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:45.500
ANGELA FORD: That's
one thing I love

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.148
about you guys is you're not
just aggregating entertainment

00:42:50.148 --> 00:42:51.440
and just kind of recirculating.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.398
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON: We
actually make a point,

00:42:53.398 --> 00:42:54.590
we don't aggregate at all.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.620
We don't go and say, oh,
this is trending right now,

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.530
we're going to just
like copy and paste what

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.280
these people said.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.320
Because our whole
thing is, since we

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.960
have a small staff is like,
if this story is already

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.890
being told, there's no
reason for us to tell it too.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.160
We need to go in and
tell the stories that

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.296
are not being told.

00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:17.890
AUDIENCE: That's a great point.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:19.480
With this being
Black History Month,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.980
and I think it's
important, like you

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.300
said-- you need to tell
the stories that are not

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.860
being told.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.800
My name is [? Kristal ?]
[? Allison, ?] and I tell

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.600
people I'm first generation
great migration to Chicago

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.920
by way of Arkansas
and Tennessee.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.820
And in that process, I've been--

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.650
Angela and I have known each
other since high school.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.700
And we've talked
a lot about this.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.388
ANGELA FORD: I look amazing.

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:47.930
AUDIENCE: And we talked a great
deal about this and I shared,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.230
I think that what she's
doing is phenomenal.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.330
And I just learned
about The Tribe today.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.440
Angela may have
mentioned it and some

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.030
of our other conversations.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.090
But when the movie
"The Butler" came out

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:03.780
and I was at the
advanced screening,

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:09.453
and it was done by Lee Daniels.

00:44:09.453 --> 00:44:11.120
So they're talking
about it because they

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.660
didn't know about that story.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.325
So I was there for
the Q&amp;A, et cetera,

00:44:14.325 --> 00:44:16.700
and I said, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute--

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.600
the black man that was
in the White House,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.350
he was the highest
level executive

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.990
in the White House at
that time, who happened

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.110
to be one of my relatives.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.540
Everett Frederic Morrow.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.030
Under the Eisenhower
administration,

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.100
he was the first
African American

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.430
to have the highest level
position in the White House.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.510
When Obama ran for
president, then

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.750
they talked about
it here and there.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:45.620
And by eBay, because I like
to look stuff up as well,

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.630
I realized that he
had written a book

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.300
and it was entitled "Black
Man in the White House."

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.710
And he chronicled a lot of
the things that were going on

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.020
and a lot of the
involvement that he had.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.060
So, as I spoke to
Lee Daniels, I was

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.410
going to like, in
telling that story,

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.280
you also need to
tell this story too.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.190
Because he was a
Republican and he

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.060
was a lawyer and in
addition, his sister

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.950
also made some major
inroads as well.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.670
But it was kind of
like, I'm learning

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.673
like I didn't know this.

00:45:16.673 --> 00:45:18.590
As well as I'm learning
a lot of other things,

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.440
I didn't know one of my great
uncles was a Tuskegee Airmen.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.570
He's going to be 99
years old this year.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.390
So I think that what you
guys are doing on both sides,

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.210
on the millennial side and
on his side, that there are

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.730
stories to be told,
there are photographs

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.840
that are out there that are in
people's personal collections.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.540
And so, I'm not sure
if I missed part of it,

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:44.030
but what are you doing to get
personal collections included

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.920
in your archives as well?

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.520
Or how do you communicating
that this exists?

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.190
Because some people where,
as they're leaving us,

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.970
the photographs are being
buried, thrown away,

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.020
or kind of locked in
somebody's photo book,

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.292
and not being told about.

00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:11.570
ANGELA FORD: Well, a personal
archive collection actually

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.780
kind of falls under
the category for us

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.160
as a small community archive.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.740
So when The Obsidian first
joined Google Arts and Culture,

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.420
we put out a press release
and we got a ton of pickup

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.340
because everybody was just
so excited about that.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.330
And one of the phone
calls I got was

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:37.250
a woman who had inherited her
dad's collection of 300,000

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:43.850
photos that included 1960s
Motown, which is gold,

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.120
and 1960s Chicago,
which was awesome too.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.830
And so many times,
people inherit

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.710
these wonderful collections
of black legacy,

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:57.110
but they definitely want
to retain ownership.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.618
And most people think, well,
I've got to stand up a museum,

00:46:59.618 --> 00:47:01.160
I've got to create
my own foundation,

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.440
I've got to replicate
this entire thing,

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:09.300
and what we're offering instead
is a platform for some of that.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.700
But at the same
time, we're going

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:15.320
to be having workshops and
symposiums on how to properly

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:21.740
store and keep your own archives
and also what's valuable,

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.600
what's valuable to
the world, and what's

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.110
valuable to you, which may
be two different things.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:31.322
What happens when people leave
things with a collection?

00:47:31.322 --> 00:47:32.780
What happens when
people leave them

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.580
with a museum or a university?

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.950
So we're going to do
a lot of education

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.470
around protecting
black history as well.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.520
So our goal isn't to build
another black Smithsonian,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.320
even though that
place is amazing.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.490
We're going to be focusing
more on digital outreach

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.545
even though we will
have a location.

00:47:52.545 --> 00:47:56.360
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think that
there's another museum that's

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.310
in the process of being
built, I forget where

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.393
it's going to be built at.

00:47:59.393 --> 00:48:01.190
ANGELA FORD: Well,
there's always museums,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.773
I mean we're not
cornering that space.

00:48:02.773 --> 00:48:06.530
AUDIENCE: So there's
always room for,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:08.150
I think, for additional stuff.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.630
Because just as that museum
has a lot of wonderful stuff

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.890
in there, as I was told,
they couldn't get everything

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:16.590
in there.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.090
So there's, again,
more stories that are

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:21.450
out there to be told as well.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:25.160
So it's good to see that they're
both platforms or forums here

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.220
to provide that as a
mechanism for learning more

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.690
because I think it is important
that we're taught who we are

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.670
and learn more about ourselves.

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.025
ANGELA FORD: Thank you.

00:48:37.025 --> 00:48:39.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you
all very much coming.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.187
And I want to ask you guys, like
you all really inspired me here

00:48:42.187 --> 00:48:43.812
today, I liked
listening to this a lot,

00:48:43.812 --> 00:48:45.190
and it was really interesting.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:52.520
I'm wondering, is fine art
ever going to be part of that?

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.250
I'm 50, so I'm like in between
the millennial or whatever.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.300
But I had my first piece in
the museum when I was 10.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:01.900
So I've seen--

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.608
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
You said fine arts?

00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:04.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.420
What about like Richard Hunt
and Kerry James Marshall and all

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:07.970
those people.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.060
Like, they did some really
cool, interesting shit back

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:10.390
in the day.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.920
MORGAN ELISE JOHNSON:
On The Tribe,

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:17.230
we recognize that news isn't the
only way to capture our story.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.840
So we have a section on the
site, if you go to the top,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.940
there's a tab that
says The Works.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.280
And it's just a space
for creative works

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.490
of many different mediums
from like short films

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.650
to photography, art, so yeah.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:34.030
So we open that up for people
to submit that type of material

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.620
to us.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.410
AUDIENCE: Cool, all right.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.060
That's good to know.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:36.865
I'll check it out.

00:49:36.865 --> 00:49:38.500
ANGELA FORD: Yeah,
so we haven't been

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.780
able to get into the
fine art space yet

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.985
because that's a different
set of legal questions.

00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:45.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.410
ANGELA FORD: So
right now, we've got

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.310
images and who owns the
image, but projecting art

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.945
isn't something
we've gotten to yet.

00:49:52.945 --> 00:49:54.880
AUDIENCE: It's some
really incredible artists.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.240
ANGELA FORD: There's some
beautiful things out there,

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.020
I agree with you.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.610
AUDIENCE: Like all over
Chicago, old stuff too.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.010
ANGELA FORD: Yeah.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:49:59.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:00.435
Thank you.

00:50:00.435 --> 00:50:03.130
SPEAKER: Again, if we could
give Morgan and Angela one more

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.880
round of applause.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.930
[APPLAUSE]
