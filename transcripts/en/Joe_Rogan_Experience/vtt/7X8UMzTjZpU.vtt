1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.380
Yeah,
yeah.
Two,
one.
Kevin Lee.
What's up man?

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.640
What's going on island?
Oh yeah,

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.870
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.</v>

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.510
You know a guy get you some thanks for even for doing it.
I,

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.420
before the fight happened,
I had kind of already had,
in my mind,
I'm like,
okay,

6
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.820
it's been a year since we last kind of did this.

7
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:22.600
And it was right after the bar bowls a fight.
And I was like,
okay,
I'm a,
I'm a,

8
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:24.790
I'm gonna get through the fight and then I'm gonna do this.

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.600
The result wasn't exactly what I want,
you know what I mean?

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.580
And it made me hesitant about doing it,
but I was like,
ah,

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
this is the story,
you know what I mean?
And this is,
as I said,

12
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.600
kind of like was upset at myself for a few days.

13
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.400
Eventually I just Kinda got over and I'm like,
you know what?

14
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:45.700
I said I was going to do it before.
I'm not about to be no sore as loser.
And

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 0>yeah,
might as well.
Like I said,
I love you whether you win or lose,</v>

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.910
I'm just,
you know,
it's,

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380
it's a giant part of the game.
Half the game is losing.

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.390
Someone has to win someone else to lose.
If you watch a fight,
someone's losing.

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.570
Yes,
it's a draw.

20
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.170
<v 1>And I figure it's,
it's all about how you approach it,</v>

21
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.090
how you take it into the next fight.
And really when you look at it,

22
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.330
I mean it sucks.
It really does and I hate it.
And like any,

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
like it's something that ball's up Masada me like I go over,

24
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:21.700
I replayed a fight a million times in my head and I actually hate losing and I

25
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:26.701
hate that feeling but it's just the reality and it's like it's just real life

26
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.050
and just realized nothing.
You can do it.

27
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.750
<v 0>There's nothing you do once it's over you.</v>

28
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.850
The only thing you can do is learn and grow.
Exactly.

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.630
And the guy you fought as a stud man you thought fought Hofeld dos Anjos,

30
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.940
he's a fucking legitimate world champion fighter.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.721
<v 1>Yeah.
When,</v>

32
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:44.220
when I was approached with the fight and in kind of start really diving into it

33
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.940
and really looking at him like I always like a really big challenge.

34
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.790
And that one was definitely one,
you know,
he had already had a lot of fights.
Uh,

35
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.680
that went five rounds.
He had fucked,
he's fought pretty much everybody,
you know,

36
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.400
uh,
uh,
Camaros.
Uzman was his last fight,
a Colby,
Covington,

37
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:02.310
EFL could be p I've already fought like a lot of,
uh,

38
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.280
top top guys and for five rounds.
So I knew what type of challenge it was.

39
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:11.280
It's just I hope myself at a high esteem.
So I was like,
you know,
I'm,

40
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.750
I'm just ready to do it.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
The,

41
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.620
the fight itself was,
was good,
but either way I'm gonna learn from it and,
and,

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.270
and grow from an end.
I still got a whole long,
long road ahead of me.
So

43
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.410
<v 0>you do have a long road ahead of you,
but you know,</v>

44
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:29.110
as we were talking about that long run could sneak up on you real quick.

45
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:30.490
And before you know it,
you know,

46
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:33.930
you're 37 years old trying to figure out if you still want to fight.
Yeah.
That's,

47
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.430
that's how it happens to guys.
I've seen it happen to guys.

48
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.610
<v 1>Yeah.
So I feel like if you approach a smart,
you know what I mean,</v>

49
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.580
you can still get done,
which is what I'm trying to do.
Right.
Uh,

50
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.250
I kinda already knew that I needed to make some changes and do some things

51
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.810
different.
Um,
even before this fight and before my last one too.
Um,

52
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.940
but you know,
I just was like,
okay,

53
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.460
I'm gonna just get through this one and then I'll do it and now I'm gonna get

54
00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:59.560
through this one and then I'll do it.
But you know,

55
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.830
that's kind of a big wake up call to just like,
all right,

56
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.890
it's time to get outside of the comfort zone in,
in any kind of,

57
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.490
do something different and,
and kind of do what I already know I've got to do.

58
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.630
<v 0>What did you think was going to happen in the fight and what was surprising?</v>

59
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.780
<v 1>I didn't think they will be able to keep the pace for sure.
Um,</v>

60
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.390
but what surprised me was how smart he was in,
in how,
uh,

61
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.460
he beat me tactically more than anything is,
you know,
when I was going,

62
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.900
he wasn't doing,
you know,
and he kind of,

63
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.280
he controlled the pace better than I thought he was going to.
You know,

64
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:35.820
I thought once I set that pace that he was gonna be right there with me.

65
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.940
But then as it got going,
I started to realize,
oh,

66
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:41.070
he's not really expending much energy.

67
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.420
He's Kinda just letting me burn out my energy.
And,
and,

68
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.530
and then he took his moment when,
when I made the last mistake.

69
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:53.280
And really when it boiled down to it,
I lost one position at the end there,
uh,

70
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.190
where I went for a take down and,
you know,

71
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990
nine times out of 10 when I go and club back,
the guy hits his knees.
Uh,

72
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.590
but he,
he just stayed on his feet.
I stepped out and when I hit my knees,

73
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:07.800
it's like lost that position and it against a guy like that.

74
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:12.150
So dangerous of black belt.
And is a,
is so good.

75
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.270
I knew one slip up was going to be all the need and not think he knew that too.

76
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.960
And he was just kind of waiting,
biding his time and hoping that I slip up.

77
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.870
<v 0>It seemed like you expended a lot of energy early on.</v>

78
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:24.660
It seemed like by the time he got the submission you were fairly tired.

79
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.470
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
follow,
she always used to tell me to send it.</v>

80
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.300
It was always a,
there's tired and can and tired and can't,
you know,

81
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.770
it's a fight.
It's,
you're gonna be tired.
Uh,
but I,

82
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:43.180
I still do think I have my legs underneath me and,
and still could,
it's just,

83
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.400
I could have played it better tactically.
I could have had had,
you know,

84
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:51.640
more time when I wasn't just going,
going as,
like you said,

85
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.780
especially in that first round,

86
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.040
if I would have had a little bit better experience maybe or,
or something,
I,

87
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.640
you know,
I don't know,
I'll figure that out,
but,
uh,

88
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.070
I could have played it a little smarter like he did.

89
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.790
<v 0>Are you,</v>

90
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.740
do you have a person that's giving you strategy or are you sort of making your

91
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.120
strategy up on the fly?

92
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.830
<v 1>That's one of the things that,
that's kind of the main thing that,
that um,
uh,
I,</v>

93
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.260
Robert Falls was that guy for me until he passed and,

94
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.180
and then I kind of just picked up the ball and,
you know,
I understand fighting.

95
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.740
Um,
but yeah,

96
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.430
it's mostly me doing the strategy and right now that that's where I'm in the

97
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:28.951
limbo of,

98
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:32.840
of trying to find somebody who already has that experience and has already been

99
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:35.570
there and done it,
uh,
to tell me a little better strategy.

100
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.160
<v 0>Yeah.
I think it's so critical,
man.
I really do.</v>

101
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:40.910
And we had this conversation over the phone about it.
I think that,
uh,

102
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.650
a young fighter with a lot of potential like yourself,

103
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.750
like this is a reason why fighters of trainers,

104
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.880
there's a reason why fighters have head coaches.

105
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.070
It's re it's not because they want to give up all their money.

106
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.210
It's because it helps.
And you can delegate those,
that,

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.460
that thought process to a master.

108
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.830
Someone who's a master of martial arts who understands positions or understand

109
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.010
strategies,
seen guys tire.
It's seen guys good seeing you in the gym,

110
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:07.820
senior grind,
understands your skillset,
understands how you are when you come in,

111
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:11.600
perfect.
Understands how you are when you come in tired,
you know,
so that,

112
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.380
that is just giant Ha.

113
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.610
It having someone who understands you psychologically as well.

114
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.300
And it also having someone that you respect and that you want to impress.

115
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.230
All those things are huge.

116
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.720
<v 1>Yeah.
It's,
it's a big one.
Especially like you said,</v>

117
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.900
being able to talk to you too in,
in,
in being able to understand you.

118
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.460
I think that's what rob did really well,
uh,
and any kind of was so good.

119
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.470
He kind of like reel me in a little bit.
Like I'm the type,
I'm just kind of go,

120
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:38.071
go,
go.

121
00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:43.071
And I kind of think higher to myself and then maybe even I am,

122
00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:46.380
but that's just high,
you know?
So that's how you have confidence.
Yeah.
So,

123
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:49.980
but he was the type to kind of reel me in and he used to even tell me like,
hey,

124
00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:53.040
you don't gotta get hit so much or you know,
I'll,
I'll stand in front of a guy.

125
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:55.260
And just like,
especially when I was younger,

126
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.070
it was a little even worse and you know,
cause that's just how I be feeling.

127
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.120
But you know,
he was the Connor to type to,
to reel me in more than anything.

128
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.510
It's not like he would tell me one specific techniques or,

129
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.540
or it was even about his style or anything like that.

130
00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:14.400
It was just the way that he was able to kind of get through to me and kind of

131
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.010
make me understand what it is that I'm trying to do.

132
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 0>Yeah.
And you guys,
you guys have just a good relationship too.</v>

133
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.120
He was such a good guy,
man.
Yeah.
Such a good dude to,

134
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.550
I mean,
just,
just losing him.
I mean,

135
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.220
it was devastating for the whole mixed martial arts world,

136
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:35.090
but losing him for you had to be a real,

137
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.000
just a giant change in your career.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,
which fight?

138
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.150
What did he die before

139
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.510
<v 1>he died right after the Tony fight,
which is a whole nother piece of it.</v>

140
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.350
You know,
I,
I know he had a whole lot of,
uh,

141
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.490
things going on early in his life,
especially,
you know,
with his family.
And,
um,

142
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.900
when we went to his memorial and people were kind of explaining,
you know what,

143
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:02.410
it's like growing up in a,
a,
uh,
he grew up a Jehovah witness.

144
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.680
So he's like explaining what it's like to grow up like that and you know,

145
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:09.460
to try and get away from that and having your family disown you and how like

146
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:14.110
that can I,
I understand.
I understand the importance of family,
so I can get that.

147
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.560
But then even I'm like,
man,
you know,
they would tell us he,

148
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.870
we were more so keeping them alive longer than,
than anything.
So I'm like,
man,

149
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:24.550
if I would've won that fight with Tony,
it's like,

150
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.980
fuck what he shows what he's still be here.
You know what I mean?

151
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.160
Those are the type of like,
I'm like,
did I do it to myself?
Almost,

152
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.040
but I already know,

153
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.910
I'm already at the point where I kinda got over it a little bit and I kind of

154
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:43.840
understand that I'm not going to be able to replace them by any means.
Uh,

155
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.990
but I am going to have to get that person who can still speak to me in that same

156
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.561
light.
You know,

157
00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:55.440
the only way that I'm gonna make it right is to win that title in and it for

158
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:55.891
him,
you know,

159
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.700
he kind of saw that from me and he was a counter to one that gave me that

160
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.870
confidence to say,
cause he,
he's already coached multiple UFC champions.

161
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.550
So when he told me that,
that he could see me being a champ,
that really,

162
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:13.350
like,
I was like,
oh,
okay.
Like I didn't really,
like,
I kind of got it a little bit,

163
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:18.120
but I didn't really know it until like he gave me that kind of confidence.
Um,

164
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.360
so the only thing that's gonna make it right is to go out there and win a title.

165
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.630
And that's,
that's if I got,
it wouldn't,
no matter what I gotta do,

166
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:28.950
I'm not stopping until I do it.
So are you 100% committed to one 70 now?
Yeah,

167
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.260
I think so.
I think it's,
I think it's,
I think it's right.

168
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.110
You look like you're about one 90 now,
right?
Yeah.
I'm just about,

169
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.700
I'm about one 85,
one 86.
Um,

170
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.310
which is normally what I would be about getting ready for a 55 pound fight to,

171
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.510
um,
actually when I stepped into the cage,
I was lighter,
uh,

172
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.720
going into this fight than it was for some of my,
my 55 pounds fights.

173
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.710
Um,
yeah,
I walked in about one 81.
Um,

174
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.520
and like for the 25 was one 84.
So,
you know,

175
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.300
that 25 was a mess because of the staff,
right?
Like,
yeah,
that's,

176
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:02.660
you guys have a decision where you had to make,
whether you're not,

177
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.830
you're going to pull out of the fight.
Yeah.
I mean,

178
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.960
I tried my best to keep it from everybody.
So in our kind of succeeded in it.

179
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.620
Um,
I mean really the only one,
something over it at the weigh ins,
right?
Yeah.

180
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:18.150
Put a makeup by the Suzy,
the girl.
She,
uh,
she did it for me,

181
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.450
but you know,
that really just made the,
the,
the,

182
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.280
the weight cut and then my body much worse.
I mean,

183
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.360
I don't really look at the fight in say that Tony's a dog and I kind of give

184
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:31.620
that to him,
you know,
kind of,
uh,
uh,
I learned a lot about myself from,

185
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.100
from that fight even,
uh,
and then fights after that.

186
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.120
I've had a lot of tough way because going into himself,
I don't really,
uh,

187
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.420
I don't really put too much in the first round though,
man.
Before you got tired,

188
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.110
you had a mounted,
it was a,
it was a big first round for you.
Yeah.

189
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.300
Yeah.
But that was one of the fights where I,

190
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.960
if I would've listened to rob in that fight,

191
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.200
I would already be the champion and then everything would look different.

192
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:58.830
You know,
I would already fought McGregor by now.
Uh,
and then the whole sport,

193
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:02.820
would it look different?
I think,
uh,
but I didn't listen to him and I,

194
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.240
did he tell you that you didn't listen to?
He tried to tell me to calm down.

195
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.010
Like when you see me,

196
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:12.780
like walk out for that fight I was on that wouldn't even like on 10,
I was on 12.

197
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.850
I was on 12 from the morning that I woke up until,

198
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.910
you know,
the,
until the fight ended.
Uh,

199
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.030
and that adrenaline pumping that,
I mean,
I,

200
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.060
I never felt like that since.
I probably don't,

201
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.430
I don't really want to feel like that either.
Uh,

202
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.430
I was when I stepped into the arena that night,
you know,

203
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:34.890
we get there about two hours before the fight actually is going on.

204
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.000
I was ready to fight and when I was warming up,
I was ready to fight.

205
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.420
I was fighting people in the bag.
There was no warm up.
There was no warm up.

206
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.080
I was fighting.
No.
How much did that staff fuck with you?

207
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.800
I think it put me into a state of fight or flight because you were compromised

208
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.470
for days before,
you know,
not even just that,
that,
you know,

209
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:00.820
the day of the fight for me in a state for for days before where it made the

210
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:04.360
weight cut.
Uh,
so horrible.
Like,

211
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.110
because my body just trying to hold on to everything and trying to,
you know,

212
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.450
when I woke up that morning,

213
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.430
I was about one 62 I woke up at 5:00 AM Wayne's are at 9:00 AM I have to be one

214
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:19.000
55.
So I've got seven pounds to to cut in,

215
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.560
which is okay.
It's not too bad.
Cut about nine pounds of the day before.

216
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.970
I'm a little dehydrated.
I'm a little,
you know,
I'm a little already worn.

217
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.060
But uh,
as the way cut was going,
you know,

218
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:34.210
we got till about eight o'clock and I had only cut a pound and a half,

219
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.220
so I still want 61 in a half something at eight o'clock Wayne's or at nine

220
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:42.100
o'clock to the point where we got to do something.

221
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:47.130
So they start to put me in the bathtub just because we do most of our cuts in

222
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.590
the bath.
You know,
when you,
when you're in a high humidity,
you,

223
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.690
you're going to cut more water weight or are you going to sweat more?
Uh,

224
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.710
and water is obviously a hundred percent humidity.
Um,

225
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.270
so they start throwing bull and hot water because we couldn't get the water hot

226
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:05.370
enough to make me sweat Christ.
So we've just taken a kettles of,

227
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:08.920
of hot water and just pouring it on me.
Uh,
and you know,

228
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:13.570
doctors are in and out his twin 12 people in and out of the hotel room to make

229
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.600
sure I'm okay and to makes sure that I could cut the weight.

230
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.730
And I was just in such a,

231
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:23.330
like an adrenaline fucking like on 10.
I'm like,
just get on.

232
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.400
You know,
I'm screaming at everybody.
I literally,
I was in the tub,

233
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:31.450
I was crying like,
why?
But to me,
I was like,

234
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.480
there's no way I'm not making this weight and six pounds in about an hour,

235
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.910
maybe two hours,
cause that go wait in about nine o'clock or so.
Uh,
or I mean,
uh,

236
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.420
about nine 30,
10 or so,
um,

237
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.350
six pounds in two hours.
This,
it was brutal,

238
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.990
but I think that just kept me as such a,

239
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.540
such a 10 on my adrenaline level.

240
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.280
I never really understood how to bring it back down,
you know?
And,

241
00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:01.480
and rob would try and talk to me and try and tell me like,
hey,
calm down.
Like,

242
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.060
you know,
take a few deep breaths.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
I'm breathing.

243
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.800
Whatever I'm wet,
I wouldn't listen to it.

244
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.780
So now when did you know you had staff?
Uh,
the Sunday.

245
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.650
The Sunday of the fight.
Yeah.
On Day of the fight.

246
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.020
So you had a whole week to think about it almost.
Yeah.
I mean,

247
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.770
I think about it like that as to be honest with you.
Yeah.

248
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.720
Which just notice I noticed like a little,
uh,

249
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.050
just the bump and it,

250
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.140
and it got like really big and I thought a spider had bitten me or something.
Um,

251
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.920
and you know,
for,
for Sunday,
I just Kinda,
you know,
I didn't think about it.

252
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.450
I wasn't trained in that day,
so it was nothing.
When I went in on Monday,
uh,

253
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.810
Dewey was actually the one,
uh,
Dewey Cooper,
my striking coach.

254
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.990
He was the one that kind of notice it.
And he was like,
Hey,
is that all right?

255
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:47.770
And you know,
uh,
and then rob,
when he took a look at it,
he was like,
oh yeah,

256
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.740
that's that staff for sure.
And,
uh,
you know,
I just kind of,

257
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.750
what do you do when that happens if you can't,

258
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.140
if you decided not to take antibiotics.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what do you do?

259
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.740
I roughed it.
I was like,
you didn't put anything topical on it or was there,

260
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.710
was there a scratch that got infected or cut?
Honestly,
I have no idea what that,

261
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.160
just,
when I woke up on Sunday,
it was just,

262
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.010
was sticking out of my chest till about a boat right here in it.

263
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.720
I thought it was a spider bite or something,
you know,

264
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:19.130
I had never really had staff like that before.
Um,
I knew guys who had headed,

265
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.140
especially through college wrestling,
uh,

266
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:26.120
those rooms are just so dirty and filthy.
Um,
that I seen other people with it,

267
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.690
but it didn't look like that,
you know what I mean?
Normally look like a,
a a yard.

268
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.540
Um,
you know,

269
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.020
you have an open wound or something and then that'll get yellow and pissy and

270
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.780
disgusting.
But this was underneath my skin,

271
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.910
so it was not like an open wound or anything.
Um,

272
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.290
when I talk to doctors they said it was just on the layer of muscle,

273
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:49.610
I guess or or something.
Um,
and kind of sticking out from it.
Um,

274
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.610
at the time I didn't really know what that meant.

275
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.080
Like he said it was staff and I was like,
okay,
you know,
like I still feel good.

276
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.170
Like I could still move around.
Like we hit pads that day.
I've still felt good,

277
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.990
you know,
I can,
I was like,
I'm showing up to fight,
you know,
I,

278
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.050
when I was doing something,
anything on it or there's no,

279
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.640
so for six days he just trained and did everything with that staff.

280
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.130
And that was kind of like the last thing on my mind.

281
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.340
Even know I was there to fight when I,
when I,
when I signed the contract,
I,

282
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.710
I'm showing up to the fight.
Like I haven't pulled out of a fight yet.
Uh,

283
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.640
when I say I'm gonna do something,
I'm,
I'm going,

284
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.320
I'm going to go ahead and do it regardless of if my leg was halfway falling off.

285
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.300
It's like,
shit,
I still got another one.
You know,

286
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:31.840
I still got five more tells on the other leg,
so.
Right.

287
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.160
But looking back on it now,

288
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:37.100
are you happy that you made the decision that you made?
Oh yeah.
It wasn't smart,

289
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.100
but you know,
you would've done it again tomorrow.
Yeah,

290
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.980
I would have done it again.
Yeah,
no doubt.
No doubt.
I mean,

291
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.820
first world title fight,
you know,
to do anything to prevent staff.

292
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:49.070
Do you use like defense soap or anything like that?
Yeah.

293
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.480
Ever since he actually hooked me up with,
uh,
with those guys.
A defense.
Uh,

294
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.900
glad you did that.
Yeah.
They've been great to celebrate.
Uh,
I shot the guy.
Yeah.

295
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.490
Yeah,
that's Taco there also.
So now I'd just take way more preventive.
Uh,

296
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.150
uh,
yeah,

297
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.180
I haven't had anything flare up on me since probiotics here and there,

298
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:10.310
here and there.
I a good way to prevent that as well.

299
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:13.280
It also helps prevent ringworm.
I try,

300
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:16.310
I try my best to eat as many natural foods,
uh,

301
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.540
in especially like a lot of yogurts and Kiefer's one of them.
Cool.
Uh,
so,

302
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.640
you know,
I try and stay on top of it and uh,

303
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:26.390
at least I not know flare up has been happening since,
you know,

304
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:29.330
I shower every time.
I make sure like I'm on top of it.

305
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:33.170
I'll make sure I break my soap in the shower because you don't want that again.

306
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.280
It's mostly the,
the,
you know.
Yeah.
The fight didn't go my way or whatever.
Uh,

307
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.110
but it was about three or four weeks after that fight where I was just random.

308
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.040
I was wrecked.
I was just don't worship ever.
And when,
when,

309
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.100
when I got on those antibiotics,
I just fucking kills people.
Styling stuff kills.

310
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.460
Yeah.
It was terrible.

311
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.610
<v 0>People that ignore staff,
I want to scream at him.
I'm like,
listen man,</v>

312
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.580
you could die this.
It seems like you just got an infection,

313
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:57.810
but that shit gets systemic.

314
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.390
It gets in your bloodstream and you could fucking die.

315
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.890
One of my friend Brian Collins,

316
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.090
friend's wife died and he went over the house and she was like,

317
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120
you know,
some people get crazy with holistic stuff.
Oh,

318
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.280
she's just going to try and natural healing.
And he's like,

319
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.780
get her do a fucking doctor.
He's like,
her gums were bleeding Jesus.
Yeah.

320
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.770
It had gotten systemic and she wound up dying.
Geez.
Yeah,
man.
From staff.

321
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.490
I've had it twice.
And,
uh,
the first time I had at,

322
00:18:22.491 --> 00:18:27.390
I see when I got on the antibiotics,
first of all the antibiotics just kick ass.

323
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.220
The fact that Luke Rockhold won the fucking title against Chris Weidman while he

324
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:36.290
was on antibiotics shows you what a stud that guy is.
Yeah.

325
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.280
Cause that shit kicks your ass.
He had,

326
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.390
he had staff when he fought Weidman and to know that actually,
yeah,

327
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:43.860
he was wrecked.
Wrecked.

328
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.940
<v 1>Oh No,
no.
Sorry.
Botics mess you up bad.</v>

329
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.280
I've done it once for like a sore throat or,
or something.
Uh,
earlier,
um,

330
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.470
couple of years ago and it just wrecked me bad.

331
00:18:53.471 --> 00:18:55.210
So I knew like going into that fight,
I was like,

332
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.510
I'd rather have the staff than the antibiotics.
I was like,

333
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.010
I have asked that before.
I've had antibodies.
I know what they gonna do to me.

334
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.780
<v 0>I was thinking that when you fought and afterwards talking to you about it,</v>

335
00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:09.260
I think you probably made the right move to not do antibiotics.
But I don't know,

336
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.430
I'm not a doctor,
but I was thinking that,
that it just weakens you so much.

337
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.790
<v 1>You know,
it's just you live and learn from these things.
I think,
you know,</v>

338
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:20.260
and this is just part of the,
the journey.

339
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.320
And before I would have like that where I wanted everything to be perfect or,

340
00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:29.300
and I wanted everything to kind of be the way I saw it,
you know,
uh,

341
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.700
especially like starting out the career,

342
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:34.090
like everybody wants to be Floyd and when you 50 and know and,
and it's just,

343
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.130
you're not getting touched and it's just easy.

344
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.450
But then when you take a look back at that and you don't see like how many

345
00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:43.450
amateur fights Floy head,
you know,
he's got his dad who fought,

346
00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:45.850
he's got his uncles and his whole family had been fighting.

347
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.170
So He's learned from all their mistakes and all their losses and everything to

348
00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:53.080
where it's like I'm the first one in my family to even ever think about this.

349
00:19:53.081 --> 00:19:56.990
So you're going bump your head a here and there,
and it just says

350
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.510
<v 0>comparison is the thief of joy.
You can't,</v>

351
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.681
you can't do that.

352
00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:07.060
You've got to just think about being the best that it is hard.

353
00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:11.800
It's very hard to be inspired by people,
but comparing yourself to their path,

354
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.740
everybody's got a different path.
Everyone's got different genetics,
right?

355
00:20:14.741 --> 00:20:16.900
Some people are just better at certain things.
Some people are,

356
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.280
some people struggle with certain aspects of the sport.
I mean that's,
it's,

357
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.840
everyone's got their own individual challenge and it's one of the things that's

358
00:20:22.841 --> 00:20:25.720
so interesting about it is watching people adapt and grow.

359
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.600
And so you're in that stage right now,
right?
You're still young.

360
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.690
You're still a top contender is still one of the best fighters in the division,

361
00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:33.920
and you just have to kind of figure out what you're going to do and how are you

362
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:36.430
going to do it.
So what are you thinking right now?

363
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.000
<v 1>So I'm leaving a straight from here.
I'm going to go to Phoenix,
uh,</v>

364
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.700
for about a week and work with John Child Crouch.
Great.
Yeah.
Love that guy.
Yeah,

365
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.520
he's great and outstanding.
Even seeing the way his coach has died,

366
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.210
I've never worked with them before,
but we have a mutual kind of respect.
Um,

367
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:56.680
I fought a couple of his guys before and,
and,
uh,
so he's definitely some masters.

368
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.970
He's one of the guys I want to pick his brain a in.

369
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.860
I kind of want to go to a couple of different places and just see how they are.

370
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.240
You know,
I'm gonna go from there to,
uh,

371
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.420
to Colorado and worked with Trevor Whitman.
Excellent.
Um,

372
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.680
and then go right to a Montreal and work with [inaudible].
That's what's up.

373
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.350
I love three though.
All three of maker great minds.
Um,

374
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.490
as I go to each place,

375
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:21.370
I'm gonna kind of see what I like and what I don't like about each one.
You know,

376
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:26.350
and see how they see how everything is there,
you know,
the life and,
you know,

377
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.100
uh,
w what training partners in,

378
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.020
in all these other things because that's just as important too,
so

379
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.880
<v 0>absolutely.
Yeah.
I think also a shock to the system is important.
Like moving,</v>

380
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.070
going to a new camp,
going into a new environment because you want,

381
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.850
you want to shine and all of a sudden you realize like,
man,

382
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.390
everything's on the line here.
Like you've literally uprooted your life,

383
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.820
move to some new place,
and it makes you be more dedicated.

384
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.260
It makes you realize you can't just fuck off here.
Like this is,

385
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.340
this is the real world.
You're a real world class fighter and you're,

386
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.180
you're on your path to attempt to become a world champion.

387
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.620
And this is the best way to do it.

388
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.790
I think it's so critical for fighters to make decisions and make changes and

389
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:11.470
make moves when they know that they,
they have a missing piece of the puzzle.

390
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.800
You know,
they're the Ma,
they're missing a master coach or they're missing a,

391
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.940
you know,
a great wrestling coach or a great striking,
cool,
whatever,

392
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.370
whatever the fuck it is.
A great environment with world class fighters,

393
00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:24.130
whatever it is.
Have you talked to Jackson's?

394
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:25.480
Have you talked to those guys at all?

395
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.650
<v 1>I haven't.
Um,
but you know,</v>

396
00:22:27.651 --> 00:22:30.860
I know a brain Gibson down there and I've been wanting to work with him for his

397
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:35.850
excellent long time.
Yeah.
Um,
I might,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know.
Uh,

398
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.920
this is,
this,

399
00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:40.760
this little trip is going to take up six weeks at a time and then I figured when

400
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:44.420
I get back to Vegas and kind of regroup and be able to make some decisions from

401
00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:46.910
narrow in on what's going to happen,
um,

402
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.310
I haven't done something like this until I,

403
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.960
since I've moved to Vegas in the first place where I just kind of packed up my

404
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:57.050
car and just start driving west.
Uh,
and you know,

405
00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.030
was sleeping out on my corner before that,
I was still in Detroit from Detroit,

406
00:23:02.031 --> 00:23:06.710
right to Vegas.
I was still in college when I got the call.
So,
you know,

407
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.300
that was like the time where I'm like,

408
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.670
I don't know which way my life is going to go.
You know,
I had,

409
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.910
I had got done with the fight with an owl.

410
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.450
I acquaint to my debut and after that fight I was like,

411
00:23:17.451 --> 00:23:19.430
I gotta make some changes.
I just didn't know what.

412
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.690
And that was just as scary a time as now,
you know,

413
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.650
even though now like I ain't,
I ain't sleeping on my car,
you know what I mean?
I,

414
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.430
and I eat whatever I can.
I get you some Nice,
uh,
I can go to restaurants and,

415
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.690
you know,
but it still kinda feels the same,
you know,
it's still that same,

416
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.990
uh,
is scary,
you know,

417
00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:41.480
and no lie because I don't necessarily know what it's gonna look like,

418
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.040
but I never really let that stop me.
The,
so what about top team?

419
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.740
<v 2>You've thought about</v>

420
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.120
<v 1>dot all I have.
I mean,
I know a lot of guys that moved down to Florida.</v>

421
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.320
Um,
you know,
the problem with Florida's is he's too nice suits.
Nice.

422
00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.630
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's still like really crazy freaks down there.
But you know,

423
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.180
people say the same thing about Vegas too though.
You know,

424
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.700
when I first moved to Vegas,
uh,

425
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.060
I think Dana had did an interview or something maybe like a month after I moved

426
00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:12.570
there and he was saying how hard it is for fighter to make it from Vegas.

427
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.000
And even at the time I was like,
no,
really nothing to me.
Like I don't really,

428
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.470
I try to stay focused,
you know,
I mean I,
I try and keep a bigger,
bigger picture,

429
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.190
uh,
in my head.
I don't really let the shit get to me too much.

430
00:24:26.191 --> 00:24:27.800
So if I do move down to Florida,

431
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.890
I don't think I'm a just be on a beach kind of sat back.
I see some guys do it,

432
00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:32.281
you know what I mean?

433
00:24:32.281 --> 00:24:36.900
I've seen guys moved down there and just get caught up in that lifestyle of

434
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.670
sitting back as just,

435
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.700
<v 2>it seems to me that Vegas,
if you stay away from this trip,
you'd be all right.</v>

436
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.950
Yeah.
But Miami's the whole strip.
Yeah,
true.

437
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.440
Might be a little harder.
It's everything.
It's all of Miami.

438
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.710
And that's the attitude down there.
Everybody just parties,
Matt.

439
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.750
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's everybody else too.
That's,
it's a big influence.
Harris</v>

440
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.950
<v 2>from a,
what is this a pro production inside with a fighter's life?</v>

441
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.950
Is that what it is?
A 95,
five minute fighting anatomy of a fighter.

442
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.620
He was just telling me about it.

443
00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:11.960
He just went down there and he was thinking about moving there until like,

444
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:14.540
he spent like four days there and he's like,
get the fuck outta here.

445
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.930
I can't live here.
This is crazy.
These people are crazy.
He said,

446
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:19.880
you should need a passport.
I'm like,
that's what I would say.

447
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.420
It's like a different words.
A different country there.

448
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.350
It's a party country down there.

449
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.680
<v 1>I've,
I've only been once to Miami.
Uh,
I've got a cousin that litter and uh,</v>

450
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.740
I mean I went out with the intention of partying,
but I was like,
whoa.

451
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.340
<v 2>I mean obviously it's looked good on it tomorrow.
Uzman mom lives there.</v>

452
00:25:36.341 --> 00:25:37.780
You can be a champion out of there.

453
00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:40.390
Robbie Lawler's from there you can be a champion out there.

454
00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:43.670
It's one of the best gyms in the world,
but it's in terms of distraction,

455
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.850
<v 1>it does the hard part for,
for uh,</v>

456
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.390
places like that is I'm missing that mind.
Do you know what I mean?
Uh,

457
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:53.060
they got a lot of great fighters Downer and they got a lot of,

458
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.410
I feel like the training and in,
in the uh,
uh,

459
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.620
atmosphere and you know,
the train of partners and everything would be great.

460
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:05.420
But I'm missing that,
that,
that great mind.
And,
and you know,
Mike Brown,
I,
I've,

461
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.630
I've met Mike a few times and there was,
this guy goes back,

462
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.100
but we haven't really like,

463
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.530
<v 2>yeah,
she has a conversation with him,
have a conversation with him too.
I mean,</v>

464
00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:16.370
if you want to really decide what clicks with you better.
I'm,

465
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.640
I'm a big fan of Mike Brown and obviously Ricardo Laborio was fantastic,

466
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:22.470
Jujitsu coach and,
you know,
and I'm,

467
00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:25.320
I'm just a whole fan of the whole organization,
you know,

468
00:26:25.321 --> 00:26:27.420
when the way they put it together,
you know.

469
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.510
<v 1>Mm.
Yeah.
I mean,
it could be a,
it might be something that I might look at.</v>

470
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:35.480
You know,
it may,
maybe towards the end of the summer or something like that,

471
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:39.290
kind of already got this trip,
uh,
set in plants.
So I'm just like,

472
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.870
I'm about to pull the trigger on it and see where to take me.

473
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.960
<v 0>Beautiful.
Wow.
I'm very glad that you're doing that.
You're making changes and,</v>

474
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:49.860
and,
and trying to see,
you know,
where the right spot is for you.

475
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.200
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
uh,
uh,
immediately after the fight is like when it,</v>

476
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:59.100
when it doesn't go your way or the way you,
that you necessarily see it is,

477
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.950
it's discouraging is all hail,
you know,
you're like,
fuck,

478
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:04.770
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.
I don't know if I'm seeing him right.

479
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:09.000
You know?
Uh,
before the fight in the locker room,

480
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.430
and this doesn't happen very often,
but I just,

481
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.730
I felt like I was seeing certain things and,
and,

482
00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:17.670
and I don't necessarily,

483
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:21.630
I'm not a religious guy like that or anything and I don't really like believe
in,

484
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.420
I don't necessarily know what,
but when,

485
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.780
when certain things started to click for me,

486
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.740
like when you're on your way to work and you just like you hitting every green

487
00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:33.870
light and then like,
you know,
somebody comes up to you,

488
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:35.670
they're going to say something,
you know what they're going to say,

489
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.160
and then you've got the,
the,
the time for the perfect answer.

490
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.990
It was kind of like that type of,
of,
of,
of feeling that I was having.

491
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.050
So I just felt like everything was like coming together.
Right.

492
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:50.100
And my confidence was like boosting up so much before going,
you know,

493
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:52.820
I think the warm up was perfect.
The weight cut was,
you know,

494
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.430
it really wasn't a weight cut is everything was perfect going into the fight.

495
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.930
So then when it didn't go my way,
it's like,
it was discouraging a little bit.

496
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:03.570
You know what I mean?
I was like,
fuck,

497
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:07.200
I didn't know what I necessarily was doing wrong or,
or,

498
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.030
or if I was on the right path,
you know?
But

499
00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.920
<v 0>which leads you to think that you need a coach.
Yeah.</v>

500
00:28:11.921 --> 00:28:15.320
I need somebody smarter than me.
That's just the

501
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.310
man of everybody's smarter than you.
That's not you.

502
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.950
They can see you in a way that you can see.
Yeah.
Yeah.

503
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.130
Your friends are always smarter than you.
It's just,
hey man,

504
00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:30.550
you got to stop doing that.
Really?
Yeah,
man.
You're fucking up like really?

505
00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.510
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
You don't see it cause I'm in it.

506
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.630
Like how do I know that's his life,
man.
That's life.
I mean,

507
00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:41.080
it's so important to have people around you that understand you and know you.

508
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.330
Yeah.
If you don't have.

509
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:47.350
And then also someone that you really trust and appreciate as a coach.

510
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.030
So gigantic man.

511
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.450
<v 1>Yeah.
I think,
and especially for fighting because fighting is such a,</v>

512
00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.750
a personal thing to me.
You know?
It's not like,

513
00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.080
that's why I never really worked with,
uh,
any of the guys at the UFC.
Pei,

514
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.720
like they've got everything there and they've got,
you know,

515
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.280
and even the coaches are great and all,
but it's like,
I need that.

516
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.450
I need to be able to trust you with my life.
Like that's really what it is.

517
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.460
Like no one's died inside the octagon yet.
But knock on wood,
knock on wood.
Yeah,

518
00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:20.010
this nice table.
Oh Shit.
I had a lot of crazy fights,
you know?

519
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.330
So when I get up,
get ready to do it,

520
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.710
I go into it with that expectation.
You know,
if you're the one,

521
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.850
you don't care how many people haven't died doing it,
you know,
you're,

522
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.010
it's hundred percent for you,
the chances.

523
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.190
So I need to be able to trust every,

524
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.860
I need to trust you with my life almost,
you know?
And uh,
you know,
it's,

525
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.100
it's

526
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.120
<v 3>hard to find that though.</v>

527
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.120
<v 0>The reason why I recommended for us a hobby is,
first of all,</v>

528
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:47.790
he's one of the smartest guys I've ever talked to him.

529
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:49.390
It was for us as it fucking genius.

530
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.500
Legitimate Genius knows everything about MMA.

531
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.820
I mean there's not a stone unturned.
And he coached GSP.

532
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.440
And I feel like your style and GSP style are very similar and that you both are

533
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:05.590
very good wrestlers and you both very good at mixing up the wrestling and the

534
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:09.550
striking or you don't see anything,
you don't know what's coming and you're both,

535
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.730
you both don't have any weaknesses.
You have an awesome submission game.

536
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.150
GSP as an awesome submission game.
You have great wrestling,
great striking.

537
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.290
It's very similar.

538
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.460
And I think that his experience and coaching,

539
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:25.300
one of the greatest of all time and George St Pierre would,
would lend,

540
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.220
would just slide right into coaching someone like you.
I really,

541
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.610
<v 3>I believe that.
Yeah.
I think for Ra as I'm getting closer to it,
you know,</v>

542
00:30:31.611 --> 00:30:36.020
I'll know more when I,
when I get there,
but that's the last stop.
Yeah,
stop on it.

543
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.240
That's the best stop.
And kind of the longest of it too.
Yeah.

544
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.530
I kind of had already thought that if I was a young man and I was thinking about

545
00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:47.210
fighting,
I think I'd moved to Montreal.
Yeah.
No,
I think he's got a special mind.

546
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.553
I do.

547
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.550
<v 0>You know,
and I,
and I,</v>

548
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.920
and it's not to take away from any of the brilliant coaches.
I mean,

549
00:30:51.921 --> 00:30:55.320
I think you can be a world champion with Duke Roufus who's also brilliant guy

550
00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:58.680
and an amazing coach.
I mean,
there's no bad stop for you,

551
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.310
but there's just something about you and for us,
a hobby that I just,

552
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.550
<v 3>yeah,
when I met him,
uh,
and I sat next to him,
we had dinner together.</v>

553
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.470
Soon as I sat down next to him,

554
00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:12.290
he told me everything I did wrong and atony fight like right out the gate.

555
00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:17.060
And I was like,
Bingo.
Right.
I mean,
he's but genius.
He's sharp.

556
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.980
He's smart.
Yeah.
Uh,
so yeah,
I mean,
but then again,

557
00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:22.880
Whitman,
I,
I've,

558
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.710
I've worked with Whitman to in Whitman is a really experienced dude.
You know,

559
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.840
he's,
he's coached so many people,

560
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:33.110
you see so many different styles and done it himself a lot too.
So,

561
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.130
you know what I love about Whitman,
when Justin gauge the flat lines,
people,

562
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.130
Whitman acts like nothing even happened.
Yeah.
It was like,

563
00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:42.200
he knew it was going to happen.
It's crazy.

564
00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:44.780
Like everybody's jumping and cheering and women like,
Yup.

565
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.660
I think it's cause he's saying so many,

566
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.590
he may have had been on the other side of that too,
where you know,

567
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.250
it's your guy getting knocked out too.
So,
you know,
it's like you said,

568
00:31:55.251 --> 00:31:57.320
it's two people going in there.
If somebody got to lose.

569
00:31:57.321 --> 00:32:01.250
So He's been around the game long enough to where he understands the other side

570
00:32:01.251 --> 00:32:04.620
of it too,
as you know,
he ain't going to go crazy.
And you know,
uh,

571
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.610
because that guy's got a family,
that guy's got people they try and take care of.

572
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.240
He's got every other motivation that you got to,
you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

573
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.540
Um,
I think Dell is also the culture shock.

574
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:22.070
Moving to Montreal will be good for it too.
Yeah.
I mean maybe,
uh,

575
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.250
I bet I spent some time

576
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.650
<v 4>cold as fuck.
So I left Detroit.
Yeah.</v>

577
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.720
Oh no worries.
Oh my God.
I've been to Montreal and January.
It's like,
yikes.

578
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.720
That's outside.
You got that thick fog coming out of your mouth.
Good.

579
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.820
Whew.
That's,
I'm going to Joe

580
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 3>now and June.
But for you,
man,
I think it's good for you.</v>

581
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:47.000
I feel like that that coal,
my,
it might be something today,
you know,

582
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:50.210
the best wrestlers and everything are always from the Midwest and in from net

583
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:53.480
code.
And you know why?
Because he developed character.
Yeah.

584
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.770
I think it is something to that it's 100% soft ask people out here in college

585
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.530
when Bro.
Yeah.
Vegas.

586
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:03.960
No difference by all my friends from Boston that come out to California.

587
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.780
People are fucking soft out here.
Yeah.

588
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.140
They don't have to shovel snow and have to worry about freezing to death.

589
00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.200
You know,
if your car breaks down in Boston,
you 10 miles from your house,

590
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:16.550
you might freeze to death.
Yeah.
That's real.
That's real.

591
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:18.590
You better keep a blanket in that bitch.
Yeah.

592
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.870
You've got to be tough and sleeping bag and a candle.

593
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.110
And I think it gives you like different,
different morals and different lights,

594
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.660
different character to you.
You know,
you,
you,
you,

595
00:33:28.661 --> 00:33:32.150
you value things a little bit differently.
So in that code,
you know,

596
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.200
Detroit was the same way.

597
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.260
It's like seven months out the year and you spending that time indoors in unity.

598
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:42.290
It's like your family and everything cause you ain't going to be inside with

599
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.520
some fucking Schmo from down the street and you don't want to count on each

600
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:50.030
other too when it gets fucking cold.
Yeah.
Cause everybody's in this together.

601
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.050
Literally,
literally all his fucking coal.
We ain't going up there.

602
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:59.051
It's also like a a vulnerability to nature that just forces you to accept your

603
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:03.350
place in the universe like you are.
You are vulnerable.
You're very vulnerable.

604
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.440
In California,
your wife could kick you out.
You're like,
fuck you bitch.

605
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.490
I'll sleep on the lawn.

606
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.730
You can go sleep in the law and you don't have to worry about nothing.
You know,

607
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.570
you'd be fine.

608
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.160
January you could sleep on the lawn with a good jacket on in California was

609
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.760
gorgeous too.
You can just get in your car,
just drive down to the beach and yeah,

610
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.580
exactly.
She live in in a mean to me,

611
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:26.390
I think it's paradise but too easy.
But then you talk to people who,

612
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.240
they spent their whole life here and they don't see it that way.

613
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:32.690
So maybe it's all perfect.
Brazil.
I mean,
how bad ass or people from Brazil,

614
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.380
and that's fucking paradise too.
Yeah.
But it's rough,
rough paradise.

615
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.300
It's a little different down in Brazil,
you know,
I think a lot of crime.
Yeah.

616
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:45.410
I get them.
Resilience,
a lot of respect.
They,
they,
you know,
some of them,

617
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.640
they really,
uh,
they come up out of nothing,
you know,

618
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:51.170
and literally out of nothing.

619
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.170
And to build that respect around a they community and stuff.
I give it to them.

620
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.600
I do as well.
And you know,

621
00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:59.330
you've got to give it up to them for creating Brazilian Jujitsu.
I mean,
they,

622
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:02.570
they essentially revolutionized Jujitsu.
Yeah.
I mean the,
the,

623
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.470
the Gracie family is the most important family in the history of martial arts

624
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.100
and what they did with Brazil and Brazilian Jujitsu and how Brazilian Jujitsu

625
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.110
evolved in that country.
You know,
just,
they took to it like a duck to water man.

626
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.060
Yeah.
I wonder what it is about,
uh,
Brazil that,
that,

627
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.910
that was like the one place to stay.
You know,
I,
I think that if they,

628
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:25.850
if that count,
my ada had gone anywhere else.

629
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.810
If he had landed and talked to some other dudes somewhere,

630
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.220
I think they got lucky.

631
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:35.320
They found Alien Gracie and Carlos Gracie and they found some dudes who would

632
00:35:35.321 --> 00:35:38.280
just straight up warriors and they taught those guys.

633
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.680
<v 0>And those guys were,
I mean,
Leo Gracie,</v>

634
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:45.390
just really him and Carlos just thought it through and then we're willing to

635
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.690
test it in real competition against people much larger than them.

636
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.520
The fact that Leo was a small man,
he wasn't a large framed man,

637
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.900
is the reason why Brazilian Jujitsu became so effective because Leo had to fight

638
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:02.200
off of his back.
He had a tire out bigger guys.
First they had,
uh,
developed,
uh,

639
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.710
the concept of cooking your opponent.
You know,

640
00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:08.400
all that wasn't in Japanese Jujitsu.
It wasn't in judo.

641
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.900
Judo is a beautiful,

642
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.160
elegant martial arts with fantastic technique and powerful moves,

643
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:16.770
but wasn't Brazilian Jujitsu.

644
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.720
Brazilian Jujitsu is largely a part of this one dynamic,
incredible family.

645
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:22.830
And if you look at that family,

646
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.100
all the fucking champions Hoists Horian Hixon you know,

647
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:33.720
I mean,
come on Matt Hoy crazy and now crone.

648
00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:38.070
Yeah,
I mean Jesus Christ.
What a fucking family man.
Hens.

649
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.740
So yeah.
Yeah,
I mean high end.

650
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:43.290
I mean just it just Gracie after Gracie,

651
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.370
you saw Gracie like oh no killers.
Just straight killers.

652
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.180
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean the game has changed a little bit.
It says,</v>

653
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.400
don't forget Carlson Gracie to the game of shades,
a little bit system.

654
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.510
But it has been because of them.
I felt sure

655
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.650
<v 0>it's evolved in that area and sprung out.
And of course,
you know,</v>

656
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.450
obviously there's,
you know,
Moyie Thai from Thailand,
Dutch kickboxing,

657
00:37:07.451 --> 00:37:10.960
American wrestling,
there's so many different factors,
Russian wrestling,

658
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.440
so many different factors that come into what we now call mixed martial arts

659
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:15.730
today.
But man,

660
00:37:15.731 --> 00:37:19.750
I just keep thinking that if it wasn't for that one family who the fuck knows

661
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:24.400
because the part of what made the ultimate fighter so spectacular or the

662
00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:26.140
ultimate fighting championship rather in,

663
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.260
in the first two ones was hoists Gracie being this guy who's not this physically

664
00:37:32.771 --> 00:37:36.410
terrifying guy.
Like give it was Mark Coleman.
If Mark Coleman

665
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:43.960
to 65 with muscles up to his neck is straight up to the top of his head,

666
00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:48.640
his neck would just like come off of his shoulders.
He was huge.
If he won,

667
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:53.050
you'd be like,
yeah,
that makes sense.
But when hoists one,
everybody was like,
shit,

668
00:37:53.051 --> 00:37:56.590
I gotta learn Jiu Jitsu.
Yeah.
Like look,
that guy choked that dude out.
What?

669
00:37:56.591 --> 00:38:00.670
His legs?
Yeah.
Like I remember people at home were going,
what the fuck is this

670
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.820
<v 3>mixed fighting?
So great.
Cause you never know what's gonna,</v>

671
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.200
what's gonna happen in real fuck,
you know?
True.
Sure.
I mean,

672
00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:09.940
even in boxing until,
you know,
you see some,

673
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.530
some crazy shit like Anthony Joshua just beat.
Uh,
but it,
you know,

674
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.620
but I think in MMA it's,
it's,

675
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.690
it's even more just cause there's so many different options.

676
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:24.691
And I have a poem from a good source that Anthony Joshua got dropped in sparring

677
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.100
the week of the fight.
Wow.

678
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.160
And he got hurt real bad the week of the fight and that he was very tentative

679
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.080
coming into that fight and very vulnerable.

680
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v 2>Which makes sense.</v>

681
00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.460
<v 1>You could kind of see it on them a little bit.
You know,</v>

682
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:42.250
when first round when you,
when you even walking out,
you know,

683
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:43.390
you can kind of see his,

684
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.820
his look and it's a little glazed and it's a little a little out of it.
You know,

685
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.400
I figured that it was just coming over to America for the first time and you

686
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:55.090
know,
being in,
in,
in New York and,
uh,
it's a lot of,

687
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.630
that's a lot of pressure and a lot of,
uh,
you know,

688
00:38:58.631 --> 00:39:02.500
especially when you talk about Deontay Walder like knocking the dude into until

689
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:06.040
like the next century,
like the week before because you see,
oh,
you're like,
fuck,

690
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:06.650
I got a fight.

691
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.410
<v 2>Yeah.
Did you see that video that I posted on Instagram from the duty?</v>

692
00:39:09.411 --> 00:39:13.700
Does animation and Nona,
oh my God,
this is too amazing ones pull up.
First of all,

693
00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:18.560
pull up the Deontay wilder one cause he has a,
the the fucking glove from a,

694
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.110
the Avengers and he,
he hits this dude.
This guy did this.

695
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.510
Yeah,
Ray,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Not Credible.
Yeah,
he's crazy.

696
00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:30.280
That guy's animate on his graphics are amazing.
But uh,

697
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.940
he did one for Deontae and then he did an even more hilarious one for Andy Ruiz.

698
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.320
Oh my God.

699
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.540
<v 1>See the Andy?
I did see the one with the [inaudible].
Uh Oh you saw that one?</v>

700
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.290
<v 2>Okay,
so pull up,
pull up the Ruiz one then.
Yeah.
So you could see when he,</v>

701
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.610
when he drops Joshua,
watch this shit.
It's hilarious man.
The guy's so good.

702
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.110
Give us some volume too.

703
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.270
<v 5>Can we do that or was it the,</v>

704
00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:56.780
the soundtrack to do you think we'll get in trouble for that?

705
00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.890
<v 2>Yeah.
No volume.
All right.
No volume.
Just play the video.</v>

706
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.740
<v 5>Watch this.
So</v>

707
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.660
<v 2>is he even the way when you look in a Joshua after the faculty of this,</v>

708
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.360
and then if he,
his body,
his body's still there,

709
00:40:14.361 --> 00:40:18.890
but his spirit,
he's got a roller roller bag.

710
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.210
Let's go through the airport.

711
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.120
His spirit has got tweety birds floating around his head.
Why?
Anthony?

712
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:26.750
Joshua was still on the ground.
His spirit gets into a plane and flies away.

713
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.480
<v 1>That was awesome.
That guy.
That dude's awesome.
It's so amazing how he did that.</v>

714
00:40:33.481 --> 00:40:36.150
The next day,
the day after the fight that was out.

715
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.590
People are getting crazy or like what they can do.
Yeah.

716
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.970
It makes you jealous a little bit.
It's like,
I know.
Right.
You know,

717
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.130
wish I even had that kind of create a process to think it through it,

718
00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:49.060
let alone like go through with it,
you know?

719
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:53.500
<v 2>I know he brought that crazy.
That guy's a master though,
is his ability to,</v>

720
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:57.220
to here's the Deontay wilder one.
Yeah.

721
00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:01.300
I mean that is crazy.
And then when Deontae moves away with the eyes glowing,

722
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.190
that's awesome.

723
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.910
He has the craziest power I've ever seen in the heavyweight division.

724
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.550
He's so weird.
It's so weird.

725
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:13.240
His Pie and you know when he fought Tyson fury wait two oh nine yeah.

726
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.660
That's all I really,
two Oh nine wow.
Crazy.
Yeah.

727
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.670
And wasn't trying to be light either.
He just,

728
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:20.140
that's just what he wound up weighing.

729
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.540
<v 1>I think he's one of those guys.</v>

730
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:26.100
I can find your Chin like certain guys like have a weird kind of,
you know,

731
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.990
these kind of Ganglia.
Anyway,
but he,
he can,
they punches.

732
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.950
I coming from od and he goes,
he's got the power and everything too,

733
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.130
but it's more than power.

734
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 3>It's like he's fine.
Any a chin in there and it's good Chin finding intelligent.</v>

735
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah,
yeah.
He's got that home seeking missile.

736
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.690
You know the fact that he dropped Tyson fury like that in the 12th round of a

737
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:47.420
fight where he was kind of getting out box other than dropping him once,

738
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.510
but the way he hit him in that 12th round,
I was like,
God damn,

739
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:52.010
he knocked him out in the 12th round.

740
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.990
I look at that and I'm like to not get discouraged.
You know what I mean?

741
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:01.160
Like that's some serious belief in the type of power that you got.

742
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:06.350
If after 12 rounds you ain't landed the shot and you can still kind of muster it

743
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:11.150
up in in the 12th it's as a fighter.
I kind of look it down like damn.

744
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:14.310
Like that's a lot of of of you got to give it to them.

745
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.060
Like you can't take your hat off to him.
It's like he's got crazy endurance too.

746
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:17.691
That's the other thing.

747
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:21.260
He must have a phenomenal work ethic because he's never tired and he carries

748
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:23.640
that power deep into the 12th round.
Yeah.

749
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.950
The a lot of times guys that hit real hard like that,
after you get past six,

750
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:31.250
seven rounds,
they start to fade,
especially in the heavyweight division.

751
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.630
But Deontae moves just as fast hits just as hard in the 12th as he does in the

752
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:39.290
first.
It might be something to,
uh,
keeping keeping his weight to like that.

753
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:40.940
Like you said,
he's only 209 pounds.

754
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.850
He was heavier for this fight for the Dominic Brazil fight.
Apparently he was,

755
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:46.640
he was quite a bit heavier.
Uh,
how much of you do you think you,

756
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.870
I think it was two 30 or something that does a lot of weight.
Yeah.

757
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.800
See what he weighed a wood what?
Deontay wilder waitin for Dominic Brazil,

758
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.620
I think.
I think that I was kind of shocked that he was just somewhere in the two

759
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:02.210
thirties,
which is like a normal heavyweight.
Two 2123 Oh,
okay.

760
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.730
Okay.
Now much still still,
still,
still,
still a little bit of weight,

761
00:43:05.731 --> 00:43:08.390
but until someone's to 18 member when he was in his prime,

762
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.650
Tyson wasn't even two to 20.
Yeah.
That's what I mean.
I think it's,
uh,

763
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.390
it's definitely something to that,
you know,
maybe a,
uh,

764
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.860
that's just what their natural weight is.
You know,
I think it's,

765
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.510
as I'm getting a little bit more deeper into the game,
it might be some tasks.

766
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.250
One think I'm gonna stay at one 70.
Uh,
even from now,
I think you've,

767
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:31.790
you show up healthier and it's,
it's just if you got that experience,

768
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:34.640
if you've already been fighting a lot of heavyweights,
like I,
he has,

769
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.840
it's not like a 265 pounds,
dude is going to shock them.
You know what I mean?

770
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:42.300
Or to 40 or,
well,
it's also because there's no wrestling.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

771
00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:46.520
That it's,
it's a big factor in it.
Um,
yeah,
I think it's a giant factor.
Yeah.

772
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.430
But then again,
look at Cain Velasquez.
When Kane was at his prime,

773
00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:52.370
he was about two 40.
And you know,
when he fought Brock Lesnar,

774
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:55.620
Brock Lesnar was quite a bit bigger than him,
but it didn't matter.
I mean,

775
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.680
cane fault.
A lot of guys who are bigger than them.
Yeah.
The,
the wrestling is,

776
00:43:58.681 --> 00:44:03.050
is probably the biggest reason I think a lot of us cut weight in him and May for

777
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:06.530
sure.
I mean,
that's,
that's where,
uh,
that's where you can feel the most weight to,

778
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:09.090
you know,
when,
when I was going against,
uh,
the sod,
Josias,

779
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.550
it's like I didn't necessarily feel he was any stronger than me or any stronger

780
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:17.830
than any 55 pounder that have fought before.
Uh,
but when,

781
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.490
when I kind of would have them pressed or whatever and I could kind of feel the,

782
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:26.510
the,
the,
the weighted at,
uh,
you know,
all my back and,
and just carry it.

783
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.360
Um,
and it makes you expend more energy to,
you know,

784
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.170
I think it's like fighting with a pound vest on.
Yeah,

785
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.680
<v 1>exactly.
Yeah.
Wait,
when the fight was over,
he,</v>

786
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.030
that's the first thing you said to me.
He's like,
yeah,
I knew coming up to two,

787
00:44:38.031 --> 00:44:41.250
one 70,
just being your first fight that he was going to get tired.

788
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:42.260
And I was like,
Eh,

789
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.070
<v 0>I could have told me that before you with,</v>

790
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.550
they don't do me no good man.
He's got some phenomenal cardio though.

791
00:44:49.551 --> 00:44:53.240
And also he was coming off the [inaudible] fine.
Bustamante outworked him.
Yeah.

792
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.400
So he's probably like extra geared up.
Yep.

793
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.660
<v 1>And it was much bigger than me too,
you know.
And uh,
so he,
he,</v>

794
00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:02.100
he had already felt that.
Yeah.
And he's,
he's fought for the title that one seven.

795
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:03.870
He's got a lot of fights at one 70 already,

796
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.270
so he's already felt that that weight gone

797
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.600
<v 0>through.
Uh,
nick [inaudible] strength and conditioning routines.
You know,</v>

798
00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:12.760
he was a,
I don't know if he's still working with nick curse on,

799
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.230
but nick curse on was a Marv Marinovich disciple and just fun.

800
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.760
They do a lot of crazy box jumps and plyometrics.
You ever seen him on Instagram?

801
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.250
No.
No.
Go to a speed of sport on Instagram.

802
00:45:24.251 --> 00:45:28.630
I know he did a lot of work with Aaron Peko before Pico.
Went to cal Avida.

803
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.660
He was doing work with him.
He's done a lot of work with a lot of profilers.

804
00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:36.040
Did I think he worked with Joe Schilling and he's worked with a lot of guys,

805
00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:41.041
but wild strength and conditioning shit a lot apply owes a lot of box jumps in a

806
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:43.450
lot of crazy shit where you,
you know that,

807
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.560
that a calf raise bar and they,
they'll do that.

808
00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:51.040
But with your feet like kick it up and down and up and down.
Like let me see,

809
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.840
would see what you got there Jamie.

810
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.090
This is just some of the shit that he has people do.
Is this dose on Joe's?
Yeah.

811
00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.480
So he was,
I wonder if he was training with him for this fight,

812
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.450
but it's a lot of this type of shit.
It's a lot of uh,

813
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.880
explosive plyometric shit.

814
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.450
And his idea is that when you're in a fight,
see this thing,

815
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.300
like they're doing a lot of stuff with that thing and they'll do it laying on

816
00:46:13.301 --> 00:46:14.650
their back with their feet as well.

817
00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:18.040
But it's all this just explosive bouncing stuff.

818
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.980
And I mean his philosophy,

819
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:24.670
he doesn't ever have those guys lift weights like traditional lifting weights.

820
00:46:24.671 --> 00:46:29.560
It's all like Plyo box jumps,
exploding,
jumping over hurdles,
that kind of shit.

821
00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.000
Intense,
intense stuff.
But it's,

822
00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.380
that's the stuff that got Bj Penn into the best shape of his life.

823
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.090
When Bj Penn fought Sean Sherk,

824
00:46:37.091 --> 00:46:41.170
when Bj Penn fought Diego Sanchez when he was at the top of the food chain,

825
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.590
Bj was working with Marinovich his and he was doing all this crazy cardio

826
00:46:44.591 --> 00:46:49.570
workout,
which was like the missing link in Bj's arsenal because before Bj's is

827
00:46:49.571 --> 00:46:50.980
incredibly talented guy.

828
00:46:50.981 --> 00:46:54.760
But then he just didn't have the same kind of work ethic and cardio and he just

829
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.030
gave himself to Marinovich and just like,
go ahead dude,
tell me what to do.

830
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.840
And mostly what they were doing with strength and conditioning and they were

831
00:47:01.841 --> 00:47:06.310
saying basically Bj already knows how to fight and the real key was to get his

832
00:47:06.311 --> 00:47:09.280
gas tank is fucking thick and fat as possible.

833
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.720
Just give him this giant ass gas tank and give him this capacity to work.

834
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.260
That's just unprecedented to him.
And then everything else,

835
00:47:17.261 --> 00:47:19.690
he already knows how to do.
So everything else,
just do it light,

836
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:22.150
but don't compromise on the strength and conditioning workouts cause that's the

837
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:24.520
most important aspect of the sport.
And it's a very,

838
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:28.840
it's a very controversial discussion.
Well,
what's most important?
Yeah,

839
00:47:28.841 --> 00:47:29.980
I think need balance with

840
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.810
<v 1>it all,
you know,
so two by you as the cal vetoes methods,
uh,</v>

841
00:47:33.811 --> 00:47:37.510
for this one and came down to see him a couple times in Orange County.
Uh,

842
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.400
which stuff did he have you do?
That dude's a fucking,

843
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:43.000
he's a man of his workouts are brutal,

844
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.000
his ideas are,
are more,

845
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.380
he takes you to exhaustion and then we do stuff like that,

846
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:53.150
like the explosive stuff in,
in,
in,
uh,

847
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.450
different types of movements and you know,

848
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.730
kind of making sure that your legs are still underneath you,

849
00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.380
but he puts you on a bike and in that bike workout is,

850
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.980
it's like a 30 minute,
uh,
three minutes,
like keeping a hard,

851
00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:09.340
hard pace on like a very,
very high level.
And,
you know,

852
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:11.930
he's got you strapped up with all these monitors and everything to,

853
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.480
to Kinda make sure that you actually hit in your red line and then the workout

854
00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:20.980
starts.
So it's about like a three hour workout in is draining.
It's brutal.

855
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.300
It's like three hours.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh,
it's,
uh,

856
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.560
you,
you see some things going through a workout like that,
you know what I mean?

857
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:32.500
Like you go to a,
like a dark dark in it.

858
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.010
I went through a couple of them getting ready for that fight.
Uh,

859
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:40.840
wages takes with Aaron Peko.
Yeah,
that's his garage through,

860
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:45.070
that's where we,
uh,
do the workout.
Nomy it's a brutal,
uh,

861
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.840
he took a lot of shit after TJ tested positive for EPO.
Well,
shit,

862
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:54.470
I can see why I needed it.
I had to go through some of,

863
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.270
I was like,
shit,
I see,
you know,
like,
ah,
you know,

864
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:02.710
each his own and all that.
Uh,
but you know,
I don't put that on Sam.
It's like,

865
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.230
you know,
in camp.
Yeah.
I mean,
teachers,
a grown man,

866
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:09.010
he's got to do what he's gonna do.
So I don't even know if he knew.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

867
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.580
and speaking with him and everything,
he had no idea.
He was just as blindsided,

868
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.680
which is,
you know,
kind of

869
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.790
<v 2>that's,
that's unfortunate for him too,</v>

870
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:18.340
because everybody was really paying attention to how,

871
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:23.670
how scientifically he was designing and engineering these workouts and people

872
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:27.340
were really excited about it.
So it was a,
you know,

873
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:28.990
a bit of a backstop for him as well.

874
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.070
<v 1>Yeah.
He,
uh,
he's a smart,
smart dude,
you know,
I think he's a,</v>

875
00:49:32.071 --> 00:49:37.020
a math teacher over it at cal state or,
or something like that.
Um,
I mean,

876
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.930
genius of a deal.
You sit and talk to them and they're like,

877
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.190
he's gone tell you exactly why he's running you through these,

878
00:49:43.191 --> 00:49:47.640
these certain things.
So,
uh,
you know,
we,
we,
we picked up on his,
uh,
uh,

879
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.430
philosophies going into this one.
And I,
you know,

880
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.520
even though I was tired during the fight,
it's a fight.
You're going to be tired.

881
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:58.050
I still have my legs underneath me and instill a could go,
you know?

882
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.810
Um,
so I don't know.
I think,

883
00:50:01.811 --> 00:50:04.710
I think it was more tactically than anything if I'm going back on it.
But

884
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.270
<v 2>you know,
you think it's more in the way you approach the pacing and the way you</v>

885
00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:13.271
approached like as far as like the strategy of how to face dos Anjos yeah.

886
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.570
What did you think was going to happen when you went into the fight?

887
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.200
<v 1>I was going to break them.
Just going to run,
wanting to fight.
Like,
you know,</v>

888
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.940
I think the fight before that with,
uh,
without,
um,

889
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.960
I hated the way that fight went.
I hated the way I,
I showed for it and I,

890
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:31.970
and I left way too much reserved in the worst feeling for me.

891
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:35.690
Like I don't really,
I hate losing,
I really do,

892
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.270
but I don't really get hung up on the results that much.

893
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.940
I hate not performance and

894
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.731
<v 0>potential.</v>

895
00:50:41.731 --> 00:50:44.310
So if you feel like you performed to your potential and someone does better,

896
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:45.690
then you're like,
okay,
this a lesson.

897
00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.010
<v 1>Yeah,
I can learn from that and grow from it.</v>

898
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.780
But when it's a fight and I get done with it when loser or whatever and I still

899
00:50:52.781 --> 00:50:55.610
got a little bit in me and I still like,
you know,

900
00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:59.050
you walk back to the doctor and I'm still ready to fight and I still feel that

901
00:50:59.051 --> 00:51:01.360
enemy.
I hate that feeling more than anything.

902
00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:06.310
So I wanted to make sure that I didn't get this one from this one.
You know?

903
00:51:06.311 --> 00:51:08.320
And I haven't really,
uh,

904
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.300
had a fight in the UFC yet that is hit kinda where I want it to be.

905
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:17.370
You know,
like I haven't given,
people have watched me grow up in,

906
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.490
in the sport I feel like,

907
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.310
but they didn't really seem like a good fight out of me yet.

908
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.910
So that's Kinda what I was looking for.

909
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
And what I was after is just those central so smart about it and in and world

910
00:51:29.531 --> 00:51:30.650
champion.
So,
but you know,

911
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.700
<v 0>yeah.
I mean he's been around the block man.</v>

912
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.120
He's smart and he's in a precarious situation himself.
Right.

913
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:40.380
Cause you get dominated by the champ and his last fight and you know,
I mean,

914
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:44.250
what do you do from there?
I mean he,
he beats you and,
but where is he?

915
00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:47.100
It's not like people are clamoring for him to fight for the title again.

916
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:50.170
<v 1>The good thing is at one 70th so many good fights to be at.</v>

917
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.820
Like even for me as so many of,
you know,
he got asked her any you got,
you got uh,

918
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.010
uh,
Mazda at all that he's getting ready to fight you got was man,
you got Comoro,

919
00:51:59.011 --> 00:52:03.720
you got pedes and Diaz is back and you know,
there's so many good fights.

920
00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:06.480
I mean there's gonna be a great fight for him.
I'm pretty sure.
I mean,

921
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.373
I don't know that.

922
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:09.900
<v 0>Yeah,
look at it like that.
No,
I'm pretty sure as well.</v>

923
00:52:09.901 --> 00:52:13.860
I mean God damn both divisions between 55 and 70 or stack,

924
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.610
you were pushing for a 65.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it's a great idea.

925
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.500
I still am Kinda [inaudible] too.
They just don't want to listen.
Nobody wants,

926
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:24.210
I think 16 change,
70 to 75 change.

927
00:52:24.211 --> 00:52:28.740
(655) 054-0530 five it's makes sense.
10 pounds makes sense.

928
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.160
But these arbitrary,
I think that should be a 95 two how about that?

929
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.970
<v 1>That one I can see a little bit just because of how shallow two oh five was</v>

930
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:40.750
getting.
But now you've got so many great fighters at two oh five,
even a,

931
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.420
and you starting to see that body type that's coming through,
you know,

932
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:47.230
the Johnnie Walker,
uh,
the kid that just fought,
uh,
the,
the last,
uh,

933
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.410
last weekend and knocked out manual.
Yeah.
I don't know,
you know,
uh,

934
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:57.070
he just knocked out Jimmy Manoa but he's Kinda got that similar frame to as John

935
00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:01.030
Jones and you know,
you starting to see more of those guys.
So

936
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.700
<v 0>how do you say his name?
Yeah,
man.
Oh,
retired.
Okay.</v>

937
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.010
Just show it to me and I'll spell it.

938
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.470
<v 1>Oh,
Alexander rockets or breakage,
right.
All right.</v>

939
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:18.270
<v 0>Right.
Yeah.
Rakic I think its rocket.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a fucking beast,
man.</v>

940
00:53:18.271 --> 00:53:20.640
That's step in left high kick was beautiful.
Brutal.

941
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:21.120
<v 1>But the,</v>

942
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.620
but now they're getting so many guys that they might be able to build a 95.
Oh,

943
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:28.740
I said at one point,
but they could do 65 right.
Right here and now.

944
00:53:28.741 --> 00:53:29.660
And it'll be okay.

945
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.350
<v 0>You know,
one of the best.
Yeah,
it'd be hard,</v>

946
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.780
but there's too many guys at 55 and 70.
Yeah.
I think that,
and then also like,

947
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.260
look at the women's flyweight division,

948
00:53:37.261 --> 00:53:39.990
the women's or the women's with women's flyweight division.
Now,
of course,

949
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:42.210
with shift Gencos gonna Fight Jessica I this weekend,

950
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.560
but if you go back to the women's,
um,
uh,
strawweight division,

951
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.270
strawweight division,
when Yolanda was champion,
everybody's like,
well,
well,

952
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.280
there's no one there who's going to fight her and now it's stacked.
It's stacked.

953
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:57.450
You got Tatyana Smart as he got Jessica on drudge who just just beat it,

954
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.150
beat thug rose,
you know,
you've got,
you know,

955
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.460
so many fighters.
It's like,
it's a worldclass division.

956
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:08.550
<v 1>It seemed like he got better too when they edit one 25.
Yes.
I mean,
it got,</v>

957
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.990
it got even more because now you seeing like the people who wouldn't get Sean

958
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:15.030
before,
now they're getting shot at you.
Like,
oh,

959
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.390
like y'all got some serious talent.
And then,
you know,
and I,

960
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:23.391
and I felt like at 55 you've got so many guys that's underneath top 25 that

961
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:28.920
could,
could shine through,
you know,
if you just give them the space.
It,

962
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.710
it also allows for,
for guys to like Max Holloway to,

963
00:54:32.711 --> 00:54:36.390
to go up at 55 and be able to compete at his,

964
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:39.300
I feel like that's more of his natural weight too,
you know,

965
00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:42.410
is you get those four to 5% of the,

966
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.000
<v 0>he lost the Dustin Poirier.
A lot of people were saying,
you know,</v>

967
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:48.060
he just doesn't have the same power at 55 that he had at 45

968
00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.410
<v 1>I just don't think he had the experience yet.
You know,
I don't,</v>

969
00:54:50.411 --> 00:54:55.250
I don't think 55 yeah,
he,
that was his first fight at 55 so,
you know,

970
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:57.290
and Dustin's already had,
a lot of them were,

971
00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.030
even if they had both fought at 45 before Dustin's already been there.
So he,

972
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.070
it wasn't,
it's not going to be a shock to him.
You know,

973
00:55:04.071 --> 00:55:07.790
he kinda gotta just give credit to Dustin how fucking bitches.
That too.

974
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.860
A lot of people forgot was wrong the way he was rolling with punches and be just

975
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.590
barely slipping them power

976
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:19.320
<v 0>or,
and once he's moved up to 55 and he was torturing himself to get to 45,</v>

977
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.530
he's a great example of a success story of a guy who stopped cutting as much

978
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:25.640
weight.
But he's big now.
He's having a hard time making 15.

979
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.400
<v 1>Yeah,
he's grown into the way classes.
Which Max,
we'll do the same,
you know,</v>

980
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:33.180
Max a big dude like,
uh,
so I think if you,

981
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.560
if you let them compete against guys that are more his sausage and eventually

982
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.590
the next time that they fought,
I think it would look a little bit different.

983
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:42.990
And what do you think could be versus Dustin looks like?

984
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:45.630
Cause that's what they're setting out.
That's the next fight.
And Abu Dhabi,

985
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:52.170
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Like to say,
right?
Yeah.
Before the Max fight,

986
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:54.720
I would have for sure been like a beach is going to blow them out of the water.

987
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.940
Uh,
he's just going to take them down and she's going to be too big.

988
00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:00.410
But like I said,
Haley wasn't trying to take him down the way it could be.
Well,

989
00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.870
it's a difference.
It's a different fighter.
Yeah.
But,

990
00:56:03.871 --> 00:56:06.750
but the way does his footwork was looking in the,
um,

991
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.780
that's what makes you think about it because,
you know,

992
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:12.960
could beeps kind of a one track one train mine,
you know,

993
00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:16.290
he's going to come right at you.
You know,
he's going to do to,
uh,
but we,

994
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.820
if Dustin not even necessarily can,
can out wrestle him.
It's just,

995
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.860
it's way easier to play defense on wrestling then than offense.

996
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:27.630
And if you've got great footwork like that to,
to keep,
uh,
uh,

997
00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.210
you're back off the fence.
Might be a long night for,
could be

998
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.860
<v 2>who notified.
It's a good fight.
It's a fight.
Dustin's got that serious power.</v>

999
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.180
Yeah.
It's a good time.
Dustin can hurt you.
Yeah.
And Paul's ag.
Yep.

1000
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.960
<v 1>You know,
Sao Paulo,
I think that's gonna play a big factor in it.
You know,</v>

1001
00:56:42.961 --> 00:56:45.180
it's a little harder to get in on a lot of those shots.

1002
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.290
<v 2>The real key is can he stuffed the take down and can he defend himself on the</v>

1003
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:51.030
ground?

1004
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:54.190
Cause it was so many guys could be gets a hold of them and then they developed

1005
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:57.430
that thousand yard stare where they're like,
what in the fuck is happening?

1006
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.500
You know how it's like when you mean especially,

1007
00:56:59.501 --> 00:57:02.670
I'm sure you remember early in your career when you would go with a guy who was

1008
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.320
just way bigger than you are way stronger than you and you just go,

1009
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.590
oh I can't do shit.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Is that I can't do shit thing.

1010
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.540
I'm just sort of surviving.

1011
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:14.290
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean I still try and put myself into situations now.
It's a terrible feel.</v>

1012
00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:17.230
You I'll roll with Robert Drysdale or something.
I'm like,

1013
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.050
I'm lucky just to,

1014
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.790
I'm just counting how many times or I rode with Vinny a malaise and I'm like,

1015
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.030
I'm just trying my best not to get submitted.
Yeah.

1016
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.790
I'm at the point where now you only go submit me one or two times.
You know,

1017
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.860
before it was like 10 that goes like as many times as you want it to.

1018
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:40.900
But you know,
like,
okay,
if I slowly pick at this and then,
you know,
my

1019
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:44.410
<v 2>so shocked he didn't win that Pfl thing.
I was so shocked.</v>

1020
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.450
I thought he was going to win it for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1021
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.520
He's striking has come so far.
You know,
it's one of those that,
you know,

1022
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:54.130
it's the game.
It's the game.
The game.
Yeah.
What can you do?

1023
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:58.330
It's a fucking crazy sport.
It really is the craziest sport that's ever existed.

1024
00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:02.930
<v 1>You never know,
even as an athlete,
like you can do everything to,
to prepare.</v>

1025
00:58:02.931 --> 00:58:06.170
Right.
And you feel like all the chips in like everything's in your corner.

1026
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:08.660
And like,
I mean,
I guess it's like life.

1027
00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:12.110
It's like you think everything is just right,

1028
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:15.370
but sometimes it's not shit half.
Look,

1029
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:19.090
can you do pick it up and try it again?
Like a map?

1030
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.410
<v 2>Yeah.
Well you just have to accept that this is what you've chosen.
You know?</v>

1031
00:58:22.411 --> 00:58:25.170
And this is part of what comes with it.
It's just chaos.

1032
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.410
<v 1>I think you just gotta be crazy.
I think that'd be a little,</v>

1033
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:32.160
you gotta be a little like out of your fucking mind to do this.
Yeah,
100%.

1034
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.320
But I mean I see other people in other professions and what they do and I'm

1035
00:58:37.321 --> 00:58:39.870
like,
he's a little crazy too.
You know what I mean?

1036
00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:42.070
He's a little out of his mind to do what he doing.
Yeah.

1037
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.380
So maybe that's just what you just be me,

1038
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.930
<v 2>the freedom to not be stuck in the fucking office.</v>

1039
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:54.400
You have an exciting life is crazy and chaotic as it is.
Lease is exciting.

1040
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:56.920
I'll take exciting every day off,
overboard

1041
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.300
<v 1>and it lets me be me,
you know what I mean?</v>

1042
00:58:59.301 --> 00:59:03.410
Like that walking out full of fighter or just,

1043
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.970
just even just getting ready for the like the week of and you know,

1044
00:59:07.971 --> 00:59:10.190
doing media and stuff like that and,
and just,

1045
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:15.670
it lets me like really express myself in a way that I never really got to as a

1046
00:59:15.891 --> 00:59:18.760
kid or,
or,
or anything before that.
Uh,

1047
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.220
where that gives me like a little bit peace and it gives me like,

1048
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.240
I really don't give a fuck about nobody else are or what they are doing or what

1049
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:30.770
they got going on in.
It lets me like just be me and just flow it in and just,

1050
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.380
and just have fun before I would never really let myself do that,
you know,

1051
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.760
to kind of always be guarded and I will kind of always be like,

1052
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:42.920
like on edge and just not just be myself and fighting has let me,

1053
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.340
let me let it out,
you know?
And not

1054
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:50.420
<v 2>because it's so crazy because it's a wild exchange because what you're doing and</v>

1055
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:53.670
so dynamic that you could just be the full,
you know?

1056
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.240
<v 1>Yeah.
And I think everybody is different too.
You know,</v>

1057
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:58.400
everybody fights different so,

1058
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:03.020
so it's not one is better than the other,
you know,
it's not like,

1059
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.790
it's like you just got to,

1060
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.170
if you be yourself then and then you're going to do better,
you know what I mean?

1061
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:12.290
Like,
even,
uh,
even in the media and stuff like that or,

1062
01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:16.280
or however you want to approach this,
like if you be yourself,
uh,

1063
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.380
I kind of figured it out,
like,
just be me and just enjoy it.
Then it's,

1064
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:24.170
then it's butter as opposed to like,
you know,

1065
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:28.150
when you target in a microphone in front of you there,
it's like when you,
uh,

1066
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.730
you know,
you're stuck in an office or whatever or,
or however it is,

1067
01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:36.020
are you stuck doing something that you feel like you should do or people want

1068
01:00:36.021 --> 01:00:39.200
you to do,
then you start like live in like that almost.

1069
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:43.610
And I kind of have felt myself get there before I started fighting.
Uh,

1070
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.850
it's like trying to live up to other people's expectations or,
or you know,
uh,

1071
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:49.430
and fighting.
It's just like

1072
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.830
<v 2>you're free of your own destiny.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And a lot of ways,
yeah,</v>

1073
01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:59.110
<v 1>the best thing about it,
the fuck the wind fuck the laws of money is fun.</v>

1074
01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.230
Uh,
that's kind of why I got into Info is fun,
but it is,

1075
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:08.510
it's given me a lot of else to my life,

1076
01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:09.300
you know what I mean?
Right.

1077
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.400
<v 2>So do you watch many fights outside of ozone?
Yeah.
All Day.
Every day.</v>

1078
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:18.300
But outside of MMA?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean it's like Jujitsu or Moy Thai or

1079
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:22.010
<v 1>I watch all the,
uh,
Jujitsu when it,
when it's really getting going.
You know,</v>

1080
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.760
I was going to try and come out here a day before and try to see worlds.
Um,

1081
01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.210
you know,
it depends,
but yeah,
I try.

1082
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.640
<v 2>Yeah.
It's,
um,</v>

1083
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:35.840
it's interesting when you see how good people are at those individual

1084
01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:38.420
disciplines,
you know,
that's,
uh,

1085
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.590
that's one of the more interesting aspects about MMA is that you really can't be

1086
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:45.560
the best in the world.
That everything and you're going to have,

1087
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.620
because it's such a complex chart.
Yeah.
You can try it.

1088
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.640
You certainly can.
You certainly can.

1089
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:57.380
<v 1>But you're right though.
I think a lot of a lot of these other sports and stuff,</v>

1090
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:57.561
they,

1091
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:01.520
they've had so many years just to figure out what works and what don't work,

1092
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:05.570
that they've really refined the process.
You know what I mean?

1093
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:10.310
Like you see somebody high,
high level boxers and it's like they've had,
you know,

1094
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:13.490
you talk about somebody like Floyd,
he's had his,
his dad fight and his,

1095
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:18.491
his uncle fight before him to where he's like refined the process so much that

1096
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.130
it's damn near perfect.
You know what I mean?
We haven't got to that point yet.

1097
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.260
<v 2>Inhibit may know it's going to be a while.
Not often while close,
not even close.</v>

1098
01:02:27.261 --> 01:02:30.110
I don't know if we'll ever get there because it seems like it's because it's a

1099
01:02:30.111 --> 01:02:34.280
combination of so many different disciplines.
It's,
you just don't,

1100
01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:39.330
it doesn't seem like you're ever going to see the a guy who is worldclass Moitai

1101
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:44.090
and worldclass Jujitsu and worldclass wrestling all in one fighter.

1102
01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:46.760
It just doesn't seem like that's really possible.

1103
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:50.220
<v 1>I think you can get it in a couple more generations though.
I think so.</v>

1104
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.140
And maybe like four more generations,
something like that.

1105
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:58.620
Because it's like I look at the kids now that are coming up and they don't have

1106
01:02:58.751 --> 01:03:03.640
the same light preconceptions that,
that even I had,
uh,
coming up in it,

1107
01:03:03.641 --> 01:03:07.780
you know,
like where when if you boxing you box in this way and you know,

1108
01:03:07.781 --> 01:03:11.410
this is the right thing to do,
this is the wrong thing to do,
you know,
uh,
or,

1109
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.150
or you taken,
you've taken so many things and you're not really,

1110
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.360
you're kind of stuck on it.
You know what I mean?

1111
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.960
And I feel like each generation is getting a little bit better,

1112
01:03:22.961 --> 01:03:26.020
a little bit better.
I look at like some of the things that kids do now,
I'm like,

1113
01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:29.710
fuck,
like I want to wish I could be debt free.

1114
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.510
And it just kind of have that,
that creative process to do it,
you know?
Uh,

1115
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.850
it's going to happen eventually I think.

1116
01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:37.781
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:41.470
With the little kids that are starting off like little amateur fights and then

1118
01:03:41.471 --> 01:03:42.910
like 10 years old and shit.
Yeah.

1119
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.250
<v 1>So then I think about his kid,
you know,
and what's it's gonna look like.
And then,</v>

1120
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:48.110
okay,
and then what's his kid going to look like?

1121
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:51.140
A it to where you will get somebody who is,

1122
01:03:51.141 --> 01:03:54.110
who is just perfect and whatever they do.

1123
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.060
<v 2>That's a good point because it really is a big factor that Floyd had his dad who</v>

1124
01:03:58.061 --> 01:04:03.061
was a worldclass Fido flush sugar ray Leonard and his uncle Roger was the black

1125
01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:07.300
Mamba mean Roger May,
where there was the fucking man back in the 80s.

1126
01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.630
And I want to see those two guys training him.

1127
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:15.310
That is gigantic grown up in that environment,
always been around boxing

1128
01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.550
<v 1>and they could tell them what to do and what not to do.</v>

1129
01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:20.580
Even when you get to that certain level,
you know,
it's like,
it's,

1130
01:04:20.581 --> 01:04:25.260
you don't know what you don't know until it's too late almost.
Uh,

1131
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.220
but you know,
he had people that he really respected like is,
is,
I mean you,

1132
01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.880
your uncle and your pops,

1133
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.270
they're going to be the first people that you respect and you

1134
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.433
<v 2>listen to them.</v>

1135
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.740
So I think it played a huge factor that people don't really look at.

1136
01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:39.821
I think so too.

1137
01:04:39.821 --> 01:04:43.010
And it's also seeing their mistakes that other fighters have made.

1138
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.230
When you're growing up in the gym,

1139
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:47.920
you've seen guys that spar too hard or seeing guys that get hit too much or

1140
01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:49.780
seeing guys that take the wrong fire to thing.

1141
01:04:49.781 --> 01:04:52.660
Guys don't fight smart defensively.
You know,

1142
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.900
one of the things that people forget is that Floyd went through a big transition

1143
01:04:55.901 --> 01:04:56.321
of his own.

1144
01:04:56.321 --> 01:04:59.230
If you go back to the early parts of his career and you watch when he was pretty

1145
01:04:59.231 --> 01:05:00.064
boy Floyd,
yeah,

1146
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.390
he was a much more aggressive fighter and you would put himself in danger much

1147
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:06.880
more.
And then when he became money Mayweather,

1148
01:05:06.881 --> 01:05:08.950
like as it got later and later in his life,

1149
01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:13.600
he just got so much more brilliant defensively and then he became the guy that

1150
01:05:13.601 --> 01:05:18.400
you see shutting out Canelo Alvarez stopping all these,
just just shutting

1151
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.211
<v 0>everything down.</v>

1152
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:23.680
He just became this defensive wizard to the point where you'd see world class

1153
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:27.580
fighters like sugar Shane Mosey,
who did tag him,
but other than that,

1154
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:29.680
didn't really know.
Once he,
once he recovered,

1155
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:30.970
he didn't really know what to do with Floyd.

1156
01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:33.940
Floyd just had the answers to his style.
He had figured them out.

1157
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.100
<v 1>Yeah.
And I,
I have a see a lot of people,
uh,
a cause I,</v>

1158
01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:40.270
I go by his gym from time to time,
you know,
it's,
and,

1159
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.850
and I see like a lot of people that,

1160
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.810
that are coming up in boxing who just want to right out the gate,

1161
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.520
be what Floyd is now,
you know what I mean?
Be,

1162
01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.960
be on the ropes and be able to slip punches and,
you know,
and,

1163
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.690
but they forget like the time when he beat the fuck out of our tour.
Oh God.

1164
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:58.980
You know,
you know,
and was no defense to it.

1165
01:05:58.981 --> 01:06:02.100
He just came out and was throwing hands.
Like they forget all of the,

1166
01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:06.300
like amateur fights that he had before that,
that he's won and loss.
And you know,

1167
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:11.350
he just had a different style of fighting.
So it's,
it takes time to get to that,

1168
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.870
that,
that level.
You know what I mean?

1169
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.990
Certainly the world get their flight was brutal.
Brutal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

1170
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:20.790
he's a monster.
I give him a lot of respect.
I do.
Uh,
you know,
and I mean,

1171
01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:24.840
not a lot of people do,
but that's crazy.
Just be on him while he talks

1172
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.190
<v 0>slash shit.
But you got to separate that from what he does.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

1173
01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:33.110
when you watch him fight,
the guy is defensively spectacular.

1174
01:06:33.111 --> 01:06:36.080
Yeah.
He knows exactly when you watch the Canelo fight.
I've watched,

1175
01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:37.550
I can know if I'd at least three times.

1176
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:42.140
And when you watch him stand in front of Canelo Canelo's throws a left,

1177
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:45.380
he's over here,
he throws a right,
he's over here,

1178
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:50.300
pop tick that Jab with you.
Oh,
and I'm back here and Chinelo is like,

1179
01:06:50.301 --> 01:06:54.170
just within the straw strong punches.
You could see the look in his face like,

1180
01:06:54.171 --> 01:06:55.810
God damn man,
I'm in here with a master.
Yeah.

1181
01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:00.320
This is a master boxer and I'm learning a lesson here.
The good thing is,

1182
01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:02.140
you know,
he learned that lesson the right,
right.

1183
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.050
<v 1>And now look at him.
Yeah.
Canelo's a monster dude.</v>

1184
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:09.620
Monster defensively to see some of his defense now.
And even me,

1185
01:07:09.621 --> 01:07:12.810
like I look at his head and I'm like,
God damn.
You know,
he said,
uh,

1186
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:15.050
against Danny Jacobs.
Just,
just a little while ago,

1187
01:07:15.051 --> 01:07:19.490
like his head mobile is just on point.
That was a great fight cause Danny Jacobs,

1188
01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:23.330
he's a fucking kill him.
And I was pulling for Jacobs but I had to,

1189
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.890
I had to give it to Canelo.
I'm like,

1190
01:07:24.891 --> 01:07:29.600
he really took what he learned from Floyd and you know,
sometimes you need that,

1191
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.493
you know,

1192
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:34.670
even like how you send me a Georgia are kinda similar.

1193
01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:39.000
I tried to pick a fight with a man.
Like I know I like,

1194
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:40.670
I wanted to fight him of course,

1195
01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:45.440
because going into I was like a win,
lose or draw.

1196
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.730
I'm gonna learn something from this month.
Boy,
he gonna know he was in a fight.

1197
01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:54.350
I'm going to show up,
I'm a give them everything I got,

1198
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:59.220
but I knew just for the future,
unlike that,

1199
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.930
a fight like that is just gonna propel you.
It's just going to get better.

1200
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.100
You know,
you,
I think he's going to want to fight and could be probably,

1201
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.250
<v 0>I think so.
Probably.
Yeah.
That's what I think.
I think,
uh,</v>

1202
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:14.120
if Dustin Poray if could be beats Dustin poor Yay.

1203
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.100
Could be is going to lobby for a fight

1204
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.810
<v 3>with George.
Yeah,
that's what I think beats George.
I think he's going to retire.</v>

1205
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:21.980
That's what I think.

1206
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.370
I think it could be bowling as a few more fights left in them.
I don't think he,

1207
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.470
I don't think he necessarily wants to fight for a long time.

1208
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.490
I think you're right.
He's undefeated.
He smashes everybody.
Yeah.
You know,

1209
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:34.640
and I think he'll go down as one of the greatest that ever did it.

1210
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:39.620
If he bes George,
Evie beads,
George [inaudible],
George in there.

1211
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.670
I mean if he could even get Georgia in there.
I mean who the fuck knows how that,

1212
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.360
if that could ever play out.
Yeah.
I mean I want that date with them but we'll,

1213
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:50.510
we'll,
we'll,
we'll see how that whole thing it also for the UFC,

1214
01:08:50.511 --> 01:08:53.610
it wouldn't be for a title,
which is a problem apparently when they,

1215
01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:55.760
when they have a problem with like selling paper views.

1216
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.730
One of the big problems is,
and this is why,
look everybody else,

1217
01:08:58.731 --> 01:08:59.930
why do they have interim tiles?

1218
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.840
The reason why they have interim titles because people see that title and they

1219
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:07.010
fucking,
they click that paper view when they might not.
That's real.

1220
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.190
It makes it's a big factor in,

1221
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.920
it plays into the Yo yo your mindset as a fighter too.
Yes.

1222
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:16.700
And so George would have to come back.
I mean,

1223
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:20.960
someone could do one 65,
they could do one.
So are they going to do one 65?

1224
01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.510
You know what I mean?
I'm just saying it,
like Dana said,

1225
01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.580
we would choose to do this doesn't mean that much because Dana is also said that

1226
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.640
women would never fight in the UFC.
But Dana said on record,

1227
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:35.330
that won't be a one 65 while he's working there,
we hero.
I hear him.

1228
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:39.050
I don't like that thinking.
I hear him though.
But you know,
I don't get it.

1229
01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:42.950
I'm going to why they want to have more weight classes.
Yeah.
I don't get it.

1230
01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:47.570
You can make the could be been George fight and it'd be nothing,
uh,
every time.

1231
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:51.350
And George wants to have fight to,
you know,
even just to say hi.

1232
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.310
I mean you'll cool motherfucker.
But George even more so.

1233
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.030
I tried to pick a fight with them and like,
you know,
for real.

1234
01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:02.180
And he called me and we talked for like over an hour and he was like,

1235
01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:06.650
he was like,
explain it to me.
He like,
listen,
I listen,

1236
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:11.590
I cannot fight you right now.
I have to get gymnastic.

1237
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:15.860
I can't do the,
uh,
the,
like I said,
I can only do it if I talked to him recently.

1238
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:18.710
If I haven't talked to him recently,
it goes away.
I forget it.

1239
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.080
But he told me he was a,
is a great fighter,

1240
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:25.610
but he wanted that I am a better fighter than him and I in,
I feel it,

1241
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:30.490
you know,
this,
I feel that there's risks of a war,
you know what I mean?
Sure.

1242
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.910
I'm the type,
I just like taking a big risk,
you know,
more than anything.
Uh,

1243
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:38.960
but George is where you hope you are 10 years from now.
Schorsch is 36 years old.

1244
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:43.430
Sure.
Right?
Is 36 or 37.
He's in,
he's in that range is 36,

1245
01:10:43.431 --> 01:10:47.980
37 years old.
You know,
he's,
he did it all.
Get it all.
You know,
he's now,

1246
01:10:47.981 --> 01:10:50.500
he's in the position where he's just trying to get them to take five to eight.

1247
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.130
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
See,
he ain't got much time.
Yeah,
no,
I feel,

1248
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.260
and even when he was explaining to me like I was like,
man,

1249
01:10:57.450 --> 01:10:59.840
I really can't hate you for this.
Like you,

1250
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.470
you kept it like as straight as possible.
He's like,
you know,

1251
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:08.450
it's just too much risks and he's like,
for what?
I like,
I like,

1252
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:13.230
I get it Bro.
Make your money.
Look,
I ain't go,
hey.
They called you though.
I,

1253
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:14.010
you know,
I try

1254
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.250
<v 2>to steal and I think he got it too.
He was like,
you know,
I,
I'd get with,</v>

1255
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:18.750
he's a brilliant guy.

1256
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.800
I turn on you when you see and talk to him and you're just the way he breaks

1257
01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:25.740
down life to waste thinking about life.
He's thinking about it.
Very smart.

1258
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:29.400
Very smart.
That's why when he won the time I was like,
yeah,
I'm good.

1259
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.120
I feel like it.
Take it.
Take that title.
I beat Michael Bisping.

1260
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:37.110
I'm going to just ride off into the sunset here for a little bit and hope in a

1261
01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:38.070
holding pattern,

1262
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.640
waiting for the next big one to come around the next big challenge.
I feel it.

1263
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:46.000
<v 1>I mean,
there's so much more to life too.
You know what I mean?
It's so big.</v>

1264
01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:50.860
Like even even for me,
like I'm dumb.
It's only one part of me,

1265
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.340
you know what I mean is the best part.
I think personally I feel like,

1266
01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:58.820
but you know,
there's,
this is still so much more that I want to do in a college

1267
01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.190
<v 2>fishing and get done.
You know,</v>

1268
01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:05.080
the biggest problem with fighters though is that fighting is so crazy and so

1269
01:12:05.081 --> 01:12:08.140
wild and spectacular in the highs and the lows,

1270
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.510
finding whatever it is.
When you say there's so much more to life,

1271
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:17.020
finding that so much more to life is so difficult for so many fighters.
Yeah,

1272
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.900
and I think it's keeping your brain too.
Yeah,
that's,
that's that,
that might

1273
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.340
<v 1>the,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

1274
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.610
I ain't nowhere close to that point to start thinking about it.
But I'm like,

1275
01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.870
<v 2>but it's hard to know when you're at that point.
Right,
right,
right.</v>

1276
01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.610
Until it's too late.
Also fighters.

1277
01:12:30.611 --> 01:12:34.630
And I like the reason why you think you could beat everybody in the world is the

1278
01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:38.560
same thing that's going to get you fucked when you think that you could still go

1279
01:12:38.561 --> 01:12:40.040
again.
You know,

1280
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.760
I mean that's what got Chuck Odell in trouble when he fought Tito Ortiz.

1281
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:46.630
Most of us that were washing the outside of like,
please don't find him.

1282
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.860
Please don't fight anybody.
When Chuck's talking about Fighting Jon Jones like,

1283
01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:54.520
oh good lord,
please don't do that.
Cause he's like,
you know,

1284
01:12:54.521 --> 01:12:58.960
I think I can get back in there with John Jones.
Like,
Ooh yeah,
like chuck.

1285
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:02.410
But that is why he became chocolate down in the first place.

1286
01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:05.410
Cause he's get that unstoppable belief in himself.

1287
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.190
But there needs to be balance.
There needs to be balanced.

1288
01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.460
You can do anything you believe in.
Debt is horse shit.

1289
01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:17.290
Anybody tells you to it that you believe in.
That's horse shit.
You know,
there's,

1290
01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:22.090
there's certain people that will fuck you up.
You gotta be smart.
Yeah.
Smart.

1291
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.103
Yes.

1292
01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:23.821
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

1293
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:28.020
Can still do things that you don't necessarily even know that you can do.

1294
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:30.180
You know,
like I look at it and I'm like,
man,

1295
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:34.810
I never thought that I would truly be like a professional fighter and be able
to,

1296
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:39.240
to live and support my family off this.
So I'm like,
you know,

1297
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.860
20 years from now,
how did I look?

1298
01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:45.780
I have no idea what it might look like and I have no idea what else I could

1299
01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.793
possibly do.

1300
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.530
<v 2>You could do anything that,
I firmly,
absolutely believe that.</v>

1301
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:53.370
It's just whether or not you dedicate yourself to it the same way you dedicate

1302
01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:55.110
yourself to find it.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1303
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.950
I think anybody that can be a professional fighter at the highest level,

1304
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.160
that is incredible juggling act of mind and body and discipline and technique

1305
01:14:05.581 --> 01:14:10.581
and knowledge and understanding of the past and recognizing traps and,

1306
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.490
and,
and intuition.

1307
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.430
<v 0>Knowing when to strike.
No one wanted to back off.
No one to push.</v>

1308
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:20.260
Knowing when to coast it says,
that's a mad fucking race.

1309
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:20.831
I mean,

1310
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:25.630
what you're doing when you're fighting is the most chaotic thing in all of
sport.

1311
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:27.970
And if you could succeed at that at the highest level,

1312
01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:30.640
I've really believe you can do anything.
I really believe that.

1313
01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.380
<v 1>Yeah.
And I think it takes a lot of,
I think it takes a lot more brain power than,</v>

1314
01:14:34.381 --> 01:14:36.210
than,
than people kind of give it credit for it.

1315
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:42.020
And I think that's a big reason why you see guys on the decline to,

1316
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.230
you know,
uh,
and I think it's something that not a lot of people look at.

1317
01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.880
You know,
you kind of see it and you're like,
oh,

1318
01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:51.030
this guy's just out of his athletic prime.
Or He's out of,
you know,

1319
01:14:51.031 --> 01:14:54.210
he's out of shape or whatever.
But really when you look at them,
you like,

1320
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:58.080
they don't be that much more worn physically.
You know,

1321
01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:01.740
maybe certain guys go through like certain injuries and get surgeries and stuff

1322
01:15:01.741 --> 01:15:05.070
and it's just not as strong as it was when he was 25.
I get that.

1323
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.620
But I feel like fighting in particular,
it's,

1324
01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.230
it's so much more thinking power and you gotta be quick.
And,

1325
01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:17.130
and maybe it's like the damage that they're taken to,
to their actual brain.

1326
01:15:17.131 --> 01:15:21.900
Like they aren't processing information the same way.
Not only is it physical,

1327
01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:23.530
but it's like it,

1328
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.410
it only takes one slip up at the top level for a guy to catch you.
So you know,

1329
01:15:28.411 --> 01:15:29.640
if you,
if you,

1330
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:33.390
if your brain just that that send up saying working perfectly right,

1331
01:15:33.391 --> 01:15:36.660
it's like that's lights out and everybody looks at us like,

1332
01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.970
oh well he's just out of shape.
He's just getting old and stuff like that.

1333
01:15:38.971 --> 01:15:42.630
But it might be something like,
no,
you're taking brain damage in there,
you know?

1334
01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.700
<v 0>Yes,
yes.</v>

1335
01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.060
And I think there's something that happens to fighters when they lose that

1336
01:15:48.061 --> 01:15:51.060
belief that they can be the baddest motherfucker in the world.

1337
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.040
And that does happen with some fighters.

1338
01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:57.180
They get a few losses and then they settle into that journeyman's position.

1339
01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.230
And you know,
that's what Gustafson just said when he retired.
He said,

1340
01:16:01.231 --> 01:16:03.180
I don't want to be a journeyman.
You know,

1341
01:16:03.181 --> 01:16:06.910
that journeyman position is a weird position because you know,
you,

1342
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:09.540
you want to get in shape to win,
to beat this guy.

1343
01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:13.620
But you kind of know that you'll never be the man.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,

1344
01:16:13.621 --> 01:16:17.340
like say if you're a guy who's in that 205 pound division and you just keep

1345
01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:21.120
losing and then she,
Jon Jones,
who's the greatest of all time,

1346
01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:25.260
just fucking everybody up and you know,
you can't beat him.
So your training,

1347
01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.140
even when you're hitting the bag and running and all that stuff,
you know,

1348
01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:32.790
Jon Jones fucked you up twice and you know,
he,
you can't beat him.
You know,

1349
01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:33.624
you can't beat him.

1350
01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:38.780
That keeps a lot of guys from having the same enthusiasm and passion that they

1351
01:16:39.481 --> 01:16:42.930
had when they were 22 and they thought they could take on the world and they

1352
01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:46.710
picture themselves on the cover of fighters only magazine the greatest of all

1353
01:16:46.711 --> 01:16:50.010
time.
You know,
everybody has these ideas of who they can be,

1354
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.700
but when that idea has been shattered and now you're just a really good fighter,

1355
01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:56.730
some fighters just lose their enthusiasm for the game.

1356
01:16:56.731 --> 01:17:01.020
And then there's Diego Sanchez who doesn't seem to give a fuck about any of
that.

1357
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:01.890
It just did it

1358
01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:06.110
<v 1>correct people.
You know what,
he's going backwards in time.</v>

1359
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:11.150
Put his clock is toy.
Yeah.
Words.
But I think it's,
he focuses on himself,

1360
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.640
you know what I mean?
He don't,
uh,

1361
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.930
Eh Diego's out of his mind for sure.
For sure.
But maybe,

1362
01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.840
maybe he's into his mind,
you know what I mean?

1363
01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:25.250
Maybe he's just so like focused on himself and you know,
even if you can't,

1364
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.530
you know,
if you look in that John and you're like,
man,

1365
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:30.550
I ain't never gonna catch up to that level.
I'm just not going to beat it then.

1366
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:33.210
Then yeah,
that can really like,
like you said,
like start to,

1367
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:36.740
to really like discourage you a lot.
But then if you're just like,
okay,

1368
01:17:36.741 --> 01:17:41.150
I'm better today than I was yesterday and you know,
my,
my jabs like a little,

1369
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.770
it's not as straight as it could be,

1370
01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:46.000
so let me just work on that and just pick the next thing and just keep

1371
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:50.990
constantly going to that.
I feel like that's what real champions doing on,

1372
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:55.910
they don't necessarily look at,
you know,
the other person and Diego,
you know,

1373
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:57.200
even if he ain't got the belt,

1374
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:01.260
he's still in his head like that's maybe high thinking about,
oh no,

1375
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.090
you had to talk to him.
He seemed like a crazy dude.

1376
01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.280
<v 2>You need to be crazy.
No To do this shit.</v>

1377
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.980
You gotta be crazy as all different kinds of crazy,
right?
Yeah.
No,
I mean,
when,

1378
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.770
when I saw Diego mom,
Micky Gall,
I was like,
God Damn,
look at this guy.
Yeah.

1379
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:22.760
Yeah.
He just has lost no,
no enthusiasms.
Zero,

1380
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:26.070
zero loss and enthusiasm.
After all these years of finding,

1381
01:18:26.071 --> 01:18:31.071
you've got to realize that guy won the ultimate fighter season one in 2005 we

1382
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.660
are now here.
I was in ninth grade.

1383
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.170
14 years later I was in eighth grade,

1384
01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.430
wasn't even in high school yet.
Jesus,

1385
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:47.630
2005 is crazy.
It's crazy.

1386
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:51.410
He beat Kenny Florian in the finals.
Kenny's long since retired.

1387
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.950
You think of all the people he beat long since retired.

1388
01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:59.210
<v 1>I don't know.
It gives it,
it gives you hope a little bit,
you know what I mean?</v>

1389
01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:03.060
We like,
no,
when does somebody else has done it so it can be done.

1390
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:06.480
I think he's just,
you know,
into his own head and just like,

1391
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:10.920
it's constantly getting better.
And that's really what the game is about anyway.

1392
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:15.030
<v 2>Remember when he used to walk to the octagon screaming?
Yes,
yes,
yes,</v>

1393
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.120
yes,
yes.
I would love it.

1394
01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:22.800
He's so fucking crazy in the best way.
Yeah.
He's as way he's of his mind.

1395
01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:24.480
He's still one of my favorite guys to watch.

1396
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.380
<v 1>Yeah,
for sure.
For sure.
I mean there,</v>

1397
01:19:26.381 --> 01:19:31.320
there's a couple of guys like that that kind of keep that,
that same longevity.

1398
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:32.461
So you know,

1399
01:19:32.461 --> 01:19:36.690
you gotta look at the past and kind of learn from other people's mistakes and

1400
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:40.740
you know,
see,
Whoa,
okay,
wow.
How was this guy thinking like that?
You know,

1401
01:19:40.741 --> 01:19:41.910
when you,
when you look at gloves,
this,

1402
01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:45.120
any like he really didn't want to be a journeyman at already lost it.

1403
01:19:45.121 --> 01:19:49.140
A two guys holding the title.
So you look at that and you like,
man,

1404
01:19:49.141 --> 01:19:53.610
you kind of comparing yourself to,
to them a little bit too much,
you know,

1405
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:57.210
like yeah,
you fought him and the result went what you want it.

1406
01:19:57.211 --> 01:20:01.020
But it's like,
okay,
that's just the game.
That's the game.

1407
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:04.980
I think it's also,
he lives in Switzerland or Sweden.
Sorry,

1408
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:06.870
it's fucking beautiful up there.

1409
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.070
<v 3>You'd probably sit in baggies probably Hudson,
you know,</v>

1410
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:15.740
has a tool life and everything.
So you like,
man,
why am I doing this shit for you?

1411
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.583
And you know,

1412
01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.720
I'm about to go back out in front of my whole country if fight another person.

1413
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.890
Like come on.
The last time we were,

1414
01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.430
the first time he fought in front of his whole country was when he got knocked

1415
01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:28.680
out by rumble.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1416
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:33.030
Ron was the dude where I look back at guys that kind of left the sport and I was

1417
01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:37.560
like,
oh,
I get it.
He's been fighting for a long time.

1418
01:20:37.561 --> 01:20:41.310
He was wrestling before that.
He didn't want to do it anymore.
I get it.

1419
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.400
It will come back.
But this,
I dunno about it now,
man.

1420
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:47.130
But the selfish part of me wanting to see rumble,

1421
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.760
get it together and fight for a title.
Yeah.
I mean,
again,
I mean,

1422
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:54.080
not just fight when he fought a DC,
but he'd go had to do it a heavyweight.
Now

1423
01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.130
it's a bad idea for him to fight it.
Head fucked up.
Our Lawsky and heavyweight,

1424
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:04.020
when he was,
before the Pfl was the Pfl when it was the,
what was it called?

1425
01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.880
A world series.
The series of flooding.
Yeah.
Dude,
he's murderous.
Striker,

1426
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.060
murderous,
you know,

1427
01:21:10.061 --> 01:21:12.810
in the heavyweight division is actually a very good division for rumble.

1428
01:21:12.811 --> 01:21:16.740
If you really think about it with his speed and power,
first of all,

1429
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.740
he hits so fucking hard.
It doesn't matter if someone's a heavyweight,

1430
01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:24.330
light heavyweight,
it doesn't matter.
He,
the way he clips people,
it's like Jews.

1431
01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:28.080
I mean,
I,
there's a lot of good fights.
I will watch them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1432
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:33.040
Him if Francis with people,
oh my goodness.
The type of,
uh,
uh,

1433
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:35.070
guys like,
like for instance,
another one.

1434
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:39.480
Like he can just find your chin and it's like I've moved around with him a

1435
01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:43.260
couple of times and you know,
uh,
you moved around with Francis.

1436
01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:47.280
I do some wild shit bro.
Yeah,
I mean he's easy,

1437
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:51.900
gentle wind as far as who was cool school move around with like little kids

1438
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:54.960
sometimes.
He,
yeah,
he's,
he's like a gentle giant,
you know what I mean?

1439
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:59.310
Most guys that you kind of see like that you,
you Kinda,
you kinda realized like,

1440
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.660
Oh,
you know your biggest teddy bear.
Yeah,
no.

1441
01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:04.920
If you signed up and say I can beat you.
Right.

1442
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.430
You see it a different side of them.
But we were just talking to my son,

1443
01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:09.510
the oldest do it in the world.

1444
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.960
But if he decided to go into pro boxing instead of MMA when he first started
out,

1445
01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:16.270
he could be a world champion right now.
Absolutely.
And like I say,

1446
01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:18.870
it just moving around with him.
He,

1447
01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:22.170
he's got like these weird ways of like this,

1448
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:24.870
the punch just comes it as such an odd angle,

1449
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.890
but it's like clean and it's like,
oh damn.
Like,
okay,

1450
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.700
I see what you're doing.
You know what I mean?
I think I see what it is.
Uh,

1451
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.280
I mean that's the only reason why move around with it.

1452
01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:38.340
God like that is to try and see what figured out a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1453
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:43.420
But there's certain things you just can't teach a person and he's Kinda got
that,

1454
01:22:43.421 --> 01:22:47.520
you know,
he's got that,
that killer instinct,
heat sinking missile.

1455
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:51.900
You can't teach that no matter how much you want to hit pads or whatever.

1456
01:22:51.901 --> 01:22:55.950
Like sometimes you,
it's in the,
it's in there.
You know,

1457
01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:59.160
he's a fascinating story too,
because after he lost a steep pay,
you know,

1458
01:22:59.161 --> 01:23:02.070
I think he was absolutely convinced he was going to Knox t pay out and be the

1459
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:03.780
world champion.
He thought he was unbeatable.

1460
01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:06.010
Steve Bay just shattered his confidence.

1461
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.640
<v 0>And then he had that crazy fight with Derek where he was just like super</v>

1462
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:14.140
tentative.
Didn't even pull the trigger,
just like,
and in any admitted,
he said,

1463
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:17.410
I carried the fear of my last fight into the cage with me.

1464
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:20.650
And then he came out and starched Curtis blades,
you know,

1465
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:24.760
and then he came out and a starch cane after that.
Like,
okay,
he's back.

1466
01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.690
<v 1>Yeah.
I think it took,
it took them some time to kind of uh,
get it back.</v>

1467
01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
To,
to,
to understand what,
what,
what it is and what's going on,
you know,

1468
01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:37.790
and to learn from it too,
you know?
Uh,
he,

1469
01:23:37.791 --> 01:23:40.010
he's so strong willed and you know,
any,

1470
01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.950
any like cotton like Kinda got a different culture too,
you know,

1471
01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:46.370
coming from Africa in,
in,
in Paris and everything.
So when you talked to him,

1472
01:23:46.371 --> 01:23:49.940
I mean,
he's super smart dose,
Super Smart,
but uh,

1473
01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:53.510
he's Kinda like me a little bit where it can be hard to get through that,

1474
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.210
get through the head,
you know what I mean?
Like,
I mean I,

1475
01:23:57.211 --> 01:24:00.440
I admit it and all of those stubborn sometimes and I think he is too a little

1476
01:24:00.441 --> 01:24:04.450
bit so it can be hard for lessons to really sink into that.

1477
01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:09.320
But I feel like now,
like he,
he's one of those guys where yeah,
you could see it.

1478
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:13.130
It's like coming together for him doing his camps in France.
No.
Uh,
no.

1479
01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:16.910
He's been over in Vegas.
One of his camps.
Yes,
he did his last Curtis blades.
Yeah.

1480
01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.390
You have fun.
Yeah.
I'm not sure where he's doing this next camp or anything.

1481
01:24:20.391 --> 01:24:23.510
I don't know.
I was doing a lot of it.
The performance too,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1482
01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:27.440
Cause you're getting good wrestling cause that's really the thing that was

1483
01:24:27.441 --> 01:24:30.590
exposed in the,
it comes over to too extreme and you know,

1484
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.230
he'll wrestle with us a lot.
You know,
it's,
the problem is just heavy weights,

1485
01:24:34.231 --> 01:24:35.064
you know,
it's not a,

1486
01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:40.100
a lot of the bigger dudes and he's intimidating too.

1487
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.120
So when I,

1488
01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.970
when I sit back and I'll be watching them move around with certain guys that you

1489
01:24:43.971 --> 01:24:48.710
can tell,
like they scared,
you know what I mean?
Oh,

1490
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.570
blame.
I don't blame him Bro.
I don't play with either two days.

1491
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:57.250
He scared me when he's on the other side of the cage.
Yeah,

1492
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:59.250
I'm outside the cage and he scares me.

1493
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.450
I've wrestled with him a couple times is I really don't really give a fuck,

1494
01:25:03.451 --> 01:25:07.950
but he's just so big.
It's hard bro.
It's like I've tried to get it,
you know,

1495
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.170
I do my thing.
I try.
I'm a strong guy.
I hold my own,

1496
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.160
<v 0>well it's,</v>

1497
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.730
the heavyweight division is very interesting right now because I think a lot of

1498
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:19.930
people are sleeping on Steve pay and I know DC DC clocked him and knocked him

1499
01:25:19.931 --> 01:25:20.830
out in that first fight.

1500
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.560
But I think Steve [inaudible] is gonna want to come back to the second fight

1501
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:24.700
with a vengeance man.

1502
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:29.740
And I mean he was the most successful heavyweight champion of all time and he

1503
01:25:29.741 --> 01:25:33.790
loses the fight,
loses his title,
can't get anyone to pay attention to him all.

1504
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:36.190
I was talking about Brock Lesnar,
DC's going to fight,
but he's like,

1505
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.480
Brock Lesnar doesn't even fight.
He's doing fucking WWE.

1506
01:25:40.481 --> 01:25:44.020
Like what is this shit?
He goes,
I am the most successful of all time.

1507
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:46.510
I'm the only guy to defend the title four times.

1508
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:50.890
I lose one fight to a fantastic fighter and I can't get a fucking rematch.

1509
01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:54.910
Like what is this about?
And then finally there's no one left in the division.

1510
01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:57.240
Who else has he got?
He's got to fight him.
Yeah,

1511
01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.210
<v 1>I mean that played out perfect for him and I,</v>

1512
01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:03.090
and I'm so glad to see it to like Steve Bay is one of the coolest dudes and so

1513
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:06.920
cool in a world bro.
And it's like,
what more do you have to do?

1514
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:09.050
You know what I mean?
Like sometimes I get sick of,
of,

1515
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.500
of just the way things are like I don't blame it on the UFC.
I don't blame it on,

1516
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.170
on anything.
It's just sometimes that's just the way things are.

1517
01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:17.380
It's just the way people are to where like they,

1518
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.310
they want to see like you act the food,

1519
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:21.200
they want to see that controversy and they want,

1520
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:25.280
they want to see the negativity all the time.
And it's like,
man,
this is,

1521
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.320
it's like a do like Steve Pay.

1522
01:26:28.321 --> 01:26:31.610
If Steve Pay can't get no love and he's like a firefighter,

1523
01:26:31.611 --> 01:26:36.611
like legitimately saving lives on a daily basis while like training to death and

1524
01:26:37.521 --> 01:26:42.380
being a world champion at it.
It's like,
man,
if I do like that,
can't get no love.

1525
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:45.860
I know I stay the chance bro.
But you know,

1526
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:50.330
I'm happy to see these are always going to work out the way it's supposed to

1527
01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:52.060
work out.
You know what I mean?
I guess.

1528
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:56.090
But I just felt like the marketing of him could've been so much better.

1529
01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:59.750
That was my feeling on it was like,
how do you miss out on this hero?
Yeah.

1530
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:04.160
I mean maybe at a super exciting,
I think it's just American culture maybe.

1531
01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:08.240
Cause you see like one fc doesn't necessarily be the same way,
you know?

1532
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:11.680
And they're still doing great.
I mean time will tell how,

1533
01:27:11.681 --> 01:27:14.710
how great they really do.
Uh,
but,
but their way of,

1534
01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.870
of marketing and a guy and promoting them and everything is just so much

1535
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:21.320
different.
It's like,
does that work in America is the problem.

1536
01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.010
It's like people only want to see what they want to see.
Like even about me,

1537
01:27:25.011 --> 01:27:25.281
you know,

1538
01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:29.930
like people see me Kinda hit key Essa at the press conference and then that's

1539
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:33.100
all they really know about me.
So that's all they really,
you know,

1540
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:36.830
they think that's me or,
or they,
they,
they even read wrong,

1541
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:40.520
get to that type of situation and they just think that that's how you is.

1542
01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:45.440
But she ever talked to Casa after your fight with you guys?
Cool.
He,
I'll go,

1543
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.790
he knows.
Oh,
he's pissed because the choke it,
no,

1544
01:27:49.791 --> 01:27:53.180
I think he's just met a way.
The whole situation like is awesome.
The choke.

1545
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:57.560
I mean it's almost like,
no,
he would have been better off if he went to sleep.

1546
01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:00.620
Yeah.
But he,
he know he,
I mean,
he even said it.
He's like,
yeah,
I mean,

1547
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:03.800
and he's mad that,
that the fight went down the way,
you know,

1548
01:28:03.801 --> 01:28:08.210
younger guys and around.
But uh,
but he's more mass still that I hit him.
It's,

1549
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:12.950
the problem was it was so locked in to stop it right there.
Like,
let them go out,

1550
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.320
let them tap or go out.
Yeah.
But,
but,
but thing is,
it's,

1551
01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.450
it's defend yourself,
you know,
but choke,

1552
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:24.530
you don't stop a choke if the guy's awake.
You don't stop a choke.
That's true.

1553
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.430
That's true.
I mean,
there's been a couple of situations where,
where,
you know,

1554
01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:31.490
that'll kind of happen in the guy will stop defending himself in the,
in the ref.

1555
01:28:31.491 --> 01:28:34.970
We'll,
we'll,
we'll stop it.
And the refs do tell you they like,
they're like,

1556
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.930
if you stop defending yourself,
then you know,
what else did they do?

1557
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.950
I mean,
yeah,
they could,

1558
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.370
you guys just let me choke him out and had been a little easier.

1559
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.460
But for us as competitors,
we kind of know,
you know,

1560
01:28:46.461 --> 01:28:49.490
I think he just was more upset that it didn't go as well.
Yeah.

1561
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.790
That it didn't go his way in and then I hit the button.
But look,

1562
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:56.090
people even read wrong,
get to that into that kind of situation.
Like,

1563
01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:00.140
I'm a cool dude.
Like I,
I mean I,
I mean,
I don't mean to say it like that,
but,
um,

1564
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.360
I'm always going to give respect to everybody.
You know,

1565
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:08.361
that's just the way I kind of am until you kind of diminish that respect for me

1566
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:13.200
then then you know,
I'm going to give it to you.
So I was talking a little bit,

1567
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:16.320
told him,
you know,
now kind of,
you know,
I'm up there,
I'm having fun.

1568
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:20.040
It's my first big press press conference.
Like I'm having fun at it.

1569
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:24.690
But the minute that he got up and ran across the,

1570
01:29:24.691 --> 01:29:28.560
towards me,
it's like there's this dividing line almost.

1571
01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.880
It's like as soon as you step over that UN in my space now it's super fans.

1572
01:29:33.190 --> 01:29:36.720
I can't,
yeah.
I can't let,
yeah,
I'm a hit you for it.
That's just the way I,

1573
01:29:36.721 --> 01:29:40.380
you know,
you also,
you're in a defensive position.
Like you have to hit them all.

1574
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:44.190
Yeah.
Yeah.
When someone comes at you in the right,
they're like,
oh,

1575
01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:47.610
this is a fight.
Yeah.
It's a fight.
I mean,
I,
that's just the way I grew up,

1576
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:50.940
you know,
is any,
anytime,
any spotty,
some,
somebody is gonna you know,

1577
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.600
invade your space.
Like you're not going to wait.

1578
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.630
Like I'm not going to sit there and see what Paul told the boss could rematch

1579
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:01.860
some time at one 17 one seven.
That's very possible.
That's very possible.

1580
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:02.970
A lot of good fights.
Well,

1581
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:05.850
he was another guy that had a real hard time making that way.
He's a big fella.

1582
01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:06.803
Yeah.
Yeah.

1583
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.860
I mean they hold back on them and for me it's like I've always just wanted a

1584
01:30:10.861 --> 01:30:15.270
fair fight,
so,
you know,
uh,
we can weigh in at whatever,
you know,
it's,

1585
01:30:15.271 --> 01:30:17.820
it's even with me and dos Anjos I was saying,
you know,

1586
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.900
let's weigh in at one 65 and just kind of shut the hand.
He didn't want to do it,

1587
01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.330
but I'm like,
I just want a fair fight out of the deal.
You know,

1588
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:27.420
it's whatever you want to weigh in.
We shake hands to fight it,

1589
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.770
to weigh in at one 65 just to show that this weight class is a viable way class.

1590
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:34.800
I tried to and he wouldn't do it.
Yeah.
He,
he said,
uh,

1591
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:39.780
I don't make a agreements with my opponents.
And I was like,
come on,
you know,

1592
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:42.500
like,
this is our problem in the first place.

1593
01:30:42.501 --> 01:30:44.460
That's why I ain't no union or nothing.
You know what I mean?

1594
01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:48.450
Like everybody's like against each other.
Like,
come on,
Bro,
we fight in any way.

1595
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.620
What do you know what I mean about the idea of a union?
I mean,
I think it's,

1596
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:55.380
I think it's inevitable,
you know?
Yeah.
I think

1597
01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:00.840
eventually it's gonna happen.
Um,
how would it happen?

1598
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.510
I think it's once a UFC,
the UFC is going to change a little bit.

1599
01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.340
I feel like it's,

1600
01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:10.980
it's just the same way that I'm kind of looking at the way that Facebook has

1601
01:31:10.981 --> 01:31:13.830
been doing stuff and,
and,
and all these other,
uh,

1602
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:18.480
companies like these large private companies,
but they're so big and it's,

1603
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:21.980
it's like the UFC is a,
is a sports organization,
you know what I mean?
But it's,

1604
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:26.130
it's so big now to where like,
it's,
I mean,

1605
01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:28.980
it's damn near a sport is,
I guess it's damn near public.
You know?

1606
01:31:28.981 --> 01:31:33.270
So I think once that kind of changes and people like once they open up the books

1607
01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:35.400
and like people really start to pay attention to it,

1608
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:40.680
then maybe somebody on the outside who's way smarter than any one of us or you

1609
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:42.060
know,
cause we're,
we're fighting,

1610
01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:46.410
we ain't really worried about the legalities of it.
And,
you know,

1611
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:48.120
I'm just signing a contract.
I don't really give a fuck.

1612
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:53.420
But once somebody who's smarter kind of takes a look at it and see what's going

1613
01:31:53.581 --> 01:31:57.780
on in,
in,
in how it is,
then,
uh,
then they're going to start up something.
I mean,

1614
01:31:57.781 --> 01:32:00.070
they,
they have to,
I wonder,
it's kind of

1615
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.890
<v 2>crazy.
It would take some sort of crazy lawsuit,
I would imagine.</v>

1616
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:05.980
But I think that fighters are individuals in that then that they,

1617
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:10.780
they think of themselves.
And then if like if you say,
Hey,
I'm going to join the,

1618
01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:13.780
yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.
If you say,
Hey,
I'm going to join the union,

1619
01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:17.950
you know,
uh,
I'm going to sit out until you guys meet the demands of the union.

1620
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:20.950
And they go,
oh,
that's great,
Colby coven concerns going to take your place.

1621
01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.860
Now he's going to fight for the title,
and then you're like,
what the fuck?

1622
01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:27.100
And then you call Dana,
hey man,
I changed my mind fucked at union.

1623
01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.620
I'm with you guys.
And that's how it goes.

1624
01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:30.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:32.090
<v 3>That,
I mean,
yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1626
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:36.510
But it's kind of a a shame on our part almost.
It's like,

1627
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:40.370
it's the same way is,
is I say,
let's meet at one 65 it's like,

1628
01:32:40.371 --> 01:32:43.940
we already don't have a lot of leverage,
bro.
Like,
you know,
yeah.

1629
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:46.730
There's only so many things that we could even do.

1630
01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.130
I understand those Saundra still.
He's like,
fuck,
we're going to fight anyway.

1631
01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.770
I don't want to cut that extra five pounds.
You didn't,
I didn't do it either.

1632
01:32:51.771 --> 01:32:54.230
I'm like,
Bro,
I'm already,
you've already fought it.

1633
01:32:54.231 --> 01:32:56.360
One 70 I'm already taking a loss here.
I'm like,

1634
01:32:56.361 --> 01:33:00.940
I'm not gonna give you too many advantages here,
but,
but do you have seed?

1635
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:03.680
They,
you feel like they treat you well?
Yeah.
I mean,

1636
01:33:03.681 --> 01:33:06.840
like you obviously you have to be good.
You're in their good graces.
Yeah.

1637
01:33:06.841 --> 01:33:07.850
I honestly,
I haven't

1638
01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:12.150
<v 1>no real like complaints about it.
You know,
it's,
it's,
I know what I'm,</v>

1639
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.030
I'm signing the line,
you know what I mean?
I know what I'm signing up for in a,

1640
01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.240
in anytime I do and I say I'm going to do something,

1641
01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.690
I'm always going to make sure I hold up my end and I'm going to do it.
Um,

1642
01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.970
and it's afforded me so much to,

1643
01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:28.620
to where my life is so much different than I thought it would be.
I like,

1644
01:33:29.190 --> 01:33:33.360
I truly thought that that everything would just look different,
you know,

1645
01:33:33.361 --> 01:33:38.220
and have provided a better life for my family.
Like my mom,
my dad,

1646
01:33:38.221 --> 01:33:41.940
and my brother's like,
well,
my one brother at least.
Um,

1647
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:47.580
but,
you know,
it's just afforded me so much that any light negatives on it,

1648
01:33:47.610 --> 01:33:50.790
like I can't really,
it's just like

1649
01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:54.510
<v 2>grievances almost.
Yeah.
No,
I understand.
I understand what you're saying.</v>

1650
01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.150
Have you ever been approached by other organizations,

1651
01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:00.650
<v 1>uh,
before getting into the UFC?
Yeah.
And then,</v>

1652
01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:03.390
I mean maybe a little bit here and there,
but you know,

1653
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.850
<v 2>when you see guys like sage Northcutt go over to one FC and Eddie Alvarez and</v>

1654
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:08.893
mighty mouse challenged,

1655
01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:12.040
<v 1>I mean it's,
it's,
it's all good for the sport in general.
You know,</v>

1656
01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:15.490
I think even the UFC sees that like competition is always good,
you know,

1657
01:34:15.491 --> 01:34:18.720
it's just,
it's just building even more and bigger and better.
Um,

1658
01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:23.070
and it's really the sport that we looking after.
So if,
uh,
I mean I'm,

1659
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:27.820
I've been in a contract with UFC for a long while now,
but,
uh,
uh,

1660
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.160
you know,
if another organization was to ever,

1661
01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.830
<v 3>you know,
I never know what the future goal,</v>

1662
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.100
like what would have ballots are really blows up and not no,

1663
01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.630
I mean Nah I ain't that names.
The goddamn anchors is true.

1664
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:46.980
Does that mean,
yeah,
kind of a bowling ball,
metal bowling ball around your neck.

1665
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.960
Yeah.
Kinda,
I mean,
I don't know.
For me,
I'm getting a UFC is where it's at and,

1666
01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:55.200
and 10% you don't want it to be too many organizations either.

1667
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:58.160
You know what I mean?
Cause then you see like Wba

1668
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.620
<v 0>with boxing fight is I get that tear.
That's why,
well that's,</v>

1669
01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:05.240
I don't want to be a partner that,
you know,
it's kind of a problem now.

1670
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:08.960
I mean with Douglas Lema Douglas Slim is world class fighter,
but you know,

1671
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:10.940
Rory Macdonald's worldclass fighter,

1672
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:14.780
these guys are world champion Caliber Rory Macdonald could absolutely be a world

1673
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:17.150
champion in the UFC.
Meet BB,
Tyron Woodley.
Yeah.

1674
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:20.230
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean I,
I think,
uh,
I,
I'm a,</v>

1675
01:35:20.231 --> 01:35:23.210
I want to be a part of keeping it all together to,
you know what I mean?

1676
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:24.620
I'm not going to be selfish and be like,

1677
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:26.360
oh well one's going to pay me way more money,

1678
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:29.290
so I'm gonna go over there and do that.
Like I,

1679
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.790
I'm a huge fan of the sport in general too.

1680
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.240
So I want to see the sport do good and,

1681
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.660
and having us all under one roof definitely does help.

1682
01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.750
<v 0>Being a UFC champion just fucking means more,
way more.</v>

1683
01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:42.950
It just means way more white more.
And I'm gonna do it.
Yeah.

1684
01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:46.340
You find out a guy's belt or champion,
like congratulations.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1685
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:50.330
I find that a guy's UFC champion like,
oh shit.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's different.

1686
01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:54.180
<v 1>Okay.
And,
and,
and I would even want to keep that integrity about it,
you know,</v>

1687
01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.320
and just filled myself,
you know what I mean?
To,
you know,
just to,

1688
01:35:58.321 --> 01:36:00.570
just to know that,
that that's what you did.

1689
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.400
You say you're going to do it like that's what you did.

1690
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:03.480
So I think there's a wake up

1691
01:36:03.490 --> 01:36:07.030
<v 0>called know when guys are going over and fighting in these other organizations.</v>

1692
01:36:07.031 --> 01:36:08.440
They're realizing now like,
man,

1693
01:36:08.441 --> 01:36:13.441
they are world class fighters that you don't know about over in one fc in

1694
01:36:13.481 --> 01:36:18.400
particular,
like Timothy nuts.
You can,
the guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez,

1695
01:36:18.610 --> 01:36:22.960
that mother fucker's world class classified as damage where bro.
Yup.

1696
01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:23.913
Everywhere.

1697
01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:28.040
<v 1>Treat everybody with the same,
you know,
it's different world.
Yeah.
It's,</v>

1698
01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:31.530
it's different.
But it's still like there was a knock you out.

1699
01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.280
<v 0>Oh yeah.
I mean it's a different world now.</v>

1700
01:36:33.281 --> 01:36:36.960
I'm saying that like you go to these other organizations,
it's not a cakewalk.

1701
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:40.390
Yeah.
They're just as hard and just as dangerous as UFC fighters.

1702
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:45.820
You know when sage fault,
you saw the,
the sage result that cosmo Alexandra guy,

1703
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:48.280
then he followed.
That guy's a beast,
man.

1704
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.280
<v 1>Yeah.
And I'm all for taking big risks.
I really am.</v>

1705
01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:56.090
And trying to take the biggest,
hardest fight did you can,
but somebody like that,

1706
01:36:56.091 --> 01:37:00.710
it was like,
somebody should've probably gotten to say Jared was like,
Hey,
listen,

1707
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:01.544
like

1708
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.810
this dude's a legit world champion.
Kickboxer you know,

1709
01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:11.510
I had just fought Nikki Hoschi,
you know,
that's a huge level of,

1710
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.080
of uh,

1711
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.090
experience that you're talking about coming from fighting somebody like Zack

1712
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:19.220
Ottawa to,
you know,
he's like,

1713
01:37:20.890 --> 01:37:25.620
that's a huge jump,
you know?
And it's the Grand Canyon with a scooter.
Yeah,

1714
01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:26.360
yeah.
Yes.

1715
01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.360
It's just sometimes the biggest risks ain't necessarily the smartest either.

1716
01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.610
You know,
you can legit get hurt in a sport.
Like it's,
it's a sport,

1717
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:41.510
but it's real life too.
Like you,
you can legit get hurt,
you can lose your life.

1718
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:42.344
So yes.

1719
01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:46.210
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I agree.
And also particularly cause sages Nano Pressler yeah.
You know,</v>

1720
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:49.900
so he's going to stand,
stand up with this dude with four ounce gloves on.

1721
01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.640
And he had never fought in a ring before,

1722
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:56.190
<v 1>at least I don't think,
I mean,
I don't know.
But when you watch</v>

1723
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.990
<v 3>that fight and you see the way he was moving,</v>

1724
01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.940
it's like he didn't expect that punch to come.

1725
01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:02.400
You didn't expect him to be able to cut them off like that.

1726
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.630
When you look at a ring,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's 180 degrees right there.

1727
01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:10.210
So you only have one way to move.
Never moved that way.
You know?

1728
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:14.970
That's a really good point actually.
I didn't even consider that.
Whoever has,

1729
01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.270
you know,
his coaches should have been like,
listen,

1730
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:22.080
like we need to work our way up there.
You know what I mean?
Or,
or,

1731
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:27.000
uh,
I think they might've had a false misconception of going over to one and one,

1732
01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:30.600
treating him real good and they're going to give you a good fight.
So,
you know,

1733
01:38:30.601 --> 01:38:34.710
they don't want to build you.
I think one is signing guys to be like,

1734
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.800
we got some of the git talent over here.
We going to sign you.

1735
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.620
You go make your money.
But,
uh,
you have to earn that money.
They can mean a solid,

1736
01:38:42.621 --> 01:38:44.550
they threw him right to the top champions either.

1737
01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:47.910
It's like they threw him to a world class fighter than they look.

1738
01:38:47.911 --> 01:38:51.120
They've got world class talent.
They really do.

1739
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:53.370
And so does Bellah tour now,
you know,

1740
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:56.800
I feel like Douglas Lema is as good as any hundred and 70 pounder in the world

1741
01:38:56.801 --> 01:39:00.990
and just knocked out by Michael Van and page like,
Holy Shit.
Brutal too.

1742
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.580
Holy Shit.

1743
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:06.930
Gay Garden was saucy is absolutely one of the best hundred and 85 pounders in

1744
01:39:06.931 --> 01:39:11.040
the world yet.
You know what I mean?
He's as world classes they get.
Yeah.

1745
01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:12.060
And there's so much talent.

1746
01:39:12.061 --> 01:39:17.010
Like you do need to keep it all under one umbrella though.
I think,
you know,

1747
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:21.630
Ben's a fan of the sport is,
and it's better for us fighters too.
You know,

1748
01:39:21.631 --> 01:39:26.460
like I,
I'm a competitor,
so I want to compete against the best of the best.

1749
01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:30.020
I don't want it like a bunch of,
you know,
like where's boxing where,
you know,

1750
01:39:30.021 --> 01:39:33.990
you can't make two fights happen and because of this promoter doesn't work with

1751
01:39:33.991 --> 01:39:37.410
this promoter and,
and you've got to go through three,
four years of,

1752
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:41.640
and the whole time a guy like Joshua was kind of sitting back and like,
man,

1753
01:39:41.641 --> 01:39:43.020
I don't know.
I,
I,

1754
01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:47.040
I don't get to fight these guys so I really don't know how good I am or,

1755
01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:49.440
or something.
Uh,
where to stay.
You just like,

1756
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:53.700
let's just go out there and compete and the later chips out and wherever they

1757
01:39:53.701 --> 01:39:54.900
fall is,
where are they gonna fall?

1758
01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.470
You only get to be able to do that if everything's under one roof.
Yeah.

1759
01:39:58.471 --> 01:40:02.970
I'm really enthusiastic and hopeful about this ESPN deal too,

1760
01:40:02.971 --> 01:40:06.570
cause I think that's going to expose a lot more people to the sport because

1761
01:40:06.571 --> 01:40:10.890
there's so many people that are just casual sports fans that always have the TV

1762
01:40:10.891 --> 01:40:15.000
on ESPN.
I mean that is America's network for sports.

1763
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:18.700
And they're good too.
They're good.
Like working with them for this last,
uh,

1764
01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:22.020
a fight and you're getting ready to do the build up and everything.

1765
01:40:22.021 --> 01:40:25.380
It just seeing the way that they do certain things,
there's like,

1766
01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:29.760
there's no fat on it,
you know,
there's no,
like,
there's no lag.
There's no delays.

1767
01:40:29.761 --> 01:40:33.930
There's no,
you know,
uh,
it just,
everybody's just on,

1768
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.560
on top of their game.
Like they're real professionals.
That is so beautiful.
Yeah.

1769
01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:39.710
I think it's love hearing that.
Yeah.
I think it's going to be big put.

1770
01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.780
I've been very impressed with their promotion to the way they promote things,

1771
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:45.060
where they put things together.
Even the way the handle social media,

1772
01:40:45.061 --> 01:40:48.240
it's a notch up and you could tell like that they,

1773
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:52.080
they're just have so much experience in sports.

1774
01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:54.220
I mean there forever.
Right.

1775
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.180
<v 1>I mean they're the leaders forever.
Beautiful.
I think,
uh,
you know,</v>

1776
01:40:58.210 --> 01:41:02.120
social media is going to probably be the last little little leg up that cause

1777
01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:06.180
our sport is living in died on it almost.
Yeah.
Uh,

1778
01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.400
and that's going to be like I met shying away from it.

1779
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:11.910
Like I don't really fuck with it like that no more.

1780
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:14.680
Just cause I don't think it's right.
You know what I mean?

1781
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:19.540
I think eventually it's going to change and it's going to get to be way better.

1782
01:41:19.690 --> 01:41:22.170
And then once that happens,
like then the sport really like,

1783
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:24.010
<v 3>wait,
what do you mean?
Like in what way?
What do you,</v>

1784
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:26.280
what don't you think is right about it?
I just don't know.

1785
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.580
<v 1>You know,</v>

1786
01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:32.580
I haven't been getting on it lately just because for me it was like I started

1787
01:41:32.891 --> 01:41:35.740
noticing that it was changing my outlook on things.

1788
01:41:35.741 --> 01:41:40.741
Like it was like I was almost doing stuff for the purpose of putting it on

1789
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:45.490
social media or I wasn't like enjoying my life as much.

1790
01:41:45.491 --> 01:41:48.630
I was more so worried about like how it was going to look or you know,
what it,

1791
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:49.810
how acting use this.

1792
01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:54.490
And I was always kind of suddenly like scheming and plotting.
Uh,
and it's just,

1793
01:41:54.491 --> 01:41:55.750
I didn't think it was healthy.
And I,

1794
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:59.200
and then I started to see the effect that it was having on other people too.

1795
01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:03.490
And in,
or just people around me in general.
He's like,

1796
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.640
I was noticing it was terrible for my little brother.

1797
01:42:06.650 --> 01:42:09.250
And I think it's terrible for the kids in general.

1798
01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.810
And it just made it to where everything was.

1799
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:17.800
So you only got to see little glimpses of things.
You know what I mean?

1800
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:21.550
People take the perfect picture and a perfectly of course and all this.

1801
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:25.840
So that's just what you see.
And you only got to see the,
the,
the,

1802
01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:28.590
the shine and the glitz and the glamor and stuff.
So when it,

1803
01:42:28.591 --> 01:42:30.340
when a young kid is looking at that,
he's like,

1804
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.220
and he's going to see thousands of likes on it too,
you know?

1805
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:36.650
And that's what everybody likes a,
so it,

1806
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.850
it just almost makes you feel like,
man,
that's what I should be.

1807
01:42:39.851 --> 01:42:43.510
You know what I mean?
And,
and when you not that,
then they can give you such a,

1808
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:47.980
a dangerous outlook on yourself to where you'll do some stupid to,

1809
01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.880
to beat it almost to where I feel like it's going to change.

1810
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:54.220
It's going to be different.
How so what do you think's going to happen?

1811
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:57.550
A couple of weeks ago,
I saw that they were talking about,
uh,
you know,

1812
01:42:57.551 --> 01:42:58.600
taken away the likes.

1813
01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.440
<v 3>You are going to see it.
People will jump off buildings.
I would love that though.</v>

1814
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:03.490
I would get back on it.

1815
01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.460
I'd be on Instagram full fledged they said they were thinking about taking away

1816
01:43:06.461 --> 01:43:09.340
the number of followers too.
So you couldn't see.
Yeah.

1817
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:11.860
How many followers of the people have,
I don't see why not.

1818
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:14.470
I don't see why you need to see it or I don't see why,
you know,

1819
01:43:14.590 --> 01:43:19.580
I guess I didn't know how ridiculous it is when,
when,
uh,
when like sometimes,
uh,

1820
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:21.770
like I'll,
I'll see someone like with,

1821
01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:25.990
with kills me as why I'm looking like the search area and there's some girl

1822
01:43:25.991 --> 01:43:29.710
doing squats and a thong and I was like,
let me see how many followers she has.

1823
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:33.030
18 million.
Yeah.
But,

1824
01:43:33.031 --> 01:43:37.720
but my thing is what good does that,
do you know what I mean?
I'm happy

1825
01:43:40.710 --> 01:43:43.680
because it's so crazy.
But even even,
you know,

1826
01:43:43.730 --> 01:43:46.630
it's huge and fighting and stuff,
but you know,

1827
01:43:46.631 --> 01:43:49.460
I look on it and like certain people have like millions of followers in this

1828
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.310
that,
but does that necessarily translate to

1829
01:43:52.630 --> 01:43:56.210
<v 1>anything tangible?
You know what I mean?
Anything real.
It's like,</v>

1830
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.130
I don't necessarily know.
I don't know what the,

1831
01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:01.820
I don't know if anybody's done any studies and like really looked at that to see

1832
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:05.780
a po.
I don't necessarily think it does and I don't really think it matters.

1833
01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:09.410
I think the only thing it does is like play into your own head where you like,

1834
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:12.290
you know,
oh he's getting so many lights or you post something,
you're like,

1835
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.150
aw man,
I get this many likes and stuff.
But it's like it does,
it doesn't matter.

1836
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:17.984
You know?
I guess for the,

1837
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:20.960
the only way I could see it mattering is for the algorithms.
You know,

1838
01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:25.160
people like to see what other people like,
so that makes sense.

1839
01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.900
But we don't necessarily have to see that.
You know what I mean?
If,

1840
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:33.260
if like where Bray rod is doing his videos,
love them,

1841
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:37.430
I'm going to look at them whether they got a hundred likes or they got a 100,000

1842
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:38.121
you know,

1843
01:44:38.121 --> 01:44:42.290
I'm going to follow him whether he's got a million followers or 100 followers.

1844
01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:43.124
You know what I mean?

1845
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:48.140
I think that's probably the way it should be more because that seems more like

1846
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.393
real life.

1847
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:54.120
<v 2>Yeah,
I get what you're saying.
Um,
but in this day and age,
everybody wants to,</v>

1848
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.910
they want to know,
oh this is the number one show on.

1849
01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.600
Like Netflix is an interesting thing because you never know what the fuck

1850
01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:02.070
Netflix ratings are.

1851
01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.220
You have no idea if you watch like say Ozark or something like that.

1852
01:45:05.670 --> 01:45:09.420
No one has any idea other than Netflix.
Netflix knows they don't tell you shit.

1853
01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:12.840
Like when I do comedy specials on Netflix,
they go,
we love it.
Thank you.

1854
01:45:12.841 --> 01:45:13.400
But here's the thing,

1855
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.260
<v 1>it does stop me from watching it.
That's true.</v>

1856
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:18.440
If anything it makes it a little better.
You know what I mean?

1857
01:45:18.441 --> 01:45:22.430
Like I think so at least cause cause now you got your own little thing that you,

1858
01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.060
that you kind of getting into.
I don't really like following the crowd that much.

1859
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:29.300
Maybe that's what the way I'm thinking about it.
But you know,

1860
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:30.680
it don't stop me from watching it.

1861
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:33.520
<v 2>I wonder if the actually do that.
I wonder if they do do that.</v>

1862
01:45:33.521 --> 01:45:35.230
If engagement will go down.

1863
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:39.230
<v 1>I'm sure Netflix,
you know when you look at Netflix is model.
Uh,</v>

1864
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:40.870
I'm pretty sure that algorithm is,

1865
01:45:40.871 --> 01:45:43.190
is showing like okay this is getting this many lights.

1866
01:45:43.191 --> 01:45:46.400
Let's put this on the front page.
So more people are going to click on it.

1867
01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:47.481
That makes sense.

1868
01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:50.120
I mean you don't necessarily have to see how many people watch it.

1869
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:54.820
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
well Netflix does it also for negotiation purposes.
Sure.</v>

1870
01:45:54.821 --> 01:45:55.960
Like say when I do a special,

1871
01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:59.250
like I know my last special got more views than my first special,

1872
01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:02.230
but I don't know how many you got.
They don't tell you shit.

1873
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.840
He didn't say we were very happy.
We're very,
very happy.

1874
01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:07.180
Well tell me how many people watching.
We can't tell you that.

1875
01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:12.080
You can't tell me they're laughing.
We're very happy,
very happy with the fuck.

1876
01:46:12.130 --> 01:46:14.520
Does that mean tell me how many people,

1877
01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:18.720
<v 1>oh,
well if it makes you feel better,
you'll see us doing that now.
ESPN,</v>

1878
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.210
you don't know how many

1879
01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:23.670
<v 2>pay per view is that?
It's getting it's of man is less the promise.
Not many.</v>

1880
01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:27.990
The first one they did was less than a hundred thousand yeah,

1881
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:31.520
that's not good when you consider that,
you know,
that was a chai fight.

1882
01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:36.020
You know Max Holloway,
Dustin Poirier a big ass fucking fight.

1883
01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:40.380
100,000 not even a hundred thousand pies.
But that takes away from our,
our,
uh,

1884
01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:42.870
value as fighters.
You know what I mean?
Cause you know what I'm saying?

1885
01:46:42.871 --> 01:46:45.990
You don't truly get to see it.
That's also because it's streaming,

1886
01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.570
because this transition to ESPN plus,

1887
01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.130
and it's going to take a while before everybody

1888
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.740
<v 3>realizes 100% this is the only way you're going to get the paper view.</v>

1889
01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.080
The only way you're gonna watch the fights.
You got to get the APP.
Yeah,

1890
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.590
that's a great app.
It's going to take a lot all the time.
I have it on.

1891
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:02.960
I have apple TV at home,
so I watch it on that.
Seamless.
I like it.
Yeah.

1892
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:07.070
I mean me too.
But then again,
I'm a just,
I'm a follow on wherever they go.

1893
01:47:07.210 --> 01:47:11.490
But the zone is the same way too.
Like I watched the Joshua,
I'm Ruiz fight.

1894
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.810
I watched that on disown.
That's fucking excellence.
The same thing.
Yeah.

1895
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.640
I mean in the numbers from,
from stuff like that,
it's like,
that's what I mean.

1896
01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:23.130
I think eventually is going to change the way we really got to see the true

1897
01:47:23.131 --> 01:47:27.000
numbers.
It's going to have to,
because I wonder,
because when you,

1898
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:31.260
when you see like Canelo Alvarez make a 25 million or wherever he did in his

1899
01:47:31.261 --> 01:47:34.090
last fight,
and then you hear he's only got,
you know,

1900
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:38.880
800,000 subscribers that signed up for does own.
But then you look at at,

1901
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:42.660
uh,
800,000 subscribers on design.
That's what I heard.

1902
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:46.110
At least that he says.
True Google.

1903
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:51.140
How many subscribers does design have Daaz n I was calling it Dayson forever.

1904
01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:57.040
And there was no,
no,
no man.
It's like,
well you need a fucking oh and an e.

1905
01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:02.970
But then you look,
I mean,
I don't know,
Jamie would probably pull up the number.

1906
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:04.170
But then when you,

1907
01:48:04.230 --> 01:48:08.370
when you look at like all the same night owl fought cowboy,

1908
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.560
which is a way better fight Tuesday amazings fight,
great fight.
But you know,

1909
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:16.500
ESPN,
I don't know how many numbers,
you know,

1910
01:48:16.501 --> 01:48:20.790
they don't say the numbers of my subscribers,
but it's gotta be comparable.

1911
01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:23.670
But that was a free fight.
He didn't have to see.

1912
01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:28.260
The thing is about ESPN plus you get free fights and then you get paper views.

1913
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:32.670
So the cowboy versus ally quantified was a great fight,
but it was free.

1914
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:35.130
So if you've got that APP,
you just watched the fight.

1915
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:37.530
But I think the zone is same way.
You don't,
you don't have to buy them.

1916
01:48:37.531 --> 01:48:39.750
You just pay per month.
Yes,
yes,
yes.

1917
01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:44.730
But the UFC for paper view is not,
so when you get a pay per view fight,

1918
01:48:44.731 --> 01:48:47.820
you have to pay.
So that's a little weird,
right?

1919
01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.740
Like maybe make it a little more money,

1920
01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:53.350
make it 10 bucks a month and give everybody everything.
That'd be crazy.

1921
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.150
What did WWE did?
Yeah,
and it was a huge success.

1922
01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:59.270
They'll probably figured that out.
It took a while.
It was a,

1923
01:48:59.430 --> 01:49:02.430
it was rocky [inaudible] modeled as old 4 million,

1924
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:05.740
4 million subscribers to design.
That makes sense.
That's really,

1925
01:49:05.741 --> 01:49:10.290
if they had from their vice president of North America said that in my TV show.

1926
01:49:10.291 --> 01:49:10.910
But yeah,

1927
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:13.980
I don't know that whale worldwide subscribers in North America subscribers.

1928
01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:16.560
I don't,
that doesn't matter.
It's internet doesn't matter,

1929
01:49:16.561 --> 01:49:17.790
but it's a 4 million people suddenly be,

1930
01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.900
you are right in this guy's full of shit and no,
no,
I think that's totally right.

1931
01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.070
I think I,
yeah,
that's totally right.
But it limits your ability to negotiate,

1932
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:31.830
right?
Because you don't know like with Directv,
like,
hey,

1933
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:36.750
directv says there's 700,000 pay per view,
buys,
know,
big hit.
Everybody's happy.

1934
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:39.600
You get a piece of that like,
Oh boy,
we've got this much money coming in.

1935
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.310
Like what?
How are they doing deals now for paper?
You,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1936
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:48.810
I ain't going to read negotiation yet,
but you know,
do they,
after your fight,

1937
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:51.970
do they give you a window of time before you,

1938
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.460
they contact you and hit you up with another fight?

1939
01:49:54.461 --> 01:49:58.690
Like how does that work knowing me,
I wanted to get back in there and August.

1940
01:49:59.350 --> 01:50:03.370
Uh,
but you know what's up Jeremy?

1941
01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:07.140
I'm not reading that at,
they were publicly saying that,
uh,

1942
01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:11.380
one point more than 1.2 million people watched worldwide,
uh,

1943
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.970
Canelo's last fight.
So it's not that,
that's the way that's way less.

1944
01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:19.450
Well that's not that many because it's free,
right?

1945
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:21.130
Once you have the zone that's free,

1946
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:23.830
which is interesting that the UFC has a different model than that.

1947
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:28.990
Only thing I mean is Canelo gets 25 million and then,
uh,
you know,

1948
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:33.260
Allah cowboy get about a hundred grand a piece.
So there's like,
you know,

1949
01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:37.510
where's the value in is going on and then it's not only the Canelo I think like

1950
01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:40.810
three fights a down,
you know,
on the,
on the cart.

1951
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.380
Like that guy got like a hundred grand,
I don't even know his name.
Yeah.
I mean,

1952
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:49.150
well,
we look at the purse out Canelo God,
I like a $600 million.

1953
01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.640
Stupid,
insane,
right?
I didn't,

1954
01:50:51.641 --> 01:50:54.640
they just signed Tyson fury did something similar like that with ESPN.

1955
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:57.640
He got us some crazy similar deal as well.

1956
01:50:57.641 --> 01:51:00.700
And Anthony Joshua was with the zone to another crazy deal.

1957
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.010
It's all weird right now,
right?

1958
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:05.470
Everybody's trying to figure out what the future is and they're banking on

1959
01:51:05.471 --> 01:51:09.580
streaming,
which I think is the correct bet.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's changing.

1960
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:13.390
Everything is,
unless everything I think is gonna gonna Change,
it's just,

1961
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:16.330
it's just taken a little bit of time before it all,

1962
01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:19.420
we used to prompt around right at a cowboy and I lie Quinta.

1963
01:51:19.421 --> 01:51:24.250
We surprised that result.
No,
no,
not really.

1964
01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:29.160
The way,
uh,
uh,
I was surprised at what that long,
you know what I mean?
I,

1965
01:51:29.161 --> 01:51:32.260
I thought,
uh,
the only way cowboy are,

1966
01:51:32.261 --> 01:51:36.220
the only way Al was going to win is if he would have knocked them out,
uh,
early,

1967
01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:41.110
um,
is just the kicks would have been too much.
And it was like,

1968
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:45.250
I think that first left switch kick that he through and kind of caught out on

1969
01:51:45.251 --> 01:51:48.880
top of the head a little bit.
Uh,
I think that,
yeah,
that was,
yeah.

1970
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:51.890
I wasn't necessarily surprised.
Hey,
cowboy has been on his game for sure.

1971
01:51:51.891 --> 01:51:55.090
It's been on [inaudible] which brings up this weekend.

1972
01:51:55.390 --> 01:52:00.220
Tony Ferguson cowboys.
Yeah.
Own Holy Shit.
Fight.

1973
01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:05.530
Ooh,
I'm so excited about that fight.
I see it going to tonitto really have to,

1974
01:52:05.531 --> 01:52:09.330
you know,
I,
at first I didn't,
I thought that cowboys just,
just to,

1975
01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:13.780
to on his point,
um,
cobbles timing might be a little bit better.

1976
01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:18.280
So you know,
and Tony does get hit so that's something to look at.

1977
01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:22.960
But I think Tony's just unorthodox movements and in the way he throws punches

1978
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:27.020
and moves his head at the same time as throwing punches cowboy,

1979
01:52:27.021 --> 01:52:30.730
he likes to kind of leave his head up there and maybe get hit to the body or

1980
01:52:30.731 --> 01:52:33.800
something.
So Tony's relentless,
relentless.
Yeah.

1981
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:36.680
That mother fucker never gets tired and he keeps it somebody robbed her.
Yeah.

1982
01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:40.930
Yes,
yes.
It's a three round it cause it's the third fight below the main event.

1983
01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:43.880
So the main event is so Hutto Marla Mris,

1984
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:47.740
which is another fucking phenomenal fight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1985
01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:52.160
Mother's got a lot of power.
Oh,
he's got everything.
Yeah.
That's a big one.

1986
01:52:52.161 --> 01:52:55.640
35 or two.
That dude's jacked.
That's a big,
uh,
that's a,

1987
01:52:56.210 --> 01:53:00.260
that's like a big risk going up for pseudo,
I think.
You know,
and you know,

1988
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:02.060
he's such a champ though.
He'd been at,

1989
01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.200
at the top of multiple sports for so long that he's got so much experience.
He,

1990
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.890
he's gonna know how to handle it.
Right.
But it's a good fight.

1991
01:53:09.090 --> 01:53:12.410
It's better than that.
People are given credit for it for sure.
Yeah.

1992
01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:16.820
He just wants to be champ champ.
You know,
as long as the two champ champs,

1993
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:21.020
he wants to number three.
Well,
there's,
hey champ.
Champs.
I'm sorry because a,

1994
01:53:21.021 --> 01:53:21.940
I'm a,

1995
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:27.190
<v 2>can we call this something else?
Uh,
Amanda Newman.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1996
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.200
Can we call it something else from you?

1997
01:53:29.290 --> 01:53:33.470
We'll be going to like it because it's too many of them now.
It's like,
okay kid,

1998
01:53:33.471 --> 01:53:37.900
I liked her.
You call a chance.
Yeah,
I'm a DC became champ champ.
I got excited.

1999
01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:38.380
But then when you

2000
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:42.880
<v 3>defend the belt,
you know for two or three times,
are you,</v>

2001
01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:45.130
are you champ champ,
Dan?
You know what I mean?

2002
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.260
You won the title twice and definitive.
It should be champ champion,

2003
01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:54.100
<v 2>but when you win two divisions,
you are champ champ.</v>

2004
01:53:54.101 --> 01:53:55.960
You stop fucking around Kevin Lee.

2005
01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:03.250
I'm,
hey.
Hey,
you can't take away a Mandy Nunez is champ champ.

2006
01:54:03.251 --> 01:54:07.780
If she decides to never fight at featherweight again,
she is champ champ.
Period.

2007
01:54:08.190 --> 01:54:12.370
I,
yeah,
you're right.
Straight up murderer.
You are right.
But you know,

2008
01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.810
I wish we call it something different.

2009
01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:20.720
He just mad that Connor invented.
Yeah.
I ain't gonna lie.

2010
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:27.010
That's about Jamie.
Do you know rumbles not fighting,
but he's soon too.

2011
01:54:27.011 --> 01:54:28.180
That's a dangerous fight.

2012
01:54:28.181 --> 01:54:31.900
If you want to keep your knees like Greg Jones is no God damn joke.

2013
01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.780
Craig Jones is a heal hook and mother fucker.
He is.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2014
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:40.690
Craig Jones is at the top of the food chain in the submission grappling world,

2015
01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:44.980
but he's not as big as rumble,
but I don't think anybody's drug testing.

2016
01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:47.830
But that means I'm not drug testing rumble.
So who knows?

2017
01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.420
I don't even know if they have to weigh in.

2018
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:50.970
I don't think they're going to weigh in.

2019
01:54:51.010 --> 01:54:54.090
They're calling it like a David versus Goliath maps.
So I don't blow wait.

2020
01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.470
Oh rose gold stolen 350 pounds.

2021
01:54:57.471 --> 01:55:02.060
I wonder what rumbles going away because Craig Jones has been grappling.
I want,

2022
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:06.980
I want,
I want to say he's probably around two 15 to 20 long guys.
Not,

2023
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:08.590
not incredibly ripped,

2024
01:55:08.591 --> 01:55:13.330
but this submission grappling world is very strange because there's no real drug

2025
01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:17.710
testing to speak of and everybody kind of knows that everybody's kind of juiced

2026
01:55:17.711 --> 01:55:20.020
up.
You know that for Brazil,

2027
01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:25.810
Brazil Jones is from Australia.
But I've just made that some of those guys,

2028
01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.820
you know what I mean?
But,
uh,

2029
01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:32.300
<v 3>I dunno,
I don't think it comes to that much into play in grappling with so much</v>

2030
01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:35.930
technique and leverage a ball,
it comes into play.

2031
01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:38.540
It helps you train much longer,
much harder,

2032
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:43.320
stronger,
especially with no g probably does,
you know,

2033
01:55:43.321 --> 01:55:47.970
I think in Nogi well I think it works with key too.
It's just,
look,
it's physical.

2034
01:55:47.971 --> 01:55:51.000
It's a physical thing.
You get two guys,
one guy's on juice,
one guy doesn't,

2035
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:55.350
the guy who's on juice has some sort of an advantage if they're both technically

2036
01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:56.100
similar.

2037
01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.600
But that's a tough fight for rumble in that Craig is used to being on the bottom

2038
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.750
and he's used to fighting with,

2039
01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:08.550
with inside control of the legs.
Like,
I don't know what kind of rumble,

2040
01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:13.140
what kind of leg lock game rumble has.
Is this Dennis Hallman.

2041
01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.250
Chuck Doris.
Oh yeah.
And the crazy thing is,
um,

2042
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:22.170
Dennis Hallman went for a fucking heel hook here and Craig Jones was like,
nope,

2043
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:26.640
not a good idea.
Yeah.
Fuck you fucked his leg.
Good idea.
Yeah.

2044
01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:29.880
I feel like that's going to be the next little evolution that you're seeing.
MMA.

2045
01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:32.080
It's like lox.
Lox.
Yeah,
I think so too.

2046
01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.930
I've really started to incorporate it a little bit into,
into my game.

2047
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:40.620
Uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,
especially against wrestlers.

2048
01:56:40.621 --> 01:56:44.190
Like I'd be a little worried if I was uh,
uh,
uh,

2049
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:48.100
in rebels corner for that cause wrestles a little more susceptible to,

2050
01:56:48.190 --> 01:56:49.260
to leg locks for sure.

2051
01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:54.680
So I feel like that's going to be like the next little level that you see guys.

2052
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:58.920
You have to understand the system and I don't,
I'm not a leg lock guy.
It's hard.

2053
01:56:59.310 --> 01:56:59.551
Yeah,

2054
01:56:59.551 --> 01:57:03.660
I see the transitions but if I was on the mat with them I wouldn't be a step

2055
01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.171
ahead.

2056
01:57:04.171 --> 01:57:07.620
I wouldn't be able to like know where they're going and I would have to react as

2057
01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:11.580
it's happening,
which is a giant disadvantage and I don't know what rumble knows.

2058
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:16.140
I know he was a great wrestler and brumble his big thing was never submitting

2059
01:57:16.141 --> 01:57:18.480
people so fucking people up standing up.
Yeah.

2060
01:57:18.481 --> 01:57:21.960
I mean I think the best way is just to try and disengage from them and just not

2061
01:57:21.961 --> 01:57:24.330
let him have your legs.
It's just,
that's easier said than done.

2062
01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:25.980
I look with all that with Craig Jones.

2063
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:30.900
It's just the thing with those guys is when you're rolling with someone who is

2064
01:57:30.901 --> 01:57:32.400
that high level with submissions,

2065
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:37.560
you are reacting and they know how you're gonna react and they're anticipating

2066
01:57:37.561 --> 01:57:41.670
your reaction and they have a counter to your reaction and you're always one

2067
01:57:41.671 --> 01:57:43.740
step behind so you can explode and explode,

2068
01:57:43.741 --> 01:57:47.320
explode and eventually you get a little tired and then who hoop and know
Hickson.

2069
01:57:47.321 --> 01:57:49.680
He's talk about that.
It's like they can keep the rhythm.

2070
01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:51.031
That's what I always say.

2071
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:54.150
They can't keep the rhythm like this cause it just keep going.

2072
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.140
They keep attacking and you just can explode and explode and show everybody how

2073
01:57:58.141 --> 01:57:58.741
athletic you are.

2074
01:57:58.741 --> 01:58:02.340
But after awhile that shit wears out and then next thing you know you're wrapped

2075
01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:05.700
up in something.
Yeah.
And I think they see more guys like you.

2076
01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:08.700
You know what I mean?
They seem more guys that are just trying to,
you know,

2077
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:10.200
they see a lot of wrestlers and all that guys.

2078
01:58:10.201 --> 01:58:12.420
Just try those same kinds of defenses.

2079
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:16.350
Were you not seeing that many guys that are good at let locks like that?

2080
01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:20.370
Especially to the point where now they're starting to understand it way more

2081
01:58:20.371 --> 01:58:22.080
technically than,
you know,

2082
01:58:22.081 --> 01:58:26.040
like [inaudible] style of just grab your foot and just trying to like squeeze

2083
01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:30.780
the shit off cars.
Had some good technique.
But if [inaudible] complex is like a,

2084
01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:33.690
you know,
Eddie Cummings or something.
Yeah.
I don't mean by Harvard said General,

2085
01:58:33.691 --> 01:58:35.940
I just mean that style of doing it.
You know,

2086
01:58:35.941 --> 01:58:39.960
some guys you just see like they just grab your foot and just twist it the way

2087
01:58:39.961 --> 01:58:41.660
it ain't supposed to go.
But you know,

2088
01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.650
when you look at a guy like a Donna here style,
uh,

2089
01:58:44.710 --> 01:58:48.240
and he's breaking it down like a mad scientist.
He's like,
you know,

2090
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:53.140
there's literally going to be no way that you're going to get out of those

2091
01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:54.320
different levels of it.
You know,

2092
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:56.730
you've seen that with Gary tone in now and I remember,
yeah.
Yeah.

2093
01:58:56.731 --> 01:58:58.390
Gary tone was fighting over in one.

2094
01:58:58.391 --> 01:59:00.970
He just submitted the shit out of somebody with an inside.
He'll hook.

2095
01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:04.990
Has he fought against it?
We just fought real recently.
Just fall like a week ago.

2096
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:10.170
Oh Wow.
He's going to be a world champion.
I really believe that.
Yeah.

2097
01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:14.230
I've seen his,
uh,
his,
his first like to maybe,
well he's undefeated.
He's foreign.

2098
01:59:14.231 --> 01:59:17.610
Oh,
now.
Oh,
okay.
And,
uh,
it's just the way he's winning too.
He's,

2099
01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.190
he's fucking people up and he's super dedicated and he's just real smart.

2100
01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:24.760
And when he's got with a guy like Donna her in his corner,

2101
01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:28.450
like Donna her is another guy and he's also,
by the way,
you know,

2102
01:59:28.451 --> 01:59:31.660
he's locked up for asa hobby.
They're all like in cahoots together.

2103
01:59:31.661 --> 01:59:35.500
They trained together,
but Donna has got a special brain.
He really does.

2104
01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:39.160
He has a special understanding of submissions.
Yeah.
I want to talk to that guy.

2105
01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:43.390
Yeah.
Shut him out.
Yeah,
definitely should go get on down in New York.
Yeah.

2106
01:59:43.391 --> 01:59:45.430
He's the type of visit to him.
Yeah.

2107
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:48.970
He's the type of dude I said that I talked six hours what it was like.
He goes,

2108
01:59:48.971 --> 01:59:53.770
he seems like he's got that,
you know,
systematic way of,

2109
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.630
of breaking stuff down.
So I kind of liked that,
uh,

2110
01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.360
because it takes the guesswork out of it.
You know what I mean?
It takes the,

2111
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.750
what if he does this?
Oh,
well then he has got an answer for it.
Would it be,

2112
02:00:04.751 --> 02:00:07.210
does this,
he's got an answer.
But you know,
uh,

2113
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:09.220
that's why I feel like I'm kind of missing him.

2114
02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:12.100
Like whoa necessarily that my game.
But yeah,

2115
02:00:12.101 --> 02:00:15.670
I think that would be a great addition to anybody's games to train down there

2116
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:18.190
and understand what that guy's doing or,
I mean there's a,

2117
02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:21.820
there's quite a few different systems now and then you got like Craig Jones

2118
02:00:21.821 --> 02:00:24.070
who's coming,
like I said from Australia,
he's got,

2119
02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.800
he's got a very similar system to,
it's just,

2120
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:28.630
everybody's got different approaches to it.

2121
02:00:28.631 --> 02:00:33.250
But what Donna her did and that Henzel Gracie team did is they just kind of like

2122
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:38.050
proof of concept.
Just let everybody know,
hey,
like you're missing out on,

2123
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:39.790
on a giant chunk of this thing.

2124
02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:43.900
And a giant chunk of this thing is all the variables that come into play when

2125
02:00:43.901 --> 02:00:46.270
guys are trying to rip each other's knees apart.
Yeah,
yeah.

2126
02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:49.300
It kind of goes back to even like,
you know,

2127
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.590
those individual sports are so ahead of,
of,
of ours,
you know,

2128
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.030
like what we were talking about earlier,

2129
02:00:55.031 --> 02:00:58.600
when you seeing worldclass Jujitsu fighters are a worldclass Moyie Thai fighter.

2130
02:00:58.670 --> 02:01:02.380
It's,
they're just better at that thing then the guys who do everything.
Yeah.

2131
02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:06.190
So I mean a couple of years ago you saw more like Jujitsu gold,

2132
02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:11.200
tobacco tax and you know,
uh,
arm bars were like really big in it.
Um,
and now you,

2133
02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:14.250
then they kind of went through like the leg lock era and I feel like we kind of

2134
02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:18.550
stuck on the back of tech kind of our bar and eventually we'll move over to,
to,

2135
02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:21.190
uh,
being able to pull up leg locks.
Cause now you see it,

2136
02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:24.460
a lot of Jujitsu guys kind of get away from the leg lock and starting to under

2137
02:01:24.490 --> 02:01:27.080
the defense is starting to catch up a little bit.
Um,

2138
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:30.620
I didn't get to go to worlds to,
to see it,
but you know,
um,

2139
02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:35.920
I always like to stay one step ahead of it and see where it's going.

2140
02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:38.710
You know what's on the other side of it.
It's interesting.

2141
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:40.010
In a world they were weighing the

2142
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.850
<v 2>fighters before they got onto the mat.
That's how you weighed in.
Yeah.</v>

2143
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:48.470
You have to make weight with your Guianan at the side of the mat and then you

2144
02:01:48.471 --> 02:01:50.120
drink some water and then go roll.

2145
02:01:50.210 --> 02:01:54.020
So they're trying to discourage any and all way cutting

2146
02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.320
<v 1>that works if you're not getting hit,
you know what I mean?
Right,
right,
right.</v>

2147
02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.340
Yeah.
When you talk about like punching each other,

2148
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:06.170
some gods are still going to cut weight and that's too big of a risk to take

2149
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:08.660
care of me.
Yeah.
You dangerous.
Very,

2150
02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:12.840
very dangerous yet very dangerous brain is,
you know,
and,

2151
02:02:12.841 --> 02:02:15.920
and this was even an idea that I had kind of head was like,

2152
02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:21.610
I wonder why nobody creates some type of fluid field,

2153
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:26.630
uh,
uh,
heck here of some sort.
You know what I mean?

2154
02:02:26.631 --> 02:02:30.290
Like when you think about like your brain,
your brain is surrounded by that,
the,

2155
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:33.140
that fluid.
And that's really what's protecting it,
you know,

2156
02:02:33.141 --> 02:02:36.920
more so than even like the thickness of your skull or anything.

2157
02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:40.520
So when you put in,
you know,
I,
I get why they like boxing.

2158
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:43.460
Amateur boxing is starting to take away the head gear because they are saying

2159
02:02:43.461 --> 02:02:44.630
it's making it more dangerous.

2160
02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.690
It's really only helping the guy who's punching you.
Right.
You know,

2161
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:50.660
when you punch somebody with a headgear you can go play full blast.

2162
02:02:50.661 --> 02:02:54.640
So it's also their head snaps more because there's weight on the neck.
Yeah,
it's,

2163
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:57.500
it's,
it's actually making it worse,
you know?
Uh,

2164
02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.630
where if you had something that was fluid,

2165
02:02:59.631 --> 02:03:03.490
feel kind of recreating the inside of you,

2166
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:07.790
hit then that would absorb and shake the water.
You know,

2167
02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:12.320
like almost like those,
uh,
those water bags,
you know,
when you hit those,

2168
02:03:12.321 --> 02:03:16.930
like you can feel like it's a little,
it absorbs the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

2169
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.300
impact a little bit different.
I just wonder,
I mean,
I don't,

2170
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:21.980
it probably not a good idea.

2171
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:26.000
Like maybe if you busted and he got water flicking flowing everywhere or

2172
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:26.834
something,
but that's what

2173
02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:29.310
<v 2>deal.
But I think you're right.
That makes sense.</v>

2174
02:03:29.311 --> 02:03:33.630
If they could design it correctly and figure out a way to disburse the impact

2175
02:03:33.670 --> 02:03:35.220
better.
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

2176
02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:39.010
<v 1>Yeah.
F Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know that they,</v>

2177
02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:42.820
they should just do some serious testing.
No,
now I don't know why.
And uh,

2178
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:47.140
I'm part of the Cleveland Clinic.
I'm over in,
in,
in Vegas.
They,

2179
02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:50.680
they've got this study going on for a couple of years where they take you in and

2180
02:03:50.681 --> 02:03:51.740
they,
uh,
they,

2181
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:55.270
they run you through an Mri scan and they do all these different types of tests

2182
02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:59.020
on you on a lot on the computer,
like testing your reaction skills,

2183
02:03:59.021 --> 02:04:03.130
testing and balance testing all the,
you know,
different parts of your brain.
Um,

2184
02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:04.180
it's been a couple of years now.

2185
02:04:04.210 --> 02:04:08.580
I think I've been part of them for like four years.
I go in twice a year to,

2186
02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:09.463
to get it done.

2187
02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.840
But that just seems like it's gonna take so long before you really notice

2188
02:04:13.841 --> 02:04:14.610
anything.

2189
02:04:14.610 --> 02:04:15.421
<v 2>And when you do that,</v>

2190
02:04:15.421 --> 02:04:18.630
do they tell you your results based on how you were six months ago?

2191
02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.650
<v 1>Yeah,
they,
they give me,</v>

2192
02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:24.330
I actually just asked for the Mri scans because they tell you and it just like,

2193
02:04:24.331 --> 02:04:28.050
yeah,
no,
you're fine.
Like,
you know,
like Yo results are the,

2194
02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:30.900
cause it's Kinda in the same test that you're taking over and over and over

2195
02:04:30.901 --> 02:04:35.580
again.
So they just kind of match them up to how you did last time.
And you know,

2196
02:04:35.581 --> 02:04:40.200
if you scored a 98 on the last one,
you scored 90 on this one.
It's like,
okay,

2197
02:04:40.201 --> 02:04:43.950
that's cool.
You know?
Yeah,
you've,
you fine.
But to me,

2198
02:04:43.951 --> 02:04:47.400
I asked him for the actual Mri Scans.
I don't know how to read an Mri like that.

2199
02:04:47.401 --> 02:04:50.430
Right.
But you know,
cause I want to see like the,

2200
02:04:50.431 --> 02:04:52.620
even though it's got to be deeper than that,

2201
02:04:52.621 --> 02:04:55.230
it's got to be deeper than two plus two and you know,
all this shit,

2202
02:04:55.231 --> 02:04:57.090
like it's gotta be something more to it.

2203
02:04:57.090 --> 02:05:02.090
Like they should just do a study where they take up holistic kit and hit it a

2204
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:06.930
bunch of times and see what's happening to the brain of it.
You know what I mean?

2205
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.880
Right,
right.
Left Francis Poncha.
Yeah.
Like,
I want to know,
you know,

2206
02:05:11.881 --> 02:05:14.550
I think,
uh,
and I think fans are like want to know,
like,

2207
02:05:14.551 --> 02:05:17.880
you don't want to give you your brain to this shit.
Right.
You know,
and it's like,

2208
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:21.960
and then you could do stuff where you put some over it,
put a headgear on it,

2209
02:05:21.961 --> 02:05:24.870
see if it makes it worse.
But like I said,
water head.

2210
02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:27.810
Do you think you're ever going to get to a point where they'll have a study that

2211
02:05:27.811 --> 02:05:30.390
they can like a test like that they could do another fighter and they'll say,

2212
02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:32.890
hey man,
you can't fight anymore.
Yeah,
for sure.

2213
02:05:32.891 --> 02:05:35.580
Cause they really don't have that right now,
which is why they let chocolate,

2214
02:05:35.581 --> 02:05:39.000
Dell fight Tito Ortiz.
Right?
Yeah.
I think,
uh,

2215
02:05:39.450 --> 02:05:43.960
just like Mr,
like an MRI,
you know,
like a couple of years ago,
you know,

2216
02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:46.710
you wouldn't be able to get the same type of images.
Um,

2217
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:49.950
and now when you see like some of the stuff that they're really coming out with

2218
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:51.360
medically,
um,

2219
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:54.750
I think that's going to advance so much more to where you're gonna really be

2220
02:05:54.751 --> 02:05:57.810
able to see like the individual neurons in,
in,
in self identity.

2221
02:05:57.811 --> 02:05:58.980
You guys see like,
okay,

2222
02:05:58.981 --> 02:06:03.690
you're breaking up these d these parts of your brain that we couldn't see

2223
02:06:03.691 --> 02:06:06.690
before.
You know,
you can see what an x ray,
you couldn't see it with a what,

2224
02:06:06.691 --> 02:06:10.230
an MRI.
A lot of times they can't see until the autopsy.
Right?
Right.

2225
02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:15.150
So hopefully as,
as technology improves and as we get better on that front,
like,

2226
02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.620
then we can just start to take some of that,
uh,

2227
02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:24.450
is that technology in and use it for what we doing,
you know?

2228
02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.950
Yeah.
Well,
Kevin Lee has been a blast.
Let's do it again.
Six months.

2229
02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:32.970
Let me know what a year.
A year.
We'll be here a year.
A year.
We'll beautiful.

2230
02:06:33.050 --> 02:06:36.150
Thank you brother.
Appreciate you,
man.
Kevin Lee,
ladies and gentlemen.

2231
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:39.890
<v 6>Yeah.</v>
