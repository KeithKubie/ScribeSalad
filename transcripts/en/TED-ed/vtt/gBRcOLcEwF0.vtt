00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.428
What's so great about the Great Lakes?

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:13.678
They're known as America's inland seas.

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:15.287
The North American Great Lakes

00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:16.026
Huron,

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:16.844
Ontario,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:17.644
Michigan,

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:18.350
Erie,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.367
and Superior

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:22.496
are so massive
that they border eight states

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:26.107
and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water.

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:29.727
That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.547
three meters deep.

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:34.057
These vast bodies of water span forest,

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:34.877
grassland,

00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:36.418
and wetland habitats,

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:40.724
supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:44.745
But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be?

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:49.862
The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago,

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:51.857
a time when the climate was warming

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:56.138
and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat.

00:00:56.138 --> 00:00:59.998
These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins.

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:03.388
Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt,

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:07.130
creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.923
Over time, channels developed between
these basins,

00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:12.658
and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.008
that persists to this day.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.038
In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes

00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:23.207
contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water.

00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:26.698
The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior,

00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:30.189
which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.569
containing half the system's water.

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.797
Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters,

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:42.349
creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.669
A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.249
before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron.

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.868
Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one.

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.879
To the west lies Lake Michigan,

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.879
the third largest of the lakes
by surface area.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.515
Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:05.660
and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.058
many wildlife species,

00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:09.419
and unique fossilized coral.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.250
To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.917
It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested,

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:19.350
including 7,000-year-old petrified trees.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.079
Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.459
from Lake Huron into Lake Erie.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.770
This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.330
has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.128
Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:41.710
more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.358
into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area.

00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:49.551
From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River,

00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.211
eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.151
In addition to being a natural wonder,

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.050
the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.232
They provide natural water filtration,

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:01.321
flood control,

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.850
and nutrients cycling.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.451
By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers,

00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:11.041
the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:15.101
and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms

00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.801
that line their banks.

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.292
But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too.

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:25.601
The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.402
exposing the once pristine waters

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:31.091
to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants.

00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.741
Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually,

00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:38.241
decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters.

00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:40.360
Humans have also inadvertently introduced

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.701
more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes,

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:48.551
such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys

00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.898
that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.225
On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm,

00:03:55.225 --> 00:04:00.300
thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.330
Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.262
of this natural resource.

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:10.379
Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution,

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.231
protect coastal habitats,

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:15.318
and halt the spread of invasive species.

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.982
Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:20.812
will require the collaboration
of many organizations,

00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:22.072
but the effort is critical

00:04:22.072 --> 00:04:26.102
if we can preserve the wonder
of this flowing inland sea.
