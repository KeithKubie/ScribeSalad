00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.166
&gt;&gt;Pierre: When I take students out
of class and bring them up here

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.436
to help me they honestly
have no idea what it is.

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:11.276
I get a lot of the same
questions all the time.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.076
You know, "What is it?

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:15.966
Oh, the plants are feeding the fish
and the fish are feeding the plants."

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:16.696
And "How does it work?"

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.946
&gt;&gt;Regina Dvorak: What he did on his
own in his greenhouse is real life.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.276
It's real food production.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.636
It's a real solution
to the food problem.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.376
The idea is incredibly inspiring.

00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:35.926
&gt;&gt;Pierre: My mom is really
into gardening so she decided

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.956
that she wanted to have a
greenhouse on our property.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:41.446
And we decided it would be
a good idea to kinda check

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:44.346
out some different alternatives as to
what you could put in a greenhouse.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:47.106
So we decided to go to the
University of Nevada Reno

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:53.996
for a workshop basically on
hydroponics and it just intrigued me.

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:56.816
I said, "Mom, listen.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.166
I think I could build one of these
systems if I had the money to do it."

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:03.586
So I had a little bit of money
in the bank and I decided

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:04.956
to spend it on the greenhouse.

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:10.376
&gt;&gt;Mary: He just took off with it and
at some point there was, you know,

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.776
two to three to four
trips every weekend to--

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:13.966
going to Home Depot to buy things.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.896
And he kept having all these ideas
about what he wanted to do next

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:21.166
and then he just went to the Internet
and started looking at YouTube videos

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.906
and learning different
ways to build systems.

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:28.086
&gt;&gt;Pierre: Honestly, I loved, I loved
it, I loved building the system,

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.956
I loved seeing the plants grow.

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:32.916
At that point I was producing
food for my family and neighbors

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.776
and selling some of it and teaching
people how the systems worked

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:40.196
and getting people started at
their homes, on their own systems.

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:43.676
And then I came across aquaponics.

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:46.096
That really put a new
twist on the whole thing.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:57.626
So here we have a three hundred
gallon trough that houses the fish.

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.736
From the fish tank,
the water's gravity fed

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:02.006
into these three grow beds.

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:08.776
From the grow beds the water drains
out into series of sump tanks.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:13.016
&gt;&gt;Will Allen: Well, most kids today
unfortunately don't really understand

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.006
where their food really comes
from in the whole food system

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:20.876
because we are several
generations now lost from folks

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:24.656
that actually grew up on the farm and
were very connected in a local way

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:25.976
or a regional way to their food.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:29.356
&gt;&gt;Pierre: From the sump tanks
the water's pumped up from a pump

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:33.996
that I have right here
into these NFT beds

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:36.426
"nutrient film technique"
is the term.

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:39.086
&gt;&gt;Will Allen: He's
embarking on something

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:41.196
that is growing as we speak.

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:45.376
Fifty percent of our fish that
we eat today is farm-raised.

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:49.416
That's gonna go to about seventy-five
percent in the next five years.

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:52.436
So he's getting the
best of both worlds.

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:57.496
He's using the plants
to remediate the toxins

00:02:57.556 --> 00:02:59.786
that the fish give
off in their waste.

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:04.056
So he's getting vegetable
product and a protein,

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:06.126
fish source about a year later.

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:09.126
&gt;&gt;Pierre: The water's gravity
fed back into the fish tank

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:15.076
where the water's completely purified
and the fish are able to survive

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.806
in a clean environment where
all the ammonia has been taken

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:20.426
out of the system.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.666
&gt;&gt;I figured I would
convert all of the systems

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.466
that I had originally
built hydroponically

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:27.916
into aquaponic systems.

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:32.606
So I tweaked the systems a
little bit, put in air pumps,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.896
basically enhancing the greenhouse
aquaponically ever since.

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:41.856
&gt;&gt;Pierre: So I was in an Ag science
class and we were doing some work

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:45.376
in the greenhouse and I noticed that
really there wasn't anything going

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.666
on in the greenhouse itself.

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.876
I asked my dad, I said, "Do
you think we can, you know,

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:54.506
try and put in an aquaponic system
in the greenhouse at school."

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:54.976
He said, "Yeah.

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:57.816
Write up a proposal,
present it to your teacher

00:03:57.816 --> 00:04:01.396
and the school council
and see what they say."

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:05.976
&gt;&gt;Dan Gayaldo: I had
no idea what it was

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:08.736
and what I did was I
looked it up YouTube also.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:13.026
I went to YouTube and I said, "What
is this aquaponics all about?"

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:17.116
And I was just blown away by
his enthusiasm, his drive,

00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:20.716
his determination, and I said, "This
kid's gonna get this project done."

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:26.026
&gt;&gt;Pierre: Presented the project and
they said, "That's a fantastic idea.

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:28.236
If you can raise the
money we'll allow you

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:29.286
to put a system in the greenhouse."

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:32.076
&gt;&gt;Regina Dvorak: He had to get
a list of materials and costs.

00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:33.756
He had to go to the
principal and ask.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:38.176
A lot of leg work, six months
worth of nothing in the greenhouse

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:42.236
and nervousness about whether
or not he could pull this off.

00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:50.046
&gt;&gt;Pierre: The community support was
a very large portion of this project.

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:52.346
I had to go around to
local organizations

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.386
and be able to raise the money.

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.406
So the community was an
instrumental part in the system.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:02.906
&gt;&gt;Ross Kelley: When we have an
AC relay operated by 110 volts,

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:09.476
when that fails, the contacts close
and start the DC-powered air pump.

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:10.976
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:13.426
&gt;&gt;Ross Kelley: Pierre came along
with the aquaponics project

00:05:13.726 --> 00:05:17.826
of which we had, basically,
no idea what it was,

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:23.536
and he showed us how it works and
we were asked to help him with that,

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:27.836
and it's been a great project and
a good learning experience for us.

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:33.226
&gt;&gt;Dan Gayaldo: When Pierre started
this project one of the things he had

00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:36.116
as a goal was to be able
supply our cafeteria

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:39.856
with fresh vegetables right
out of this greenhouse.

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:43.436
It was quite a process because any
time you do something in a school,

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:46.386
it's about ten times the paperwork.

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:50.286
We have a wonderful salad bar
that's used by hundreds and hundreds

00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:52.966
of students every single
day and it's really neat

00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:55.466
when those kids know their
digging into those greens,

00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:57.736
they're coming right
off of our campus.

00:05:57.736 --> 00:06:00.836
&gt;&gt;Pierre: So this is a small-scale
aquaponic system that I designed

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:03.856
for a classroom or a
residential setting.

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:07.456
So you're looking at
maybe seventy-five

00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:09.866
to a hundred lettuce
plants every two months.

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:13.946
&gt;&gt;Pierre: I want to bring this
system into many different schools.

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:18.546
You know, learning opportunity that a
system like this provides is immense.

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:22.396
You've got water chemistry,
agriculture, science,

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:25.316
physics, mathematics, economics.

00:06:25.956 --> 00:06:29.526
A lot of these subjects could be
modeled from this particular system.

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:35.366
If I can provide a curriculum to go
with this system then the knowledge

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:39.266
of aquaponics will be
proliferated throughout,

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:42.976
hopefully, the United States.

00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:46.576
&gt;&gt;Will Allen: What Pierre is doing
is something that's different.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.656
Something that schools
aren't used to dealing with.

00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:52.896
If you think about this, you
have a student who's come

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:57.786
up with this creative model and
now he goes to the school officials

00:06:57.786 --> 00:06:59.896
and he says, "Listen, I want

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:02.776
to create a curriculum
that I can pass on."

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:07.166
Schools aren't used to hearing
that kind of stuff because change

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:10.236
in schools comes very slow.

00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:12.176
&gt;&gt;Dan Gayaldo: One of the
shortcomings of education is

00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:15.526
that we don't do things that
are application in nature.

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:19.956
They're all theoretical in nature and
this was a project that I think fit

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:23.576
into the culture of the community
and the culture of the school.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:26.626
That's education the
way it should be.
