00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.190
Hi and welcome to the second lesson on tools of the trade. In the

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.710
previous lesson we talked about IDEs. Integrated

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.300
Development Environments and in particular we discussed

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.460
the eclipse ID. Today we're going to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.780
talk about another fundamental type of tools

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.840
in the software engineering arena. Version control

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.140
systems. And these are also called, revision

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.620
or source control systems. In particular, we will focus on a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.320
specific version control system called git. And as we did for eclipse,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.510
we will first present git from a conceptual standpoint. And then

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.200
we will do a demo. To get some hands-on experience with GIT.
