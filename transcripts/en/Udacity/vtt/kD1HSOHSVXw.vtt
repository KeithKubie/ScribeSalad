00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.537
And our answer is negative 4 comma 4, with square brackets on both sides. We can

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:09.003
find this out pretty easily using the table. We want x squared minus 16, which

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.362
is, of course, the distributed form of x minus 4 times x plus 4. We want that

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:18.071
quantity to, to be less than or equal to 0. They are basically interested in all

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:22.349
of the rows in the table, for which this right column does not contain a plus

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.704
sign. So that's these 3 in the middle right here. It means our interval goes

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:30.982
from staring at negative 4 and including that, all the way to positive 4 and

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:34.403
including that as well. Which is what we have written here.
