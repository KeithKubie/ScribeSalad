00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.405
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.780
Now, it is my distinct pleasure
to introduce to you today's

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.160
speaker, Pierre Meystre.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.980
Pierre is a good friend.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
Pierre got his degree
in Switzerland, and then

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.370
another degree in Germany.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.440
He came here to do a postdoc.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.350
Then, he disappeared
back into Germany

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
to be part of the Max
Planck Institute in Optics.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
And then, he came back, where
he's a Regents Professor, which

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
is the highest award that we can
bestow on any of our faculty.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.230
He's a humbled
fellow, and I can go

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.620
on and on about all his awards.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.260
He's, unfortunately,
just retired.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.400
But he hasn't retired.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.080
He's become the Chief Editor
for the American Physical

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.920
Society, which is a big deal.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.510
If anybody's
interested in physics,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.490
all the important things
are written there.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.920
And today, he's going
to tell us a little bit

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.540
about the wondrous
physical world when

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.810
you go really, really small.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.643
Pierre.

00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:10.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.840
Well, thank you, Joaquin.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.570
Has anybody looked at the
weather forecast for New York

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.880
today?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.780
It's great to be in Tucson.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.220
So thank you for inviting me.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.770
And before I start,
there is one person

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.140
that Joaquin forgot
to thank for all

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.240
these extraordinary
lectures, which we have year,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.980
after year, after year.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.620
And it is a Joaquin Ruiz,
because none of that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.945
would happen without him.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:45.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.545
So thank you very much, Joaquin.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.197
So this is the last lecture
of this physics series,

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:57.030
and I'm actually shocked
that there is still

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.430
anybody in the room, because--

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.170
--when I was a young, and
I would go to parties,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.570
and suddenly some lady
would come close to me,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570
or people would come close
to me, and they'd go,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.289
what do you do?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.664
And I would say,
I'm a physicist.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.750
They would all walk away.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.780
So we had four
extraordinary lectures,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.520
where the speakers
tried to explain

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.890
what we do to understand
what's next in physics.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
And what we've seen is
that a lot of this work

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.780
is done in extraordinary
extreme conditions,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.240
be it near a neutron
star or a black hole,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.790
or in these extraordinary
accelerators which are built--

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.910
the LHC accelerator in Geneva.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.220
And really, to understand what
we don't understand in physics,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.890
or in astronomy, we
have to, very often,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.100
go to these extraordinary
extreme conditions.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.180
But what I'd like to do today
is to take a step back, and tell

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.890
you that things are even
extraordinary and bizarre and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.980
strange in our everyday life.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.610
And about 100 years ago,
very, very bright people

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.000
invented a new theory
of physics, which

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.340
is called quantum mechanics.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.820
And I will show you that
quantum mechanics has

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.540
changed our lives completely.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.540
And you could not live
without quantum mechanics

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.332
anymore, except you
don't know that,

00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:29.540
or you don't care about that.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:33.710
But the other thing,
which is really important,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.980
is that, in addition
to changing our lives,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.160
quantum mechanics has
forced us to change

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.700
our deep understanding
and things like,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.000
what is reality, what is
locality, and things like that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.690
So let's see if it works.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.527
I'm a theorist, I
break everything.

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:53.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.900
I think Keith Dienes has
told you something very, very

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.200
important about
what physicists do.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.520
And the first thing that we
do is we try to understand,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.210
what are the rules of the game?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.600
What are the laws of nature?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.140
And this is, again,
what, for instance,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.330
we heard when we talked about
the LHC experiments, trying

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.895
to discover new particles,
stuff beyond just

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:18.589
than relative physics.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.110
But there is a lot more
to physics than that.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.696
And it's like if you play chess.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.070
If you play chess,
it's one thing

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.940
to learn the rules of
how you move the pieces.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.860
But if you just
learn the rules, I

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.280
can bet you I know my grandson
is going to beat the heck out

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.510
of you.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.220
Because he's learned
more than the rules.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.589
He's learned also strategies.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.130
He's learned how to
exploit the rule,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.920
how to understand their
profound implications,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.630
and how to do stuff with that.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.810
And this is the second
part of physics.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.880
In parallel with the process
of discovering new laws,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.710
we need to learn how
to use these rules,

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.390
how to understand
what they mean.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.890
And this is a little
bit what I want

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.910
to talk about today, the
second aspect of what

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.400
makes physics so exciting.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.210
And basically, I will talk
to you about two mysteries.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.430
So there is a cat here.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.080
And this cat is here for
at least three reasons.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.670
The first one is that cats
are very mysterious animals,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.030
and a lot of what we're going
to talk about is mysterious.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.270
We know the Cheshire cat, which
was a very strange cat in Alice

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.500
in Wonderland.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.800
Most of you probably also know
about the Schrodinger cat,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.920
which is both dead and alive.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.360
And so I thought that,
if I keep this cat here,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.929
on some of the slides,
this cat will come back.

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:37.220
And this is a time when you
want to take a deep breath,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.241
because it's going to
become really weird.

00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:39.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.020
And I want you to think
a little bit this--

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.660
so the cat is going to help
guide us through this business.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.810
And there are basically two
mysteries I want to talk about.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.760
The first one is
something that you may

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.200
have heard about the bit more.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.730
It's called wave
particle duality.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.410
This was something
which was understood--

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.910
not understood, but studied
about 100 years ago,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.200
90 years ago.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.950
And basically, it tells you
that quantum objects are waves,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.230
except if you look at them.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.010
So that's the first mystery
we're going to talk about.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.130
And the second mystery is
something Einstein called

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.910
spooky action at a distance.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.530
And it has to do with the
fact that, in some situations,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.090
you can have two particles,
one on the moon and one

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.580
on the earth, or even
more unrealistically,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.410
one in San Francisco
and one in New York,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.440
and you cannot describe these
two particles independently.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.900
What a particle does profoundly
and instantaneously impacts

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.610
the other particle.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.300
So this is the two mysteries.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.910
And the bottom
line of my lecture

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.430
is going to be that
these two mysteries lead

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.530
to two really key consequences.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.040
The first one is that
we have to rethink

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.970
what we mean by reality.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.370
And the second one
is that we will

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.120
need to rethink what
we mean by locality.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:16.000
Reality is the idea that the
properties of objects exist,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.420
whether I look at them or not.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.370
So basically, Joaquin
exists with a beard,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.280
whether I look at him or not.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.576
That's reality.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:31.020
Locality has to do with the
fact, which Einstein made very

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.580
clear, that no information
can propagate faster

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.170
than the speed of light.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.710
And we're going to have
to revisit these two

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.830
self-evident
truths, if you want,

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.926
in the context of
quantum mechanics.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.140
OK.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.550
So let's try to stop
a little bit slowly,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.510
and it's always a good idea to
start with talking about light.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.640
Because for
centuries, scientists

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.830
have been worried quite
a bit about light.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.110
What is it light?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.316
How do we process images?

00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:07.690
All these kind of
optics of light

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.900
are extremely fascinating.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.450
I could give a whole lecture,
or series of lectures, on that,

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.210
but I don't have time.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.090
So I will start at Newton.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.140
Newton was a cranky old man.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.810
And he was cranky, and
he looks cranky here.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.110
And he actually was one of
the most important scholars

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.890
of optics, until the
18th and 19th century.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.919
He wrote a wonderful
book called Opticks,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.289
where he studied the
reflection of light,

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.460
the refraction of light.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.250
He studied how light, if you
put light through a prism,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.670
it gets broken into colors.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:53.100
And he came to the conclusion
that light was made out

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.260
of streams of little particles.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.660
OK, that was his
view of the world.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.560
So light was
particles for Newton.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.480
And this view of
light stayed with us

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.470
for well over 100 years,
until another great character

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.040
came around.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.240
His name is Thomas Young.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.590
He was actually a polymath.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.430
He was a medical doctor.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.610
He was very
interested in the eye.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.160
He's the first who understood
how the eye changes

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.020
its shape so that we can focus
object at different distances.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.480
He also was the first to
understand what astigmatism is.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.520
But in addition, he
was also an Egyptolog.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.860
He made key development
which led then

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.770
to the translation
of the Rosetta Stone

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.310
by Champollion in France.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.680
And so he did all
kinds of things.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.100
He started in mechanics.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.170
There's a wonderful book.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.560
If you don't have anything to
do, you should read this book.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.240
The title of the
book, Thomas Young--

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.560
The Last Man Who
Knew Everything.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.670
An absolutely remarkable book.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.060
And he studied life as well,
because he was interested

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.880
in the eye, so,
therefore, he thought

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.410
I need to study what light is.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.850
And he made a very simple
experiment, which I show here,

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.730
where he took a little
screen, and he cut two slits

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.070
into this screen, and
he shone a beam of light

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.960
through that screen.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.890
A very, very simple experiment.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.290
And we all know what to expect
in this experiment, right?

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.039
What do we expect?

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:24.620
Well, light is made out
of little particles,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.720
so the particles will
go either through one

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.730
of the slits or the other.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.580
So we are clearly going
to get two bright lines

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.950
on some detector,
on some screen,

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.824
behind this double slit.

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:38.240
This is completely
obvious, right?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.100
So why bother to
do the experiment?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.010
But anyway, he did
the experiment anyway.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.760
He probably didn't have
anything else to do.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.440
And what he found is
completely different.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.510
He found this pattern of rays,
which are called interferences.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.460
And interferences
were well known,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.380
and are very well
known, for instance,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.040
if you are on a very
quiet pond, and you

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.900
throw two little
pebbles in this pond,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.580
you'll get two waves,
which are going

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.360
to come close to each other.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.530
And when they interact,
you get these waves.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.580
You get this
interference pattern.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.880
So like, on that.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.880
So he concluded
that actually life

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.760
is not made out of particles,
but it's made of waves.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.950
So just to make sure that
we keep that in mind,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.530
because it will be
somewhat important.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.140
If light is made
out of particles,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.320
we would get a patter like
that-- two bright spots.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.420
If it's made out of waves, we
will get something like that--

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.432
the interferences
that Young observed.

00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:42.265
So he wrote a paper.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.560
And then, he realized
that it's not a good idea

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.180
to contradict Newton.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.090
So here is the paper.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.760
I don't want you to
read it, but I just

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.760
want to show you a
review of his paper.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.710
And now, I'm an editor
of a bunch of journals,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.170
so I see reviews like that.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.570
Maybe not as arrogant.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.370
But to show you that physicists,
contrary to popular belief,

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.420
are not always nice guys.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.390
So here is what
this review said--

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.250
"the paper contains nothing
that deserves the name either

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.020
of experiment or
discovery, and it

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.298
is in fact destitute of
every species of merit."

00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:28.926
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:30.450
And then, it got personnel.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.060
"More fancies, more
unfounded hypotheses,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.140
more gratuitous fictions,
all upon the same field

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.850
on which Newton trod, all from
the fertile yet fruitless brain

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.940
of the same eternal Dr. Young.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.485
This is not nice.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.950
So yeah.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.150
So it's tough, right?

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.574
You have this dogma around,
and you try to change it,

00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:02.490
and it's really tough.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.870
And it took a long, long time
before finally people said,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.840
maybe Young has something.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.420
And during the
whole 19th century,

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.960
people worked very hard at that.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.040
And the culmination of this
work was the work of Maxwell--

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.490
James Clerk Maxwell--
who explained light

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.530
in terms of
electromagnetic waves.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.720
I think that Keith Dienes
has talked about that.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.500
These are electromagnetic waves
which propagate-- surprise--

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.270
at the speed of light.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:31.930
OK.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.340
So this was perfect.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.950
And this is one of the
culminations of 19th century

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.840
physics.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.450
It's also a boot
camp for theorists.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.110
This is very hard
physics, and it explains

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.970
a great deal of things.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.420
And it's wonderful.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.500
It's wonderful, except
there was just one

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.860
small problem with
Maxwell's equations,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.440
and this theory of light.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.800
And this is something
called blackbody radiation.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.170
So let me tell you what
blackbody radiation is.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:08.990
Blackbody radiation has to
do with the light emitted

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.240
by something called a blackbody.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.320
So what is a blackbody?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.720
This is what I've
tried to show here.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.220
It's basically a little
cavity, a hollow cavity,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.810
which is black for everything.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.380
So it absorbs all colors
of light perfectly.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.010
Now, of course, if the system
wants to reach a temperature

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.667
and not melt, it has
also to emit this light.

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:33.750
So there is an equilibrium
between the light which

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.120
is absorbed, and the
light which is emitted.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.080
Blackbody is that this
works for every color

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.150
in the spectrum of light.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.700
And then, you can
make a little pinhole

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.250
and see how much
intensity you have

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.450
for different colors
of this light.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.440
It's called the spectrum
of blackbody radiation.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.640
And you can measure that, and
you find this result here.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.690
So on the horizontal axis, I
have the wavelength of light.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.160
It's just the
color of light, OK.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.550
And on the vertical
axis, it's the intensity.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.950
And I have three curves of
different color-- a red curve,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.020
a yellow curve,
and a blue curve--

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.420
for three different
temperatures.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.630
So it's 3,000 Kelvin.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.530
You see the peak.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.320
The most intensity is
around 1 micrometer,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.540
which is infrared light.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.280
As you heat up your
cavity, you make

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.110
it 4,000 Kelvin, the peak
of the intensity shifts

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.880
to more visible
light near the red.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.970
And if it gets even warmer,
it shifts toward the blue.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.430
These are things that people
can measure extraordinary

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.800
accurately.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.930
This is the blackbody spectrum.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.730
And the white curve is
the classical theory

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.490
for 5,000 Kelvin--

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.070
the theory of Maxwell.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.750
And you don't have
to have a Nobel

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:00.420
Prize to see that the blue
curve and the white curve

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.640
don't quite match.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.630
Now, physicists are
highly trained people.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.160
We go through
undergraduate school.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.900
We do four years of
undergraduate school.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.970
We do a bunch of years
of graduate school.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.050
We become postdocs.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.420
We go through tenure
track, and all that.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.130
So we have really very fancy
technical words to explain

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.460
these kind of problems.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.360
OK, that's the problem, and
this is the technical word.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.820
So it means we have a problem.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.450
Everything was perfect, except
for just this one experiment.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.200
And nobody could throw
away the blackbody,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.950
and the experiments were very
good, and we had a problem.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.510
So it bothered
people a great deal.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.440
And one of the folks who
spent a lot of years trying

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.710
to figure out what was
going on was a physicist

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.390
in Germany named Max Planck.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.440
And finally, out
of desperation, he

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.569
came out with a crazy, new
assumption based on nothing.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:13.030
He said light is made of
waves, but these waves

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.680
come in little
bundles of energy,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.550
which can have only
discrete values, which

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.930
are called quanta of energy.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.640
He invented the word
quanta of energy.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.160
Now, this is what we
would call photons.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.300
It was completely
out of nowhere.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.140
It was just desperation
he came up with this.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.600
And then, Einstein worked
with this hypothesis.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.140
He was able to explain
a bunch of other things.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.630
So suddenly, we were
back in a situation,

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.180
this kind of perfect
compromise, where light

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.040
is both waves and particles.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.600
So this was quite a big
leap of faith, in a sense,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.360
but it explained
this blackbody system

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.610
and all kinds of other things.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.250
And then, there was a prince.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.570
You know, every story
has to have a prince.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.220
So we have a French prince.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.720
And this is Prince
Louis de Broglie.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.320
And he went one step further.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.930
He said, well, if
light is made out

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.340
of objects, which are
both waves and particles,

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.680
maybe everything is made
out of waves and particles,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.980
every particle is
made out of wave--

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.270
has a wave aspect and
a particle aspect.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.560
For instance, electrons.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.090
And this was, again, huge.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.350
It was his PhD thesis.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.900
He was in his 20s, OK.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:35.280
And if you did that, you could
develop some wonderful theory,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.960
but it was again not clear that
it was right until, in 1927--

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.760
so just 90 years ago--

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.920
there were experiments
done in the United States

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.920
by Davisson and Germer, which
actually proved that electrons

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.020
behave like waves.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.800
So all this story, which
took about 20-25 years,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.050
lead to the development
of quantum mechanics.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.670
There are two of
the big heroes--

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.555
Erwin Schrodinger and
Werner Heisenberg.

00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:03.180
Now, you have to
understand, Heisenberg

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.770
was like 25 years
old when he did that.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.820
And Schrodinger was the old guy.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.400
He was almost 40.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.665
Don't you hate them?

00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:14.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.500
They have no respect.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.920
I guess you had to be
really young to be so crazy

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.290
and create, even
invent, this new theory.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.920
And it worked.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.650
And quantum mechanics
has been developed

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:31.080
to an exquisite level
of understanding,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.530
and it's change your life.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.990
How has it changed your life?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.910
If you understand
quantum mechanics,

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.640
if you understand that
electrons are waves,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.850
you can understand why
some solids are metals,

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.460
some are insulators,
some are semiconductors,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.970
and all kinds of
things like that.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.940
And this led to
extraordinary development.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.800
You would not have
integrated circuits

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.750
if you did not
understand quantum mech--

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.530
if somebody did not
understand quantum mechanics.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.270
You would also not
have cellphones.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.792
You would not have a GPS system.

00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:08.000
What else would you not have?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.040
You would not have the
internet, that's for sure.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.960
You would not have lasers.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.480
You would not have
laser surgery.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.780
If you did not understand
how atoms interact

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.990
with magnetic fields,
or with light,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.740
you would not have
magnetic resonance imaging.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.580
Did I get it right?

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.980
I did.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.180
And you would not
have solar panels.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.910
So it's really
changing our life, OK?

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.290
Everything we have in this room.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.790
I don't know how many people
have a cell phone in this room,

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.472
but I would bet
it's more than one.

00:20:42.472 --> 00:20:44.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.420
And this is all based
on understanding

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.110
quantum mechanics, understanding
this wave particle duality.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.770
Of course, there are
also some bad things.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.220
And as somebody pointed
out, a single nuclear weapon

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.950
can ruin your whole day.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.910
But anyway, so this is really
what quantum mechanics has

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.240
done for us, thanks to
people really understanding

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.590
how to play this game.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.930
But I want to go
back a little bit,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.660
because now we know
how to do that,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.960
but do we understand the
real deep implications

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.860
of quantum mechanics?

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.580
And this is what I want to spend
a few minutes going back to.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.890
So I want to go back to
this double slit experiment.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.380
Because I told
you that electrons

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.430
are particles and
waves, or photons

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.490
are particles and waves.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.552
But I have not told you
how strange that is.

00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:43.510
And now I want to tell
you how strange that is,

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.690
so I'm going to redo the
Thomas Young experiment.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:53.000
But instead of sending a beam
of light, or a beam of electrons

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.620
through my double
slit, I'm going

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.280
to send one electron a day.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.252
Or maybe one one
electron every week.

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:01.460
Or one electron every minute.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.590
It doesn't matter, but
very rare events, OK.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.880
One electron, and then you wait.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.430
And now, we can do
that, because we

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.054
have all these graduate students
who have nothing better to do.

00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:11.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.310
So they can certainly do
this kind of experiment.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.200
So let's see what happens.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.090
So what do you
expect will happen?

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.459
Well, what I expect will happen
is now it's just one electron,

00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:25.750
so the electron is going to
go through one of the holes

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.290
and land on the screen,
and I will get a little dot

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.251
on my detector.

00:22:31.251 --> 00:22:31.750
And I do.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.190
So this is after a week.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.462
You have seven or eight dots.

00:22:35.462 --> 00:22:38.030
There's no big deal here.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.960
And then, I can
do it for a month,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.360
and I get them more dots.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.790
And then, I'll do it for
a year, and suddenly, wow.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.980
I get these interferences.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.150
This is completely crazy.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.920
You have to understand
this is completely crazy.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.850
Because I did it one
electron at a time.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.630
How do they know?

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.980
How do they know?

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.340
Well, I'm a physicist,
so I say, well, I'm

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.050
going to trick these
darn electrons.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.770
I'm going to check through
which hole they went.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.870
And I can put a little detector.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.200
So here, I have my experiment,
I put a magnifying glass--

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.934
actually, it's going to be a
slightly fancier detector--

00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:21.600
and I'm going to just
look through which

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.450
hole this darn electron went.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.310
We can do that.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.380
Do the experiment.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.782
You measure through which
hole your electrons went.

00:23:31.782 --> 00:23:33.730
Boom.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.638
The interferences disappear.

00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:43.108
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.108 --> 00:23:44.104
There's the cat.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.120
What have we learned?

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.844
Is my electron a
wave or a particle?

00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:56.830
If you look, if you
observe which way

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.220
the light went through,
of the electron,

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.840
it appears to be a particle.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.120
If you don't look, it
behaves like a wave.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.570
What it means is that
you can change reality

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.950
by deciding what you're
going to look at.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.510
And this is the new thing that
quantum mechanics does for you.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.280
It forces you to change your
understanding of reality.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.270
John Wheeler.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.970
You may have heard about John
Wheeler in other lectures,

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.516
because John Wheeler was a great
expert at general relativity.

00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:39.140
He coined the word
black hole actually,

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.900
but he was also a great
expert at quantum mechanics.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.610
And he was also a
magician with words.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:50.150
And he coined this sentence
to describe the situation.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.610
"What we call reality arises
in the last analysis from

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.830
the posing of yes or no
questions and the registering

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.560
of equipment-evoked responses--

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.300
all things physical are
information theoretic

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.644
in origin."

00:25:08.644 --> 00:25:10.310
Here's another way
to say what he said--

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.400
no phenomenon is a
phenomenon until it

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.360
is a recorded phenomenon
brought to a close

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.300
by an irreversible
act of amplification.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.400
It's a very, very
profound statement.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.840
Feynman-- everybody has
heard about Feynman--

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.570
put it another way,
which is actually

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.350
very important to also digest.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:39.170
"It is impossible to explain
this in any classical way.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.420
It has in it the heart
of quantum mechanics.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.220
In reality, it contains
the only mystery.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.000
We cannot make the mystery
go away by explaining it.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.780
We can just tell you how it
works, but not why it works."

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.750
So through this wave
particle duality,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.720
which we use to make transistors
and [? RCs, ?] and all that,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.660
has actually much more profound
implications in a sense,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.350
because it forces us to revisit
what we mean by reality.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.710
And the reality is that I'm
going to be in real trouble

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.450
with time.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.110
OK.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:18.210
So this was my first mystery.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.220
Remember, I'd said I would
talk about two mysteries?

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.690
Now, I'm going to get to
the second mystery, which

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.670
Einstein--

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.660
Einstein was such
a brilliant man.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.280
He always brought up new
extraordinary concepts.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.180
And this is spooky
action at a distance.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.900
So now we're going to talk about
spooky action at a distance.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.670
And this is a bit tricky, so I
actually will need some help.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.535
So I need two assistants.

00:26:46.535 --> 00:26:49.410
Now, I'm not going to ask
any of you to come up there.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:54.020
I don't want to
impose that on you.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.890
So I'll have two
virtual assistants.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.410
And in physics, we used
to call them A and B.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.100
But then, we decided to be
nice, and we had to be friendly.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.430
So now we call
them Alice and Bob.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.670
So I want to introduce
you to Alice and Bob.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.190
So who should Alice be?

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.360
I think it's pretty obvious.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.270
Alice should be Alice
from Alice in Wonderland.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.000
So here is Alice.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.160
And for Bob, we
need somebody who

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.530
is a very distinguished
person, probably

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.880
someone with a Nobel Prize.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.980
Nobel Prize gives you the kind
of gravitas that you need.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.740
So here is a Bob
with a Nobel Prize.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.710
So this is Alice and Bob.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.460
And they will be with us
for a little while now.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.260
So let's first do a
very simple experiment.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.940
We're going to play with coins.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.390
So we have a bag of coins,
and both Alice and Bob

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.920
take one coin each
out of this bag.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.870
And then, Alice flies
fly to New York.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.220
Bob flies to Los Angeles.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.500
And they start
playing head and tail.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.830
They start flipping their coin.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.640
So let's do it once.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:23.320
And Alice finds tail, Bob head.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:32.160
Do it again, Alice
head, Bob tail.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:43.250
Do it again, head, tail, head,
tail, tail, head, head, tail.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.542
That's what they find.

00:28:44.542 --> 00:28:45.500
This should bother you.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.291
Does it bother you?

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.744
Yep.

00:28:47.744 --> 00:28:49.700
Good.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.370
Why does it bother you?

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:57.210
Because you never find a case
where they get the same thing.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.430
These are independent coins.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.430
He took his coin,
she took her coin.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.230
She went to New York,
he went to Los Angeles.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.770
There must be many
situations where they both

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.350
flip to head or to tail.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.840
We don't have any of those here.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.644
So this is impossible, right?

00:29:20.644 --> 00:29:22.750
This is impossible.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.290
It was an hour it's impossible.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:30.340
But what I'm going to show
you, or try to convince you,

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.100
is that, in quantum mechanics,
this is actually possible.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:44.110
Now, Alice comes and says,
"There is no use trying.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.910
One can't believe
impossible things."

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.440
But fortunately
the Queen of Hearts

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.460
comes and answers, "I daresay
you haven't had much practice.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.580
When I was your age, I always
did for half an hour a day.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.700
Sometimes I've believed as
many as six impossible things

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.440
a day."

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.080
All I want you to do is to
believe one impossible thing

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.860
today.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.290
Or maybe two.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.690
OK, so let's try to do
some impossible stuff.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.280
And to do that, I will
tell you something

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.540
that we can do in physics.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.310
We can do something,
which is called--

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.540
we can create something
called two-state particles.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.470
Let me tell you a little
bit how this works.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.200
It's actually very
simple in principle.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.610
In practice, only
experimentalists can do that.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.450
But basically, the
idea is very simple.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.530
You take a source of
atoms, maybe cesium atoms

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.010
or silver atoms, and
you put them in an oven.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.130
And you heat them up until
they start evaporating.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.160
And some of the atoms are
going to exit from the oven.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.070
And then, you put
two little holes

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.890
to make a very
nice beam of atoms.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.730
You can do that.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.860
And then, you pass
this beam of atoms

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.420
through a magnet, which is a
north pole and a south pole.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.890
And then, you see where these
atoms land on the screen

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.090
after the magnet.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.560
And what you will find
is that they will only

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.110
land in two positions,
either up or down.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.900
OK.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.700
This is called the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.300
For a given atom, you don't
it will end up or down,

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.110
but they will only
end up or down.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.260
So this is basically like coins.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.330
For coins, we had head and tail.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.120
For these atoms,
we have up or down.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.500
So in a sense, you can think
of them as quantum coins.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.820
And one thing that
I also need to tell

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.340
you, because it's
going to be important,

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.060
is that you can rotate the
magnets, and what will happen

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.590
is that you just
rotate the same.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.840
You still have just two dots.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.250
They will just be
rotated like the magnet.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.370
And we are going to use that
later to really confuse things

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.710
even more.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.940
So these are, if you
want, our quantum coins.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.810
And these quantum
coins are very strange.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:10.070
So classical coins can
have only head or tail.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.440
Quantum coins can have up
and down at the same time.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.190
We talked a bit about
the Schrodinger cat,

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.101
which can be alive and dead.

00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:21.350
Well, it's hard to make a
cat which is alive and dead.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.160
But these quantum coins, we can
really make them up and down

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.580
at the same time.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.670
So this is a key difference.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.610
Classical coins have
to be head or tail,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:35.560
this can be head and
tail at the same time.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.090
So now, let's play
with these coins.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.650
OK, let's do the Alice
and Bob experiment.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.370
So I'm going to have a
source of these coins.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.760
And I can send two of
them, because these

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.260
are very special sources.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.240
You have to work a little
bit at making these sources.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.230
But you can make these two
quantum coins, these two atoms.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.140
You can prepare the
system in such a way

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.690
that, if the first one is
up, then the second one

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.030
is down for sure.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.110
And if the first one is
down, then the second one

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.910
is up for sure.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.720
You can do that
in atomic physics.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.310
It's not very hard.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.120
These are called
entangled particles.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.960
If one is, the other
one is down for sure.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.090
That's the thing that was
impossible with the coins

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:33.290
of Alice and Bob, but with
atoms, you can do that.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.480
And so, if you want to
describe this system,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.740
you will say that this system
is such that, if one is up,

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.890
the other one is down.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.940
But remember, they can be up
and down at the same time.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.620
So we have the system which
is up, down, and down, up.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.690
So that's the state
of the system,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.790
to use the jargon
of quantum physics.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.600
These are entangled particles.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.435
And now, let's make
some measurements.

00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:05.560
So I'm going to make an
experiment, where I'm going

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.210
to put one of these magnets.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.110
Remember like we had a
couple of slides ago,

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.270
I'm going to put a magnet
to try to figure out

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:17.060
if my particle 1 is up or down.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.000
And let's say I measure
my particle to be up.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.190
So what does it mean?

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.790
It means the second
particle is down for sure.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.420
Right?

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.580
All these particles
were prepared.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.409
So once I look, and I discover
that the first particle is up--

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.504
look under the--

00:34:35.504 --> 00:34:39.820
poof, this disappears.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.400
After I have measured the
state of my first particle,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.409
the system is now in this state.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:48.900
The second particle
is instantly in down.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.960
And this will be
instantly in down,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.150
even if the first
particle is in New York,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.170
the second is in Los Angeles.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:02.010
This is what Einstein called
spooky action at a distance.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.330
Why did he call it spooky
action at a distance?

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.400
Because it was
this instantaneous

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.460
change in the system, and
Einstein, who was no dummy,

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.740
knew that things like
that should not happen,

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.410
because no information
can be transferred faster

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.160
than the speed of light.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.980
So what's going on here?

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.440
What's going on is
that spooky action

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.930
at a distance conflicts with the
fundamental concept of locality

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.971
in classical physics.

00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:32.845
And that's a problem.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.990
That's a real problem.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.760
Now, I have to make
a point very clear.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.820
It doesn't mean that information
can be transferred faster

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.260
than the speed of light.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.090
But just the state
can be changed faster

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:49.030
than the speed of light, which
is a different statement.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.056
OK.

00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:51.720
And that's not all.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.590
He comes back.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.811
Einstein never
stops annoying you.

00:35:55.811 --> 00:35:58.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.920
Einstein wrote a very, very
wonderful paper in 1935

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.980
with his colleagues,
Podolsky and Rosen.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.320
This paper made everybody think.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:14.170
And it's almost certainly the
most interesting wrong paper

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.330
in the history of
physics, because it really

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.290
made everybody think.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.170
And he had a definition of
reality, which I already hinted

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:26.430
at earlier, which he wrote.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.010
His definition of reality--

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.100
"If, without in any way
disturbing a system,

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.440
we can predict with
certainty the value

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.770
of a physical quantity,
then this physical quantity

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.500
corresponds to an element
of physical reality."

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.672
So that's what I
said about the dean.

00:36:44.672 --> 00:36:46.130
I don't have to go
touch his beard.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.510
I know that he has a beard.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.910
There is an element of
physical reality associated

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.260
with his beard.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.210
It might be a poor
element of reality,

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.370
but it's an element of really.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:01.900
So basically, since
now you know for sure

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.060
what the state of
this particle 2

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.450
is without having
to measure it--

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.740
just the particle that
you didn't look at--

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.160
there is an element of
physical reality associated

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.260
with the state of this particle.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.800
No question.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.671
But now you can become nasty.

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.670
And you say, I'm going
to do another experiment.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.140
Instead of having my
magnets pointing vertically,

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.360
I'm going to rotate
them this way.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.160
Same experiment,
but now I've change

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.230
the direction of the magnet.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.360
And obviously, I can
do the same argument,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.070
and I will also have an element
of physical reality associated

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.412
with the state of this
particle along this direction.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.740
Makes a lot of sense.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.350
It should, because it
comes from Einstein.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.030
Einstein makes a lot of sense.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.160
But then, there is this fellow
I mentioned earlier, Heisenberg.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.417
And he said, you can't do
that, not in quantum mechanics.

00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.000
This is no-no.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.140
It's a big no-no.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.440
It's called the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.170
It is fundamental to
quantum mechanics.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.210
And he says that
you cannot measure--

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.950
I'll use jargon, the spin
is basically this component

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.660
of this particle up and down--

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.710
you cannot measure this thing
in a vertical and a horizontal

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.990
direction at the same time.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.150
It is not allowed
in quantum mechanics

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.830
to do that with
arbitrary accuracy.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.280
This is the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.570
Nobody disputes that.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.680
It's been tested and
tested and tested.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.450
So here is Einstein,
who says, there

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.940
must be an element of
physical reality associated

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.670
with the vertical
component, an element

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.810
of physical reality associated
with the horizontal component.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.150
And Heisenberg says, you can't
measure both at the same time.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.440
So what is the conclusion?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.460
The conclusion is that
quantum mechanics does not

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.420
provide the complete
description of physical reality.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.570
And this is the famous
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.730
paradox.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.110
So where does it leave us?

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.220
It leave us with a problem,
which I already showed you

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.130
at the beginning of
this presentation,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:20.980
that quantum entanglement
is in conflict

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.000
with two fundamental tenets
of classical physics--

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.940
reality and locality.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.870
And we went through that.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.636
OK, so that's pretty heavy.

00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:36.260
It's actually too
heavy for me, so when

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.390
you see something like that--

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.862
so I have a friend who would
say, that's why we drink.

00:39:40.862 --> 00:39:44.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.669
But another person will
say, I give up, OK?

00:39:46.669 --> 00:39:47.960
I'm going to do something else.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.340
I'm going to go and
start a sock factory.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.476
So now we are going
to talk about socks.

00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:56.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.090
That should be a bit
easier than to talk

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.070
about this darn particles.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.160
So I'm going to work
in a sock factory,

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.120
and they want me
to test the socks--

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.980
how good they are, how well
they resist being washed at room

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.990
temperature-- you
know, cold wash--

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:15.280
and intermediate temperatures,
and maybe hot temperatures.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.080
By the way, this
is a presentation

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.060
I stole from this reference.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.450
So don't blame me.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.270
So here's the test
we want to do--

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:28.790
am I losing--

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.310
OK.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.640
Will these socks
survive 1,000 washes

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.520
at 0 degrees, 45
degrees, and 90 degrees?

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.340
But I'm a bit lazy.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.230
I don't want to do
all these tests.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.470
So I'm going to take some of the
socks and do them at 0 and 45.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:48.080
Some I will do it 0 and 90,
and some I will do at 45 at 90.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.150
And I figure my boss will
never see any different.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.470
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.970
So I can do this
test, and what I

00:40:55.970 --> 00:41:01.440
find is something which may
sound bizarre, but you will see

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.100
is actually completely trivial.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.720
What do we find is
the number of socks

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.200
that can be washed at 0
degree and not at 45 degree

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.620
temperature, plus the number
that could be washed at 45

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.900
degrees and not
90 degrees must be

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.520
larger than the number that can
be washed at 0, but not at 90.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.000
Sounds strange, but let me
show you why it's not strange.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.070
I have a very beautiful little
picture here, which is actually

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.460
due to Ken and Danny.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.520
So thank you so much
for figuring that out.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.310
So here are my socks.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.600
So green is they passed the
test, red they failed the test.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.760
So let's look at the
first one, the ones which

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.160
can pass at 0 degree
and not at 45 degrees.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.030
So we've not made the
test at 90 degree.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.580
But at 90 degree, either
they would have passed

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.060
or they would not have passed.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.370
So my pairs of socks on
the left are the same

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.400
as the pair on the right,
except, at 90, they might

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.390
have passed or not have passed.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.570
OK?

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.360
And I can do the same
for the next test.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.000
The ones that can
pass at 45 and 90--

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.730
these are these guys
here-- but the test at 0

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.110
could be successful or not.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.290
So this is really what it means.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.940
And the one at 0 degree is
90 degrees, same thing again.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.950
The one in the
middle, at 45 degrees,

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.470
could have passed
or not have passed.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.390
And now, you look at
this bunch of socks,

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.270
and you give them letters,
because we are doing science.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.075
So we put letters.

00:42:34.075 --> 00:42:35.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.530
And you see that these guys
here-- the guys B down here--

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.230
it's green, red, red.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:44.190
It's the same as the
green, red, red up here.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.320
And the green, green,
red are the same

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.750
as the green, green,
red up in the middle.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.600
So you see these two guys are
included in the other two,

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.666
but the other two
have more stuff.

00:42:53.666 --> 00:42:55.290
And therefore, what
is in the first two

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:59.280
is at least as much as
what is in the third.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.312
So it actually kind
of makes sense.

00:43:04.312 --> 00:43:06.020
And now, you can make
a great assumption,

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.820
or you can ask the question--

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.180
are particles like socks?

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.710
So you can make the same
estimation with particles.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.320
You change socks
to little balls,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.340
and you get exactly
the same thing.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.350
And this is a very
fundamental theorem,

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.380
which is called Bell's theorem.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.640
He did it with a
little bit more mass,

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.010
but basically
that's what he did.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.920
And here is John Bell.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:40.340
John Bell was an extraordinary
talented theoretical physicist.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.120
Worked at CERN.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.270
He was a high energy
physicist, but he also

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.110
played with these foundations
of quantum mechanics.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.190
And the beauty of this example
with socks and particles

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:56.240
is that this is something that
you can test experimentally.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.220
The EPR paradox,
for a long time,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.340
folks thought that it was
more or less philosophy.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.400
But now, you can test these
things experimentally.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.850
And if the particles don't
behave like sock's, it

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.510
means something fundamental.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:15.330
It means that quantum
physics cannot be represented

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.260
by a classical
picture of physics.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.190
Or if you want to put
in more fancy words,

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.400
if this test is
failed, it rules out

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.000
of description of
quantum mechanics

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.380
by a local realistic theory.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.120
And again, the beauty
of Bell's theorem

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.760
is that, suddenly, you can
actually do the experiment.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.490
So the experiment was done.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:41.000
Started in the late
'70s and early '80s.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.990
And the way you do the
experiment is pretty much what

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:47.600
I did before, except that now,
having testing on just one

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.575
side, you put one side at 90
degrees and one at 45 degrees

00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:53.950
to do the two temperatures if
you want the two angles now

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:57.850
for the spins, and you can
still do this experiment.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.820
And you can count.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.320
And these experiments
have been done

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.740
better and better
and better, and they

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.880
are becoming more and
more sophisticated,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.150
and with less and
less systematic error.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:14.760
And the result is, if the
particles behave like socks,

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.970
you will have this inequality.

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.710
And in quantum mechanics,
you can actually

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.130
calculate, or measure,
these probabilities,

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:29.090
and you'll find that
the first one is 0.07.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.850
The second one is 0.07.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.140
And the third is 0.25.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:39.690
And 0.25 is larger than 0.14.

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:40.700
So this is violated.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.076
So particles don't
behave like socks.

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:48.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:54.720
And basically, it shows that
quantum mechanics is not

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.295
a local realistic theory.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.120
So Feynman.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.370
Feynman is back.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.800
And he made another
statement about the result

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.190
of this experiment, which is the
statement that you should make,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.380
that we should all make.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.048
This is why we drink.

00:46:14.048 --> 00:46:15.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.910
"Quantum mechanics
describes nature as absurd

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.400
from the point of
view of common sense.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.580
And yet it fully
agrees with experiment.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.970
So I hope you can accept
nature as she is--

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.450
absurd."

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.160
And unfortunately, that's true.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.520
It's completely contrary
to our common intuition.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.740
We're just not hardwired
to understand what

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.420
nature is at the quantum level.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.000
Now, there is another
quote I want to make.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.790
This is from somebody
named Alain Aspect.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.130
Alain Aspect is a remarkable
figure in this whole story,

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.930
because he started
to do experiments

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.790
as a graduate student.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.380
I know him quite well.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.320
And he told me that, when he
started to learn about that,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.100
he went to visit John Bell.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.760
Alain Aspect is in Paris,
John Bell was in Geneva.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.070
And he told him, I
want to do experiments.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.700
And John Bell asked him, do
you have a permanent job?

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.140
And Alain Aspect was a student.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.025
He said, no I don't.

00:47:16.025 --> 00:47:18.770
He said, don't do it.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.560
Because it was the best
way not to get the job.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.010
But Allain Aspect, being who he
is, decided to go ahead anyway.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:28.190
And he's become the world
expert on this business.

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.350
I'm sure he will
get a Nobel Prize.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.500
The other reason I want to
show this picture of Allain

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:39.680
is that he makes the best
duck confit in the world.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.690
And he has a cellar with
over a thousand bottles.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.700
And I want to be invited
back in his house.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.600
And what Allain said is, "By
closing"-- so it was in 2015,

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.850
he said that, when these
perfect experiments

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:59.000
on the violation of Bellian
inequalities came out.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.190
And Allain said, "By
closing these loopholes"--

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.640
so it was still bothering
people-- "at once,

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.220
three experimental tests of
Bell's inequalities remove

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.570
the last doubts that we should
renounce local realism."

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.630
And the other key point that he
made, that other people knew,

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.870
and this brings us to the
second quantum revolution,

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:23.330
is that these experiments
opened the door to new quantum

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.340
information technologies.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.110
And I want us to spend
about three or four

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.210
minutes-- where is Bo?

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.660
Bo is checking time.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:35.030
Bo, I think it's
time for a break.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:39.260
So I want to show you
one simple example of how

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.230
this new, more profound,
understanding of the way

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.840
to manipulate the laws
of quantum mechanics

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.340
will lead us to
new technologies.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:52.275
The example I want to mention
is quantum cryptography.

00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:54.420
Now, we all know
about cryptography.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.100
This is these
techniques which make

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.470
us able to communicate
with our iPhones,

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.410
without everybody
eavesdropping on us.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.120
So the idea is--

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.680
let's say, here is Alice again.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.930
She wants to
communicate with Bob.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.420
She wants to send him
this beautiful message--

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.120
very romantic message-- and
she doesn't want anybody else

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.500
to hear this message.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.070
So the way cryptography
works is that you

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.110
invent a key, which
allows you to encrypt

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.720
your system, and the keys
that she uses, in this case,

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.650
is this thing in yellow here.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.650
And the trick is that Bob
also needs to know this key.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.330
OK, here's the key.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:36.880
And then, once he
has the key, she

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.710
can just call him
with the message.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.230
No, first, she has to
encrypt this message.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.120
And the way she does
it here is very simple.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.110
If two numbers are the same, it
becomes a 0 in the encryption.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.140
If the two numbers are
different, it becomes a 1.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.630
And then, she sends
encrypted message.

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:57.790
And he uses the same rule
to recover his message.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.680
That's how it works.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.330
And the trick of cryptography
is to make these keys very safe,

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.180
hard to break,
and hard to steal.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.310
But it's always a problem.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.170
And people are
spending actually a lot

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:14.170
of money making safe
encryption, and trying

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.390
to break safe encryption.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:22.400
So quantum entanglement
allows actually to beat this.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.050
And the way it works
is very simple.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.100
Instead of having a key
that you share by telephone,

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.040
or by meeting under
a tree or something,

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.650
you do an experiment with
these entangled particles.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.640
So let's say Alice is
going to create sources

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.220
of entangled particles,
and she gets one of them,

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.170
and Bob gets the other one.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.080
And now, they're
both going to measure

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.220
the state of their particle,
if it's up or down.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.090
And if the analyzers-- if the
magnets are aligned the same

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:59.410
way, they know for
sure that, if they--

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.110
Alice knows for sure,
if she measures up,

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.392
Bob will have down.

00:51:04.392 --> 00:51:09.010
But if they are not
aligned the same way,

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.230
then there is
nothing they can say.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.780
They don't know what the
answer of the other will be.

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.630
So all they need to do is
to do this experiment--

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.640
this measurement--
many, many times,

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.310
and then they get on
the phone and they share

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.662
the alignments of their magnet.

00:51:23.662 --> 00:51:25.870
And maybe they will say,
oh, in the first experiment,

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.750
both magnets were
aligned the same way.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:31.844
So I know what I measured,
therefore I know what he has.

00:51:31.844 --> 00:51:34.260
And in the second one, they
were not aligned the same way,

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.650
so we discard them.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:41.740
And they keep doing, and you
keep only the results when

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.490
your magnets were aligned, so
you get your nice entanglement.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:47.370
And you build a key this way.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.860
You never have to tell the
result of your experiment.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.930
You just have to say the
setting of your magnet.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:59.560
So can you break this way
of transferring information?

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.180
It turns out--
that's what I said.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:07.160
So it turns out that
you can't in principle.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.030
And the reason you
can't is twofold.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.650
The first one is the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle,

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.850
which we talked about.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.250
If somebody tries to make a
measurement on your system,

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.920
it will perturb your system
in quantum mechanics.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.592
So we'd know for sure that
somebody was eavesdropping.

00:52:23.592 --> 00:52:25.050
So the eavesdropper
will say, well,

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.716
I'm just going to
duplicate your system.

00:52:26.716 --> 00:52:28.640
I'm going to make a
clone of your system,

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.230
make my measurements
on your system,

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.050
and then I will know
what you have done,

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.660
and I will steal your key.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.240
And you can't do that either.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.160
I don't have time
to go through that.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.396
You can't do that, because
there is a theorem, which

00:52:40.396 --> 00:52:42.020
is called the no-cloning
theorem, which

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.540
says that you can only
duplicate the system by losing

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.010
all information.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:51.240
So the result is that
quantum key distribution--

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.110
that's the best
word used for that--

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.930
is completely safe.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.880
And this is one of
the first applications

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.482
in the second
quantum revolution.

00:52:58.482 --> 00:53:00.690
There are several companies
which sell these systems,

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.692
to banks mostly.

00:53:02.692 --> 00:53:03.650
There is one in Geneva.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.608
There is one in Vienna.

00:53:04.608 --> 00:53:06.730
There is one in New York.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.712
And so I was talking
about that with Dean Ruiz.

00:53:09.712 --> 00:53:11.670
And he says, that's really
cool, because now we

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.045
could have the
secret information

00:53:13.045 --> 00:53:15.670
all around the world.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.700
And I had to tell
him, not so fast.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:23.240
Not so fast, because
it's actually hard.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.080
And it's so hard that the
world record right now

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.900
of how far you can actually
transmit quantum information

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.160
this way is 90 miles.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:37.650
And there is a dream to actually
have this global quantum

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.590
communication, but it
doesn't work so far.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.460
And why doesn't it work?

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.570
It turns out that, if you
want to make these experiments

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.270
at very small
scales in your lab--

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:50.050
on the tabletop in your lab--

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.470
it's not too hard to do.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.740
But the bigger you want
to do the experiment,

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.570
the harder it becomes.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:01.560
And it may just be impossible
to do a global communication

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.060
system.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.830
We just don't know.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.830
So this begs actually
a couple of questions,

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:12.130
which bring the cat back.

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.130
So we know how to do
these quantum systems

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.610
when they are somewhat small.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.960
140 kilometers is
not completely small,

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.560
but it's not very big either.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.160
So this begs the
question-- why don't we

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.440
live in a quantum world?

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.016
Why does it look like
reality is the way we've--

00:54:31.016 --> 00:54:32.720
we have this intuition for that?

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.750
If quantum theory is a
more fundamental theory

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.930
than classical theory,
why does everyday word

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.440
appear as classical?

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:49.500
Another related question is,
are we fooling ourselves?

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.630
Quantum mechanics was
actually developed

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:56.190
to describe atoms and photons
at the microscopic level.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.020
We've pushed it very hard.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:02.120
But is it really the
fundamental theory?

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.640
To which extents are
these laws applicable

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.740
in macroscopic systems?

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:12.240
And a related question is, are
there fundamental limitations

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.950
to quantum entanglement?

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.680
Not practical, but
fundamental limitations.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.300
Or can we, in
principle, prepare a cat

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.670
in a state where it
is both alive and dead

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.140
at the same time?

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.910
So these are very
profound questions.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:35.164
And these are questions
which bother many physicists.

00:55:35.164 --> 00:55:37.080
And there are two
approaches to this question.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.200
There is what is called the
shut up and calculate kind

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.270
of physicist.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:47.260
This sounds pejorative,
but it's not really.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.950
It's the way that most
physicists do physics.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.540
We do our calculations.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.440
We take our system that we want
to behave quantum mechanically,

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.480
but we know that
it's not isolated.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.880
It's surrounded by
the rest of the world,

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.940
and it's always coupled somehow
to the rest of the world.

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.240
And it turns out that,
the bigger your system,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.840
the harder it is to isolate
it from the rest of the world.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.730
And this coupling to
the rest of the world

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:17.500
tends to make the systems
behave more classically.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.210
So this is kind of
the practical-- the

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.640
shut up and calculate--
where you don't really

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.004
try to understand fundamentally
what the question might be.

00:56:26.004 --> 00:56:27.670
And then, there are
the other physicists

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.503
who actually try to
understand this question

00:56:29.503 --> 00:56:31.090
in a fundamental way.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.410
And they are working very hard.

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:36.720
And they're also developing
experiments jointly with theory

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.570
to try to figure out if there
is something fundamental here.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:42.840
There are some ideas,
from Penrose and others,

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.290
about the role of gravity
in making systems classical.

00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:47.040
But we don't know.

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.350
So I'm going to finish
my talk, essentially

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.810
like most of the talks
have been finished,

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.820
by a big question mark.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.470
And this is pretty much
always the same in physics.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:01.380
You always answer
some questions,

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.430
and open more problems,
more questions.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:09.730
But I'm not completely
finished, because I

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.660
was told that I should also try
to summarize a little bit what

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.800
we have all learned.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.090
So it's two minutes.

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:18.640
More or less.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.806
He's trying to kick me out.

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:24.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:27.130
So what have we learned?

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:31.670
And again, Einstein
comes to the rescue.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.860
Einstein said so many
very profound things.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.790
And one of the things he
said is that "no amount

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.780
of experimentation can
ever prove me right,

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.880
but a single experiment
can prove me wrong."

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.890
And we had one example of that,
with this blackbody radiation.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.520
People did all
these experiments--

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.350
Maxwell was great-- the view,
the wave nature of light

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.370
was perfect.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:59.930
But there was this one
experiment that didn't fit,

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.720
and it changed everything.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.540
It forced people to
invent quantum mechanics,

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.210
this new view of
reality and all that.

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:10.930
So this is absolutely
true and profound,

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:18.340
that one experiment can force
you to revisit everything.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.100
And this is exactly those
experiments that we like.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.510
And this is why people will
do LHC, to push the limits.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:30.430
This is why people do
gravitational wave detection.

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.590
This is the motivation,
to push the theories,

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.641
to push until we have
a place where it fails.

00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:39.140
Because that's-- when it fails--
that we can hopefully learn

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.720
something fundamentally new.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.800
Now, I should say that this
is not always an easy job.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.490
It can be quite
humbling, because we

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.360
have our preconceived
view of things,

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.220
and we have to change it.

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.629
And my son, who is
a very wise man,

00:58:57.629 --> 00:58:59.420
once told me that there
are only two things

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.460
that academics don't like.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:03.320
The first one is the
current situation,

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.043
and the second one is change.

00:59:05.043 --> 00:59:07.004
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.380
So there we go.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.490
OK.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.460
So we have this problem here.

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.980
But on the other
hand, the payoff

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.140
can be quite extraordinary.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.030
And we have seen some
of this payoff today,

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:22.410
and in the other
lectures as well.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:28.430
So this unknown, and in being
in a situation of ignorance,

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.860
is actually what
physicists strive for.

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.200
I was preparing this slide
and I was talking to my wife,

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.840
and she said, do you really
want to use the word ignorance,

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.210
because ignorance has
a bad connotation?

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:40.550
But it's not.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:41.650
It should not be.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:42.150
OK?

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:45.650
Ignorance is just an
excuse to understand

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.480
what we don't understand.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.310
So ignorance, in this sense--

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.900
in this very narrow sense--

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:56.300
is actually what we strive to
figure out, and to clear up.

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.850
This is really what
keeps us going.

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.662
And this is why I think
there is no better job.

01:00:01.662 --> 01:00:02.620
So thank you very much.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.370
