00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.310
For linear regression, we compute

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:04.072
the quotation B and A,

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:05.543
and I give you the formulas

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:08.074
B is calculated as a quotient

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:10.421
of these terms that I’ve given you before

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:13.367
divided by those guys here.

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:14.653
A as you might remember

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.180
is given by this formula.

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.188
And to compute them, let’s first compute

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:19.677
the various components here.

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:23.000
Let’s start with N, what is N?
