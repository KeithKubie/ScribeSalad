&gt;&gt;Khaldoon H. Tabaza: Hello, I'm Khaldoon
Tabaza and I'm the managing director of Riyada

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.270
Ventures.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.792
So, I'm here in Davos and have attended some
of the _____ leaders program and today the

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:17.939
main program started and we had a session
about the Middle East.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.800
And what I'd like to report is that, you know,
the view of basically the penniless what they

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.119
said has been extremely frustrating. We've
been hearing the same and the same issues

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.410
being discussed and been seeing the same people
talking about the same thing and talking in

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.309
terms of millions and hundreds of millions
of jobs that are required and hundreds of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.359
billions of dollars that are invested by Middle
Eastern countries. And they need to invest

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.190
in education, and they need to invest in entrepreneurship
and they need to invest in job creation. But

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.750
we've seen very, very little practical steps.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.499
So I don't know what happens when these people
go to their offices. I don't know why it's

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.780
so difficult to translate what they're talking
about into actionable small steps by governments

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.110
in the Middle East. Just extremely frustrating.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.460
We can see countries and regions and nations
of much less natural resources doing much

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.630
more in terms of build up of their knowledge
economy, in terms of encouraging entrepreneurship,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.409
in terms of encouraging innovation.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.030
Up until now the hardest task in the other
world is to get somebody seed stage funding.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.719
So somebody starting starting a new business
wanting to get some seed stage funding wanting

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.439
to go and build up a you know go and basically
get space in an incubator finds it very tough.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.950
Let's get something done about this. And this
is me reporting from Davos. Thank you.
