00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.830
MAN: Hey, Shelby!

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.210
Hey, Shelby!

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.540
What the hell's going on?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.960
MAN: Hey, Shelby!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.210
[inaudible]

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.960
Probably need a chain or
a rope, or something, huh?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.830
MAN: Probably, and a saw, maybe.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.210
SHELBY: I'm gonna go
back up there, man.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.250
- OK.
- Not a thing.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.710
SHELBY: Looks like you
got a big one to me!

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.580
[laughs] All right.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.210
Thank you, man.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.750
NARRATOR: Around these
parts, neighbor always

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.000
helps a neighbor out.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.880
And the swamp man's
happy to oblige.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.250
Hey, there it is.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
- There it is.
- Wow.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.250
SHELBY: Blocking, eh?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.250
Yeah, it is.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.250
Son of a bitch.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.580
SHELBY: It's all the
way across, ain't it?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.830
NARRATOR: Seems a
greedy local fisherman's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.380
fenced off his honey
hole, trying to keep

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.460
the best spot to himself.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.500
That ain't right, man.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170
People hungry
after these storms.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.960
Can't keep it all to yourself.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.040
WOMAN: What do
you want me to do?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.380
SHELBY: I don't know.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.790
We've got to get it
out of here, somehow.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.460
NARRATOR: In the swamp, blocking
a fishing hole's 'bout as

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.960
crooked as a dog's hind legs.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.620
That's blocking the
damn fishing hole, man,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.710
for them people to fish in.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.880
Don't look like there's anything
to tie it to on it, does it?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.250
WOMAN: Don't look like it.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
NARRATOR: And Shelby sure as
hell ain't gonna stand for it.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.120
WOMAN: So what's a good way
to get this out of the way?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.920
Hold on a minute.
Let me get it.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.540
I don't know.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.920
I hope you can pull
that thing up, man.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.830
Might be the best thing to
do is to run through it.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.880
I'm about to do some
community service.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.210
Look out, junior.
Here we go!

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.790
WOMAN: Oh my god.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.040
Shelby is [bleep] crazy.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.420
Hold on now, we're
gonna go through it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[bleep]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.920
SHELBY: Get out the way!

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.880
[cheering]
- Damn!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.750
Damn!
Oh my god, look!

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.170
SHELBY: Oh, man!

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.290
NARRATOR: Problem solved.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.210
Oh, look at this [bleep], man.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.040
NARRATOR: And it's been
a memorable first day

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.540
on the water for his new hand.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
Every day with Shelby is like,
fly by the seat your pants.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.210
You never know what's
going to happen.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.540
Yeah, that would've
frickin' killed me!

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.380
Man!

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.040
[inaudible] Boy, you lucky.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.250
[bleep]

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.420
WOMAN: Look at that.
SHELBY: Huh?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.420
They can get in there now.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080
The older I get, the better
I get wreckin' [bleep]..

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080
[laughs]
