00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.468
&gt;&gt; Now, the second step of parsing our map involves loading all the tileset data

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:06.992
described in the file. For each tileset, we need to create a new image, set a

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:10.583
call back function for once it's loaded, and then set the source value to the

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:14.357
tilesets image attribute. This is the same basic image loading process that

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:18.485
we've been using previously. It's worth pointing out now, that we're kicking off

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.023
asynchronous loads of images for our map data, which already has been

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:25.886
asynchronously loaded. As such, we may want to actually wait on setting the

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:29.766
fully loaded flag to true until after all the images are loaded. To do this,

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.796
you'll need to use a counter variable to keep track of how many images have been

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:37.702
loaded, and only set the fully loaded flag to true once all the tilesets have

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:39.735
bee successfully loaded into memory.
