most people believe that there is one
way that the body responds to stress and

way that the body responds to stress and
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.200
way that the body responds to stress and
everyone's heard the fight-or-flight

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
everyone's heard the fight-or-flight
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.600
everyone's heard the fight-or-flight
response but actually turns out that

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
response but actually turns out that
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.640
response but actually turns out that
that's just one way that the body and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
that's just one way that the body and
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.169
that's just one way that the body and
brain can respond to a stressful

brain can respond to a stressful
 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.230
brain can respond to a stressful
circumstance and it's often not a very

vessels are going to relax and open up
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050
vessels are going to relax and open up
so you get more blood flow to your

situation it's going to be better for
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120
situation it's going to be better for
you to have a challenge response than a

you to have a challenge response than a
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039

threat response you'll perform better
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749
threat response you'll perform better
and that's been shown in situations

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
and that's been shown in situations
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.330

it's taking difficult exams that when

it's taking difficult exams that when
you have a challenge response you just

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
you have a challenge response you just
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.540
you have a challenge response you just
do better and it seems like one of the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
do better and it seems like one of the
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.610
do better and it seems like one of the

best ways to shift from a threat
response to a challenge response is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
response to a challenge response is
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.440
response to a challenge response is
actually to view your own stress

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
actually to view your own stress
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470
actually to view your own stress

response in a stressful situation is
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.160
response in a stressful situation is
that the very first signs of anxiety

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
that the very first signs of anxiety
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.020
that the very first signs of anxiety
when they notice some sweat on their

trying to calm down we're trying to
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.830
trying to calm down we're trying to
suppress whatever stress is arising and

research originally coming out of
Harvard University has shown that when

Harvard University has shown that when
people say okay I'm stressed out I feel

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
people say okay I'm stressed out I feel
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.729
people say okay I'm stressed out I feel
stress happening right now and that's a

me do better it actually changes the
 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.090
me do better it actually changes the
physiology of the stress response from

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
physiology of the stress response from
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.520
physiology of the stress response from
threat to challenge and it helps people

threat to challenge and it helps people
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.650
threat to challenge and it helps people
perform better whether they're giving a
