00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.150
In this lesson,
we will see how memory works.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.400
We will look at memory technology and
look how SRAM and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.740
how DRAM works, and what do these mean?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.960
We will see why is the main memory so
slow?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.142
We will see why don't we just use
the cache-like type of memory for

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.315
the main memory to make it faster?

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:24.062
We will see what happens on a cache
miss when we once access main memory.

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:27.783
And we will see some techniques for
making things faster, so that once you

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:31.610
have a cache miss, the memory
doesn't take that long to respond.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.290
It's still going to be ridiculously
long, but not as bad as before.
