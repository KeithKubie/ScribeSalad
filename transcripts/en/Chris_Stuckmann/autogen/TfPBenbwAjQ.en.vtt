this movie and some of it was very

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959
this movie and some of it was very
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.470
this movie and some of it was very
profound and some of it was very good it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480
profound and some of it was very good it
 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.720

was still very well acted but I think

really dark and that's probably why I
 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.910
really dark and that's probably why I
enjoyed the first one more because it

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
enjoyed the first one more because it
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.860
enjoyed the first one more because it
actually felt like it had a whole group

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
