00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Instructor] What we are going to try

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.720
to understand in this video

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.970
is the balance of payments.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.800
And it's really how a country accounts for

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.680
the different ways that money
is flowing into the country

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.360
or payments are happening into a country

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.630
or payments are happening
outside of a country.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.860
And right over here, I have information

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.380
for the United States in 2011,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.100
all of the numbers right over here

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.990
are denominated in dollars.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.290
And in green I have all of
the reasons why currency

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.790
or why payments would be made to the US

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.260
either the government of the US,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.960
the federal reserve of the US,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.000
or to citizens of the US.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.770
And in orange, I have all the reasons

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.560
why payments would be made
to folks outside of the US,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.370
either the government, central banks,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.000
or private citizens.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.600
And for this video, I'm
going to first focus

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.460
on the left hand, these
reasons right over here.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.270
And this you could view,
this is the current account.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.350
The current account.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.620
And the current account focuses on things

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.230
related to trade, so exports and imports,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.640
things related to income in that period,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.540
so if I'm getting dividends from a stock

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.130
that's a German company
or if someone in Germany

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.510
is getting dividends from a stock

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.630
that's an American company,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.440
and just transfers of money.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.740
I give money to my mom in
France to help support her.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.350
So that's what factored
in in the current account.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.420
In the next video, we will
talk about the capital account,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.076
the capital account, which focuses

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:33.680
on transfers or payments that are due to

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.240
changes in ownership of assets

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.920
and we'll see how they all balance out

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460
either in the next video or
maybe the video after that.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.880
But let's first focus
on the current account.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.320
So in green, I have all the reasons why

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.140
the US got payments from the
rest of the world in 2011.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.150
So the first one right
over here is exports.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.620
You can imagine if we are exporting,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.830
and this is in billions, so this is 2.1,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.620
this is 2,105 billion
which is the same thing

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.450
as 2.1 trillion.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.980
If we're exporting 2.1 trillion dollars

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.820
worth of goods and services,
then the rest of the world

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.760
is going to have to pay that much to us.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.150
So this is going to be an inflow,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.280
this is going to be a payment,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.560
this is a reason why we have more dollars

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.590
after all the appropriate
currency transactions take place,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.550
why more dollars have to come to the US,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.070
either to US private
citizens, to the government,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.760
or to the federal reserve.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.660
And for the most part, this is going to be

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.330
for private citizens or corporations.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.100
And this right over here is income

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.200
that Americans get from
owning assets abroad

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.400
in other countries.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.030
So imagine that I, I'm
an American citizen,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.400
I own an apartment complex in London,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.510
the folks in London have
to pay rent on that,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.620
I convert that rent to
dollars and I bring it back

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.060
to the US, that would be
an income receipt to me.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360
It's the reason why currency or payments

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.580
are being made to the US.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.520
And so once again, that's why I've colored

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.480
these right over here in green.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.270
Now let's think about the
other side of that coin.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.780
Obviously, we're not just selling stuff

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.540
to the rest of the world,
the rest of the world

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.910
is selling stuff to us.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.490
And that's what imports are factoring in

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.200
and the US actually runs a trade deficit.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.440
It imports more than
it exports to the tune,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.730
if we wanted to round, of
about 2.7 trillion dollars.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.990
And once again, if we're
buying other people's goods

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.740
and services, we needed
to make payments to them.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.600
Currency needs to go to them.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.270
And so you see it's to the tune,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.950
and that's why I wrote it
right over here of in orange.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.870
And once again, income payments,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.320
other side of income receipts.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.600
This is foreigners owning
assets in the United States.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.370
If a foreigner owns a pizza
parlor in the United States,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.170
that pizza parlor makes a
$100,000 in a given year,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.300
and that $100,000 will
go to that foreigner,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.610
it will be an income payment.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.990
And so that's what this
factors in right over here.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.020
This is income on foreign-owned assets.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.260
It does not go into an American.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.560
It does not go to the American government

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.070
or private citizen or corporation

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.140
or the federal reserve.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.110
It goes to someone outside of the country.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140
And so this would be
an outflow of payments

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.420
outside of the country.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.880
And so this last part right over here,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.730
this is net transfers.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.350
This is literally just on a net basis,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.520
Americans giving money away
to the rest of the world.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.430
And it actually since
Americans give away more

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.330
than they receive from
the rest of the world,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.530
we're not talking about transactions,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.450
this is kind of just pure
I'm an American citizen,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.950
I give money to my mom and friends,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.480
or this could even be foreign aid,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.915
the US government giving aid to a country,

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:32.730
and since the US does give
more than it receives,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.890
we just write it down
on a net transfer basis

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.390
and it is right over here a net outflow.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.460
And so we can figure out looking at this,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.769
while just based on these causes,

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.200
the trade deficit, the income receipts,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.310
and the net transfers, where the US

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.350
is transferring more currency abroad

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.630
or getting more currency onto,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.130
I guess you could say, into its ownership.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.493
And to do that, let's
get our calculator out.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.990
Let me get the calculator out.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.930
And so let's think.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.150
Okay, so this is all of the money

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.060
that we are getting.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.510
These are the payments, these
are the inflows to the US.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.490
So let's add those up, 2,105 billion

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.070
plus 739 billion,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.810
and now let's subtract
out all of the outflows

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.220
of capital or I should
say all of the outflows

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.450
of currency from the US.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.610
All of the payments that go out of the US.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.960
So let's subtract, so the
payments we have to make

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.700
due to imports, so 2.7 trillion

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.410
and then we have the 518 billion of income

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.680
that foreigners make on US assets.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.620
And then finally, or
foreign-owned assets of the US,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.140
or in the US I should say,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.710
and then the money that
the US just gives away

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.820
to the rest of the world on a net basis.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.190
And you see here, when you just
look at the current account,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.240
the US is running a
current account deficit.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.700
For just these causes alone,
the US is making more payments

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.053
than it is receiving.

00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:04.160
And it's to the tune
of 474 billion dollars.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.870
So let me write it right over here.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.760
So our current account,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.177
current account deficit

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.786
is to the tune, I already
forgot the number,

00:06:17.786 --> 00:06:22.490
474 billion dollars.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.450
If that number was
positive, I would call it

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.893
a current account surplus.
