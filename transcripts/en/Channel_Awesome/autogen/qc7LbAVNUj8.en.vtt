00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:15.870 align:start position:0%
a little bit more like a punch line um
 

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.769 align:start position:0%
a little bit more like a punch line um

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:21.730 align:start position:0%
like that it didn't go the route that
 

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
like that it didn't go the route that
you<00:13:21.880><c> just</c><00:13:22.120><c> from</c><00:13:22.720><c> the</c><00:13:23.020><c> first</c><00:13:23.290><c> frame</c><00:13:23.649><c> you</c><00:13:23.709><c> think</c>

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.190 align:start position:0%
you just from the first frame you think
 

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.190 align:start position:0%
you just from the first frame you think
you<00:13:24.279><c> know</c><00:13:24.430><c> where</c><00:13:24.610><c> it's</c><00:13:24.730><c> going</c><00:13:24.910><c> to</c><00:13:24.940><c> go</c><00:13:25.170><c> so</c><00:13:26.170><c> I</c>

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
you know where it's going to go so I
 

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.250 align:start position:0%
you know where it's going to go so I
like<00:13:26.440><c> that</c><00:13:26.620><c> but</c><00:13:26.770><c> it's</c><00:13:26.890><c> not</c><00:13:27.570><c> hugely</c><00:13:28.570><c> different</c>

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.260 align:start position:0%
like that but it's not hugely different
 

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
like that but it's not hugely different
it's<00:13:29.470><c> not</c><00:13:29.560><c> like</c><00:13:29.890><c> oh</c><00:13:30.130><c> you</c><00:13:30.190><c> got</c><00:13:30.880><c> me</c><00:13:31.120><c> and</c><00:13:31.330><c> stuff</c>

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.630 align:start position:0%
it's not like oh you got me and stuff
 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.850 align:start position:0%
it's not like oh you got me and stuff
it's<00:13:32.080><c> one</c><00:13:32.260><c> of</c><00:13:32.320><c> those</c><00:13:32.380><c> things</c><00:13:32.620><c> where</c><00:13:32.770><c> you</c><00:13:32.830><c> just</c>

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.860 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things where you just
 

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.050 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things where you just
going<00:13:33.190><c> to</c><00:13:33.250><c> go</c><00:13:33.339><c> okay</c><00:13:33.520><c> um</c><00:13:34.709><c> so</c><00:13:35.709><c> so</c><00:13:36.550><c> it's</c><00:13:36.700><c> not</c><00:13:36.880><c> where</c>

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.060 align:start position:0%
going to go okay um so so it's not where
 

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.449 align:start position:0%
going to go okay um so so it's not where
I<00:13:37.089><c> was</c><00:13:37.420><c> going</c><00:13:37.510><c> to</c><00:13:37.690><c> go</c><00:13:37.810><c> but</c><00:13:38.080><c> there's</c><00:13:39.070><c> nothing</c>

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:39.459 align:start position:0%
I was going to go but there's nothing
 

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:41.850 align:start position:0%
I was going to go but there's nothing
that<00:13:39.670><c> like</c><00:13:40.000><c> all</c><00:13:40.240><c> of</c><00:13:40.390><c> that</c><00:13:40.420><c> makes</c><00:13:40.720><c> it</c><00:13:40.959><c> so</c><00:13:41.649><c> much</c>

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:41.860 align:start position:0%
that like all of that makes it so much
 

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
that like all of that makes it so much
more<00:13:42.130><c> powerful</c><00:13:42.430><c> that</c><00:13:42.610><c> makes</c><00:13:42.850><c> the</c><00:13:42.970><c> message</c><00:13:43.420><c> or</c>

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
more powerful that makes the message or
 

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.870 align:start position:0%
more powerful that makes the message or
that<00:13:44.529><c> makes</c><00:13:44.680><c> the</c><00:13:44.830><c> TWiT</c><00:13:45.070><c> so</c><00:13:45.279><c> much</c><00:13:45.430><c> more</c><00:13:45.640><c> great</c>

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
that makes the TWiT so much more great
 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.550 align:start position:0%
that makes the TWiT so much more great
it's<00:13:46.149><c> more</c><00:13:46.330><c> just</c><00:13:46.600><c> kind</c><00:13:46.779><c> of</c><00:13:46.930><c> playing</c><00:13:47.200><c> with</c><00:13:47.350><c> an</c>

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's more just kind of playing with an
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.810 align:start position:0%
it's more just kind of playing with an
idea<00:13:47.830><c> that</c><00:13:47.920><c> you</c><00:13:48.130><c> saw</c><00:13:48.310><c> you</c><00:13:48.370><c> know</c><00:13:48.580><c> where</c><00:13:48.700><c> it's</c>

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:48.820 align:start position:0%

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no you got me that's just totally
 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah no you got me that's just totally
thrown<00:13:57.040><c> me</c><00:13:57.160><c> for</c><00:13:57.190><c> a</c><00:13:57.399><c> loop</c><00:13:57.430><c> it's</c><00:13:57.940><c> just</c><00:13:58.240><c> oh</c><00:13:58.420><c> you</c>

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:58.930 align:start position:0%
thrown me for a loop it's just oh you
 

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
thrown me for a loop it's just oh you
didn't<00:13:59.140><c> go</c><00:13:59.200><c> that</c><00:13:59.380><c> direction</c><00:13:59.500><c> nice</c><00:14:00.510><c> kind</c><00:14:01.510><c> of</c>

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.630 align:start position:0%
didn't go that direction nice kind of
 

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
didn't go that direction nice kind of
thing<00:14:01.839><c> um</c><00:14:02.520><c> so</c><00:14:03.520><c> yeah</c><00:14:04.420><c> I</c><00:14:04.450><c> think</c><00:14:04.990><c> this</c><00:14:05.140><c> is</c><00:14:05.290><c> a</c><00:14:05.320><c> very</c>

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:05.950 align:start position:0%
thing um so yeah I think this is a very
 

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
thing um so yeah I think this is a very
good<00:14:06.279><c> very</c><00:14:07.029><c> clever</c><00:14:07.540><c> film</c><00:14:07.930><c> uh</c><00:14:08.760><c> it's</c><00:14:09.760><c> not</c><00:14:10.390><c> a</c><00:14:10.420><c> film</c>

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
good very clever film uh it's not a film
 

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.410 align:start position:0%
good very clever film uh it's not a film
that<00:14:10.990><c> necessarily</c><00:14:11.740><c> like</c><00:14:11.890><c> grabs</c><00:14:12.310><c> me</c><00:14:12.820><c> it's</c><00:14:13.240><c> not</c>

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:13.420 align:start position:0%
that necessarily like grabs me it's not
 

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.730 align:start position:0%
that necessarily like grabs me it's not
something<00:14:13.630><c> I'm</c><00:14:13.899><c> like</c><00:14:14.080><c> I'm</c><00:14:14.230><c> guessing</c><00:14:14.560><c> it's</c>

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:14.740 align:start position:0%
something I'm like I'm guessing it's
 

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
something I'm like I'm guessing it's
like<00:14:14.860><c> eight</c><00:14:15.459><c> nine</c><00:14:15.520><c> times</c><00:14:16.300><c> or</c><00:14:16.690><c> anything</c><00:14:16.899><c> like</c>

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.170 align:start position:0%
like eight nine times or anything like
 

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
like eight nine times or anything like
that<00:14:17.200><c> even</c><00:14:17.529><c> though</c><00:14:17.709><c> there</c><00:14:17.890><c> are</c><00:14:18.010><c> things</c><00:14:18.279><c> that</c>

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.490 align:start position:0%
that even though there are things that
