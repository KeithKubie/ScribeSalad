I can basically use any male on my father's side, because they

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.970
would share the same Y chromosome. So I can use my biological brother.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.770
But I couldn't use my maternal half-brother or my maternal uncle, or my

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.990
maternal grandfather, because they don't share

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.650
the same Y chromosome as my father.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.590
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
