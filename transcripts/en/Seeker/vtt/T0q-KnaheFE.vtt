00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.930
This episode of DNews is presented by Kay
Jewelers.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.850
Every kiss begins with Kay.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.849
Attraction feels kind of crazy when it happens,
like, there are times when I have to physically

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.950
stop myself and say, "Trace.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.009
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:20.820
What's going on 
in here?!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929
Humans are big animals, big dumb animals.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.080
You, me, them, everybody; we're all slaves
to our brain chemicals and biology -- and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.449
when we fall in love, that's a big one.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.910
Obviously, we can make our own choices, but
attraction, lust and love are driven by animal

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.910
nature.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.650
We want to find a good genetic match, mate,
reproduce, raise young -- it's part of our

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.050
ancient programming!

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.980
In the modern day, we have more social restrictions,
but essentially the brain is handling stuff

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.820
backstage and it's doing a poor job of it.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.040
According to biological anthropologist Helen
Fisher, "Romantic love is akin to an addiction."

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.830
Yeah, you might as well face it.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.080
We're addicted to love.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.570
But in a very specific way; scientists believe
when we're attracted to someone we're subconsciously

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.180
weighing their genes, looks, and cultural,
religious and socioeconomic backgrounds.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.910
As we grow to know someone, the brain releases
hormones which cause us to bond with someone,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.470
and different levels of different hormones
will affect different people differently.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.800
Which is why love stinks.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.500
Hormones like dopamine which is for rewards
like cocaine or chocolate, norepinephrine

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.590
which causes excitement like adrenaline, or
serotonin which is the chemical that makes

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.420
you feel like you're going temporarily insane
are all squeezed out of the brain and into

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
the bloodstream…

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.610
In fact, studies from Rutgers University found
four chemicals affect the attraction cycle

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.120
-- dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen/oxytocin
-- and they were each tied to a personality

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120
type!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.620
According to the studies, the more active
a person's dopamine centers the more reward-driven

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.980
and impulsive they are in love.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.920
Serotonin-heavy people were less anxious,
but more risk averse.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.950
These two groups tend to be attracted to others
like them; but sometimes as Paula told us,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.960
Opposites attract.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.189
Testosterone-heavy people are analytical and
competitive; while estrogen/oxytocin-heavy

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.520
people were more empathetic, trusting and
social; each of these groups were more likely

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.819
to be attracted to the OTHER.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.319
It's important to note, that none of these
hormone types determined along sex lines...

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.260
In the brain, males can be estrogen/oxytocin
heavy, testosterone heavy or serotonin heavy…

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.640
and females can be any of those things too
… It can go any way.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.840
With all these chemicals squirting every which
way, messes can happen, but if the pairing

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.529
makes it through the crazy serotonin stage,
OTHER chemicals come into maintain a coupling.

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:45.680
Vasopressin and oxytocin are released after
the initial love addiction to form longer

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.769
term bonds.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.109
A study in Social Cognitive and Affective
Neuroscience found that during the initial

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.150
love period, the Ventral Tegmental Area was
very active, as was the areas controlling

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.859
addiction, but as love wore on, the brain
changed.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.849
When in new love, people report pining and
anxiety, and a heated NEEDINESS but after

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.280
20 years -- married couples had more activity
in the posterior globus pallidus, which is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.510
associated with pleasure and pain relief.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.829
This part of the brain usually activates when
you eat to the best food or take morphine!

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.360
Other parts of the brain showed pair-bonding
for long-term couples is similar to maternal

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.989
love, and even stronger than love for friends!

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.340
In the end, the initial spark of attraction
might be based on pheromones, genes, hormones

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.859
and looks, but a strong bond can be created
too.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:34.889
What do you think?

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.730
Are you a slave to your brain?

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:48.329
Which of these hormone personality types are
you?
