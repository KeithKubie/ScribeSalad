00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.350
What is the image of the polygon
below after the translation is

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.930
capital T with the
subscript 5 comma 2?

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.950
So that means let's translate
5 in the horizontal direction

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.340
and 2 in the vertical direction.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.048
So let's do that.

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.290
So I'm going to focus on
this point right over here.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.320
So that point is at
the point 3 comma 3.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.530
If I want to translate five
in the horizontal direction,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.790
the x value is
going to get to 8.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.320
So the x value is
going to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.150
And then we want to
increase the y value by 2.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.140
1, 2.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.470
Let's check our answer.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.150
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.640
That was lot of fun.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000
So here we need to
shift it by negative 8

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.830
in the horizontal direction.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.024
So this one right over
here, it's x value is 0,

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.190
so we need to go essentially
negative 8, negative 1,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.720
negative 2, or we move to the
left 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.300
And then we have to
move it down by 2.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.690
So we have to move
down 1, move it down 2.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.910
And we're done.
