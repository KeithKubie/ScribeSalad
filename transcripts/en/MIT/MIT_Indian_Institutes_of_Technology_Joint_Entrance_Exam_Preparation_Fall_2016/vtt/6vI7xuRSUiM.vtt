00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video for 3D geometry, we will be
talking about two topics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.960
One is the angle bisector of two planes and
one is line of intersection of two planes.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.060
Both of the topics are important especially
the line of intersection of two planes, and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.600
I will be spending some time on that.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.250
Angle bisector of two planes is a very easy
topic, something you should remember while

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.340
preparing for JEE.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.529
I will just give you the formula and I won’t
be doing a problem but I will spending sometime

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.824
on this (Line of Intersection of two planes),
because this is a relatively important topic.

00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:33.530
So let us say we have a pair of planes.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.729
And you have to find the angle bisector.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:49.819
This is the angle bisector —
plane which is the angle bisector of two planes.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.840
This angle is the same as this angle.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.760
You have been given equations for P1 and P2.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.459
You have find equation of angle bisector.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:12.860
If you think about this — easiest way to
think about planes is using a notebook.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.970
I always recommend you do that if you are
a little confused.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.110
So let us say I have two planes like this.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.430
Again, they are infinite.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.460
One plane will be the plane bisecting this
angle.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
This plane can also be extended to this direction.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.960
Thus there can also be an angle bisector of
this angle between the two planes.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.170
There are always two angles — one is acute
and one is obtuse.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.090
You can find equations for both of the planes.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.190
The way you do it is very simple.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.720
I will describe the equations of both kind
of planes.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.660
Again, there are two angles — acute and
obtuse.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.810
How will you find the angles?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.410
Just take dot product between n1 and n2.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.890
You will get an angle — either obtuse or
acute.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.478
If there is one angle, you can always subtract
180 - that to get the other angle.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:23.829
Let us say we have equations —
this is just how you should remember to do

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.829
this.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.670
I am currently writing d1 here so please take
note of this.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.459
Generally I write d on the right hand side
but this time it is here.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:50.829
Whenever you get something like this, ensure
d1 and d2 are greater than 0.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.340
d1&gt;0 , d2&gt;0.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840
Whatever equation you get, take constant to
the left hand side, multiply by negative if

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.810
there is a need to make this greater than
0.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:20.029
Once you have ensured that, check if a1a2
+ b1b2 + c1c2 &gt; 0.

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:45.499
If it is greater than 0, then (a1x + b1y +
c1z -d1)/(a1^2+b1^2+c1^2)^(1/2) = (a2x + b2y

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:51.299
+ c2z -d2)/(a2^2+b2^2+c2^2)^(1/2).

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.959
This would be the angle bisector of the obtuse
side.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:35.870
Similarly, let me just write it down so there
is no confusion.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:45.170
This would be the angle for the acute side
with negative sign in front.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.100
This is only when a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 &gt; 0.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.170
If it is not greater than 0, vice-verse otherwise.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:06.630
The signs would reverse if this
is less than 0.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:19.320
Just say opposite if a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 &lt; 0.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.750
Think like this that whatever will be the
sign of a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2, that will be the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.379
sign of obtuse side.

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.520
Thats how I remember.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.490
Again, you have to ensure that d1&gt;0, d2&gt;0.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.060
If is not a very conceptual thing and I can
explain to you how this equation was derived,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.650
it is not hard to see.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:06:00.360
Thats not the important point here.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.160
If the question comes, just remember this
thoroughly.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.920
It is literally like being careful with signs
and calculation.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.910
So I am not doing a problem for this, you
can do very easily yourself.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.900
You can construct two planes, and then find
the angle bisector.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.560
I think its pretty straightforward.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.360
You just have to remember the formulas.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.790
Now let us go to the next part which is a
very interesting topic — line of intersection

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.900
of two planes.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:39.500
Let us say you have two planes P1 and P2.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.650
What is the line of intersection of two planes?

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:52.310
That is the line which is — this line i.e.
the line of intersection of two planes.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.830
If you have a notebook.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.970
The way you think about it — this line is
the line of intersection of two planes.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.100
So just take a notebook and look at this line
and that is the line of intersection.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.900
How would you find the equation of line?

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.690
If you know P1 and P2, the question would
be how to find this line L here.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.910
How would you define this.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.970
What all do you need to define a line?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.530
You need a parallel vector.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.730
You will have n1_vector and n2_vector.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.250
You need a point here, a_vector.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.980
And you need a parallel vector.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.610
What is the property of this parallel vector?

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.430
Property of this parallel veto is that it
is parallel to both P1 and P2 planes.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.850
Because it parallel to the line and the line
is in both the planes, so it parallel to both

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.180
planes P1 and P2.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.400
In other words, it is perpendicular to both
n1 and n2.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.909
And as soon as I say this, it should flash
into your mind that b_vector = n1 \cross n2.

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:06.960
This is
something straight out of the cross-product

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.760
definition that b_vector = n1 \cross n2.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:17.200
Please recall the chapter of vectors if you
are forgetting cross-product.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.760
So the first step is that you will fine n1
\cross n2 for getting b_vector.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:42.710
And second thing you would do is find a common
point by putting one coordinate to be zero.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:48.300
I will solve a problem so that it will hopefully
make it easier for you to understand.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:09:04.380
The equation for P1 that has been give to
you is x+y+z=1.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:16.480
And the other plane has been give to you is
x-y+z=1.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.320
First thing we have to do is that we have
to find b_vector. What is n1_vector? n1 = i_cap

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:33.120
+ j_cap + k_cap. And n2_vector = i_cap - j_cap
+ k_cap.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:52.560
Now b_vector would be = |i j k; 1 1 1; 1 -1
1|. If you open this up, it will come 2i_cap

00:09:52.560 --> 00:10:03.180
- 2k_cap. You can check by taking a dot with
both of them. This 2-2=0 and 2-2=0. This is

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.700
a vector which is perpendicular to both n1
and n2.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.440
So this is the vector parallel to the line.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:21.520
Then you have to find the point. This was
Step-1. Step-2 would be — we can put any

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.560
coordinate to be zero. Let us put z=0 in both
the planes. What we are doing is that we have

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.760
to find a point. So we have to get the x coordinate,
y coordinate and z coordinate. But you have

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.240
two-equations and three variables. So we are
putting one coordinate to be zero. If we put

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.320
z=0, then you have two equations and two variables,
and then you know the point.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:59.440
So we have x+y=1 and x-y=1. So that will give
you x=1 and y=0. This will become x+y=1 and

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:10.410
x-y=1. This becomes x=1, y=0. So the point
A is (1,0,0).

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:26.350
So equation of line L is i_cap + \lambda (2i_cap
- 2k_cap).

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:31.400
This line would lie in both plane 1 and plane
2.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.630
And you can also write it in the coordinate
form. (x-1)/2 = (y-0)/0 = z/(-2).

00:11:36.630 --> 00:12:02.240
I hope that this made sense and gave you the
idea of what it means. Line of intersection

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.500
like a notebook is a line common to both the
planes. It is perpendicular to both n1 and

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.370
n2. So the parallel vector has to be n1 \cross
n2. And then you can find the point by putting

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.610
one coordinate to be zero.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.730
So this was the topic of angle bisector of
two planes and line of intersection of two

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.630
planes. The next video we will start mixing
up line and planes, and points and planes,

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.589
and things like that. I hope to see you in
the next video. I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:28.089
Thank you.
