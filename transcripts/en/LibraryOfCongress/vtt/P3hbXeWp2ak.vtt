00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We
are very, very pleased

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.140
to be tonight graced with
having Jorg Widmann, composer

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.860
and clarinetist in
the Pacifica Quartet.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.430
We'll be talking with Sibbi
Bernhardsson and it's exciting

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.220
to have people here
who are going

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.360
to be both performing
and composing.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.820
This afternoon I understand
you had the pleasure of looking

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.570
at the Von Weber clarinet
quintet some copious manuscripts

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.760
and we'll talk about
that as well.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.530
So, we'll just jump
right in and say both you

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.070
and the Pacifica are rapidly
expanding an impressive roster

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.370
of new music.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.670
It's really exciting.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.370
Whenever I read about you,
I'm so intrigued and impressed

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.570
by the scope of your activities,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.670
including just 10 days
ago the world premiere

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.050
of your new oratorio, which
we'll talk about, Arche,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.420
and also just-- in fact,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.710
you have another piece
being done the same--

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.800
in the same venue,
the Elbphilharmonie.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.490
I'd love to talk a
little bit about that,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.700
which is such a spectacular
new venue in Hamburg.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.640
And I saw a reference to
you and to the Pacifica

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.170
as a repeat collaborator--
that sounds a little criminal,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.050
but how long have you
been working together?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.350
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yeah,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.030
well we were actually
just talking about it.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
We met by in Badenweiler,
Germany and there used

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.720
to be this wonderful new music
festival in a hotel and the guy

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.660
who ran the hotel was also this
incredibly knowledgeable person

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.790
about music and was
close friends with many

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.890
of the leading composers
and he hired the--

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.040
got the quartet to play all five

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840
of the Elliott Carter
string quartets

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.820
and then he also brought it
together with Jorg Widmann

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.360
to play the clarinet
quintet and--

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.410
I think this was like 10 years
ago-- and we would be rehearsing

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.890
and we had never met Jorg
Widmann and then it was

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.000
like after the first [inaudible]
Brahms we're all like, wow,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
this is going to be the
greatest Brahms we've ever done

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.100
because he's amazing.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.690
And then during rehearsal
breaks,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.160
Jorg Widmann was
running upstairs

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.370
and finishing Vienna
Philharmonic

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.230
and that was our
introduction to Jorg Widmann.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.650
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
so, we know--

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.700
well, of course we've
had you a few times

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.920
and then I was looking
the other day at the video

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.140
of when you were here in
2000-- was it 2010, I think,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
with Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center--

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.740
and it's nice to be able to
welcome back people that feel

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.520
like true friends, you know.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.410
We have quite a few of them here

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.010
in the audience and
on stage as well.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.100
But I wanted to ask you,
Sibbi, a little bit about some

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.010
of the new music that
you're doing and starting

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.320
with a piece that's not so
new, but is new to many people,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.670
and that is the Ornstein
piano quintet.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.820
That's an amazing piece,
when did you pick this up

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.120
and how did you come by it?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.890
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, well that was--

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.620
we were lucky enough that we
were once playing a concert

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.390
in Boston and then Marc-Andre
Hamelin, the pianist,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.780
he came backstage and the
concert was George Crumb Black

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.960
Angels and Carter 3 and he
came backstage and he was like,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.950
you know, there's this great
composer that no one knows

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.580
and his name is Leo Ornstein
and I really want to, like,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.520
actually record this piece
and tour it and I feel

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.820
like we would be a good fit.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.540
And, you know, we like
right away were intrigued

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.370
and it is actually
quite a piece.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.690
And Ornstein, I don't know
if any of you knew him,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.490
because I certainly
didn't, but he is actually--

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.840
he was apparently this
amazingly popular famous pianist

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.150
and in the-- and when he was

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.530
in his 20's he apparently
sold the halls

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.690
out faster than Heifetz did.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.340
And-- but he only performed
for about three years

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.640
and then he just
like gave it up.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.740
He-- something-- he just
didn't have the nerves

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.020
and he also just
wanted to compose.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.150
And he started a children's
music school in Philadelphia

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.480
and then he moved
around for a while.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.750
He lived in a trailer in-- on
the border of Texas and Mexico

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.690
and was composing and
he died in Green Bay.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.600
And he is the-- after
Elliott Carter,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.020
he is the second oldest
published composer

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.540
and he did incredible music

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.570
and Marc-Andre Hamelin
has really championed him.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.950
And these have really
kind of haunting titles,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.200
like some of his piano
pieces they're called, like,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.220
suicide on an airplane
and things like that.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.960
But it's spectacular music

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.880
and Marc-Andre Hamelin
has been playing it a lot

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.370
and we love that quintet.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.840
Do you know the composer?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.140
Yeah.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.580
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah, so
I think it was Andre--

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.440
Marc-Andre who was
saying he's a mixed--

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.790
no, it was in the notes to that
recording, a mix of [inaudible]

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.670
and [inaudible] piano slayer.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.620
Strange combination of a
description for somebody.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.860
I just was interested
because I had not heard of him

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.730
and I know he's a very
extraordinary person,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.090
arresting music, very
little counterpoint,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.100
somewhat extended noise
techniques, maybe,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.600
or verging on the edge of that.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.020
So, that's one thing
you're doing

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.730
and then mention a little bit

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.810
about your new quintet,
the cello quintet.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.950
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, so we are-- we--

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.660
with Johannes Moser,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.500
we commissioned Julie
Wolfe to write a quintet.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.900
It's a basically a reaction
of the super cello quintet,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.930
so the projects is that
we pair those two together

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.840
and that has been a
very-- it's a great piece.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.500
We just premiered
it last November.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.800
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
you have a new--

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.270
had also a reduction of a
piece by Jennifer Higdon,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.940
a new reduction of her Dooryard
Bloom-- is that the name?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.240
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yes.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.540
Wow, you like really did your--

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.840
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I'm
very interested

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.910
because I'm not kidding about
your being a force for new music

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.890
and that's what we're
going to really be focusing

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.340
on while we're talking, but--
so was that an orchestra piece

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.020
and now you're doing it
as an ensemble piece?

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.320
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, for--

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.680
it's for piano, voice,
and string quartet.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.770
Yeah. And then we also a piece
that we really love playing

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.410
and is commissioned
by Shulamit Ran.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.090
She wrote a very powerful
quartet called Glitter, Shards,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.300
Memory, and Doom and
it's a very, very--

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.800
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's an
interesting title, yeah.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.590
Well, this is great and
now we'll talk further

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.150
about this new work, the
oratorio, and I caught a bit

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.180
of this on the internet
and it was just stunning.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.040
And this is-- I'd like you

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.670
to tell the audience
a little bit about it.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.740
The name, how you
came up with the name,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.410
and it's really a metaphor,
and talk about the concert hall

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.560
and so on a little bit.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.530
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Well, first
of all, also for me it feels

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.060
like coming home,
back to this place

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.950
into this wonderful acoustic
of this hall and it feels

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.240
like coming home for me.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.270
You know, after years-- too many
years-- that we didn't meet--

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.570
and we just said

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.990
in the rehearsal today
it feels like yesterday.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.260
You know? We-- you just
continue-- maybe we were--

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.340
we are somewhere else now,
so we have new experience,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.420
but it feels really like
musically coming home.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.380
This piece, yeah, I
wrote this piece for--

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.920
I was writing on it for
more than half a year.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.170
It almost tore me apart because
there are 300 people involved.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.540
Three choruses, one
children chorus,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.930
one youth chorus,
one opera chorus.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.970
Kent Nagano was conducting
it a fantastic way.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.680
I mean he's one of
the few people I think

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.580
who can hold something
like this together.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.180
It's two hours long
almost and huge orchestra,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.560
so 300 people involved.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.740
And I wrote every note of it--

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.040
still I don't believe when I did
it, but I heard most of them--

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.550
all of them-- so, the title
comes really from this building.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.560
So, maybe you have
seen images of this.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.670
It looks like a ship from
outside, but when you're inside

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.540
of it it's really an amazing
modern hall because even

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.950
at the seat, which is farthest
away from the center stage

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.430
or from the conductor,
you feel still

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.440
like a part of the whole thing.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.310
In some halls, also, some
modern halls, you think is--

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.680
did the orchestra
start playing already,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.270
you feel like in
a different room.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.100
And that's really like you feel

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.470
like in the middle
of a ship or an ark.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.040
So, it has this also
religious connotation,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.930
but I think if you decide to
write an oratorio, in our time,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.110
I mean this really turmoil
of politically everywhere

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.850
in Europe-- everywhere--

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.990
it's one of my pieces which
really has a message and ends

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.470
at the end with "dona
nobis pacem"

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.210
and I think that's what we need
in our world more than ever.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was going
to ask you about the text.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.630
I know there are many, many
texts from Heine, Nietzsche,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.130
to the Bible, Schiller,
Matthias Claudius, and so on.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.530
Did you choose the texts or
did they guide you on this?

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.900
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: So, when Kent
Nagano asked me, he just--

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.250
so, we know each other for a
long time, so he trusted me.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:14.350
So, I-- the only wish was that
there's a chorus involved,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.230
so not a purely symphonic work.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.430
So, this time it was the first
time I chose all these poems

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.470
and poets.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.320
So, it was a composition
in itself

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.730
and it took me much
longer than I ever thought.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.670
So, this was already
compositioned [phonetic]

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.650
as one line from
Michelangelo which I combined

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.010
with six lines of Schiller.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.820
So, that was already
a kind of composition.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.050
Normally, I prefer if I
have somebody, you know,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.480
I can work with and
also disagree with--

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.120
that's very important for our
work, sometimes, you know?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.700
You have the librettists
for my operas.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.400
Here it's half opera,
half oratorio,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.030
but this time I chose
these texts.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.450
And, by the way, the Schiller
text, it was really amazing

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.780
to me because in the
moment of the dies irae,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.540
the fourth part is dies irae,
and I strongly disagreed

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.930
with the fifth, you know, pair
of lines, which is about guilt,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.850
our guilt as human beings
and that there is one day--

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.150
so it will be-- there's
a book written

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.260
and all my sins will be read--

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.640
so, I strongly disagreed with
that because that can only mean

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.450
that in life we are
already full of guilt.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.750
You know?

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.630
And I-- it was a real crisis.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.310
I could not continue writing

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.740
because I could not
simply set this to music.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.450
And in these days I
found the Schiller lines

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.920
from an early version
of the [inaudible],

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.310
so this joy which Beethoven
used in his ninth symphony,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.440
but he did not use these lines.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.970
So, if he would have, I
would have never dared

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.580
to even touch them,
but since he did not

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.200
and it was exactly contradicting
these lines and it says, like,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.630
that our book of guilt should be
torn apart and let's have joy--

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.460
and I mean that's
the simple version,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.400
it's incredible Schiller
words, but these things happen

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.470
so already the choosing
the literature was a part

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.830
of the composition.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.680
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And the form
of the piece, how did you--

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.460
did this sort of
evolve over time?

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.530
What kind of structure
did you give it?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.280
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: To me, it
was very clear from beginning

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.970
on that since it was one
of the opening nights

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.170
of this new hall-- so, it's
a new hall and I did not want

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:35.320
to pretend I go there and I
start, you know, with, you know,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.870
with a D major chord or
with a dissonant chord

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.630
or with any statement.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.580
To me, it became very
clear it has to evolve

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.880
from nothing, actually.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.930
So, there is nothing there,
like chaos, like it's described

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.210
in the Genesis, you know?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:56.170
So, I choose this light, you
know, there are these concepts--

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.960
two concepts, of course, of
the beginning of the world.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.050
In the Bible, one is the light,
the other one is the word

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.210
in the Johannes [inaudible].

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:11.470
So, these two different concepts
of the world, they're both in--

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.770
represented in this piece.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.930
So, it starts really with
the creation of the word--

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.130
sounds funny when I say
it, I'm happy I could do it

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.700
in the music, but it
really comes from nothing.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.750
So, it means that there
are only air noises.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.470
It starts only with strange
noises and it takes six, seven,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.180
eight, nine minutes until
the first pitch tone comes

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.780
and then the word light,
of course, since Haydn.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.000
We have a responsibility to
set this word into music.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.930
I did it completely different.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.990
Not like-- in Haydn it's this
es werde licht, you know,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.290
the light, [inaudible].

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.270
I was more interested in
a transition, you know,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.740
from piano to a fortissimo
chord.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.040
So, that's the first part.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.900
The second is the flood, which
many religions believe in.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.310
The Jews believe in it, the
Christians believe in it,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.010
the Babylonians believed
in it, in the flood.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.910
So, I did not want-- only
want to write a festive piece

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.740
for a festive night, so we have
to know about the dark sides

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.530
and also the number four, dies
irae, of course is a dark one.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.380
The third one, the center
of the piece, is about love.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.320
So, it's-- doesn't
have to do so much

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.100
with the traditional
oratorio form.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.930
And the last one, to
me most important,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.210
when the children
come on stage--

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.260
they only come on
stage for this piece.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.870
This message.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.290
Sounds very much like cliche
when I say it now, but,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.720
you know, in two hours
and after you went

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.900
through all these dark
things, when the children,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.030
they come on stage and
they just say come on,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.500
don't deliver everything
to gods about peace.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.230
We have to start
as human beings.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.530
So, that's their message.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.630
So, no matter what you believe

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.320
or you believe, we
have to start it.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.620
Right now.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.360
So, that's-- so, in
the end, the adults,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.930
they understand this message
and it gave me the possibility

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.300
that in the very end it
really ends in a positive way

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.530
and it was so-- I was very
touched how it was received

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.160
because the people I
think understood this very

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.210
heartfelt message.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.990
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Can't wait to hear it.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.930
No, I said I can't
wait to hear it.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.720
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Yeah, Kent
Nagano, we talked for an hour

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.380
on the days afterwards
because he was still staying

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.870
in our place and he said
he also wants to bring it

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.320
to the United States for sure,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.540
but it's difficult,
you know, 300 people.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.280
The stage-- you have to
find a stage for everybody.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.800
Maybe I do a somewhat
smaller version.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.100
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
For clarinet quintet?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.980
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Yes, exactly.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:58.410
Exactly. So, I am the child
who joins you in the end.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.300
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was
reading this comment from one

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.150
of the singers that was
involved saying it was a cosmic

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.840
experience and Nagano was saying
that this was the best room

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.630
in the world to have
this experience for him,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.410
that the room itself helped to
contribute to the experience,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.620
and I was thinking about concert
halls as spiritual spaces.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.970
And now the growth and birth
of these phenomenal halls,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.270
like this new one, which
is so extraordinary

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.560
and also the Paris Philharmonie,
which I have heard a concert in

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.290
and it really-- it's like
a cathedral for music.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.900
And then you think about,
you know, people will talk

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.420
about the decline of classical
music and so on and so on,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.880
but it's-- to me, it's
very moving to know

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.910
that these places are
being built and not only

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.780
that people are coming
to them in droves.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.110
I know the Paris one, they're
saying they've far exceeded the

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.290
number of people they expected
to have in the first year.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.200
And I was curious
about this one.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.540
Is it-- as I understand
it, it's a concert hall

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.890
that presents many
kinds of music, right?

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.190
Yeah.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.490
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: So,

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.790
the spiritual dimension
is the first thing.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.780
When you enter this hall,
that's one of the first things--

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.030
and I agree, in Paris
it's similar.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.940
They are not that far away from
each other in aesthetic and--

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.240
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah, the
pictures I saw, yeah--

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.320
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: And the
futuristic approach and--

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.710
but futuristic approach
sometimes means a little bit

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.750
cold, sometimes, but here there
is a certain warmth about it

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.550
as well and it's great
acoustics-- still, of course,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.180
I mean we could research
a lot now,

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.460
so I think it will
take some time

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.790
to really fix some
problems is too much,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.700
it's fantastic acoustics but
with these forces involved,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.350
you know, chorus and orchestra,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.720
you can really know
afterwards, you know.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.680
And I will be-- the
day after tomorrow,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.190
I will be in Paris
to-- in this hall to--

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.490
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You'll love it.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.750
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Yeah,
I know, it's fantastic.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.900
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, it's
wonderful to just chat

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.830
in general, but I wanted to get
you guys to talk a little bit

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.050
about your quartet that
you'll be performing tonight

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.410
and is this one of the
more dramatic quartets

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.710
in your repertoire?

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.010
I would think so.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.310
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
The-- his--

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.050
yeah, dramatic is
exactly the right word

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.040
because actually he
asked us to do all sorts

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.270
of extramusical things,
like, you know, we get to--

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.000
we do a fair amount of shouting,
we get to whip our bows,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.460
we get to slay our cellist and
so I think it's exactly right.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.950
This is probably the
most dramatic piece,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.090
but it's a really,
really exciting piece.

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.570
It's really hard.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.970
We're going like
160 miles an hour.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.920
And then-- but it's
so effective.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.660
And actually-- I've actually
often used Jorg as an example

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.020
when I'm talking to
aspiring composers is one

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.810
of the reasons why I think--

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.290
one of the many reasons besides
him just being so talented

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.700
and creative-- why he's
such a great composer--

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.000
and we've had this
conversation--

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.470
is just like he knows
the literature so well.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.110
He just knows music, like,
from the beginning to now.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.120
So, he just-- he has
such a strong foundation

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.690
and he knows how to write,
he knows the counterpoint,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.340
he knows all of this, so when
he is doing these extramusical

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.880
things or when he's having
us do unusual things,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.220
it's so convincing
because it's based

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.360
on such a strong foundation.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.720
You know? And so this piece--
which when you will hear it,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.150
I mean, you-- it's doing--
and even the notation.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.400
I mean there's not even western
notation to some of the things

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.480
that he's asking us, so he
has to actually write little

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.890
like asterisks and say, well,
actually you're supposed

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.800
to do this with a bow
and this and that.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.710
And-- because with his
creative mind he's like looking

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.390
for the sounds and
whatever it takes in a way

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.690
like George Crumb does.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.300
I mean he's just like
looking for the sound

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.600
until he just gets it.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.480
So, it's incredibly dramatic
and it's incredibly--

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.500
and, well, you should talk
about it more, but, you know,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.300
when you were explaining
it to us about hey,

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.020
it sort of is how
the scherzo evolves

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.890
and from a minuet to a hull.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.210
I remember you described it
so well, like how, you know,

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.260
Haydn turned the minuet
into a scherzo as a joke

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.890
and then Beethoven turned the
scherzo into something dramatic

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.810
and then Mahler into
something tragic.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.590
So, I think when you're
playing this piece--

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.510
I was just thinking the other
day, well, it's sort of up

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.900
to the listener if
the piece is a joke

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.580
or if it's sarcastic
or deadly serious.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.140
So, that will be for, you
know, for you guys to decide.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.910
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And maybe
would you give us a little

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.190
background-- I know you've
written these as a series

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.550
of five quartets and this is
the centerpiece, but tell us how

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.210
that relates to the
forms and so on.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.850
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: So, every
movement I would even call it

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.270
of this quartet cycle, so it
can be performed as a cycle,

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.960
so then it's really movements,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.770
but they can be performed
individually.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:40.360
So, each of these quartets
represents a traditional form

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.390
of-- traditional
form of movement.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.160
So, the first one would
be an introduction,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.910
the second a very slow movement.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.990
This one is the scherzo
with all its implications.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.780
The fourth one is an andante

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.420
and the fifth one
comes in a soprano.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.250
Joins the quartet
and that's a fugue

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.710
or the attempt of the fugue.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.490
So, this is really-- I think
you described it so well,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.570
I should not add too
much to it, but this--

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.870
talking about tradition,

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.280
maybe just taking this
first thing you mentioned,

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.580
that's right.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:23.300
I am grateful that on a daily
basis I am allowed to be

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.390
in touch with these great
masterworks of the past,

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.950
which we played tonight, like
the Weber, which I was so moved

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.260
that this is here at the
Library of Congress--

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.560
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
The manuscript?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.860
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: The
manuscript-- incredible.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.240
We will talk about
this in a minute.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.980
It was a very, very special
moment for me because,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.990
as a clarinetist, we adore
Weber, but as a composer also,

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.710
I'm one of the very few people

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.320
who really admire
Weber so, so much.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.550
You know, there are so
many prejudices about him.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.390
Let's talk about Weber
rather than about my quartet.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.930
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, there's
a lot to be said about Weber,

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.780
I mean he was-- my
colleague talked about him

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.370
in his program saying he was--

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.060
could be called a
musical impresario

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.280
because he was a
conductor, he was a pianist--

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.640
I believe you're
also a pianist--

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.120
but he was a performer.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.610
He did all these many things
and certainly was influential

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.200
in opera of the time and so on.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.900
You mentioned that when you
were a child you found the

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.050
[inaudible] music very scary.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.560
And so why was that?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.860
Talk about that.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.070
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I was so
scared, but really scared.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.770
You know? It was not a being
scared you see a theater

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.400
and you understand that they
want to make you being scared.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.400
I was really shaking and this
[inaudible] scenery, you know,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.440
the dark scenery of [inaudible]
and I was scared by the sounds.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.320
I remember these low clarinets--

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.960
even as a clarinetist I would
never imagine two low clarinets

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.150
in this registers, then
celli playing far above.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.280
Or the piccolos-- I
still hear today--

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.150
with the women's
chorus, this [inaudible].

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.450
I can still hear it.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.480
I was shaking.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.440
And, of course, the
great clarinet works,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.310
he really maybe only
as Mozart and Brahms,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.940
he understood our instrument.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:15.520
He understood the
essence of our instrument.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.260
You know, writing a
piece like the Fantasia

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:27.120
in the Weber Clarinet Quintet,
this incredible imagination--

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.560
and you know in clarinet
quintet he cannot even do much

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.590
about instrumentation because
it's, you know, it's this set

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.460
of instruments, but
his orchestration--

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.780
and that's what Berlioz praises
in his instrumentation most.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.920
That's unique and so new.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.410
And Wagner, by the way, he-- I
mean I don't want to talk badly

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.460
about him, but he really--
it's on the edge of being--

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.910
we are being able to say
he stole some of things

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.750
and some of the effects.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.050
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yeah,
one movement.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.350
Did he really?

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.650
I mean did he publish
it as well?

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.050
I know he took it and copied it?

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.660
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Oh, you
mean this one, the quintet--

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.230
for a long time,
people thought it was

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.570
by Wagner, but it was by Berman.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.230
So, I think because they wanted

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.260
to sell more copies they
said it's by Wagner.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.090
And in the 19th century people
thought it's a clarinet quintet

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.460
movement, an adagio, very
beautiful piece in D-flat major,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.600
very strange key, but it was
written, now they found out,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.840
by the clarinetists of Weber.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.430
But what I mean is
the harmonies.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.130
You know? If we listen to
[inaudible], we think ah,

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.510
that's Wagner harmony.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.660
Well, Weber was so many decades
before that and Wagner was aware

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.440
of it because at the day of
the funeral when Weber died

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.310
in London and they
brought his corpse to the--

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.620
to Dresden, Wagner
organized a whole day of music

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.680
and he wrote music for Weber.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.090
So, he knew what-- where
he was getting it from--

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.770
you know, I'm too
sarcastic about it,

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.030
but a lot of the best
Wagner I think is Weber.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.050
[ Laughter ]

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.970
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's
quite a statement, yeah.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.180
Well, let's talk a little
bit about the impresario--

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.140
I mean the virtuoso, you
mentioned Berman, he really,

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.860
like as in the case of so
many people who were virtuosi

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.630
who advanced technique and
advanced a whole school

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.480
of playing and so on, he
really made these come alive

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.360
and they still exist in part
because of him, I think.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.030
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: And I
think also the manuscript,

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.670
which I today saw, so the--

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.560
I did not know until today

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.570
that there is a clarinet piano
version in the handwriting

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.760
of Weber, which is just here,
very moving moment for me.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.170
And I will play it, I promise.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.170
I will play it with piano
also, I just did not know

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.910
about it, that it exists.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.220
And the score is not
by him but with his,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.600
you know, comments in it.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.090
And, you know, he did not write
much-- a little bit like Mozart.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.060
And let's not forget
that the wife

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.700
of Mozart was Constanze
Weber, so it's the same family

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.890
as Weber, so Weber was in
every moment of his life where,

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.040
you know, of-- you know, of--

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.340
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Connections.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.640
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: Yes,
of this connection.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.120
But without Berman, these pieces
would not be possible even

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.330
to play because Weber
rarely writes any phrasing

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.660
or even dynamics.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.550
So, Berman added some things.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.340
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And even
the clarinets of those days,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.640
I mean they made this--

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.020
the chromatic passage were
much easier I understand

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.620
and you were saying
that Mozart wrote these

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.280
with low clarinet
writing in mind

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.490
that not many people
were doing that then.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.650
That this really was a
move forward and so on.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.310
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I think
we should be so grateful

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.830
to these people and still
today I think you mentioned

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.540
when you played the
quartets and so on.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.290
So, when we work today with the
living composers of our time,

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.620
you know, we know
that it's not--

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.250
I mean some composers
work like that.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.110
They write a piece
and they give it to us

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.860
and we are executing
and performing it.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.170
You know? But, with most of
them, it's a real exchange.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.500
So, they're interested what's
possible on a clarinet,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.610
you give them some ideas,
and they will turn it

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.900
into their language anyway,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.490
but I think this
exchange is so important.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.790
You know? And some of the works
which were written for me,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:20.760
which I premiered in a concerto
of [inaudible], for example, I--

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.640
when I first saw it, I did
not think I will ever be able

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.870
to play it because his
clarinet concerto is 50 minutes

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.380
without any rest
for the clarinetist.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.320
So, I had to do certain
exercises and techniques

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.740
and today it's a
standard piece for me.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.060
So, if I would have told
him right away, no, no,

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.360
it's not possible, and we
could not-- or just imagine--

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.100
I don't want to put
it on the same level,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.880
but you know the just principle,
let's imagine Berman saying,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.930
you know, these runs
in the last movement

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.500
of the clarinet quintet,
it's insanely difficult.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.800
Don't write it.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.720
I mean we would not
have the piece today.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.020
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Exactly.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.850
How do you guys work on-- they
say it's a pocket concerto,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.980
what somebody has written this--
how do you work on it together?

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.760
It must be so much fun.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.630
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Actually, we worked-- we were--

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.120
this is actually the first time
we played the Weber with Jorg.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.570
We played the Mozart,
we played the Brahms,

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.530
but so this will be our first
Weber with-- yes, and we--

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.850
actually, we were going

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.480
to rehearse it yesterday
early evening,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.980
but then travel problems and all
that, so we didn't get to until

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.980
like 9:45 and he'd just came
from Paris, we got stuck

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.780
in Detroit-- he was
totally jetlagged--

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.300
and then we come in there and,
you know, we start playing it.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.480
And then him-- so we were
just after the rehearsal

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.390
like how are you going
to be when you're rested

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.370
because this is the fastest
Weber you will ever hear.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.190
I mean we could barely
like, you know, keep up.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.490
So-- but anyway.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.370
But it's like-- but with a
piece like this, it's just so--

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.220
well, any kind of
rehearsing, no matter what,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.950
no matter what the composer
or the period or any of it.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.010
I mean it's all about,
you know, trying to--

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.650
you know, we have a
script and we're actors

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.570
and actresses trying
to convey what's there.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.720
So, so much of the rehearsal I
find is just about characters

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.380
and how to like, you
know, find the ways

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.210
to convey those characters.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.460
And even if you agree
on a character,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.940
you may not always agree
on how to execute though.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.510
So, much of us, you know,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.590
what we were doing yesterday
was like, you know, finding--

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.020
trying to convey the spirit
and that means like timings

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.320
or tempo or this and that.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.370
So, that's all we were
doing, but no different

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.350
than if we were doing
the Brahms I think or--

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.380
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: That's
right, but at the same time,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.220
really discovering, in a way,
because it's so original.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.520
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yeah.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.820
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I think
that we were smiling

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.100
when we did the third movement,
it's called menuetto [phonetic],

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.520
which is actually
wrong, I think.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.640
I mean to be-- you are not
able to dance this minuet.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.770
No way possible because
it's so fast

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.810
and should be, I'm convinced.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.820
So, it's on the edge of being
still a minuet, but she calls it

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.660
that way, and the
end of it is just--

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.590
I don't know any piece like
that in the 19th century

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.290
which ends with [humming].

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.590
That's it.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:56.230
You know, it's a question-- only
bones, you know, it's almost--

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.700
a modern-day composer would
even add [inaudible] to it,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.660
but you found a color which it
makes it sound really modern

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.520
in a way.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.360
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know, while
you were talking, I was thinking

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.030
about how you have this passion
and joy for this older music

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.490
and then obviously you
create new music every day

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.970
and you perform new music
every day and thinking about--

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.880
a comment I wanted to ask you--

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.920
Jorg, you've said your music is
meta-modern or you're interested

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.830
in meta-modernism and your
colleague Per Masumi has said

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.090
that working with you
is like having a foot--

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.650
one foot in the past
and-- not in the present--

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.580
one foot in the past and
one foot in the future.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.630
And I like that.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.070
And yet you're in the
present together, but, yeah,

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.660
talk about this idea
of meta-modernism.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.840
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I
don't remember when I--

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.820
I said it's a nice word,
I should maybe use it.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.040
No, but seriously I-- this--

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.610
to put it that way is a
beautiful way, you know,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.320
one foot in the past and one--

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.810
it reminds me of last time
we were sitting here we were

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.670
talking about the Messiaen
quartet of the end of time

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.750
about the angel which has one
foot, you know, on the ground

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:12.700
and the other one in water in
the apocalypse of Johannes.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.250
I can't think differently.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.770
You mentioned that Weber
was a conductor, a pianist.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.700
You know, for me, it never--
this tradition never stopped.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.080
I think it happened
maybe in the 19th century

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.140
that people specialized and then
suddenly there was the concept

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.720
of the maestro, you know,
conductor, ingenious conductor,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.710
you know, who does all
these magical things.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.460
Then strange composers who were

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.220
at their places write
this strange music,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.200
then the virtuoso, you know?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.780
To me, it felt always
strange, this, you know,

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.370
that it went apart so much.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.650
To me, it's music, you know,
and to me it's still valid,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.320
this approach of music.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Last week,
we talked with Richard Egarr,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.720
who's the man who conducts the
Academy of Ancient Music and,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.330
like you, he was saying-- we
were talking about, you know,

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.330
things technical, hand positions
and do you change your position

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.020
from keyboard-- from the
piano to the clavichord

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.850
and he said no, I don't really.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.060
He said I hear the
music in my mind

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.250
and that's what I
want to come out.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.630
It's the same with your
techniques as a string quartet.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.930
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yeah.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.380
Exactly. That's exactly right.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And I was--
back to the string quartet,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.630
I was going to ask you about--
I know you don't want to talk

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.250
about the Hunt Quartet,
but let's talk for a moment

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.800
about the extended
string writing

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.000
and those techniques in there.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.300
Are those challenging?

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.710
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, I mean they're--

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.010
well, you have to figure it out.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.670
So, I mean, so-- but now
that we've figured out, no,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.400
they all like make
so much sense now.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.290
They like seem, you know,
natural, but there--

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.890
yeah, there are different
techniques you will hear

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.800
like he has us do not
only just [inaudible],

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.110
which is when you hit with
the stick of the bow--

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.110
a lot of composers use that,
which has a very kind of--

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.620
a specific-- like
it's percussive,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.920
but it has sort of
overtones as well.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.740
But he has us like play
around with where we hit it

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.040
on the fingerboard,

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.790
which creates actually a whole
different set of pitches,

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.370
which is amazing, and then
he has us-- in the beginning,

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.160
we are whipping our bows,
but we're doing in unison,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.860
so that creates actually
a sound.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.180
And then we are actually
scrubbing the hair with the bows

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.060
and it also creates a very
specific and very appropriate

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.030
for what is going
on in the character.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.890
But I want to stress what I said
earlier, like all these sounds,

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.830
I mean, I just-- knowing Jorg
and having done this piece,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.550
it's like, you know,
you must have just--

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.070
I don't know how you
even found these sounds.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.490
You were looking for some kind
of characters and kind of mood

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.000
and I don't know if your sister
helped you or like, you know,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.970
to find like these-- his sister
is a wonderful violinist.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.290
So, like, you know,
if you were just

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.590
like experimenting because--

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:46.070
since I was mentioning George
Crumb, once we were working

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.180
with him on the Black Angels
and there's this place

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.870
in the Black Angels where
he has you have thimbles

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.120
and we're supposed to do
this thing in staccato

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.800
in like a thimble and then
it's all amplified and we just,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.650
you know, we were doing it,
and it's like yeah, you know--

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.230
and he doesn't play the violin--
it's like well, yes, it's nice,

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.690
but then he took my violin and
then he put these thimbles on

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.800
and he just like-- I mean it's
like incredibly magical sounds.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.880
And, like, watched it, and
he just told me had been just

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.080
like in his office or in
his room, he was just like--

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.950
had some sound in mind and he
was just like looking for it

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.470
until he just finally found it.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.880
So, no matter what it took--

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.190
and so all the extramusical
sounds you hear in his piece,

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.770
I mean they just have such an
emotional, specific meaning,

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.170
which is why it's a great piece
and why you're a great composer.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.470
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I don't know,

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.000
but it has a dramatic
meaning also.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.040
I mean mentioning this very
beginning of the piece,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.280
what I liked about it, it's
the gesture you make is a very

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.580
brutal one, but the sound
which comes out is very subtle.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.440
I like this combination
of [whistling sounds]

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.090
and then the piece starts.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.580
So, it all starts in
A major, the piece,

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.750
it's really clean,
positive A major.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.710
So, to me that's composing.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.220
Putting together things you
would not imagine all the sounds

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.900
Sibbi just mentioned
being combined in a piece

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.430
which starts in A major.

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:16.330
To me, that's already composing,
putting these things together,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.880
and here in this piece
it's a real drama

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.090
and at some places the
piece was premiered--

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.160
by the way, also in
Badenweiler at this place

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.270
by the Arditti Quartet
who did all kinds

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.660
of modern things in their life.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.500
You know, they probably
did every sound

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:36.690
from burning a violin to, you
know, to the most silent sounds,

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.370
and they were laughing
and stopping

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.920
and because the sounds
were new to them.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.590
So, sometimes-- I'm
not a string player,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.770
but for this piece I spent
half a night with a cello just

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.630
to experiment how it
feels and I experimented

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.250
with some of the sounds.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.800
There's one behind the
bridge, you know, these--

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.660
when you press on a
certain part and then trill

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.730
and I think that's a really
new sound, but it's not only--

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.920
it's not good because it's
new or bad because it's new,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.240
but I think there
are some new sounds.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.280
Take it, what I said jokingly
before, that I join you

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.990
as a child, it comes
from me like--

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.730
it's like a child
would be at a piano.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.810
It would probably not play a C
major chord in middle register,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.880
it would probably move to the
edges of the piano and repeat.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.170
So, this kind of being
curious that's very important

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.700
in my music.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.000
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
this is the piece

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.980
with the papillon quote, right?

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.150
And people-- I've read
other people say oh, no,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.840
it's Beethoven's seventh
symphony rhythms and so on,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.490
but that isn't correct.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.700
But tell us why this quote.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.640
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: I
needed a simple rhythm.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.940
Since it's called
the Hunt Quartet,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.890
I needed a very clear
hunt rhythm.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:59.020
And the hunt rhythm throughout
all centuries is [humming]

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.000
and that's of course Beethoven's
seventh, you all know,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.350
the first movement of
Beethoven's seventh,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.620
which was really a revolution
in music history, I think,

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.820
because when you look at
the chord, it really looks

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.470
like a pattern of
wallpaper even because it's--

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.170
everything is less
important in this chord

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.590
than the rhythm itself.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.780
You find this rhythm
throughout this whole movement.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.400
I was very impressed by that.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.700
But you're absolutely right.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.830
The quote, it only turns up
very quickly and then it goes

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.300
to a different direction.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.170
I have to tell you the truth.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:36.420
I was not even aware it was a--
and I'm such a Schumann fan,

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.840
but I was not aware
in this moment when--

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.020
I just had to start the piece
with this positive gesture,

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.110
so I started with this
[whistling] [humming]

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:52.360
and then comes this-- which is
actually an old German folk tune

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.140
which Schumann used in the
Papillon, and then I admit

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.430
on page four or something I
had the feeling I know this

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:01.800
from somewhere.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.000
And then I researched--
did some research on it

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.380
and actually it's a
very important motif

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.680
in Schumann's life.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.410
It also turns up in
the davidsbundlertanze.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.100
It turns up in the Eichendorff
songs in a slow version

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.170
when the text says I wish I
would be a bird then I would fly

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.840
over the seas, you know,
then it's the slow version.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.460
But it's just the
starting point--

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.180
and more important to me, of
course, is what I do with it.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.750
It's almost to the point that I
destroy it, but not the rhythm.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.280
At the end of the piece
you will hear this rhythm,

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.680
but played on the bridge, kind
of dead sound [mimics sound].

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.530
So, that's what I'm
interested in and fascinated

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.640
by that you can start a
piece with the same rhythm

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.000
and the whole piece
is 12 minutes,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.880
but for you it must feel
like a whole symphony

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.880
because the amount of notes
since it's that fast, you know,

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.590
it's-- I have the greatest
admiration for how you do this.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.890
And they are doing it right.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.880
You know, they could
fake it, but they don't.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.180
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Since
this is a cycle,

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.760
do you ever have performers
who want to do it say

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.310
over two days, all five of them?

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.660
Or I know the Minguet
Quartett has recorded them all.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.060
Anyone else has recorded
all of them?

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.820
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: The Leipzig
String Quartet did as well

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.590
and when it's performed, it's in
one evening, so it's two halves,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.740
like 45 plus 45 minutes.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.200
There has to be a-- like
tonight, an intermission

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.050
after the Hunt Quartet
because players are dead.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:36.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, I was
thinking about the instruments

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:41.060
that you use because I know all
of you have older instruments.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.860
You have a Testore, is it?

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.160
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, actually--

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.810
well, since now I have a new
violin-- well, old violin,

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.690
but yeah, new, so I used
to have a Testore, yeah.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.860
You really did your research.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.540
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: But I was
interested in thinking of all

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.000
of these players with these
beautiful old instruments

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.470
like we have here and--
so how was that for you?

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:01.010
Doing modern music of any
kind, not just Jorg's music,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.610
but it must be just
second nature to you now?

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.910
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson:
Yeah, well,

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.580
I mean that's what we have
those-- I mean the instruments,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.600
of course, have been
so modernized.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.510
I mean we play on steel strings
and like, you know, the bridges

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.860
and all that, so-- but yeah, no,

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.500
but this is-- these
are our tools.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.800
But, you know, you are right.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.570
We-- in our quartet, we
do have old instruments.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.710
My instrument was made in 1712.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.420
Simin's instrument
was made in 1710.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.930
Masumi's instrument was made in
1619 and our cellist, Brandon,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.110
he has the-- one of the oldest--
there are only two cellos still

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.020
that exist by that
maker, Gasparo da Salo.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.630
His cello was made in 1580's.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.650
I mean his cello
is older than Bach.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:40.950
Yeah.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.510
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann: My
clarinet was built in 1993.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.340
[ Laughter ]

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.640
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And, in fact,

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.710
you're one of now the more
older generation, kind of,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.130
of string quartets
of your group.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.370
It's funny to say that,
but I was reading this

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.670
and I was thinking
wait a minute,

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.440
they're not really an older
generation, but you've been--

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.210
what is it, 20-something
years now?

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.510
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yeah.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.060
So, the-- and actually
not only-- yeah, we are--

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.730
the quartet is about 22 years
old and this membership has been

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.230
since 2001 and there's
actually only one touring group

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.540
that has a membership
that is older than us

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.440
and that's the Brentano
by one year,

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.600
but even the Emerson
are younger than us

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.780
because they have a
more recent cellist.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.550
Yeah. Yeah, so we are now
officially a senior group.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.850
Yeah.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.160
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was reading

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.910
that the Budapest
Quartet had said--

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.920
the members said it take five
years to learn how to play

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.350
as one and a lifetime to learn
how to play as individuals,

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:41.770
examining individuality within
the quartet structure helped

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.450
to free us up with
our entire repertoire.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.150
I was very interested by that.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.450
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: Yeah.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.750
No, I mean that's exactly right.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.230
And I think, like, you know,
when we first started and I see

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.720
that with young quartets
there's so much time spent just

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.990
like trying to blend
and be unified and--

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.500
which is completely
important and necessary,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.320
because one of the hard things
about quartets and why we have

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.460
to rehearse so much is because
we are four brains but we have

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.320
to become one and we have to--
we can't really compromise or--

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.890
because then the
music is compromised.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.410
We have to come up
to a consensus

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.110
and that just takes a lot
of time to try to find

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.850
like a third way that may be
better or come to a consensus.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.810
But that's a very valuable quote

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.500
because when the music
requires us to be unified,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.470
we have to be unified, but then
when the music requires not

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.560
to be, we have to be able to,
you know, do exactly that.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.930
And actually playing Elliott
Carter taught us that very well

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:39.630
because he is so into
individuality and how

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:43.360
that represents sort of people
in general and how they interact

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.850
and in his second quartet he
actually asked us to sit as far

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.860
as practical from each other

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.110
and we actually keep us a
character throughout the entire

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.600
piece and are kind of
oblivious of each other,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.170
but it still somehow works.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.580
And then actually after we did
that and then coming back--

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.830
and I remember right after that
we were rehearsing Brahms' A

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:09.170
minor quartet, which of course
completely different music,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.860
but sort of the issues of
sort of balancing and voicing,

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.360
somehow-- like somewhere in the
back of our ears we were sort

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.520
of in this Carter mode and
it actually really helped.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.510
Like sort of separating the
voices in a certain way.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.780
So, back to what we were talking
about earlier, we are so lucky

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.190
in the string quartet
that there's just

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.560
such great literature,
like from Haydn

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.790
and people are still
interested--

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.390
Jorg is still interested
in writing quartets.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:37.150
For some reason, this medium
is still so fresh and exciting.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.330
So, we're very lucky that
we can play great music

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.140
that is written today
and that was written 250

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.670
or 300 years ago.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.900
So, we're just-- we can
just focus on great music

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.830
and the language will be
different, but it's still all

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.550
about communication
and characters.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.740
And one of my favorite
quotes is from Robert Mann

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.820
of the Juilliard Quartet
and his famous quote is

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.090
like old music should
be played as if it's new

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.910
and new music should be
played as if it's old.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.640
And I think that's
exactly right.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.940
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It's so
much fun to talk with you

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.250
because there are so
many avenues to go down,

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.540
but maybe some of you
have some questions

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.820
for Jorg and Sibbi, perhaps.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.440
We'll bring you a
microphone here.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.820
I just wanted to ask you-- you
mentioned about the essence

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.400
of clarinet and how
Weber understood it.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.030
Could you describe
what the essence

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.500
of the clarinet is for you?

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.800
&gt;&gt; Jorg Widmann:
It's a very good

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.100
but very tough question
to answer.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.300
I am happy that I have
the clarinet tonight

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.650
to answer it in my way.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.240
I think this incredible
ability of the clarinet

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.760
to develop this sound from
nothing and at the end

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.080
of the note to let it
disappear in nothing.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.230
That, especially in this
Weber quintet, you will hear

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.670
in the second movement.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:07.500
There is one place which was in
music history not done before.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.100
You know? There's an echo place.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.200
You play fortissimo
a chromatic scale--

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.740
so, just recently
developed technique.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.880
Mozart did that technique.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.230
There are also echo effects,
but here it's spectacular.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.290
On the edge of being
heard, you know?

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.740
An oboe, beautiful instrument,

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:30.480
but that's for sure not
the foremost character

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.470
which would come to your mind
when you think of an oboe.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:38.070
So, this-- or take the Mozart
clarinet concerto just air

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.850
and this piano melody which is
pianissimo when it comes back.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.250
It's hard for me
to put in words.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.160
It's also something when
you play it, you feel--

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.140
there is some great
music, but it's kind

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.550
of against the instrument,
so we have to fight it.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.400
It does not make the
music worse, you know,

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.510
don't misunderstand me, but
here the music is so fantastic,

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.270
but it's written for
this instrument--

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:09.660
they really understood
the spirit.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.800
In Brahms, it's different.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.590
It's in a way more difficult

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.630
because he does not
give you a rest.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:20.890
You know? So, it's-- in Brahms,
the difficult thing I think is

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:25.860
that it's the absence of
virtuosity of outside virtuous--

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.900
of what we call virtuosity,

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.950
which is always digital
virtuosity.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:33.280
So, in Brahms, it's
singing for 45 minutes.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.830
Here in the Weber, I think
it's a fantastic combination

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.930
of all the things which are
possible in the clarinet.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.870
I think it's like a love
declaration to the clarinet.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.980
I think I did not satisfyingly
answer your question,

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.280
but I tried.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.770
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well,
I think we're good.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.070
Anything else?

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.370
Final thoughts, gentleman?

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.240
&gt;&gt; Sibbi Bernhardsson: No, we're
just really looking forward.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.310
It's great to play in this great
hall with so much like legacy

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.240
and history and, yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.550
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Thank you, yes.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:16.510
Thanks so much.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:22.340
