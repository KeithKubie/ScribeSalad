00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.360
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.820
Well my problem today
is a little different.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.630
Because I don't have
two initial conditions,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.680
as we normally have for a
second-order differential

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.070
equation.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.610
Instead, I have two
boundary conditions.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.900
So let me show you the equation.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.780
So I'm changing t
to x because I'm

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.000
thinking of this as a problem
in space rather than in time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.140
So there's the
second derivative.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.520
The minus sign is
for convenience.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.760
This is the load.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.515
But here's the new thing.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.870
I'm on an interval 0 to 1.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.200
And at 0-- let me take 0 for
the two boundary conditions.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.510
So my solution somehow
does something like this.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.870
Maybe up and back down.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.530
So it's 0 there, 0
there, and in between it

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.360
solves the
differential equation.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.980
Not a big difference,
but you'll see

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.450
that it's an entirely
new type of problem.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.020
OK.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640
As far as the solution
to the equation goes,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.500
there is nothing enormously new.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.690
I still have a y particular.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.070
A particular solution
that solves the equation.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.410
And then I still have the y
null, the homogeneous solution,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.930
any solution that solves
the equation with 0

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.310
on the right hand side.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.440
And in this example--
this is especially

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.770
simple-- the null equation would
be second derivative equal 0.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.450
And those are the
functions, linear functions,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.660
that have second
derivative equal zero.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.170
So there's the general solution.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.350
And now I have to put in,
not the initial conditions,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.652
but the boundary conditions.

00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:04.152
OK.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.650
So I substitute x equal 0.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.850
And I substitute x
equal 1 into this.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.330
I have to find y particular.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.170
I'll do two examples.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930
I'll do two examples.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.460
But the general
principle is to get

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.670
these numbers, these
constants like C1 and C2,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.400
from the boundary conditions.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790
I'll put in x equal zero.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.810
And then I'll have y of 0,
which is y particular at 0,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.280
still defined, plus
C times 0, plus d.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.370
That's the solution at the left
end, which is supposed to be 0.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.670
And then at the
right end, end, I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.700
have whatever this
particular solution is at 1,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.040
plus now I'm putting
in x equal 1.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.770
I'm just plugging in x
equals 0, and then x equal 1.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.770
And x equal 1, I have C plus D.
C plus D. And that gives me 0.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.060
The two 0's come
from there and there.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.710
OK.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.800
Two equations.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.580
They give me C and
D. So I'm all solved.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.890
Once I know how-- I
know how to proceed once

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.060
I find a particular solution.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.140
So I'll just do two examples.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.740
They'll have two
particular solutions.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.340
And they are the most important
examples in applications.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.140
So let me start with
the first example.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.050
So my first example is going
to be the equation minus D

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.600
second y, Dx squared, equal 1.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.060
That will be my load.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.300
f of x is going to be 1.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.210
So I'm looking for a particular
solution to that equation.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.420
And of course I
can find a function

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.130
whose second derivative
is 1, or maybe minus 1.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.690
My function will be-- well, if
I want the second derivative

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.243
to be 1, then probably 1/2 x
squared is the right thing.

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:19.534
And that would give me a minus.

00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:23.590
So I think I have a
minus 1/2 x squared.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.580
That solves the equation.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.520
And now I have the Cx
plus D. The homogeneous,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.010
the null solution.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.240
And now I plug in.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.690
And again, I'm always
taking y of 0 to be 0,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.430
and also y of 1 to be 0.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.430
Boundary conditions.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.490
Again, boundary condition,
not initial condition.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.080
OK.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.800
Plug in x equal 0.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.070
At x equals 0, what do I learn?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.700
x equal 0.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.790
That's 0, that's 0, so
I learn that D is 0.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.470
At x equal 1, what do I learn?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.840
This is minus 1/2.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.890
D is 0 now.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.280
And x is 1.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.590
So I think we learn
C is plus 1/2.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.010
OK with that?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.970
At x equal 1, I'm
supposed to get 0

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.130
from the boundary condition.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.070
So I have minus 1/2,
plus 1/2, plus 0.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.250
I do get 0.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.410
This is good.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:38.060
So this answer is-- Cx, then,
is 1/2 x minus 1/2 x squared.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.440
That's it.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.745
That's my solution.

00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:48.690
That function is 0 at both ends,
and it solves the differential

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.560
equation.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.980
So that's a simple example.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.550
And maybe I can give
you an application.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.010
Suppose I have a rod.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.040
Here's a bar.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.010
And those lines that I
put at the top and bottom

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.420
are the ones that give me
the boundary conditions.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.225
And I have a weight.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.420
A weight of 1.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.570
Maybe the bar itself.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.760
It gives-- elastic force.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.820
Gravity will pull,
displace, the bar downwards

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.010
because of its weight.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.340
It's elastic.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.650
And this function
gives me the solution,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.010
gives me the distribution.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.150
If I go down a distance
x, then that tells me

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.630
that this part of the
bar, originally at x,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.880
will move down by
an additional y.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.130
Moves.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.170
So this is now at x plus y of x.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.710
And that's the y.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.940
And that is 0 at the
bottom, 0 at the top,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.770
and positive in between.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.260
OK.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.910
That was a pretty quick
description of an application.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.150
And more important, a pretty
quick solution to the problem.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.525
Can I do a second example
that won't be quite as easy?

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:25.025
OK.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.150
So again, my equation
is going to be

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.180
minus the second
derivative equals a load.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.720
But now it will be a point load.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.790
A point load.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:50.210
That's a point
load at x equal A.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.780
This is my friend,
the delta function.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.530
The delta function,
you remember,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.730
is 0, except at that one
point where this is 0.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.210
This is 0 at the
point x equal A.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:10.980
In my little picture
of a physical problem,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.840
now I don't have any
weight in the bar.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.700
The bar is thin.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.670
Weightless.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.710
But I'm putting on, at the point
x equal A, right at this point,

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.240
I'm attaching a weight.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.299
So this distance is x equal
A. Here's my weight, my load,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.250
hanging at this point.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.570
So I can see what will happen.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.299
That load hanging
down there will

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:46.470
stretch the part above
the bar, above the load,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.470
and compress the
part below the load.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.710
So it's a point load.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.960
Very important application.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.570
OK.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.930
Now I have this
equation to solve.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.600
OK.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.575
I can solve it on the
one side of A, x equal A.

00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:06.260
And I can solve it
on the other side

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.100
of x equal A. Let me do that.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.510
For x less than A, I have
minus the second derivative.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.590
And what's the delta
function for x below A,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.350
on the left side of the spike?

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.250
0.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:30.060
And x on the right side
of the load, again, 0.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.880
And what are the solutions
to the null equation?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:46.000
y is Cx plus D on the left
side of the load, there.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.280
And now here it may have
some different constants.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.180
y equals, what shall
I say, E x plus F,

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.980
on the right side of the load.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.930
And now I've got
four numbers to find.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.690
C, D, E, and F.
And what do I know?

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.040
I know two boundary conditions.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:16.690
Always I know that y of 0 is 0,
from fixing the top of the bar.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.340
So y of 0 equal 0.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.560
And when I put in x equal
0, that will tell me D is 0.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.250
And then also y of 1 is 0.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.230
And that will be on
this side of the load.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.150
So when I put in x equal 1, that
will tell me that E plus F is

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.510
0, at x equal 1.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.870
So it tells me that
F is minus E, right?

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.180
So what do I know now?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.855
D is gone.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.600
0.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.840
F is minus E. So can I just
change this to F is minus E.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:08.650
So I had E x minus
E. E times x minus 1

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.640
takes care of that
boundary condition.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.800
At x equal 1, it's gone.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.300
OK.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.330
But I still have two,
C and E, to find.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:25.120
So what are my two further
conditions at the jump?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.380
So far I'm on the left of the
jump, the spike, the impulse,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.910
the delta function.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.410
And on the right of it.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.440
But now I've got to say, what's
happening at the impulse?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.070
At the delta function.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.290
Or at the point load.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.930
OK.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.340
Well, what's happening there?

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.550
I need two equations.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.140
I've still got C and E to find.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.510
So my first equation
is that at that load,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.880
the bar is not going
to break apart.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.560
It's just going to be stretched
above and compressed below.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.340
But it is not going
to break apart.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.030
So at the load, at
which is x equal A.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:10.871
So now I'm ready for x equal A.

00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:11.370
OK.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.890
What happens at x equal A?

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.910
That's the same as that.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.460
Let me draw a picture
of the solution, here.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.720
Here is x.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.120
This is x.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.890
Here's y.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.190
Here is x equal 0.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.430
Here is x equal 1.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.960
I see a linear function.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:43.360
Cx up to the point
x equal A. And here

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.890
I have a linear function
coming back to 0.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.570
You see?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.510
That's the picture
of the solution.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.130
The graph of the solution.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.260
It has this 0 at
the left boundary.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.390
It has 0 at the right boundary.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.690
It has, in between, it
is Cx in the x minus E.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:11.810
And I have made it
continuous at x equal A.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.480
The bar is not coming apart.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.890
So that this solution
runs into that solution.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.550
That's good.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.860
That's one more condition.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.990
But I need one further,
one final, condition.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.830
And somehow I have to
use the delta function.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.780
And what does the
delta function tell me?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.110
I'm just going to go give you
the answer here, rather than

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.900
a theory of delta functions.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.270
That equation.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.405
So you see what my solution is.

00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:48.250
It's a broken line
with a change of slope.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.430
It's a ramp.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.950
It has a corner.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.230
All those words describe
functions like this.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.810
So I have some slope going
up here, and some slope--

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.830
and let me tell you.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.320
I'll tell you what
those slopes are.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.200
I'll tell you what those
slopes are in this.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.330
So I'll tell you the answer
and then we'll check.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:16.210
So that C turns out to be 1
minus A. So in this region,

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.190
I have 1 minus A times x.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.520
In that region.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:28.130
And in this region, below,
so that's stretching.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.830
The fact that it's
positive displacement

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.660
means it's stretching.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.790
Now this part is going
to be in compression,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.260
with that negative slope.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:43.740
And I think in this region
it's 1 minus x times A, which

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.840
will be coming from there.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.870
So there is my solution.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:56.670
Because of the delta function,
I need a two part solution.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.320
To the left of the delta
function, the point load.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.510
And to the right
of the point load.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.540
And then we could
check that at the load,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.190
x equal A. This is
1 minus A times A.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.840
This is 1 minus A
times A. They do meet.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.800
And now comes this
mysterious fourth condition

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.680
about the slopes.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.040
The slope drops by 1.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.940
Here the slope is
1 minus A. That's

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.070
1 minus A is the slope there.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.540
And here the slope is minus
A. You see minus x times A,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.270
so the derivative is minus A.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:42.240
So it was 1 minus A. The
1 dropped away and left me

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.930
with minus A. That's what
the solution looks like.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.100
And now I have to say
one word about why

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.460
did the slope drop by 1.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.790
The slope dropped by 1,
from 1 minus A to minus A.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.120
And that has to come
from this delta function.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.250
And of course you remember
about the delta function.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.010
The key point is if when you
integrate the delta function,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.370
you get 1.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.110
So when I integrate
this equation, I get a 1

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.540
on the right hand
side from the delta.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.850
And on the left hand
side, I'm integrating

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.470
the second derivative, so
I get the first derivative.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.400
Great.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.310
The first derivative
at the end point,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.000
minus the first derivative
at the start point,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.030
should be the 1.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.510
And that's the drop of 1.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.180
I'll do a full-scale
job with delta functions

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.450
in another video.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.820
I want to keep this
one under control.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.580
We're seeing the new idea
is boundary conditions,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:53.600
and here we're seeing a
delta function equation

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.190
in this boundary value problem.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.960
Thank you.
