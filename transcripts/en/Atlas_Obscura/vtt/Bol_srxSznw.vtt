00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
 Passed by hundreds of students everyday 

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.792
sitting in a box at the end of a hallway in a university building in London 

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:11.500
 is the corpse of one of the most important philosophers in modern history 

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.375
 Jeremy Bentham was a philosopher 

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.708
 he is considered the father of utilitarianism 

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:24.250
the notion that you want to do the most good for the largest number of people 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.667
 he was also a man well ahead of his time 

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.375
 while women were still being persecuted for witchcraft in other parts of Europe 

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.375
 Jeremy Bentham was espousing things like 

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:39.333
 gay rights, the end of slavery, the end of child labor, animal rights 

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.500
 he was a guy who was forward thinking 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.375
 and when it came time for his death 

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.834
he didn’t want to be buried 

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.792
 he wanted to be made into an “Auto-Icon" 

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:54.208
 Jeremy Bentham wrote his will when he was twenty one 

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.708
 and he already knew what he wanted to happen when he died 

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:00.417
 his body was given to his friend to dissect 

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:02.458
so that he might learn something from it 

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:06.291
 Bentham also wanted to be made into a corpse 

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.667
 that he thought maybe his friends would come and visit 

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.250
 that could be taken out at parties 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.291
 and he did this for a number of reasons 

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:15.458
 One, he didn’t have a real high view of the church 

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.458
 and in some ways this was a way of kind of thumbing his nose 

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.667
 at the religious traditions 

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.875
 Second, as a utilitarian he genuinely thought 

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.959
 what is the most value that my dead body could possibly have 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.125
and, finally he was just funny 

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.500
 he was just a funny guy, who probably thought that this was hilarious 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.166
these are the reasons he decided he wanted himself made into an “Auto-Icon" 

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.375
 In fact he used to carry around a set of glass eyes 

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.875
 that he wanted put into his Auto-Icon 

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.041
 and he would bring them to parties and he would pull them out 

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.000
 and sort of use them as a conversation piece 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.875
 and as a way of shocking some of the more proper people at the party 

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.792
 the same friend who dissected him 

00:01:57.792 --> 00:02:00.041
 also did the mummification of his head 

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:04.667
 he did so using a Maori style of mummification 

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:07.083
 that involves sort of stretching and heating 

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:08.667
 and I think using hot sulfur 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:12.000
 but it looked pretty bad 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.750
 with sunken cheeks and the skin is sort of tight over the skull 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.667
 it’s not a super great look 

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.917
 of course, they still dutifully popped those glass eyes in there 

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:24.583
 Here’s the solution. We are going to have a beautiful wax head made for him 

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.291
 it’s going to look just like him

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.458
it’s going to be nice and fleshy faced like he was in life 

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:33.667
 for a long time he sat there. Serene. 

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.875
 wax head. Real head down beneath his feet 

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.583
 ghoulishly looking out with these bright glass eyes 

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:46.250
 However, in the 1970s some students managed to just extract the head, the real head 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.542
 which they then ransomed to the college 

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:53.375
 asking for a hundred pounds given to a charity 

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:57.208
 the university said we’ll give 10 pounds to the charity 

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.166
 and the students dutifully returned the head. 

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:06.625
 After this prank, they decided to keep it somewhere safer than between the feet of Bentham 

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.000
 so it is now in a Victorian bell jar 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.417
 in a box 

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:15.000
 that takes four keys and two people to open 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 and no one is going to open it for you. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.792
 That said Bentham’s Auto-Icon, it does get around. 

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:25.208
 It was taken out for the 150th anniversary of the college 

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:30.667
 and he recently attended the retirement of a particularly long serving provost 

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:35.917
and when they had to take him to a conservator in another part of London 

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.917
 they just put him in a car 

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:41.000
they just drove him there in the passenger seat 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.959
  Weekend at Bernie's style 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.834
 There are some other stories of pranks that have happened 

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:49.792
 One of the most famous is that his head was stolen and used in a football game 

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.375
 This is a total myth 

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.792
  For no other reason than basically that his real head could never have survived 

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.875
 Some students did steal the wax head in the 90s 

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:02.083
 and take some pictures of themselves hanging out with it 

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.583
 As a utilitarian, I think Bentham asked himself 

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:07.625
 “What good can my corpse do?" 

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:13.750
 and having had it dissected, having had it appear at various functions 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.166
 having it serve as just an amusing backdrop for the students of University College London 

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.792
I think you can’t get a whole lot more utility 

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:26.208
 out of a dead body, than that. 

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:27.959
 Bentham! 

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:32.166
So there is a particularly weird twitter stream 

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:35.291
 related to Jeremy Bentham, you should follow 

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:39.834
there is a little camera hooked up, which takes a picture every hour or so 

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:45.125
 and sends a stream of basically what Jeremy Bentham sees 

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.792
 it’s like the Jeremy Bentham Cam 

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:52.208
 It is strangely hypnotic, and I highly suggest you follow @panopticonstream 

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:57.166
 and you know, see through the eyes of Bentham himself
