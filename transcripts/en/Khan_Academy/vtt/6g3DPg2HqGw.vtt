00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.010
The circle x squared plus
y squared minus 8x is

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.770
equal to 0, and the
hyperbola x squared

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.090
over 0 minus y squared
over 4 is equal to 1,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.650
intersect at the points
A and B. In problem 46,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.820
they want us to find equation
of the circle with AB

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.470
as its diameter.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.340
So let's visualize the
circle and the hyperbola.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.480
The equation of the
circle x squared

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500
plus y squared minus 8x.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.240
Let me write it this way.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.170
This can be rewritten as x
squared minus 8x plus y squared

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990
is equal to 0.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.560
You can add 16 to both sides.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.300
And I'm doing that to complete
the square for the x term.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.125
So plus 16.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.370
This over here becomes
x minus 4 squared,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.060
plus y squared is equal to 16.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.770
And so the circle's going
to look something like this.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.750
That's my x-axis.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.239
That's my y-axis.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.660
Its center is at 4, 0.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.360
Zero.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
So 1, 2, 3, 4-- 4, 0.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.090
And its radius is 4.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.450
Its radius squared is 16.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.470
So its radius is 4.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.870
So let me go 1, 2,
3, 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.400
Then we go up 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.380
So all of these points, that
point, that point, that point,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.690
and that point are all
going to be on the circle.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.810
Let me draw that a
little bit neater.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.364
That point, that
point, and that point

00:01:34.364 --> 00:01:35.780
are all going to
be on our circle.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.450
So my circle's going to
look something like this.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.629
It's not drawn as
neatly as it could be.

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:44.170
But I think you get
the general idea.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.990
This is our circle.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.190
Then they have a hyperbola.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.493
x squared over 9 minus y squared
over 4 is going to equal 1.

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:55.240
This hyperbola is going to
open to the left and the right

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.925
since our x term is positive.

00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.550
It's going to look
something like this.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.000
You can actually figure
out the asymptotes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.250
Actually, let me just do that.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.690
Let me solve for y.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.510
So you would get, let
me write it this way,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.510
negative y squared over 4 is
equal to negative x squared

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.010
over 9 plus 1.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.180
I just subtracted x squared
over 9 from both sides.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.380
And then we would get,
let's multiply both sides

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.500
by negative 4.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.530
You get y squared
is equal to 4/9.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100
X squared minus 4.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.560
Or y is equal to--
and now this will just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.010
be the positive part over here.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.510
But I'm doing that so that we
can understand its asymptotes.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.490
y is equal to the square root
of 4 over 9x squared minus 4.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.400
So as x gets larger
and larger and larger,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.160
this term right here is going
to stop mattering so much.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.350
So as x approaches
infinity, this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.370
is going to approach the
square root of 4/9 x squared.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.480
This constant's not
going to matter much.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.860
And so it's going to approach,
this thing right over here

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.140
is going to be 2/3 x.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.590
So it's going to, if you
imagine a slope, let's see, 2/3.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.810
If you run 3, you rise 2.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.410
So the asymptote is
going to look like that.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.710
It's going to approach
that line over there.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.130
And it's going to be symmetric.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.510
So it's also going to
approach-- so 3 and 2,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.940
it's also going to approach
that line over there.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.830
And if we want to see where
it intersects the x-axis,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.070
you just set y is equal to 0.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.350
You get x squared
over 9 is equal to 1.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.150
So x is going to be
equal to plus or minus 3.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.430
So the positive intersection
is going to be over there.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.030
So our hyperbola
on the right side's

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.640
going to look something like,
something, something like that.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.767
It's also going to show
up on the left side.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:49.600
But that's less interesting
because it's not

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.650
doing anything with the circle.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.020
Now they told us that the
hyperbola and the circle

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.480
intersect at the points A
and B. So this right here

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.830
is the point A. This
right here is the point

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.100
B. In this question, we want the
equation of the circle with AB

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.160
as its diameter.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.211
So AB as the diameter.

00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:13.210
I could have drawn that
a little bit straighter.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.480
So the equation of that
circle right over there.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.230
So essentially, we
just need to figure out

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.480
where does this hyperbola
intersect this circle.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.060
Now, the easiest way to
do this is to-- well,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.310
we have two constraints here.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.580
Let's solve for y
squared for the circle.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.170
And we could substitute that
in for y squared right here

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.920
and see what x values,
the intersect that.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.160
And then we want the
x value out here.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.177
So something that
looks like this value

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.260
is the one we want to use.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.970
Then we could figure
out the y value.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.890
The y value is going to be
the radius of our circle.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.090
The x value comma 0
will be the center.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.400
And then we'll
have our equation.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.860
So let's do that.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.360
So this up here, we have--
let me do it in yellow.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.986
So if we subtract x squared and
negative 8x from both sides,

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:00.360
the equation of
the circle can be

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.370
rewritten as y squared
is equal to-- I'm

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.940
going to add 8x to both sides.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.360
So it's 8x.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.690
And then subtract x
squared from both sides.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.780
8x minus x squared.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.980
I really just moved
to that and that

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.140
over to the right hand
side of the equation.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.890
Now I can take
this and substitute

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.150
for y squared in the
equation of the hyperbola.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.730
So the hyperbola's
equation is x squared

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.400
over 9 minus y squared
over 4 is equal to 1.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.780
Instead of running a
y squared over there,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.640
we know that it has to
satisfy this equation as well.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.420
So for y squared, I'm going
to put an 8x minus x squared.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.790
And let's see if we can
solve this right here.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.230
This is just a straight
up quadratic equation,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.620
although it might not
look like it just yet.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.560
Let's simplify this.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.220
So this tells us that x
squared over 9 minus 8x/4.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.352
So minus 2x plus x squared
over 4 plus x squared over 4.

00:06:03.352 --> 00:06:05.660
I just distributed
essentially the negative 1/4

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.970
over both these terms.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.370
Is equal to 1.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.180
Let's see, we can multiply
the whole thing times 36

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.430
to get rid of these fractions.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.590
So that's 4 times 9.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.870
So 36 divided by 9 is 4.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.500
So this is 4x squared
minus 36 times 2 is 72.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.660
72x plus 36 divided by 4 is 9,
plus 9x squared is equal to 36.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.280
These two terms right
here, we can add them.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.930
We get 13x squared, minus 72x.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.290
And then we could subtract
36 from both sides.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.510
So minus 36 is equal to 0.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.330
So now we just have a straight
up quadratic equation.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.050
We just have to find
the x's, find the roots.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.580
So let's use the
quadratic formula here.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.490
So x is going to be
equal to negative B

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.450
So that's negative negative 72.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.800
So it's 72 plus or minus the
square root of 72 squared.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.880
I'll just write that 72
times 72 minus 4 times

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.087
A times C. C is negative 36.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:14.920
So that negative, you
could put it out here.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.840
And just put the 36 out back.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.540
And then all of
that over 2 times a.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.920
So all of that over 26.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.080
So the hard part is
really to simplify this.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.120
But it looks like we have some
interesting stuff going on.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.307
So let me rewrite
this part over here.

00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:35.390
Let me write it over here.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:43.910
72 times 72 is the same thing
as 2 times 36 times 2 times

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.750
36, right?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.870
Each of those are 72.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.420
That's the same
thing as 72 times 72.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.400
And then we're adding to
that 4 times 36 times 13.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.040
And we're taking the square
root of this whole thing.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.420
I'm just doing the work
out here so we don't.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.390
waste this real
estate over here.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.900
Now we can factor
out a 4 times 36.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.480
This is 4 and this is a 36.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.570
So this is equal
to-- I know it's

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.490
getting-- let me write
it a little bit neater.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:24.960
This is equal to the square root
of, we can take a 4 times 36.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.460
And actually 4 times 36 is 144.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.290
I'll just write 4
times 36 right here.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.120
4 times 36.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.409
Now over here we use
the both 2s in the 36.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.980
So we have a 36 left.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.960
We use this 4 times 36.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.429
So we have plus 13.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:45.880
So this becomes the square
root of, 4 times 36 is 144.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.250
36 plus 13 is 49.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.370
So we're lucky that
it actually worked out

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.480
to 2 perfect squares.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.370
So this is the square root
of 144 times the square root

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:02.310
of 49, which is 12, times
7 or this is equal to 84.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:09.340
So this business over here
simplifies to 72 plus or minus

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.450
84.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.330
This whole thing over
here is simplified to 84,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.800
all of that over 26.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.634
Now if we were to
subtract 84, we

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:20.050
would get something
over here that

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.920
doesn't make sense
in this context.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.550
We're looking for something
a positive x value.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:34.520
So let's only consider the
plus 84 and see what we get.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.600
So the first thing to
do, actually let me just

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.710
divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:45.390
So this is the same thing
as 36 plus 42 over 13.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.190
And this is the same
thing as 78 over 13.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.437
And it looks like 78
is divisible by 13.

00:09:53.437 --> 00:09:58.280
78 divided by 13 is 6.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.310
This is equal to 6.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.570
So the x-coordinate here is 6.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.570
It's right there.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.760
So it's 6.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.600
We don't know what
the y-coordinate is.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.860
So let's do that.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.960
It's pretty easy to solve.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.330
We could substitute x equals
6 into any of these equations.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.860
This one is probably
easier right over here.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.520
So we get y squared
is equal to 8 times

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:28.070
6 is 48, minus 48 minus
36, which is equal to 12.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.610
And so y is equal to
the square root of 12.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.852
We could simplify that
radical if we want.

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:34.935
But we know the point now.

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:38.240
It's 6 comma the square root--
Sorry, this point over here

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.230
is 6 comma 0, but the
actual intersect, the center

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.460
is 6 comma 0, but the
actual intersection point

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.120
is going to be 6 comma
positive square root of 12?

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.190
And I should say this is
a positive or negative

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.560
square root of 12.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.150
And this row over
here is going to be

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.240
6 negative square root of 12.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.390
This right here is 6 comma 0.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.610
That's the center of our circle.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.330
So what's the equation of
this new circle going to be?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.440
What's the equation of this
new circle going to be?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440
Well we know its center.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.420
Its center is at 6 0.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.750
Let me write it down here.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.000
Its center is at 6 0.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.520
So it's going to be x minus 6
squared plus y minus 0 squared

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.020
is equal to the radius squared.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.280
Now what's the radius?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.700
The radius is this
height right over here.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.380
Or it's just equal to the y
value at the intersection.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.110
It's the square root of 12.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.050
Now this is going to
the radius squared.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.400
The radius is squared of 12.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.300
Squared of 12 squared is 12.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.490
So the equation is
going to be x minus 6,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.770
and see what form
they have up here.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.534
So they actually
multiply everything out.

00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:46.450
So let's just do that.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:52.280
So this is going to be x
squared minus 12x plus 36 plus y

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.310
squared is equal to 12.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.010
And then we could subtract
12 from both sides.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.240
Subtract 12 from both sides.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.460
And we get x squared minus
12x plus 24 plus y squared

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.390
is equal to 0.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.400
Let's see which of the
choices match that.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.370
Let me copy it.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.820
And then let me
paste it up here.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.550
Let me paste it up here.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.150
And it looks like we have
an x squared positive y

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:29.750
squared, a negative 12x
x and then a positive 24.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.340
Negative 12 x positive 24.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.860
So it looks like
our answer is a.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.630
Did I do that right?
x squared plus y

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.540
squared minus 12 x plus 24.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.710
Yep, our answer is a.
