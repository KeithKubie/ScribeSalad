00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.670
Alright, so we have installed, GitHub locally, which

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.865
gives us a place to put our files.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; We have an account, which gives us a place online to

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.690
have our files. How do we get them to talk to each other?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.330
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we're going to need to, sign in. So, let's go to Preferences.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt; Alright. So, yeah we want to Allow that. Sure.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.650
So that was something about how is sort of makes sure that it's us.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we can access any repositories

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.590
that we have here, but we don't have any yet.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.579
&gt;&gt; Right so,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.187
&gt;&gt; Go back.

00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:39.603
&gt;&gt; Were going to need to go actually get the repository

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:39.952
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:43.360
&gt;&gt; The original repository from GitHub. What

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.280
should I do? Search for that [CROSSTALK].

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.084
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:52.931
&gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:54.440
Okay.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.129
&gt;&gt; Alright, so we, so we found his repository.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.325
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:59.220
&gt;&gt; So there are two options here. We could clone it, which

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.020
means that we would just have a local version of his repository.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.370
Or, we can Fork it which means that we make our own

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.120
copy of the repository that we can then put on our local machine.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.540
&gt;&gt; Okay, and what should we do?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.800
&gt;&gt; Since I don't think we, we want to make any changes to his repository,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.190
I think we want to fork it so that we have our own totally separate one.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.282
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:19.607
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:22.873
I like.

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:23.691
&gt;&gt; It's forking it.

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.440
&gt;&gt; I like it. So I'm going to Refresh, and there we go.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.220
&gt;&gt; Alright, so now we have our own copy.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.050
&gt;&gt; That is cool. So these are all those files that I had copied and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.930
pasted before. The JavaScript files, the Style

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.820
files, and then this Index file. Very cool.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So now if we go back over here and refresh, it shows up.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.920
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.810
&gt;&gt; And we can clone it to our local machine. Alright,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.890
so we now have a copy of the repository on our machine.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.
