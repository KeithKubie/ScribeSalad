00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.963
When you look at a picture
with a certain degree of ambiguity,

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:06.606
your perception heightens it,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:10.678
and you try to figure it out
from all kinds of possible references.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.223
You don't know what it is,
and you are completely open

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.810
to any kind of way
of thinking about it.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.981
When I knew that
The Museum of Modern Art

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:24.031
was organizing
Stieglitz at Lake George,

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.735
I went to see it in an afternoon.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.740
That show got me in a mood
of looking for things in things,

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.950
which is something that you do
when you look at clouds

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.076
one way or another.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.788
And the beautiful thing
about Stieglitz's Equivalents

00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:40.875
is the fact that you're
always seeing forms in clouds,

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.001
in the Equivalents you don't.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.003
You just see clouds.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:51.886
I just saw the show,

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:56.658
and right after leaving it
you had these amazing marble floors.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.518
I kept thinking about clouds,

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.491
and when I left,
I looked at the floor,

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.126
and I saw all these clouds,

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.853
and then I took the camera
and I started shooting the clouds

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.360
right there, and this whole thing...

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:09.570
I remember, I used to work there.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.031
I was there,
I remember those floors well.

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:16.090
And then what I did,
I went to the gift shop,

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:22.430
and I got a piece of paper to draw
and a little pair of scissors,

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.703
and I made these little round things
that looked like the moon,

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.338
and I started shooting it there.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.716
And a security guy came
and tried to ask me what I was doing,

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:33.218
and I said, “No, I'm just
taking pictures of the floor.”

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.391
And then he was like,
“Ah, you cannot do this.”

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.223
I said, “Why not, I'm just
taking pictures of the floor.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.016
I mean, people take pictures
of the artworks and you don't mind.”

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.228
And I went out to the street,
I came back,

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.688
and I shot like four rolls of film.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:52.821
I wanted to make something
that looked just like a Stieglitz

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.658
but then it was just the floor
of the museum

00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.118
in front of the exhibition
where a Stieglitz was.

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:02.040
When you're dealing with something
that seems familiar to you,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.166
it's great because first of all
you're open to it,

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:07.753
and you look at it as something
that you want to see again.

00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:11.153
But then there's this double-take.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.706
You realize that that is not
what you thought it was.

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:17.843
That feeling is quite effective
in creating a lasting impression

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.306
and starting a conversation.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.268
And before you know it,
you're implicated in a series

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:25.355
of questions about
what's in front of you.

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.763
You're not just looking at something,
you're actually thinking

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.191
about the way
you're looking at something.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.276
This is the kind of interaction

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.655
that I want my works
to have with the viewer.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.493
When you think of photographs
as processes, not as products,

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.913
you start really understanding
what they really mean.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.128
My mother came to one of my shows,

00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:51.588
and the first time
she stepped into a museum

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:56.510
was to see one of my exhibitions,
so I make work for her.

00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:59.721
If she won't like it,
I don't think it's good.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.018
Maybe I am one of these artists
that don't take any pride

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.565
for not being understood
and being ahead of my time.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.458
I'm right here right now,

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.276
and I want people to get it
or to feel at least something

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.655
because I make work in a way,

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.323
I don't make it
for any specific public,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.075
and it has something for everybody.
