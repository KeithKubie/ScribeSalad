00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.240
- [Instructor] Hey, this
is Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.520
and today I'm learning about Article I

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.190
of the U.S. Constitution.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.730
Article I is jam packed
with information about

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.630
how our government is supposed to work,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.610
but principally what it does
is create the Legislative

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.181
Branch of government,
which includes the House of

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.580
Representatives, and the
Senate, which together,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.610
comprise the Congress
of the United States.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.630
Article I also tells us
how people can get elected

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.930
to those bodies, and
what powers Congress has.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.070
To learn more about
Article I, I talked to two

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.890
Constitutional experts.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.910
Ilya Somin is a professor
of law at the Antonin Scalia

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.770
Law School at George Mason
University, whose research

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.750
focuses on Constitutional
law, property law,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.940
and the study of popular
political participation.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
Professor Heather Gerken is
the Dean of Yale Law School.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.010
She's a leading expert on Constitution law

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.610
and election law, and
her research focuses on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.010
Federalism, diversity, and dissent.

00:00:57.572 --> 00:00:59.040
- [Dean Gerken] Article I
gives an enormous amount

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.530
of power to the legislative branch,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.190
otherwise known as Congress,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.610
and it was designed
specifically to overcome

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.223
some of the problems
that they'd seen under

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:10.031
the Articles of Confederation.

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.845
- [Professor Somin] The
legislative power under

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:13.228
the Articles of Confederation

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:17.510
was pretty weak, in part
because the Congress

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.440
under the Confederate articles
didn't have the authority

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.719
to directly tax the states.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.580
They also lacked a lot
of other powers that were

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.430
eventually given to Congress
under the Constitution.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.280
- [Dean Gerken] These were the
things that really mattered

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.380
if you're building a young nation.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.160
You need to be able to do
certain things in order

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.199
to protect it, especially
at that time, when there

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:42.940
were many, many other
countries that were circling

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.431
around wanting to grab the land and power.

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.964
And so the United States
needed to defend itself

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:50.457
in those early days.

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:52.050
- [Kim] Okay, so we
all know today that our

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.950
Legislative Branch is
made up of the Senate

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.610
and the House of Representatives.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.080
But it didn't have to be
that way, so why was it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.060
that the framers settled
on this two house structure

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500
for the Legislative Branch?

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:06.760
- [Professor Somin] I
think for several reasons.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.060
One is that it was a compromise
between the small states

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.940
and the large states.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.110
The large states, ones that
have a lot of population,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.750
wanted representation in
Congress in accordance with

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.650
population, obviously then
the large states would get

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.900
more representatives.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.330
The small states, on the
other hand, were concerned

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.350
that they would be dominated
by the large states if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.893
that happened, so in the
end, the compromise is

00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:33.960
you have one house, the
House of Representatives,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.634
which is largely apportioned
based on population,

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:42.488
and one house, the Senate,
which is apportioned

00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:46.270
based on each state having
two votes, no matter

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.260
how small or how large it is.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.090
A second reason why you
end up with this structure

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.030
is the influence of the British example.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.470
The British had both the
House of Commons and the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.110
House of Lords.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.920
And the House of Commons, of
course, being more subject

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.039
to popular pressure, while
the House of Lords were this

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.480
elite aristocracy.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.296
And the founders also wanted
a combination of popular

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:11.950
and elite power.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.280
And it was thought that
the Senate would fill that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.530
elite role, in part, because
initially the senators

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.480
were chosen by state
legislatures, rather than

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.740
by the voters directly.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.240
- [Dean Gerken] So the
House of Representatives,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.450
which is based on districts,
is supposed to represent you

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.486
based on where you live, and
the Senate, which is based

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:33.770
on states, is supposed to
allow, at that time, the state

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.778
legislature to nominate two
luminaries from the state

00:03:36.778 --> 00:03:38.310
to represent the state.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.510
- [Kim] So yeah, for a long
time, the senators were

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.460
actually appointed.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.920
Now they're elected.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.790
- [Dean Gerken] Senators were
appointed until the passage

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.060
of the 17th Amendment, which
amended Article I, and that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.210
gave state legislatures a
fair amount of influence over

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.440
who went to the national government.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.083
- [Professor Somin] But it
is also true that many states

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.690
by that time already
effectively had popular election

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.620
of senators.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.147
- [Kim] Really interesting.

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:03.330
Okay, so you described the
Senate as being kind of the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.900
American version of the
House of Lords, a little bit

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.050
more elite, a little less
subject to popular opinion.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.190
How does that carry over
into the Senate that we

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.023
have today?

00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:15.380
How are its powers different from

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.410
the House of Representatives?

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.430
- [Professor Somin] It does
have certainly different

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.320
powers from the House in some respects.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.950
For example, it has the
power to ratify treaties

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.750
and to confirm appointment
to the the Court and to the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.050
president's cabinet, so
earlier this year when

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.710
Neil Gorsuch was appointed
to the Supreme Court,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.350
he had to be confirmed by the Senate.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.030
Obviously today, the Senators
are elected just like

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.610
members of the House are,
and I think they're every

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.990
bit as partisan and almost
as sensitive to public

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.399
opinion as members of the
House of Representatives,

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.940
so the difference between
the Senate and the House

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.230
in that regard, maybe it
hasn't completely disappeared,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.610
but it's certainly greatly diminished.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.530
- [Kim] Okay so there are
certain powers that are

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.670
reserved to the Senate.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.663
Are there particular
powers that are reserved to

00:05:03.663 --> 00:05:04.980
the House of Representatives?

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.260
- [Dean Gerken] The House is important.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.970
Don't underestimate the
importance of the House.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.360
I'll just say the House
of Representatives,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.500
for example, is allowed
to initiate impeachment

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.210
proceedings against the president.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.810
- [Professor Somin] If
the House votes in favor

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.100
of impeachment, then
the Senate holds a trial

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.500
to determine whether
the official in question

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.810
gets convicted or not.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.630
- [Dean Gerken] As a
general matter, though,

00:05:26.504 --> 00:05:27.337
they're roughly co-equal.

00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:29.750
For the big, important things,
like passing legislation,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.150
you need both of them to work together.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.490
- [Kim] So together these
two houses make up Congress.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.124
So how is Congress different
from the Executive Branch

00:05:40.124 --> 00:05:41.950
or the Judicial Branch?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.810
What are its powers?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.440
- [Dean Gerken] The way that
the framers understood it

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.980
was that each one would
have their own job.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.410
So the judiciary, obviously,
was there to judge

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.817
disputes between people, to run
the court system, et cetera.

00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:57.880
The executive was there
to carry out the laws.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.380
And so the executive's job
is to administer the law

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.940
once it has been made.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.770
And of course the legislature
is there to legislate.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.610
So its main job was to make the law.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.820
And at the time, I will just
tell you, everyone thought

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.260
that the big gorilla in
the room was Congress,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.040
that it would be by far the
most powerful organization.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.731
The framers simply did not
anticipate how powerful

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.625
both the judiciary and the
president would become over time.

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:27.530
- [Kim] So what happens if,
for example, the Congress

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.978
and the president don't get along?

00:06:29.978 --> 00:06:32.184
- [Professor Somin] Well,
it happens quite a lot.

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:37.184
The president could refuse
to accept laws passed by

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.220
Congress, he could veto them.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.850
In that event, Congress
can only override it if

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.953
two-thirds of both the
House and the Senate voted

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:47.690
to do so.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.250
Congress, on the other hand,
can pressure the president

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.450
in various ways.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.540
They can hold hearings
investigating his conduct on

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.310
various issues.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.343
They can de-fund agencies
of the Executive Branch

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:03.290
whose job performance they don't like.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.380
They can refuse to confirm
the president's appointees

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.023
to various offices, and in
extreme cases, that have

00:07:10.023 --> 00:07:13.319
happened a couple of times
in our history, Congress

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:16.460
can even impeach the
president, and if he gets

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.400
convicted in the Senate,
then he would be removed

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.410
from office.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.580
This is what led to the
resignation of Richard Nixon.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.655
The House of Representatives
impeached him,

00:07:25.655 --> 00:07:29.810
and Nixon resigned before he
could be tried in the Senate.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.332
President Andrew Johnson
and President Bill Clinton

00:07:32.332 --> 00:07:36.438
were also both impeached,
and in both cases, the Senate

00:07:36.438 --> 00:07:40.520
ultimately acquitted
them, but it was still a

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.870
very painful time for
both of those presidents.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.430
- [Kim] So speaking of
antagonistic relationships,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.230
I think one thing that's really
come to dominate Congress

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.480
is partisanship.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.290
To what extent did the
Constitution anticipate this

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.480
rise of parties and partisanship?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.100
- [Professor Somin] They
actually knew about parties

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.040
to some degree from their
British experience, but they

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.280
were very suspicious of them,
and they hoped and perhaps

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.110
expected that they wouldn't
emerge in America to

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.860
anything like the same extent
that they had in Britain.

00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.550
But in actual fact, a few
years after the adoption

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.400
of the Constitution, we already
had the first party system,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.930
the Federalists and the
Democratic Republicans,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.863
and partisan alignments have
played a big role in Congress

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.410
ever since then.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.390
- [Dean Gerken] So even
back then there were rival

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.640
interpretations of how the Constitution

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.940
should be carried out,
and what kind of power

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.060
the national government should wield.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.950
But they somehow thought,
naively, I think, that the

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.768
parties would disappear
and that people would have

00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:44.030
allegiances to their
state or to their region,

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.210
but they wouldn't have
allegiance to a party.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.210
That broke down completely
almost immediately

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.230
after the Constitution was written.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.880
That leads to a real problem
these days, because most

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.180
modern Constitutions
recognize that there will be

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.650
two parties, that they
will be in competition with

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.070
one another, and that
part of the job of the

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.046
Constitution is to
regulate that competition.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.650
- [Professor Somin] Would
the founders have done

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.750
anything differently if
they had known about parties

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.210
and expected that they
would play such a big role?

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.130
It's hard to know for sure,
but maybe they would have

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.420
been less confident than some
of them were that Congress

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.030
would always stand up for
its prerogatives against

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.270
the president when the
president and Congress are

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.040
of the same party.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.008
I think often Congress
is inclined to overlook

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:34.920
various presidential abuses.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.350
- [Kim] If the reverse
is true, things might

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.840
be very difficult to do.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.673
- [Dean Gerken] Exactly.

00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:40.745
I mean the whole point about
them needing one another

00:09:40.745 --> 00:09:43.911
to act is really a problem
if one side is antagonistic

00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:46.260
to the other side.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.410
- [Kim] One other thing
we see here in Article I,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.322
is talking about kind of what
the Federal government does

00:09:51.322 --> 00:09:53.210
versus what the states do.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.880
So this is kind of the
idea of Federalism, then.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.180
Could you tell us a little
bit more, just about what

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.750
Federalism is and how
it's supposed to work?

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.090
- [Dean Gerken] So the
way that we understand

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.580
Federalism back then, was
that there was a division

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.450
of labor.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.990
The states would regulate
things that were inside

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.730
their territories, and
accorded to them in terms of

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.024
responsibility, and the Federal
government would regulate

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:18.370
everything that was accorded
to it under the Constitution.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.340
The problem is, as Congress'
power became more and more

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.624
expansive, it ended up
regulating the same areas

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.420
that the states regulate.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.180
- [Kim] So if the Federal
government and the states

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.650
have a law on the same topic, who wins?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.530
- [Dean Gerken] As long as
it's passed properly by the

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.350
Federal government, then
the Federal government wins.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.840
So if there's a Federal
law and the state law is

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.630
inconsistent with it, the
state law is displaced.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.540
- [Kim] Is there anything
that might surprise the

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.150
framers about how our
Congress operates today?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.610
- [Professor Somin]
When the framers created

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.560
Article I and drafted it,
they certainly expected

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.410
that Congress would have
more power under the

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.230
Constitution than it did under the

00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:02.100
Articles of Confederation,
but I don't think

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.070
very many of them would have believed

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.790
that Congress would ever
be able to do things like

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.880
forbid the growth of medical
marijuana in your backyard,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.670
or regulate what kind of
toilet you're allowed to have

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.400
in your house, or for that
matter, do something like

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.210
the war on drugs, which
forbids the possession of drugs

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.310
throughout the country, and the like.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.890
Originally the power to
regulate interstate commerce,

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.890
which is the authority under
which most of these things

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.190
are done, it was at the
time conceived of as a power

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.770
for Congress to break down
trade barriers between states

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.370
and perhaps regulate the
actual shipment or trading

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.701
goods and services across state lines.

00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:48.775
It was not until the 20th
century, particularly

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:52.510
after the New Deal, that
Congress was able to start

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.810
using this as a power
to regulate nearly every

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.900
aspect of human life that
might in some respect

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.720
affect the national economy.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.920
So that, I think, is a huge change.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.667
- [Dean Gerken] I think
what would really surprise

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.620
the framers is how willing
Congress has been to

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.040
give up its own power.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.680
So Congress has given the
president a lot of power,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.090
because it's created
administrative agencies

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.780
with vaguely defined
mandates that therefore allow

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.730
the president to use his
entire administrative agency

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.470
apparatus to pursue his goals.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.230
- [Kim] So we've learned that
Article I of the Constitution

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.530
establishes the Legislative Branch of the

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.472
U.S. government, which
is made up of the Senate

00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:32.500
and the House of Representatives.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.680
These two bodies were created
to balance popular power

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.400
with elite power, since
members of the House of

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.380
Representatives were directly
elected by the people,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.860
whereas senators were appointed
by state legislatures.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.610
Although one major change
is that senators are now

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.540
elected as well, what might
really surprise the framers

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.140
about Congress today is
how its power has evolved

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.973
over time.

00:12:54.973 --> 00:12:57.590
On one hand, as Heather
Gerken mentioned, the powers

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.627
of the president and the
Supreme Court have grown

00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:03.880
compared to the powers of
Congress, but on the other hand,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.440
as Ilya Somin points out, the
framers might be surprised

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.870
at just how much of our lives
Congress can regulate today.
