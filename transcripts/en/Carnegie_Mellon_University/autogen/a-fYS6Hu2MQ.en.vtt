so the first thing we're going to look
at is how to make characters and robots

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170
at is how to make characters and robots
 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.799
at is how to make characters and robots
really interactive and that means that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809
really interactive and that means that
 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.839
really interactive and that means that
there might not be a puppeteer in the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849
there might not be a puppeteer in the
 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.370

background actually choosing what

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380
background actually choosing what

instead it would really be measuring and
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.790

responding to the audience and to the
 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.380
responding to the audience and to the
children in the audience in particular

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390

children in the audience in particular
the reason I'm excited about the lab is

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519
the reason I'm excited about the lab is
 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.089
the reason I'm excited about the lab is
because the entertainment industry as a

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099

whole has basically not funded any
 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.830
whole has basically not funded any
research in academia and so this is a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840
research in academia and so this is a
 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.990
research in academia and so this is a
real opportunity to change that and

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000
real opportunity to change that and
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.149
real opportunity to change that and

a team with people in academia and they

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299
a team with people in academia and they
 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:44.850
a team with people in academia and they
think that that research that results

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860
think that that research that results
 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.649
think that that research that results
from that will be really valuable to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659

them in their business as well as to the
field making progress in the field as a

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949
field making progress in the field as a
 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:59.350
field making progress in the field as a
whole

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360
