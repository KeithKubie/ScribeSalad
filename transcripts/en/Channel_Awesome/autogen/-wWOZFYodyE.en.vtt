that it's mainly just a couple worlds
 

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.920
that it's mainly just a couple worlds
it's a couple characters um and if

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:33.930
it's a couple characters um and if
 

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.660
it's a couple characters um and if
you're fine with that you'll probably

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:35.670
you're fine with that you'll probably
 

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.829
you're fine with that you'll probably
like them okay

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839
like them okay
 

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:39.350
like them okay
you know and it is just sort of like say

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360
you know and it is just sort of like say
 

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.759
you know and it is just sort of like say
you know that the character is

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:40.769
you know that the character is
 

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:42.590
you know that the character is
eventually going to come to grips with

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600
eventually going to come to grips with
 

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.150
eventually going to come to grips with
who he is and everyone else is gonna

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160
who he is and everyone else is gonna
 

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.860
who he is and everyone else is gonna
come to grips with who he is and stuff I

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:45.870
come to grips with who he is and stuff I
 

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.650
come to grips with who he is and stuff I
think this is not a big shock um but I

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660
think this is not a big shock um but I
 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.329
think this is not a big shock um but I
thought the way they did it and the way

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339
thought the way they did it and the way
 

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:51.559
thought the way they did it and the way
they explained to it whether it was very

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:51.569
they explained to it whether it was very
 

00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:56.119
they explained to it whether it was very
well handled um so yeah I think that

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:56.129
well handled um so yeah I think that
 

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.189
well handled um so yeah I think that
sort of sums up you know who would like

00:09:58.189 --> 00:09:58.199
sort of sums up you know who would like
 

00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:01.100
sort of sums up you know who would like
it who wouldn't like it um like it's a

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.110
it who wouldn't like it um like it's a
 

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.509
it who wouldn't like it um like it's a
there's definitely not a big focus on

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519
there's definitely not a big focus on
 

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.569
there's definitely not a big focus on
the video game element in there it's not

00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:05.579
the video game element in there it's not
 

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:07.639
the video game element in there it's not
the focus I should say the main focus

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:07.649
the focus I should say the main focus
 

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:11.059
the focus I should say the main focus
the main focus is the characters uh so

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:11.069
the main focus is the characters uh so
 

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.360
the main focus is the characters uh so
yeah that's it for a wreck-it Ralph to

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.370
yeah that's it for a wreck-it Ralph to
 

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.650
yeah that's it for a wreck-it Ralph to
