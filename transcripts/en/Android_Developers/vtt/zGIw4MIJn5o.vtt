00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.350
SPEAKER 1: Huh, That's
a little bit better.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.850
Oh, hey.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm here to talk about
important changes

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.290
to notifications
in Android Oreo.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.630
Up until now, there hasn't
been a unified way for users

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.838
to have fine-grained control
over their notifications

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:12.930
for a single app.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.390
If you have different
types of notifications,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.490
there might be some the
user cares a lot about,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.850
and others that they are less
than thrilled to receive.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.370
Unless you've made custom
preferences for your user,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.980
the default user choice if they
don't want some notifications

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.580
is--

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.850
do I just want to turn off all
the notifications for this app,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.590
or do I just deal?

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.450
Having the user shut
off all notifications

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.060
is no good for you, and
it's no good for the user,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.130
if they miss an
important update.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.320
Shoot. where's my demo phone?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.290
O also introduces
notification badges

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.910
and other snazzy updates.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.170
But first, let's look at O's
new notification channels.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.640
Notification channels give
fine-grained notification

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.210
control with a consistent
settings UI to users.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.079
Here I am on my own device.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.620
I've just got a new notification
about a friend following me,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.510
[? Nyi. ?] I can
long press, and I

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.150
see that I have the option to
turn off the follower's channel

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.370
or take a look at
all of the channels.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.080
Notification channels,
which are also

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590
called notification
categories in the UI,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.300
are collections of
associated notifications.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.670
Every notification
in O needs a channel,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.470
or it won't even show up.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.620
For my new social local
app, I have two channels,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.290
one for all of the notifications
about follower updates,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.251
and another for direct messages.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.250
You'll want to separate
out your different types

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.920
of notifications into
different channels.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.240
You can further organize
notification channels

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.760
into channel groups.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.340
Channel groups let you group
notification channels together

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.360
in the UI.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.310
For example, you can
have a channel group

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.990
for your work
account notifications

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.690
and for your personal
account notifications.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.340
To set up a channel,
you simply create

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.980
a notification channel
object with a unique string

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.300
to identify it.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.760
You can add the default
settings for that channel

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.220
and submit the channel.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.500
If you want to add a channel
group, you can make the group

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.360
and then add it to your channel.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.460
Submitting a channel
is much like giving it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.122
as a gift to the user.

00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:02.580
Once you've submitted
the channels,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.920
the user now owns them
and has full control

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.780
over their
notification settings.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.789
As a developer,
you can no longer

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.710
modify the settings
of that channel.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.660
You can see what settings
the user has chosen,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.550
and you can make
suggestions, but they

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.350
have the ultimate control.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.360
Making channels is
important, because when

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.780
you make a notification,
you pass in the channel ID.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.970
In fact, you must
pass in the ID,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.310
or your notification won't
show up on O devices,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.870
and you'll get an error.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.650
In addition to
notification channels,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.610
Android Oreo introduces
notification badges, also known

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.440
as dots.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.880
The default behavior
for launchers

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.790
that support badges is this--

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.150
when there are outstanding
notifications for an app,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.385
I see this little circle
on my launcher icon.

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.340
I can then long
press to see a count

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.620
of all of the outstanding
notifications and swipe

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.850
through them.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.724
This new feature comes for
free for devices running O.

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:52.140
If you need more
control over when

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.300
to show badges to your
user or to control

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.250
the number of outstanding
notifications,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.420
there are options for you.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.950
So check out the docs.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.116
Finally, O offers a few
other cool notable features.

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:04.740
You can set the background color
for your forgone notifications

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.960
using the new
setColorized() method.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.120
You should only use this
for ongoing notifications

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.036
that are of the utmost
importance for the user

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:13.730
to notice at a glance, like
a notification I'm actively

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.895
using for directions.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.070
Some O devices now
support lock screen

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.070
ordering using the category,
priority, and associated

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.870
people for the notification.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.450
And the MessagingStyle
style now displays more

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.400
content in its collapsed form.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.707
There's also a
addHistoricMessage method

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:30.540
that lets you show a
little bit more context

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.830
for the conversation.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.140
We have a sample, code
lab, and documentation

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.980
to get you started.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.180
So take a look.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.830
