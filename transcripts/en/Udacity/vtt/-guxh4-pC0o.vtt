00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When there are backward slices, there are also forward slices.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A forward slice contains all statements that depend on a specific statement.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
As an example, let's come up with a forward slice

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of the initialization of the out variable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Very obviously, the final return statement is part of the forward slice

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because it reads from a variable which is set over here, namely, out;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
therefore, it is data-dependent on this earlier statement.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And, therefore, it's part of the forward slice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now for the quiz:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Which other statements are contained in the forward slice of S?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Check all that apply.
