00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.846
So, notice that we took our orange circle with the center at 0, 0 and we moved

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:10.322
its center to 20, 0. We also moved the other four points, so we can connect

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:15.763
them to form a new circle that's been shifted 20 units to the right. But what

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:19.738
I'm wondering is what's the equation that would represent this circle? We know

00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:23.886
we can't use this equation since it represents the circle centered at the

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:29.316
origin. We also know that this equation cant be right for our new circle since

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:35.660
if we plug in the points 70, 0 into the equation, it doesn't check. The x value

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.419
is too large. Keep in mind that this point was at 50, 0 and the y value still

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:48.174
was 0. But the x value changed to 70. Which made this too big, and it made our

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:53.324
equation not check. So what I want you to think about is, what would be the

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:58.795
equation for our new circle centered at the point 20, 0? I want you to enter

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:02.606
that equation here. Now I want to acknowledge that this is a really tough

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:07.134
question. You want to think about if the radius changed at all, or if the x

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:13.150
values changed or the y values changed. We need to adjust one of them. Which

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.679
one do you think we should adjust and by how much? Take some time to think

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.892
about it, and if you'd like, you can always play around on decimals and enter

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:24.906
your own equations to see how circles move. You're not expected to get

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:27.930
everything right on your first try, you're just expected to think and learn

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.410
about math.
