00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.347
- [Voiceover] Let f of x
equal three to the negative x

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:06.575
minus five, and g of x equals
negative x to the third

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:08.548
minus four x-squared plus x plus six.

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:11.520
The graphs of y equals f
of x and y equals g of x

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.397
are shown below, and we
see them right over here.

00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:17.042
This y equals f of x is
in that purplish color.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:21.756
Let me see if I can get
that same purplish color.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.607
So, that is, in that.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.045
So, let me underline it now.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:31.442
So, f of x is

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:33.160
in that purplish color.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.149
So y equal f of x, that's
right over here in purple.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.586
And then y equals g of x, that is in blue.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.443
So y equals g of x.

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:45.480
g of x is defined right over there.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.311
y equals g of x, well that
is graphed in the blue.

00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.029
And we see that they intersect

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:53.978
at the point a comma b.

00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:57.879
So there's a couple of
ways to think about this.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.828
We could say that when x is equal to a,

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:04.125
f of x and g of x equal each other.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.120
Or, we could say, f of a,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.604
and this is coming from
this point of intersection.

00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:12.344
Let me draw a little arrow here.

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:13.737
Or a big arrow.

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.586
That point of intersection lets us know

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.612
that f of a,

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:23.517
f of a is equal to g of a.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:27.827
Is equal to g of a, which is equal to b.

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:32.006
g of a, which is equal to b.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.513
They both, if you input
a into the function f

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:36.720
you're going to get b.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.438
If you input a into the function g,

00:01:38.438 --> 00:01:39.576
you're going to get b.

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:44.071
And so the point a comma
b is on both graphs.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.717
Both y equals g of x and y equals f of x.

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:48.635
And so from here, you could

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:52.582
make some interesting statements.

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:56.181
For example, you could just
say, well, what is f of a?

00:01:56.181 --> 00:02:00.329
f of a is 3 to the negative a power

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.584
minus five, is going to be equal to,

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:05.158
what's g of a?

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.350
g of a is negative a to the third

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.137
minus four a-squared

00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:15.782
plus a plus six, so you could say this.

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.218
And that would be equal to that.

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:21.865
Either of those would be equal to b.

00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:24.443
Alright, I think we've
analyzed that a good bit,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.811
so now let's actually
answer their questions.

00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.831
And normally I'd suggest
you look at the questions

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.644
before you actually try to solve it,

00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:32.662
but I just wanted to do this
just to really squeeze out

00:02:32.662 --> 00:02:35.768
as much as we could out of
the information they gave us.

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.020
So they tell us the value
x equals a is the solution

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.445
to which of the following equations?

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:40.908
Select all that apply.

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:43.299
So this first one is three
to the negative x minus five

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.646
is equal to b.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.332
Well, we already know that,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:51.170
we already know that three
to the negative a minus five,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.740
Three to the negative a minus

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.065
is going to be equal to b.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:59.130
Is going to be equal to b.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.846
This over here, this is
equivalent to saying,

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:05.120
this is equivalent to saying f of x,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.280
f of x is equal to b.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.832
And we know f of x
equals B when x equals a.

00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:14.501
When x equals a, f of x is equal to b.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.149
This expression is equal to b.

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.539
So we know that that first one is true.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.722
Now the second one is just saying,

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.592
f of x is equal to g of x.

00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:27.076
Well, we know that when x is equal to a,

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:29.630
f of x is equal to g of x.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.183
That f of a is equal to g of a.

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:35.925
Because, as a reminder,
this right over here

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:38.363
is our definition for f of x,

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:43.357
and this over here is
our definition of g of x.

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:45.835
So this is just saying
f of x equals g of x,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:46.926
when does that happen?

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.807
Well, that happens when x equals a.

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:49.852
We already saw it up here.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:51.867
f of a is equal to g of a.

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:54.022
They both equal b.

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:55.461
And so both of these are going to be

00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:59.246
equal to each other when x is equal to A.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:02.915
So I will check that one as well.
