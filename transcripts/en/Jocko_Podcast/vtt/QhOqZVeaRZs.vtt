1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.540
I have been somewhat of a pushover for the majority of my life since listening

2
00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:06.850
to the podcasts,
I've been trying to assert myself more.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.690
One thing I can't seem to shake is constantly being interrupted.

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.310
How can I rise above and overcome this obstacle?

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
<v 2>Should I re read the Hashtag Hashtag fellow hardcore kid,
hey,</v>

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.440
there you go.
Hey,
we'll party park.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.060
And there's a little layer in there cause he put rise above in there.
So sure.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.360
You know,
I,
so I thought about this because

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
I would say I don't get interrupted a lot.
Yeah.
But I don't,

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.150
I think that's kind of the current state of me.
Sure.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
And I think there's a reason why I don't get interrupted a lot.

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.510
And it's not because you know,
people are going to think,

14
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.130
oh well that's because you're going to bash people in the head with a club.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.280
That's not the actual answer of why look uninterrupted.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.620
So one thing I think is important is,
you've heard me say this before,

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.300
the less people talk,
the more people listen.

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.050
So when I'm in a group of people that all want to talk and I don't want to talk

19
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:07.740
over each other and they want to cut each other off,

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.050
you get in that group right there.
I don't talk,
I don't talk.

21
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.710
I let there,
I sit there,
I listened to him and I plot.

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.451
Then I think,

23
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.451
and I put together my thoughts correctly so that when I do decide to say

24
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.610
something,
it's going to have impact.

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.583
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.090
<v 2>And then I wait for the right moment.
Right.</v>

27
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.390
Because if there's people that are bickering back and forth,
okay.

28
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.550
I wait for a lull in the fire

29
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.600
and when that low combs,

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.370
then I make my point in a very direct manner.
I might even,

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.360
I might even have to wait until the conversation is like all but over.
Hmm.

32
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.730
Wait until they're done with their little firefight.
Get p.
P.
P.
P.
P.
P.

33
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.570
P.
P.
Yep.
Yep,
Yep,
Yep,
Yep,
Yep,
Yep,
Yep.

34
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.480
And then I'm going to talk and they're done.
And what I,
when I talk,

35
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.380
you know I'm going to do it.

36
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.100
Since I've been thinking about it's going to be articulated in a way that I can

37
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.870
present my full point.

38
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.990
And so I think that's an effective way to do things I think.

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.080
I think if you let people speak a bunch,

40
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.430
you let them get it out of their system and then when you decide to talk,

41
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.250
they don't have anything left to say.
So that's a way to stop getting caught off.

42
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.960
So this is almost like flanking,
right?

43
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.520
This is flanking the fact that when people have a bunch to say and they got all

44
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.500
these thoughts in their head and they want to get them all out,

45
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.200
let him get him out.
Don't try and fight that battle.

46
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.890
They've got a bunch of things they want to say.
Let him say it.
Also,
as we know,

47
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.410
when you listen to someone else talk

48
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.663
<v 1>it</v>

49
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.450
<v 2>you,
you now know what their ideas are.
Yeah.
You know what they're thinking.</v>

50
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.110
There's a power and not saying anything because it allows you to think and it

51
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.610
allows you to hear what other people think.

52
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.150
And it allows you to hear other people.

53
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.240
So in a conversation you get to hear other people's counters to what people are

54
00:02:58.241 --> 00:02:59.770
saying and you're not,

55
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.150
you're not having to expend any ammunition yourself.
Someone else is doing it.

56
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.760
You know about the third or fourth or fifth piece person in the conversation

57
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.410
that's expanding ammunition and running their mouth to try and counter some

58
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.290
point that someone's made.
Let them do that.
Because by the way,

59
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:15.970
then you get to see what the other counter is.
Hmm.

60
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.810
So I think being assertive doesn't mean talking more.

61
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.260
I think being assertive means talking less,

62
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.390
talking at the appropriate times,

63
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.540
monitoring and understanding the firefight that's happening so that when other

64
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.980
people have expended their ammunition,

65
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.290
you can step in and you can take your shots.
You in know simple,
clear,

66
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.090
concise manner.
That's what I think.
Yeah,
I think you're right.

67
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.670
I think you built up this reputation though.

68
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.700
That's in the little added element to your specific situation,

69
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.320
which is where when you talk it like you're not saying fluff,

70
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.690
you know you're,
you know when you talk it's like something,

71
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.890
well that's a good point.

72
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
So if you don't want to get caught off and 70% of the things that you say aren't

73
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:12.130
really that impactful and don't add a lot to the conversation while then there's

74
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.790
a good chance that when you say open your mouth to start talking,

75
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.470
someone else doesn't think it's gonna be important.

76
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.250
So they just jump right on top of you.
But if you say less and to your point,

77
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.450
if the things that you say generally are well thought out and clear and are

78
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.440
going to have impact,

79
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.910
well then we have a good chance that you're not going to be cut off because

80
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.580
people actually want to hear what you're going to say.
Yeah.

81
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.630
Don't talk just to talk ever.
Yeah.
See.
And that's a hard,
I shouldn't say ever,

82
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.690
but hardly ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:43.770
That's a hard one because it,

84
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.620
and it's not like people are interrupting you on purpose because you don't have

85
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.740
nothing to sit,
you know,
like you're just talking fluff.
That's nice.

86
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.530
Not a conscious on purpose thing.
A lot of the time I think anyway,

87
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.300
it doesn't feel like it is.
Um,
it feels like it's like subconscious,
you know,

88
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.110
like how can someone see fit to actually follow through with interrupting

89
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:06.070
somebody if they don't think like,
okay,
this isn't quite that important.

90
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.110
At the very least,

91
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.300
the very least what I'm about to interrupt with is more important.

92
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.600
So some people think that what they're about to say is really important.

93
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.740
Here's another thing,
it's like the little boy that cried wolf.
Right?
If I,

94
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.410
if I talk and talk and talk and talk and talk,

95
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.010
I'm taking away the value of each one of those statements that I make because

96
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:29.440
I'm making so many statements that not all of them can have a high level of

97
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:33.010
value.
So w w w who do you,

98
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.540
who do you pay more attention to?
The person that makes a hundred statements.

99
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.640
Yeah.
And what are those?
Okay.

100
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:41.380
Let's say you want to pay attention to the person that makes a hundred

101
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.070
statements.
How much can you pay attention to those hundred statements?

102
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.580
How much do you,
how much do you gather from those hundred statements?
Yeah.
Well,

103
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.290
it's a limited amount.
Yeah.
It's 1% per statement,

104
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.470
right?
What's the one person you have to fool you think?

105
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.570
I make some general statements at the 1% per statement.

106
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.400
If the person says one thing,
how much percent do you pay attention to that?
Oh,

107
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.050
that's right.
You said 100% so there you go.
Yeah,

108
00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:09.400
it makes sense to check.
