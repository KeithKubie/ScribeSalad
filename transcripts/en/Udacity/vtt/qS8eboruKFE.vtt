00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.650
Our extracted DNA sample that's been amplified, so

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.280
we have enough of our sample to do

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.710
something with. are we ready to go sequence

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.780
it now, is that what we're going to do?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.050
&gt;&gt; So the the process that your DNA undergoes at 23Me

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.240
is a little different to sequencing.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.980
It's called chip hybridization or genotyping.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; And so how does this differ from sequencing? What's the difference between

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.310
sequencing and sort of, what you mention is sort of chip hybridization or

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.360
for, for genotyping? So you can think of sequencing

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.070
as just reading the genome from beginning to end

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.760
almost, you want to know every single letter and what

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.840
it is. With genotyping, we actually decide beforehand which

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.210
parts of the genome, which letters are interesting to

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.010
us. And then we specifically look at those letters,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.910
with the knowledge that these are the letters that

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.440
maybe cause diseases or are associated with some, trait that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.810
you have.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.670
&gt;&gt; I see. So, so you actually have to put a lot

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.630
of thought into it beforehand to sort of know exactly which positions, which

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.850
bases, which letters you're interested in.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.610
How, how many letters do you actually,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.070
or how many bases do you look at in, in an individual sample?

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.672
&gt;&gt; So we look at about a million, on the current 23andMe chip. that

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:15.640
means that when you get your results back from us you can download a million

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.810
different calls or base pairs from us.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.985
&gt;&gt; Sequencing sounds like it gives you a lot more information. what are

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:26.660
the prohibitive aspects of sequencing? Why doesn't

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.320
23andMe do sequencing? Yeah, sequencing is definitely

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.070
the future of this field, and we we're definitely interested in sequencing when

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.910
it gets cheap enough, but the main advantage of genotyping is cost. so we know

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.880
that to get the same results that we get with the 23andMe chip, we would have

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.630
to charge at least ten times more with

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.330
the sequencing product. Probably a lot more, I don't

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.910
know. Genotyping has other advantages as well, we,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.610
because you genotype using the process of hybridization,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.290
you actually get a lot of different shots

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410
on goal if you like. You get to hybridize

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.050
different molecules. many times.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.255
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:12.530
&gt;&gt; And you get the, the sum of all of those.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.620
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.010
&gt;&gt; Or the average of all those reads. So you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.020
get a lot of information compiled into one data point.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.450
With sequencing you might actually miss the part of the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.430
genome you were interested in. And that could be a problem.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.310
&gt;&gt; I see. So in, in a way you kind of have Higher confidence,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.800
even though you have maybe more limited

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.540
information in the end, you have a higher

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.910
confidence about the actual, you know, letter or base result for that position.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.130
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and some people describe genotyping as almost like

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.040
single base sequencing, where we're seq, we're sequencing hundreds of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.730
thousands of molecules. On each part of the chip. So

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.390
there's an advantage there that's hard to replicate with sequencing.
