00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.840
Movies have the power to make an audience
believe an actor has always looked a certain

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
way.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.590
Take, for instance, Kelsey Grammer in the
X-Men films.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.040
With a bit of makeup and some prosthetics,
you truly believe he could have been a blue,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.869
beastly mutant at one point in his life.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840
The reality, however, is slightly more complicated.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.380
It takes more than just the clothing and a
hint of makeup to make a costume come alive.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.720
Whether the outfit is CGI or handcrafted by
a costume designer fans always remember the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
greats.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.380
Check out these 10 shocking facts you didn’t
know about your favorite movie costumes.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.680
Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War
Wakanda is one of Marvel’s most technologically-advanced

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.360
countries in the world, notable for its massive
supply of vibranium—the same metal found

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.370
in Captain America’s shield.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.820
But what you probably didn’t know is the
durable and powerful metal is also found in

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.550
King T’Challa’s Black Panther suit giving
him one big advantage in Captain America:

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.550
Civil War.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.200
Actor Chadwick Boseman spoke in detail about
the Black Panther costume revealing to Entertainment

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.130
Weekly that the infused suit absorbs attacks
from an opponent.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.450
That explains how Black Panther stood perfectly
still while being shot at by police in a helicopter

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.489
in “Civil War.”

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.781
Catwoman in Batman Returns
A popular figure in DC Comics, Catwoman has

00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:12.600
been featured in most media adaptations related
to Batman (most recently in 2012’s The Dark

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Knight Rises).

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.899
But arguably Selena Kyle’s finest moments
came in Tim Burton’s 1992 Batman Returns,

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.749
which had Michelle Pfeiffer step into the
role.

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:22.950
While Pfeiffer’s sexy and sleek outfit gave
the appearance of latex, it actually took

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.590
a little more work to get that glossy and
sheen look.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.009
When Pfeiffer put on her cat costume, the
costume department used big sponge brushes

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.729
to lather her in a thick silicone.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.139
Costume designer Mary Vogt has stated the
process was messy but the final look was perfect

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.159
giving the actress a fluid and elegant look
with a hint of grunge.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.679
Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands
This Tim Burton film featured an almost unrecognizable

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.990
Johnny Depp with tight and creaky leather,
a wild mess of hair and the scissors for hands,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.990
of course.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.670
The look came together to give Depp a Frankenstein,
American goth feel but with the art came a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.119
bit of suffering for the actor.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.780
To ease some of Depp’s pain the director
and costume designer installed a special cool

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.179
suit that would stop him from overheating
in the Florida sun on those long shooting

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.179
days.

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.899
Despite these efforts the actor would still
rush over to special fans to cool down after

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.509
a shot.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.530
Viggo Mortensen in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
Peter Jackson’s epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien’s

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.200
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy features the
rugged character Aragorn (played by Viggo

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
Mortensen).

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.060
When initially introduced, the character had
a distinctive look of a grungy and rough man,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.760
which is exactly what Mortensen wanted.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.150
The actor wanted to give his costume the lived-in
appearance and took it upon himself to make

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.150
that happen.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.099
He reportedly took his outfit home, then lived,
breathed and sweated in it until it looked

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.680
as beaten and battered as possible.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.959
He even repaired the costume whenever it needed
it.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.120
Mortensen’s efforts paid off, as the actor
not only delivered a breakout performance,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.230
but looked 100 percent the part doing it.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.379
2 Fellowship actors wore no prosthetics in
Lord of the Rings

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.549
Almost all the actors in Lord of the Rings
wore prosthetics to create the look of their

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.040
various fantasy races.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.360
Among the many used in the films were the
pointed elf ears that were worn by both Cate

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.120
Blanchett (Galadriel) and Liv Tyler (Arwen).

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.569
Hairy hobbit feet worn by Elijah Wood (Frodo
Baggins) and Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.569
much more.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.069
However, two members of the nine in the fellowship
managed to go prosthetic free.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.219
Both Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean (Boromir)
wore no latex additions to their costumes—this

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.640
is because they were playing humans.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.510
Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight
Heath Ledger will arguably remain the best

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.599
Joker to grace the screen in Christopher Nolan’s
Batman adaptation.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.810
The actor went to great lengths to get in
the right mindset of the psychotic clown in

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.810
The Dark Knight.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.190
He locked himself in a hotel room for a month
and worked on his character’s voice and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.390
personality, all while keeping a diary to
chronicle the Joker’s thoughts.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.540
He even designed the Joker’s makeup using
mascara and grease paint.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.860
Ledger said Sid Vicious and the thugs in Stanley
Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange inspired him.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.819
While the costume designer Lindy Hemming looked
to musicians such as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.129
and Johnny Rotten for inspiration on wardrobe.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.719
Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy
Would you believe that Darth Vader’s costume

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.359
was based on a gas mask, a motorcycle suit
and Nazis headgear wore during WWII?

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.959
Costume designer John Mollo fused elements
of various real life uniforms associated with

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.310
war and evil to bring Vader’s look to life.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.109
Aside from the Nazi gear and leather attire,
the costume designer also added in elements

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.680
from a monk’s cloak found in the Middle
Ages department of a costume warehouse and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.189
that gave us the iconic villain the original
Star Wars trilogy: Darth Vader.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.049
It’s also worth noting that his helmet isn’t
the only German army reference in the films.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.650
Vader’s army of Stormtroopers are named
after specialist German soldiers in World

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.160
War I.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.520
Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man
Before Tom Holland took the mantle as Spider-Man,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.720
a young Tobey Maguire stepped into the red
and black lycra costume.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.850
Well, apparently there were 70 versions of
the Spider-Man suit made for the films.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.500
Costume designer James Acheson created 70
different versions of the famous costume while

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.000
trying to find the right perfect way to get
the webbing to stay on and remain flexible.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.570
According to Movie Pilot, Acheson recalled
a disastrous time when the everything on the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.940
costume went belly up.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.810
Speaking to Imaginary Worlds, Acheson said:
"We had a stunt man on a wire, and they flew

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.200
him straight into a tree and the whole suit,
I mean, half the webbing unglued from the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.970
suit, I mean it was sort of like a terrible
waffle hanging in the trees.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.110
It was a disaster.”

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.850
Luckily we now have amazing CGI capabilities
to keep those details in place.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.480
Harry Potter and the wizard wands
Every wand seen in any of the eight Harry

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.770
Potter films has been created on-site, which
include the few Daniel Radcliffe has worn

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.770
out.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.840
Just like in the books, no two wands are alike.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.000
Most of the wands have remained the same throughout
the films staying a consistent 13-15 inches

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.380
long just like in the books.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.220
This means characters have grown into their
wants over years of filming.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.470
Dumbledore’s (Michael Gambon) wand has remained
the same throughout all the films even before

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.600
fans knew of its significance as the Elder
Wand.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.480
Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine claws
Wolverine’s adamantium claws are as iconic

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.090
as the characters sideburns.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.110
Visual effects supervisor Tim Crosbie spoke
to Fxguide about the practicality of those

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.880
unique claws saying: “Those metal claws
are pretty sharp, you can put an eye out pretty

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.530
easily - they are polished aluminum.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.350
They had to be sharp otherwise they wouldn't
play properly in close-up.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.460
But only a certain level of stunts can be
done with them, beyond which even the slightest

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.160
bump can cut his knuckles - so that's where
CG takes over.”

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.400
Beyond CGI, Jackman would sport plastic claws,
rubber claws and even small two-inch long

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400
stubs.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.040
What do you think of our list?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.960
Are there any shocking costume facts we missed?
