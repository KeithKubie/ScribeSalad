00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.469
- Yolk and squid.

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.076
And I don't know if anything
could get better right now,

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:05.159
in the world.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.301
This is an absolute dream
come true on a plate.

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:13.884
(bright music)

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.626
Good morning everyone,

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.671
it's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Barcelona, Spain.

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:25.838
That bed is just insane,
it's like a giant pillow.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.466
I slept so comfortably.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.946
We're gonna go to breakfast,
have a quick breakfast,

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:34.703
and then we have a full day
ahead of us in Barcelona.

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:37.045
- Would you like to go here or there?

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.212
(bright guitar music)

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:44.954
- We just came down to breakfast,

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:47.771
and I didn't have a chance to
explore this area downstairs

00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:51.271
yesterday, but this is
a really nice place,

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.967
and there's even a library.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.223
It is a very heritage historical building.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.471
I was reading about it.

00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:00.469
But we have come to
breakfast this morning,

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.125
and I'm trying to hold myself back,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.487
I'm going easy, just
got some pieces of jamon

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:10.227
and some vegetables, because very soon,

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:14.268
we are going to La Boqueria,
which is a gourmet market.

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:16.495
But how could I resist that jamon,

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:18.772
the different cuts of jamon.

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:22.939
Okay, this is just some of
the finest ham in the world.

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:33.727
Yeah.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.093
It's just amazing.

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.343
And this one is like a much leaner one.

00:01:46.518 --> 00:01:48.906
That was some seriously good jamon.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.730
Oh, I love it so much.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.854
And now just walking around.

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.342
They actually have a library,

00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:56.213
and old library within this hotel,

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:58.145
and I'm really impressed.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.977
Everything is just so
incredibly well-decorated

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:06.144
and designed, and yeah, the
interior design in here is...

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:17.803
We made it to La Rambla,

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.204
which is a street right
in central Barcelona,

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:23.583
and it's one of the most
famous streets in the city.

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:26.441
A very wide walking pedestrian street,

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:30.501
lined with trees, there are
cafes and restaurants and stores

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.021
and souvenir shops on this street.

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:36.707
And at the moment, in
the morning at 8:30 AM,

00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:38.856
it's nice and quiet and relaxing,

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:41.197
but I know later in the day this street

00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:42.908
will get extremely busy.

00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:45.492
If we keep following the La Rambla street,

00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:47.070
we will get to La Boqueria,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.599
which is one of the
destinations in Barcelona

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.182
that I am looking
forward to visiting most.

00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:01.713
We have just arrived to
Mercat de la Boqueria.

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:04.912
And for any food lover
such as myself and you,

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:07.617
this is a dream come true.

00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:09.633
This is a pilgrimage destination.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:13.555
(speaking in Spanish)

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:16.322
As I saw, a couple of seats are open

00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.158
at a place called Pinoxto.

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.302
We decided to immediately sit
down to have something to eat

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.654
before exploring the market more,

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:24.338
because I know this place will pick up

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:28.255
and it will get really
busy throughout the day.

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.919
This is a tapas bar,

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.903
so they offer a lot of
different combinations

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:38.211
of many different things.

00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:40.923
But the main thing I wanted to
tre here for breakfast today

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:44.317
is garbanzo beans with blood sausage.

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:45.564
I didn't know how it would come actually,

00:03:45.564 --> 00:03:48.719
but the garbanzo beans
and then the morcilla,

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.843
which is the blood
sausage, is all mixed up

00:03:50.843 --> 00:03:53.399
and kind of blended
in, and then there are,

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.608
you can see little bits
of chiles in there,

00:03:55.608 --> 00:03:57.745
you can see the, oh, that oil!

00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:01.412
And you can see maybe
some cilantro as well.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:09.367
Wow.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.124
That is awesome.

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:15.457
Those garbanzo beans are so,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.472
they're starchy, but so smooth.

00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:21.980
And then pretty salty.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.808
You can taste an herb,
something like rosemary

00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:27.296
within there as well.

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:29.970
It's definitely a little
bit on the greasy side,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.981
but it is delicious.

00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.564
That is, that is extraordinary.

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:40.850
Oh yeah.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.278
And also what I love about it

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:45.361
is the quality of salt that they use.

00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:49.144
It's salty, but at the same
time you can taste that

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:50.788
that salt is such good quality,

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:54.621
that it just, that it's
okay to be that salty.

00:04:56.248 --> 00:04:58.180
Oh, this cup of coffee is hard to hold

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.920
because it doesn't have
a full finger holding.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.753
Okay.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:08.873
Well what a combination.

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:11.596
And also they had a number of
different types of omelettes

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:15.009
up on the counter, so we
got an eggplant omelette.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.759
Look at that glisten.

00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:21.382
Nice slices of eggplant within the egg.

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:27.341
The eggplant flavor is so well-pronounced.

00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.052
It tastes like, yeah,

00:05:29.052 --> 00:05:32.577
like slices of really smokey eggplant.

00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:35.817
The texture of the egg is
almost a little bit rubbery,

00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:38.910
but in a very good kind of way.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.410
That is delicious.

00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:43.284
Wow.

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:45.811
What a breakfast.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:51.699
And then also the coffee
here is really good as well.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.116
I'm on my last sip of coffee.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:56.944
My friend Chris English, he recommended

00:05:56.944 --> 00:05:58.815
this dish for breakfast right here,

00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:01.611
he said it was the breakfast
of champions in Barcelona.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.544
And I feel like a champion
after eating that.

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.044
Oh, that was good.

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:17.284
This is an incredible,
extraordinary market.

00:06:17.284 --> 00:06:21.303
So many beautiful colors
of fruit, fresh vegetables.

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:25.433
There are stores selling all
sorts of jamon and sausages,

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:28.535
and preserved meats, and also fresh meats.

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.188
And then there are just restaurants

00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:31.485
where you can sit down to eat,

00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:32.795
like that bar where we just ate,

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:34.892
mixed throughout the entire market.

00:06:34.892 --> 00:06:37.302
Wow, this is like all things good

00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:38.906
under a single roof.

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:43.073
And just look at the amount
of fruit, and the displays.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.923
Oh, oh.

00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:49.340
And look what I'm coming up on right now.

00:06:58.991 --> 00:07:01.805
There's another tapas bar
that I wanted to sit at

00:07:01.805 --> 00:07:03.180
before it gets too busy.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.848
And so we walked around for a little bit,

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:06.192
and we just sat down.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.064
They give you a checklist menu.

00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:10.777
The one thing though I have to eat here,

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.720
I think it's this one here.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.144
The fried eggs with the baby squid.

00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:17.227
That is an absolute must.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.589
This place is called
El Quim de la Boqueria,

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:31.464
and this is a legendary
bar, counter tapas place

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:32.320
in the market.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.655
I'm having a little bit

00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.361
of a food mental breakdown right now.

00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:39.308
This place is absolutely incredible.

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:40.763
This entire market.

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:43.096
Oh, here comes our, gracias.

00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:45.747
Oh yes.

00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:47.434
Our first dish has arrived.

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:50.247
This is the main dish that I came for.

00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:51.497
Oh, that aroma.

00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:01.739
Oh, I just wanna bathe in that steam.

00:08:03.398 --> 00:08:05.328
The main dish that I came here for

00:08:05.328 --> 00:08:07.784
is the fried eggs with
the baby squid on top.

00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:09.996
And I saw them cooking it in the back.

00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:11.433
When they were cooking up that squid

00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:12.600
and also frying up the eggs,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.164
you could just see a flame of fire

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:16.074
shooting up into the stall.

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:19.696
The duo, or maybe even a trio
of fried eggs at the bottom,

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:21.580
and you can see the crispy edges.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.172
And then it's just piled
with all of those baby squid.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:27.029
The black ink has seeped out.

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.256
There are some very finely
shaved green onions on top.

00:08:30.256 --> 00:08:32.657
Okay, are we, oh, oh, the yolk,

00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:35.074
are with ready for this yolk?

00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:39.061
Oh, I am about the unleash the yolk.

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:42.427
(laughing)

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.499
Okay, yolk and squid and,

00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:49.755
I don't know if anything
could get better right now,

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:50.861
in the world.

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.544
I'm gonna attempt to get a
little bit of everything,

00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:57.544
and mix the squid in with that yolk.

00:08:58.912 --> 00:09:00.745
Okay, bite number one.

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:03.637
Oh, come back, squid.

00:09:11.127 --> 00:09:12.988
The creaminess of that egg yolk,

00:09:12.988 --> 00:09:17.155
but with that crispy, completely
caramelized egg layer.

00:09:19.753 --> 00:09:21.503
And then those squid,

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:26.406
I know I say this a lot
again, are so tender.

00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:31.829
This is an absolute dream
come true on a plate.

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:33.579
Or, within a skillet.

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:37.002
Wow, it's just so simple,

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:39.005
but so beautiful.

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:42.407
And look at all the squid heads,

00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:44.345
these are my favorite parts.

00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:46.686
Oh, so they sort of put it, oh, here's a,

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.612
here's an entire baby squid.

00:09:48.612 --> 00:09:50.529
Just eat it on its own.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.334
It's so tender.

00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:00.964
And then it has just a little
bit of a seafood-your flavor.

00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:03.002
And I saw the fresh green chiles,

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.919
and I could not resist.

00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:07.510
Oh wow.

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:12.607
I love the fried green chiles.

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:15.030
They're so good, so perfectly cooked.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.983
And they're like,
blistered on the outside,

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.035
but then the inside of those chiles

00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:24.274
are just soft, it's
almost like chile puree.

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:27.401
And then that salt, again the
salt is of such good quality,

00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:31.568
that although it's salty,
it's not salty in a bad way.

00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:33.734
It's so good.

00:10:37.706 --> 00:10:41.569
I could pop these chiles all
day long, they're so good.

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:44.152
And I also go another espresso.

00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:52.520
And I noticed there are a
couple of these little chiles,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.964
and I just had one.

00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:56.100
They're actually quite nice and spicy.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.888
I'm gonna add it, and I think they might

00:10:57.888 --> 00:11:00.792
have sauteed the squid
along with those chiles,

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:02.580
and just a few light spices.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.988
I'm gonna get that chile
on there with some squid.

00:11:05.988 --> 00:11:07.968
Oh, there's another chile, oh good.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.385
And making sure all that ink,

00:11:11.617 --> 00:11:14.124
making sure to scoop on

00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:16.549
some more of that sauce.

00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:19.466
This is just an extraordinary dish.

00:11:20.817 --> 00:11:24.558
And wait a few seconds
for that chile to kick in.

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:26.273
Oh, that chile is fantastic.

00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:27.749
I think it's a dried chile.

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:29.274
It has a kick to it.

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:32.607
And I can't get over these green chiles.

00:11:34.507 --> 00:11:35.340
Wow.

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:42.451
There must have been at least,
like, six or seven chefs

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.459
in the kitchen there.

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:44.839
Just such a tiny, tight space,

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:46.195
but they were all working together,

00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:50.362
cooking up incredibly delicious
food and fresh ingredients.

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:52.812
Oh man.

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.044
I'm in a little bit of a food shock.

00:11:55.044 --> 00:11:58.544
Overwhelming sense of delicious right now.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.521
Some of the fruit and vegetable stores

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:12.748
within this market are just insane.

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:15.129
Look at the beauty and the variety

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:18.656
of the different fruits
available at this shop.

00:12:18.656 --> 00:12:21.373
That is literally an entire farm worth of

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.585
a variety of different fruits.

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:25.699
After that food I am ready for a juice,

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:28.246
so I'm moving in on this stall here.

00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:31.291
Just stacks and stacks and cups of fruit.

00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:32.979
You can either buy fruit,

00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:35.164
which is cut up into bite-sized pieces,

00:12:35.164 --> 00:12:39.331
or over here they have all
sorts of different juices.

00:12:40.683 --> 00:12:42.778
After that salty food in the morning,

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:45.642
a juice sounds incredible.

00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:47.772
And I chose, it actually took me a while

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:49.642
just to look at all the
different signs here,

00:12:49.642 --> 00:12:51.023
there's such a variety.

00:12:51.023 --> 00:12:54.443
Almost every fruit that
is sold within this market

00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:57.276
at the fruit stalls, they
have made into a juice,

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.634
or a fruit salad.

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:01.418
I ended up going with one of
my favorite types of juice,

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:02.585
passion juice.

00:13:04.233 --> 00:13:06.836
And that's almost like a passion smoothie.

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.149
It's kind of thick,

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:11.816
and it almost has like
a pureed taste to it.

00:13:25.473 --> 00:13:27.457
I see these little cones of jamon,

00:13:27.457 --> 00:13:28.658
I just have to.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:31.417
(speaking in Spanish)

00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:32.539
I could not leave this market

00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:35.338
without trying some iberico jamon.

00:13:35.338 --> 00:13:37.921
This is just a beautiful thing.

00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:44.678
Yeah.

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:45.926
Oh it's so good.

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:48.296
Despite the white fat within it,

00:13:48.296 --> 00:13:51.307
it just melts in your
mouth, and then the meat,

00:13:51.307 --> 00:13:54.890
it's almost like slightly
jerky in texture,

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:57.515
and then just with every chew,

00:13:57.515 --> 00:14:02.155
it just releases more and
more porky oils and flavors.

00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:03.563
Oh.

00:14:03.563 --> 00:14:07.051
And there's nothing better
than eating jamon like this

00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:09.301
with a background of jamon.

00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:28.641
The Monument a Colom,

00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:31.380
which is the Christopher
Columbus monument.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.668
It is right at the beginning of La Rambla.

00:14:33.668 --> 00:14:36.020
And also right along the sea.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.516
And it was built in 1888 to honor

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:42.597
Christopher Columbus' first
voyage to the Americas.

00:14:42.597 --> 00:14:45.716
We are off now to walk
around the Gothic Quarter,

00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:48.485
and kind of make our way through the lanes

00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:51.812
to the Cathedral of Barcelona.

00:14:51.812 --> 00:14:55.312
(thoughtful guitar music)

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:12.767
And this is the old area of Barcelona

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:15.474
that dates back to the
medieval and Roman times.

00:15:15.474 --> 00:15:18.273
And some of the alleys
within the Gothic Quarter

00:15:18.273 --> 00:15:20.738
are literally like slot canyon size,

00:15:20.738 --> 00:15:22.418
they are so narrow.

00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:25.041
And there are restaurants and cafes,

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.962
there are boutiques and shops.

00:15:26.962 --> 00:15:29.682
But I really think the beauty of walking

00:15:29.682 --> 00:15:32.690
and discovering the Gothic
Quarter of Barcelona

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.658
are just the architecture, the buildings

00:15:34.658 --> 00:15:38.825
and these narrow lanes that
you can just get lost in.

00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:52.637
We were just kind of
aimlessly waking around

00:15:52.637 --> 00:15:54.856
but meandering our way through the lanes

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:56.312
in the Gothic Quarter,

00:15:56.312 --> 00:15:59.176
and we have come to the
Barcelona Cathedral,

00:15:59.176 --> 00:16:00.904
which I'm standing right next to,

00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:04.040
but I haven't even
gotten a far view of it.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.459
So we are close, we're gonna take a look,

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:08.584
and then probably after
we take a look inside,

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:10.849
maybe I'll try to go further for a view.

00:16:10.849 --> 00:16:11.682
Oh, here.

00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:13.033
Maybe I've just come to the plaza

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:17.200
where you can get a view
of the cathedral from far.

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:26.938
And it's right in the Gothic Quarter,

00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:28.951
but we got here right as
they closed for lunch.

00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:31.573
So I think maybe we'll sit down somewhere

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.780
for a little while, and then be able

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.222
to go inside once they reopen.

00:16:36.222 --> 00:16:38.167
Since the cathedral is
closed for a little while,

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:40.855
we've decided to go back into
the Gothic Quarter lanes.

00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:42.791
And there's a place I wanna check out

00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:44.455
for a quick bite to eat.

00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:47.622
(speaking in Spanish)

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:04.438
Cheers, thank you.

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:07.024
We just stopped into this
little family-run place,

00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:08.349
it's called La Pineda.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.021
And they are doing some
construction outside,

00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:14.173
so they have a temporary
sign on the outside,

00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:16.621
but then you come inside,
it's still fully open.

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:19.501
This is a beautiful little gem of a place

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:21.789
that Chris English recommended me.

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:24.413
Thank you Chris again
for the recommendation.

00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:26.676
But it's right here in the Gothic Quarter.

00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:28.676
They have legs of jamon.

00:17:31.124 --> 00:17:33.757
It's hanging all around the shop.

00:17:33.757 --> 00:17:36.669
There are jars of pickled items.

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:39.086
There are beverages all over.

00:17:40.237 --> 00:17:43.232
And I have just come in
here for a quick snack.

00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:47.232
I got a type of sausage,
and also some vermouth.

00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:56.579
I just got a cup, or a glass,
a little glass, of vermouth.

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:59.171
And this is an aromatic beverage

00:17:59.171 --> 00:18:02.004
with lots and lots of herbs in it.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.983
Wow.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:09.375
That's delicious.

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:12.458
Oh, it's sweet, but not overly sweet.

00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:17.075
It's very smooth, and you can taste like,

00:18:17.075 --> 00:18:18.899
a depth of different herbs

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:21.772
and aromatic ingredients within it.

00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:24.893
It's almost like an herbal
tea, but with a kick to it.

00:18:24.893 --> 00:18:28.246
And then I also got a
plate of botifarra blanca,

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:30.035
which is a type of sausage,

00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:32.534
and then also some little pieces of toast,

00:18:32.534 --> 00:18:36.701
I think with a little bit of
a tomato spread topping on it.

00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:38.602
This first.

00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:42.840
Mmm.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.638
Oh I think, oh yeah,

00:18:46.638 --> 00:18:50.522
can definitely taste a
lot of pepper in that.

00:18:50.522 --> 00:18:52.772
Put on some of the sausage.

00:18:57.384 --> 00:19:00.043
You can taste the tomato,
it's kind of like rubbed on.

00:19:00.043 --> 00:19:02.866
So it's crispy, but then it
has a little bit of a gooeyness

00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:04.783
from that fresh tomato.

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:08.157
That gives it a nice flavor.

00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:10.620
And follow that.

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:18.028
That is a fantastic combination.

00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:21.495
It's like being in a pantry of jamon

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:24.144
and pickled and canned items,

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:25.903
and there are cheeses.

00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:28.767
And antiques, there are bottles in here,

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:33.346
there are different types
of chorizo and sausage

00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.898
and hams and all sorts of things.

00:19:35.898 --> 00:19:39.304
Then there are packaged things.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:42.471
(bright guitar music)

00:19:53.054 --> 00:19:55.245
I am within the Barcelona Cathedral,

00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:58.334
which is known as the
Cathedral del Barcelona.

00:19:58.334 --> 00:20:01.421
It is a Gothic cathedral which was built

00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:04.781
in the early, or completed
in the early 1400s,

00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:07.069
but certain sections of the cathedral

00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:10.318
have since been added in previous years.

00:20:10.318 --> 00:20:13.624
And this is the cathedral that is the seat

00:20:13.624 --> 00:20:15.936
of the archbishop of Barcelona.

00:20:15.936 --> 00:20:17.554
I didn't know this at first,

00:20:17.554 --> 00:20:19.393
but in the morning it's free entrance,

00:20:19.393 --> 00:20:21.303
but if you come in the afternoon

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.297
from one to five I think,

00:20:23.297 --> 00:20:25.830
there is an entrance fee to get in,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.414
but I don't know when I'll have
a chance to come back again,

00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:31.650
so I decided to just come in.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.900
And now I'm walking around.

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:06.102
I pre-bought some tickets to
Sagrada Familia in Barcelona,

00:21:06.102 --> 00:21:08.620
so we are just jumping on the metro.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.340
Oh, here it is right now.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.437
And we are gonna get there by metro,

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:16.354
because we are in a little
bit of a tight time.

00:21:17.617 --> 00:21:18.746
It's pretty busy now.

00:21:18.746 --> 00:21:20.857
And in just a couple stops we will arrive

00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:25.024
to Sagrada Familia, but we
need to make one transfer.

00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:34.321
And immediately upon exiting the station,

00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:36.988
you turn around and there it is.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:42.535
Sagrada Familia, which was
designed by Antoni Gaudi.

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.929
It is one of the icons of Barcelona,

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.762
and it's an impressive, it's huge,

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:51.565
it's impressive to see in person.

00:21:51.565 --> 00:21:53.220
And last night I booked by ticket online,

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.748
so I have the tickets on my smart phone.

00:21:55.748 --> 00:21:58.665
And we're waiting in line to enter.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.950
Luckily with that online ticket,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.798
it just took about 10 minutes to get in,

00:22:05.798 --> 00:22:08.071
and I also got an audio guide.

00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:10.070
So I'm gonna pick up the audio guide.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.072
Hello.

00:22:11.072 --> 00:22:12.917
- [Employee] You can
get a audio guides here.

00:22:12.917 --> 00:22:15.069
But we ask only one
person to collect them.

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:16.469
- Oh okay, I will collect it.

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:18.198
I'm gonna start this audio guide,

00:22:18.198 --> 00:22:22.365
and I will give you all
some details as they come.

00:22:34.692 --> 00:22:38.444
How are you enjoying the audio guide?

00:22:38.444 --> 00:22:40.557
Gaudi designed the Sagrada Familia

00:22:40.557 --> 00:22:42.364
with lots and lots of windows,

00:22:42.364 --> 00:22:44.844
and within the arches and the domes,

00:22:44.844 --> 00:22:46.364
there are little windows,

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.989
and he wanted the entire basilica

00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:50.925
to be covered by natural light.

00:22:50.925 --> 00:22:52.637
So even though from the outside

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:55.597
it looks like such a
dark, Gothic structure,

00:22:55.597 --> 00:22:58.396
inside you come in and it's really bright

00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:01.211
and naturally lit inside.

00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:04.579
And this is possibly
the most stunning modern

00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:07.746
stained-glass window that I have seen.

00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:10.499
It just covers the entire wall.

00:23:10.499 --> 00:23:12.435
And I think right now the afternoon sun

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:14.308
is coming straight for it,

00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:17.347
and it is just illuminating
this entire area

00:23:17.347 --> 00:23:22.084
with colorful light of red
and orange and green and blue.

00:23:22.084 --> 00:23:25.141
Also on the ticket I bought
online, I got entrance to,

00:23:25.141 --> 00:23:27.475
there are two different
towers that you can access,

00:23:27.475 --> 00:23:30.051
and I got entrance to the Nativity Tower.

00:23:30.051 --> 00:23:31.547
To go up to the tower,

00:23:31.547 --> 00:23:34.880
you gotta put your backpack in a locker.

00:23:35.816 --> 00:23:39.293
It says that from the top, you
will discover a new dimension

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.685
of la Sagrada Familia and also
a superb view of Barcelona,

00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:47.212
so we are waiting on the
elevator to go up now.

00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:49.462
(laughing)

00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:55.271
And now climbing a flight of stairs,

00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:57.438
a narrow flight of stairs.

00:24:01.268 --> 00:24:02.877
There are towers all around.

00:24:02.877 --> 00:24:03.878
And this is amazing,

00:24:03.878 --> 00:24:08.412
I'm walking through this
little walkway bridge,

00:24:08.412 --> 00:24:11.791
and you can see amazing views of Barcelona

00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:13.608
to the left side here.

00:24:13.608 --> 00:24:16.454
You can see the construction
that they are doing

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.926
to the right side.

00:24:17.926 --> 00:24:22.014
And you can just see the
creative Gaudi architecture

00:24:22.014 --> 00:24:24.910
and design, as well as
the entire Barcelona.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.077
You can see the Mediterranean
Sea in the distance.

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:32.809
The way that the sun is shining,

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:36.552
you can see down below, the
shadow of the Sagrada Familia,

00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:38.719
and it looks like a crown.

00:24:39.993 --> 00:24:42.585
What is over the ledge?

00:24:42.585 --> 00:24:43.418
Whoa.

00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:48.501
It feels kind of like I'm in a dungeon,

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.998
but at the same time, like a castle,

00:24:50.998 --> 00:24:54.209
and like a church or basilica cathedral

00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:55.959
all at the same time.

00:25:05.586 --> 00:25:09.506
We have come to the most
insane spiral staircase.

00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:12.146
And there's a hand ledge on one side.

00:25:12.146 --> 00:25:15.522
But then there is just a
spiral that looks like a snake

00:25:15.522 --> 00:25:17.522
that just goes down...

00:25:17.522 --> 00:25:19.581
You'll be okay, don't look down.

00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:21.998
Just hold on to the handrail.

00:25:27.354 --> 00:25:29.858
I was debating whether I should
buy the ticket for the tower

00:25:29.858 --> 00:25:31.730
or just, they also have a ticket

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.728
that's just for the basilica,

00:25:34.728 --> 00:25:36.897
but that tower was well worth it.

00:25:36.897 --> 00:25:38.561
That was the best part.

00:25:38.561 --> 00:25:40.448
Ying felt a little dizzy coming down.

00:25:40.448 --> 00:25:41.281
- Yeah.

00:25:42.137 --> 00:25:43.659
- We are recovering.

00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:45.571
It's one thing to be so creative,

00:25:45.571 --> 00:25:47.562
and have an incredible imagination,

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:49.315
which undoubtedly Gaudi did,

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:52.803
but it's another thing to
come up with such a design

00:25:52.803 --> 00:25:54.562
that is actually functional,

00:25:54.562 --> 00:25:56.674
or that's actually architecturally

00:25:56.674 --> 00:25:58.494
or engineeringly possible,

00:25:58.494 --> 00:26:02.661
and Gaudi has designed an
absolute wonder of a construction,

00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:09.445
and it's marble from the
inside and the outside.

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:19.400
It's about 8:30 PM, we are
walking on our way to dinner now.

00:26:23.338 --> 00:26:26.642
This restaurant is called
restaurant Portoles,

00:26:26.642 --> 00:26:28.357
and this is a real classic,

00:26:28.357 --> 00:26:31.138
old style traditional restaurant.

00:26:31.138 --> 00:26:34.594
They have the menu
written just on the wall,

00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:36.630
they look like chalkboards,

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.709
and most people just walk up there

00:26:38.709 --> 00:26:41.149
to look at the menu on
the wall, but for us,

00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:45.869
they gave us a very nice picture
menu which is in English.

00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:48.669
This restaurant opens
for dinner at 9:00 PM,

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:51.712
and we got here about five
minutes early and grabbed a seat,

00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:54.130
and there were only a few tables occupied,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.815
people waiting already to eat here.

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.722
And now, it's like 9:05, yeah,

00:26:58.722 --> 00:27:01.055
9:05 exactly, and it's full.

00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:05.728
(speaking in Spanish)

00:27:18.747 --> 00:27:20.451
I just was flipping through the menu

00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:22.375
and just pointing to different dishes,

00:27:22.375 --> 00:27:25.290
and then he said, that was enough.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.114
This is sort of like a salad,

00:27:27.114 --> 00:27:29.722
but it's potatoes at the bottom

00:27:29.722 --> 00:27:32.458
and then it's strips of red chiles,

00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:35.208
and I think it's sardines on top,

00:27:36.094 --> 00:27:38.026
and then some kind of a sauce,

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:39.994
and then with some olives.

00:27:39.994 --> 00:27:43.994
Let me try to, I'll take
a little bit of everything

00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:44.994
in one bite.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.210
And get some, a lot of that sauce,

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.960
kind of an oil sauce.

00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:55.636
Mmm.

00:27:55.636 --> 00:27:58.147
You've got the starchy potato,

00:27:58.147 --> 00:28:00.897
the really creamy soft red chile,

00:28:02.596 --> 00:28:05.929
and then the salty, like, fishy sardine.

00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:10.020
Also got some roasted asparagus,

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.966
and then he served it with this sauce.

00:28:12.966 --> 00:28:15.549
Maybe try it on a couple first.

00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:26.253
Oh yeah.

00:28:26.253 --> 00:28:27.922
I love asparagus.

00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:30.386
And that's like a vinegar-y,

00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:32.969
kind of sour and peppery sauce.

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:38.126
This one, I think you pronounce it fideua.

00:28:38.126 --> 00:28:40.222
And this is similar to paella,

00:28:40.222 --> 00:28:42.243
but it is made with noodles.

00:28:42.243 --> 00:28:44.482
And there is some seafood in here.

00:28:44.482 --> 00:28:46.116
This looks fantastic.

00:28:46.116 --> 00:28:48.435
Oh, there's even squid below there.

00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:50.690
Let me just taste some of this.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.857
Oh, and I got a little
piece of squid in this bite.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.648
It's a little bit tomato-y

00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:01.824
and a little bit garlic-y,

00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:03.408
nice seafood in there,

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.741
good seafood flavor as well.

00:29:06.899 --> 00:29:09.363
And then also got some fried sardines.

00:29:09.363 --> 00:29:13.509
And I will go ahead and
squeeze the lemon on.

00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:15.842
Good generous dose of lemon.

00:29:24.774 --> 00:29:28.141
Those are hot and fresh and crispy,

00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:30.996
and you just can chew
right through those bones.

00:29:30.996 --> 00:29:34.075
Little fish like this,
like sardines or anchovies,

00:29:34.075 --> 00:29:37.303
they are just like pure nuggets of protein

00:29:37.303 --> 00:29:39.136
and omega fatty acids.

00:29:42.487 --> 00:29:45.542
On the menu, this is
called rollito de pollo.

00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:48.165
And it's some kind of a chicken roll,

00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:50.613
but I'm not sure what's within the roll.

00:29:50.613 --> 00:29:52.036
But it's a little roll.

00:29:52.036 --> 00:29:54.324
It looks like some kind of jamon

00:29:54.324 --> 00:29:58.491
or some kind of bacon-y meat
within this sauce on the side.

00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:03.190
And then are these mushrooms, or dates?

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.933
Oh, those looks like dates.

00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:06.514
And then yeah, okay.

00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:10.639
I guess I will cut into the chicken roll.

00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:11.935
Let me cut it in the middle,

00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:15.435
then we can find out what's on the inside.

00:30:19.564 --> 00:30:20.397
Cool!

00:30:20.397 --> 00:30:22.292
Is it stuffed with jamon?

00:30:22.292 --> 00:30:23.977
That looks like ham in the middle.

00:30:23.977 --> 00:30:27.324
I couldn't have even
guessed a better filling.

00:30:27.324 --> 00:30:29.824
Slice off an appropriate bite.

00:30:32.627 --> 00:30:35.127
Let me get some of that sauce.

00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:40.673
That sauce does look a
little oily, but wow!

00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:42.006
Put that on top.

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:47.935
Is that a, I think that's a seed.

00:31:00.074 --> 00:31:00.907
Wow.

00:31:02.645 --> 00:31:05.101
That tastes like it's filled with bacon!

00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:07.112
That is just awesomely good.

00:31:07.112 --> 00:31:08.520
Wow.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.008
Yeah, it tastes like maybe
ham or bacon in the middle,

00:31:12.008 --> 00:31:14.104
wrapped with chicken, and then,

00:31:14.104 --> 00:31:18.536
kind of like sauteed
probably in lots of oil.

00:31:18.536 --> 00:31:22.041
And that sauce has a little
bit of a sour touch to it,

00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:24.809
and then you can taste
just that cured meat

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:26.616
within the sauce as well.

00:31:26.616 --> 00:31:27.944
That is insane.

00:31:27.944 --> 00:31:29.594
Wow that's good.

00:31:29.594 --> 00:31:30.983
Oh, and is there like, I think

00:31:30.983 --> 00:31:32.629
there might be some cream in here.

00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:35.360
Can make things even better.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.363
Look at that.

00:31:36.363 --> 00:31:37.615
Or is it cheese?

00:31:37.615 --> 00:31:40.703
I can't even tell if it's cream or cheese.

00:31:40.703 --> 00:31:41.536
Oh wow.

00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:44.556
That is just a stunner.

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:50.382
At first I thought it was a date,

00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:53.728
but the sauce is not very sweet.

00:31:53.728 --> 00:31:55.032
Let me taste a piece.

00:31:55.032 --> 00:31:57.032
Oh look at that, like fleshy,

00:31:57.032 --> 00:31:59.949
it looks like, almost jam, on seed.

00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:05.445
It's not that sweet.

00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:07.509
Yeah, it does taste like jam.

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:10.926
But is it some kind of a plum or a prune?

00:32:13.096 --> 00:32:15.013
Oh, maybe it's a prune.

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:17.793
That's like perfectly sweet,

00:32:17.793 --> 00:32:20.210
and just really silky smooth.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.941
That was a fantastic,
well-rounded, family,

00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:26.988
tasted like home cooked meal,

00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:29.387
and this is a family-run restaurant.

00:32:29.387 --> 00:32:31.034
I love the ambiance here.

00:32:31.034 --> 00:32:32.524
Delicious food.

00:32:32.524 --> 00:32:37.212
That was another fantastic way
to end this day in Barcelona.

00:32:37.212 --> 00:32:41.755
I am very happy and very
sleepy after eating this meal.

00:32:41.755 --> 00:32:43.943
I'm gonna head back to the hotel

00:32:43.943 --> 00:32:45.894
and I'm gonna call it a day,

00:32:45.894 --> 00:32:47.913
so I'm gonna end the video for today now.

00:32:47.913 --> 00:32:49.738
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:32:49.738 --> 00:32:51.673
