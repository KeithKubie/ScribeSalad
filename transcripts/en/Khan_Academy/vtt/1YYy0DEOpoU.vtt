00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.040
What I hope to do in this video
is explore the relationship

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.390
between oil and gas prices.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.130
And you do see that there
is a very strong correlation

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.380
between how they trend.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.960
This right over
here is oil prices,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.820
quoted at a specific
point on the planet.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.780
It is dependent
on where you are.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.610
As you can see, this is
in US dollars per barrel.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.420
In early 2008 around $100 went
up to $140 then came back down.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630
And then it's been
trending up ever since.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.090
Now it's about $100 per barrel.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.450
This is where we see the oil
prices are per barrel basis.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.420
And then related to that you
see the price of gasoline.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720
And this is even more
geographically specific.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.210
Because not only do have
transportation costs,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.270
but you also have very
region-specific taxation

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.670
for oil and
sometimes regulation.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.770
But taxation is
the big part of it.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.620
But you do see it trends
up when oil prices trend up

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.870
and then it goes down.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.900
And this is on a
per gallon basis.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.122
And these are the prices
right over here in New York.

00:00:58.122 --> 00:00:59.830
But they don't move
completely lock step.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.810
If anything you see that the
oil price on a per barrel basis

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.870
is much more volatile than the
gasoline price right over here.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.440
But there is the
same general trend.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.870
When the oil prices moves
up this tends to move up.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.780
But it's not always in
the same percentage.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.940
But there's definitely
a relationship.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.580
Now, before trying to figure
out when you pay, say,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.800
$4 at the pump how
much of that is

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.400
oil, and how much is refining,
and how much is transportation

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.300
let's at least kind of build
up to that to think about

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.020
just how does the oil
even end up in your car.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.880
And then we can build up
that price of the oil,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.370
or the price of the
gasoline, I should say.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.075
So this right over here, you are
probably familiar with these.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:43.040
These are oil rigs, two
very different types.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.490
This is an offshore oil rig.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.070
This is a land based oil rig.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.159
But they're both doing the
same fundamental thing.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.950
They're drilling into
the ground until they

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.550
get to a pocket of oil.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.580
And then they will
pump that oil out

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.650
and try to transport it
to the market somehow,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.680
first going through a refinery.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.060
Offshore is really fascinating.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.400
It really is an engineering
marvel how they do it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.840
It might be sitting
out here in the ocean.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.630
And it will literally go
to the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.370
go to the sea floor,
and then drill

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.339
from there to actually
get to the oil pockets.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.880
So it's really an
engineering marvel.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.890
And you have to be very careful.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830
It can be very dangerous
working on an oil rig.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.496
And obviously, if there's
an accident on them

00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:19.120
it could be an
environmental nightmare,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.300
like what we saw what
the BP situation.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.920
But it is undoubtedly
an engineering marvel.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.230
Now once you have that oil you
need to get it to a refinery

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.810
so that oil can be broken
up into it useful parts.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.220
And the way that is typically
transported to a refinery

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360
is some combination of a
pipeline or an oil tanker.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.070
This right over here is
actually the Alaskan pipeline.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.900
And it takes oil from the
very northern part of Alaska

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.900
to the southern part.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.450
So that it can then be put on
oil tankers, which can then

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.430
transported anywhere in
the world to refineries.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.820
It could go straight
to a tanker.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.010
Actually even some offshore
places you could use a tanker.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.890
Or sometimes even if
they're close enough

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.410
to land they actually
might have a pipeline that

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.110
will take it to land where
it can go to a refinery

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.620
or go to an oil tanker so it
can be transported even farther.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.540
And then from there,
it gets to a refinery.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.390
And so we could start to think
about how the price of oil

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.590
is built up before we even
think about what a refinery even

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.860
does.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.230
So let's say that the
current price of oil-- and I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.870
kind of rigged the
numbers, not to be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.180
too punny-- to work
out fairly well.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.155
But let's say that the current
price of oil is $90 per barrel.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.180
So, and this is
just a units thing,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.200
a barrel is equal to 42 gallons.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.730
So if I say I have
a barrel of water

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm really saying that I
have 42 gallons of water.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.360
And now all 42
gallons of crude oil

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.500
do not turn into 42
gallons of gasoline.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.160
Out of 42 gallons
of crude oil you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
can get about 19 or 20
gallons of gasoline.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.570
For the sake of to
make the numbers easy

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.190
I'll just go with 20,
20 gallons of gasoline.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.210
And then the rest
will be other stuff.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.160
So 22 gallons of other stuff.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.790
It might not even be 22 gallons.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.630
In fact it won't be.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.860
Some of it is just waste.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.140
Some of it is byproduct.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.670
Some of this is actually used
to fuel the refining process.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.070
So let me not write that number.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.490
So the rest is other stuff.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.060
So this refinery is paying $90
per barrel when it gets it.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.540
So that incorporates what the
oil producers are getting.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.580
It also takes care of
the transportation costs

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.970
to the refinery.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.310
And let's say just for
the sake of argument

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.877
that the refinery
can sell-- let's

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:51.460
say it's doesn't even take care
of the transportation network.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.793
Let's say there's people who
are willing to buy directly

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.400
from the refinery
at the refinery.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.560
They're willing to buy
gasoline at $3.25 per gallon.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.470
So the gas at refinery
people are willing to spend,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.680
or the transporter is willing
to pay them, $3.25 per gallon.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.851
And so from this
barrel they're going

00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.510
to get 20 gallons of gasoline.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.490
They can sell that
at $3.25 per gallon.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.660
So you're going to have
20 times $3.25, which

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.200
is let's see 20 times 3 is 60.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.930
And then 20 times $0.25 is $5.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.330
So they're going to get
$65 for the gasoline.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.090
And then let's just say
for the sake of argument

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.360
they get $35 for
the other stuff.

00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:52.220
And some of this other
stuff is quite useful.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.580
It's stuff like motor oil.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.910
It could be jet fuel.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.850
It could be natural gas.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.240
And it could be obviously fuel
to actually fuel the refinery.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.250
And so let's actually
start building this

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.720
up right over here.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.400
So one way to think about it--
so let me draw it this way.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.730
We're up to $3.25 per gallon,
is what the price is exiting

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.590
the refinery, what the
refineries getting for it.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.900
So let me draw it down here.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.480
So let's say that this is $1.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.110
This is $2.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.590
And this is $3.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.130
And then they're getting
$3.25 would be like that.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.800
That is what the
refinery is getting.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.258
And one way to
think about it, it's

00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:47.770
not completely because
all of their profit

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.110
isn't coming from the gasoline.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.470
But one way to think
about it is the refinery,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.020
after refining this
barrel of crude oil

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.860
that they paid $90
for, they're going

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.950
to get $65 for the gasoline.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:05.450
And then they're going to
get $35 for the other stuff.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.295
So they made a combination of,
what is it, they made $100.

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:11.040
They're able to buy
this crude oil at $90,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.440
do what they had to do.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.104
And then they're able
to sell it for $100.

00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:17.020
So one way to think about
it is that, at least

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.820
in this situation, 90% of
what they're getting for it

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.830
was their cost.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.590
But it breaks down between the
other stuff in the gasoline.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.150
So it's not super
easy to break down.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.330
But you can say, in this
example, a good chunk of this

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
was the cost of gasoline.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.780
And it obviously depends
how you account for it.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.170
But a good chunk of it,
not the cost of gasoline,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.880
a good chunk of it is
the cost the crude.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.160
And this right over
here, you could say

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.980
is how much the
refinery actually makes.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.570
And the amount that
the refinery gets

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.470
versus what it costs--
so the amount they

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.300
get for all of the product they
produce versus the crude oil

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.430
that they have to pay
for, this margin, this

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.210
is often called
the crack spread.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.420
And just to understand
what a refinery is doing,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.372
it's breaking up that crude
oil into its various parts.

00:08:08.372 --> 00:08:10.080
And it's actually a
fairly simple-- well,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.370
I don't want to
say simple process.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.105
Obviously when you
look at a refinery

00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:13.970
it does not look
like a simple thing.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.940
But the idea for the process
is fairly straightforward.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.105
It takes the crude oil and it
heats it up through a boiler.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.970
So right over here the
crude is getting really hot.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.190
This is the boiler.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.150
And the boiler is fueled,
often fueled or usually fueled,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.460
by some of the
outputs of that oil.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.840
So this is fire,
just to symbolize

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.049
that it's getting hot.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.741
And then it goes into
a distillation column.

00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:44.240
And the distillation column,
that's why you see all of these

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.720
towers right over here
in an oil refinery.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.690
Those are the
distillation columns.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.870
And so in a distillation column
the different parts of the oil

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.810
have different
boiling temperatures.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.870
So the very long carbon
chains in the oil

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.030
have very high
boiling temperatures.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.640
So as hot as they are
they're not going to boil.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.390
They're going to stay in
their liquid form down here.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.920
And then the slightly
shorter chains

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.099
they're going to boil and
evaporate a little bit.

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:10.140
But then as they rise
they're going to cool down.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.800
And then they might
condense right over here.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.740
Then they can be pulled
away in pipes and then

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.700
things that are even
slightly shorter chains

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.610
than that will go a little
bit higher before cooling

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.520
to even lower temperatures
before going back

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.602
into a liquid state.

00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:25.310
And then they can be
collected over here.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.560
All the way until you get
to the very shortest chains,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.860
like the natural gas, that would
be collected out at the top.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.650
And the gasoline that
you put in your car

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.625
it might be collected
right over here from this.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.440
So you're essentially
breaking up that oil

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.852
into its different parts.

00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.310
And on some of the
other parts this

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.184
might be motor oil right
over here, the thing

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.920
that you used to lubricate your
engine, not fuel your engine.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.810
You might have jet fuel up here.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.540
And you have a whole ton of
other different-- kerosene,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.200
all sorts of things,
you are able to take out

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.620
of that crude oil.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.340
But anyway, let's get
back to the gasoline.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.570
So the refinery got $3.25.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.330
Now we have to
transport that gasoline.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.680
So let's say $0.10
for transportation.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.150
So this is at $3.25
right over here.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.440
So now we're going to have
$0.10 for transportation.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.550
So that right over here is
$0.10 for transportation.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.220
I'll just write
transportation for short.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.770
And then it goes
to the gas station.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.880
And as I mentioned, gas
is heavily, heavily taxed.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.620
And depends on
what jurisdiction,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.476
what country, and even
states within countries.

00:10:28.476 --> 00:10:30.850
But for the sake of simplicity,
let's just say it's taxed

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.330
at $0.50 a gallon, which is
not that different from what

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.080
it's taxed at in many states.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.220
So now we're at $0.50 a gallon.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.090
So that would be right around,
so let's say-- actually,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.030
let me do a new color.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.870
I keep using the same
colors over and over again.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.060
So let's say this is
$0.50 a gallon tax.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.190
So that is tax right
over there going

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.480
to the state and
federal government.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.630
And so let's see $3.25
is what the refinery got,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.040
$0.10 for transportation,
gets us to $3.35, $0.50 tax,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.720
so this is $0.50 tax,
gets us to $3.85.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.915
And then now we're
at the gas station.

00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:12.040
There essentially it's
going to cost $3.85 a gallon

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.670
for that fuel.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.490
The gas station needs to make
some money to pay their costs.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:21.470
The gas station sales you
that fuel at $4 a gallon.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.220
And so you might say,
OK, the gas station,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.045
that already seems
surprisingly low.

00:11:25.045 --> 00:11:26.420
And that is actually
on the order

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.260
of how much gas stations
actually make on

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.490
a per gallon basis.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.530
You might say, hey, the
gas station made $0.15.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:38.020
$4 minus the $3.85 that takes
in all of these other costs.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.322
But actually a huge amount
of that $0.15 actually

00:11:40.322 --> 00:11:41.780
goes to the credit
card processors.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.230
Because most people pay the
pump with a credit card.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.997
And that's why some
gas stations like it,

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.830
will give you a discount
if you pay in cash,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.630
because of that $0.15 as
much as, and or in general

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.060
around $0.05 of that will
go to the credit cards,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.690
will go to the credit card
processors, credit card fees.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.980
I know this is getting messy.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:08.582
So the retailer will be left
with about $0.10 of margin.

00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:10.040
So anyway, hopefully
that gives you

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.670
a sense of how crude
oil turns into gasoline.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.500
And when you pay
at the pump what

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.420
is the breakdown for
the different players.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.100
And how much of
the money is going

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.590
to those different players.
