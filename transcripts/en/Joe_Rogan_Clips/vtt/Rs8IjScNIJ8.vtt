1
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.720
And I think that that just did not exist. I mean,

2
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.300
Gina Carano sorta caught it a little bit,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
but she was gone before it really caught fire, you know?

4
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.470
And then when she lost a cyborg, there was a,

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.640
there's a lot of like weird feelings about that because there's all these

6
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.750
speculations as cyborg was on drugs and then they looked at Gina Carano and she

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.710
was all beat up afterwards and that left his sort of weird taste in people's

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.110
[inaudible].

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.780
<v 0>I understand that. And I think that, um,</v>

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.820
their eyes are tasty. Um, no, I, I think that there's something to that.

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.440
I think, um, it's unfortunate because I'm like, I know Chris cyborg, you know,

12
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.280
I was the matchmaker, you know, with Invicta when she was fighting for us and I,

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.160
I was there for her weight cuts and I saw some of her struggles and,

14
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:52.090
and what a kind, kind person, she is just a genuinely kind person.

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.210
But then there's this persona of toughness and her saying this kind of thing to

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.790
rando or she's saying this to Gina and then they're saying it back and it's

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.340
this, that, you know, and it just like for some reason, um,

18
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.750
I never thought she got the, um, the respect that was due, but at the same time,

19
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:07.120
then she did fail a drug test. So it was like, ah,

20
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.740
like unfortunately you carry the burden of having your entire legacy be

21
00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:13.900
questioned when you mess up like that.

22
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.260
<v 1>But we know what the human body looks like. You know,</v>

23
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.310
you know what a female body looks like and you know what someone looks like when

24
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:25.510
they most likely have been introducing male hormones into a female body.

25
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.840
<v 0>I don't, I, you know, I,</v>

26
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.660
I understand what you're saying because we know what we think is normal or what,

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.660
you know, what a female body is like. But I would say that, uh,

28
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.100
we know what a male body looks like too, without hormones and we, yeah,

29
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:42.100
and I mean, you look at somebody who's like perfect physique, Sage Northcutt.

30
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.200
I mean is everybody speculating the,

31
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.510
he's on steroids because he looks a certain way. Cause I,

32
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.600
I met the kid when he was a kid and he looked like that.

33
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.160
<v 1>The problem that line of thinking is that he's a male and then he has natural</v>

34
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.070
testosterone and that you can accentuate natural testosterone pretty

35
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.240
significantly, especially if you're someone like a Kevin Randleman or you know,

36
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:05.470
like a, a Marvin Eastman who just has this extreme mesomorphic bill.

37
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.340
There's a lot of people that are built that way that don't do anything illegal.

38
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.080
There's not a lot of women that are,

39
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.770
<v 0>yeah, I, you know, I again, I, when we do the eye test like that, like I,</v>

40
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:17.860
I completely understand that my, um,

41
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.340
I guess I wanted to believe that I wanted to believe that cyborg was drug free

42
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:26.380
and now I believe that she is, I believe that she's not. Yeah,

43
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:27.160
I believe that she's,

44
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.310
whatever happened in that time in 2011 she has rectified it.

45
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:33.640
She's passed all of her, I guess something happened. I'm not really,

46
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.560
cause it was with the UFC with some kind of test,

47
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.650
but it turned out it was with her birth control pills or something kind of

48
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.620
behind him. Yeah. Something happened with her birth or something,

49
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.240
something happened there. But

50
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.140
<v 1>no, it's spironolactone.</v>

51
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.780
And which is a DHT inhibitor with dihydrotestosterone inhibitor that is used for

52
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:55.430
a bunch of different reasons. It's used as a, um, it's used as a diarrhetic.

53
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.490
It's used for people combating the effects of anabolic steroids for females

54
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.190
combating the effect. It's used for cysts.

55
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.620
It's used for a bunch of bunch of different possible reasons to use it,

56
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.760
<v 0>I think. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.850
Cause I think I've known somebody who's been on that for cystic acne before.

58
00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:15.330
So I understand. I don't understand what happened in all of that.

59
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:18.870
And I would love to, I need to read about it. I'd love to know more about it.

60
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:23.070
It wasn't my, in my sphere of interest exactly right. But you know,

61
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.690
pre 2011 drug test,

62
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:27.330
I wanted to believe she was natural because I wanted to believe in her and

63
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:32.331
believe that somebody could be that vicious and for Roche's.

64
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:34.080
And wonderful like that and take it,

65
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.740
take the idea of women fighting to a different level.

66
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.020
And when she tested positive for the, um, it was a D D stands,

67
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.030
yes. Stands something in 2011, so whatever. Yeah.

68
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.300
And then, you know, and then I was just, I was heartbroken because first of all,

69
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.030
you know, it was just like, there was this, I didn't believe anymore.

70
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:54.540
And then I got,

71
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.630
I got to meet her actually in a professional setting and I got to know her as a

72
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.930
person. And you realize that when you know people, it's a lot more new student,

73
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.090
right.

74
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.440
<v 1>Believe in you as a person and not, you know, you know what I mean? Well,</v>

75
00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:06.910
I believed in a lot of guys that turned out to be taking steroids. Yeah.

76
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.010
It's weird to associate, I guess. I never will. You're a nice person.

77
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.680
You're kind what you wish for the best. I do.

78
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:17.130
But I also wish for the best for women all the time and that we're not gonna

79
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:20.610
mess up. Right. But if you do wish for the best for women,

80
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.850
wouldn't you definitely want to take a hard stance against someone who's

81
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:27.690
introducing male hormones into a female body. And you know, they'll also,

82
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.990
the problem that is a lot of the effects are permanent, like the,

83
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:35.220
a lot of the effects of a woman altering her physiology with male hormones.

84
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.720
There's a certain amount of those effects.

85
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.620
And this is also argued against men taking steroids. There's a certain amount,

86
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:41.880
and there's been tests about this.

87
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:46.830
This isn't just speculation that certain amount of physiological changes are

88
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.580
permanent.

89
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.320
When you take steroids because you're introducing these hyper human levels of

90
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.580
testosterone to a male system and things change, bone density changes,

91
00:04:56.581 --> 00:04:58.050
the shape of your body changes,

92
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.240
the tendon strength changes and your testicles shrink and certainly cause you,

93
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.990
you don't have the ability to predict to see that that comes back like the,

94
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:11.280
the testicular atrophy. It's really the shutdown of the endocrine system,

95
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:13.560
but that comes back and when it comes back,

96
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.260
there's a certain amount of the improvements that you've received because of the

97
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.090
steroids that you will keep forever.

98
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.110
So even when you're in that exact steroid area. Yes.

99
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.450
And which is one of the things that infuriates people that had been cleaned

100
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:29.160
their whole life is that someone can test positive and then they continue on

101
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:33.540
their career. Even if they are not taking steroids now they have a, a benefit.

102
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.460
They have a permanent benefit of taking those illegal drugs. That sucks.

103
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.500
Yes it is. I mean there's nothing like I can say like that would champion and

104
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.890
<v 0>that being a good thing. It's not a good thing. But I will say that like,</v>

105
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.160
she did not test positive the entire, you know,

106
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:53.180
since 2011 and so if there was that advantage in something like that,

107
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.010
we saw somebody like arena bearish and kickboxing still work that and still

108
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 1>find victory. Right. So I, I, I don't know,</v>

109
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.830
should show one half to work against that. First of all,

110
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:07.400
the Zarina bar's fight was a Testament to sidebars, courage and yes.

111
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.700
And fighting spirit that she took that fight cause nobody wanted to fight

112
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.150
Georgina for a long time. And if you don't know who's Juliana barges,

113
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.800
if you watch her Moitai fight, she's some ungodly number of fights she's had.

114
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.510
She's a multiple time world champion and she's just so stunningly technical as a

115
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.470
fighter. But you know, you look at them physically, they look very,

116
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.670
very different. You know,

117
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.250
cyborg is just this attacker Berzerker style and fought a very good fight.

118
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.410
It was a girl that nobody wanted to fight. It was a wonderful fight.

119
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.410
It's like one of those fights even in a loss like her stock came up. Yes,

120
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.340
I bore things. I hate her. Look, I, I think she's awesome. Uh,

121
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:49.520
I'm a fan and I tweeted this many times along that at the UFC needs to make 145

122
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:50.390
pound women's division.

123
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.980
But there's also some realities that you have to address and those realities

124
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.400
have to be addressed for the other women that haven't done anything as well to

125
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.770
still look up for them. I think you're right about that.

126
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:02.690
I think that when people test positive,

127
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.240
I think that the penalties have to be harsh.

128
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.050
They have to be hard and I don't know what's going on with the new testing and

129
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.090
stuff like that. I'm not, I, I don't,

130
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.090
I'm not in the know when it comes to the UFC, I'm no longer on a team.

131
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.200
You know what I mean? It's like everything I do,

132
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.570
I've read through MMA media now, so, um,

133
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.460
I don't know who's testing what and what's going on,

134
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.700
but I will say that the men had been doing it for so long as well.

135
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.200
So should men who were clean have to have fought against men who were dirty?

136
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.180
Very good question. A lot of people think they shouldn't. Yeah. So it's,

137
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.130
I don't know what we do about clean slating it at this point. And it's also,

138
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:35.210
is it the same thing?

139
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.200
Is a man taking male hormones the same as a woman taking male hormones?

140
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.540
The man already has the male hormones. Right?

141
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.710
Wouldn't that be even more of an increase than a woman taking cause if a woman,

142
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.830
I mean, no. Okay. No,

143
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.440
because a woman's adjusting her physiology and becoming masculine,

144
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.380
whereas a man is becoming more masculine. It's, there's a,

145
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.340
there's a shift literally in the body structure that happens to women when they

146
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.510
start taking testosterone.

147
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:03.200
That's why a transgender man goes from a woman to a man.

148
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:07.190
All sons grows a beard, right? Chaz bono. It changes the shape of your face,

149
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.190
changes the tone of your voice, your voice gets deeper. I mean,

150
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.580
so many different factors play in that. I mean it's really depends on,

151
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.350
there's no, there's also, there's a rainbow, like a broad spectrum of dosages.

152
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.470
Like who knows how much you're taking, how long you're taking it for,

153
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.480
and then there's also massive negative consequences health wise for women.

154
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.190
I mean it's already hell on your body to fight and it's hell on your body to be

155
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:34.460
a female athlete in many ways it's wonderful and encouraging, but you're right.

156
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.310
And I, again, I don't have an answer for that.

157
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.390
I don't think there was a clean slate.

158
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:42.350
I do think that Chris cyborg is in the position right now with our career and

159
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.330
with the things that have been questioned about or the things that have been

160
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:44.451
done.

161
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:49.451
She has actually the opportunity now to really spearhead making it all clean and

162
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:50.181
coming, you know,

163
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:52.700
coming forward with whatever happened in the past with the Spears,

164
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.470
I forgot the name of spironolactone.

165
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.140
That's less of a concern because that's not really a performance enhancing drug.

166
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.310
The spironolactone is not gonna. It's not performance enhancing.

167
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.280
It's not like the other stuff. It wasn't a failed test then.

168
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.370
It was not prohibited or it is prohibited.

169
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:12.540
But she could get a therapy therapeutic use exemption. Did she,

170
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.391
I think she did,

171
00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:17.460
didn't leave there doing that or in the process of trying to do that.

172
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.880
Maybe it has been cleared, but what that means is, look,

173
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.600
it's not hurting anybody she competes against. It's not that it's just,

174
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.370
they don't like people taking it because it can mask some of the effects of, um,

175
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.000
androgens in, in the female body. And it also, um,

176
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.270
as a diarrhetic diuretics are illegal because diarrhetics also can mask some of

177
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:43.881
the potential properties of testosterone or hormones or did away with all the IV

178
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.050
rehydration, the only person who liked Ivy Erie hydration.

179
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.810
You're the only one now. I think there's a lot of people that like to lie.

180
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.040
I was clean. I hate to say that I was clean my whole life,

181
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.030
but I was possibly, because nobody ever offered me anything.

182
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.950
If somebody offered you steroids, you think you would have taken it.

183
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.420
I don't know. I look back now and I'm like,

184
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:05.760
I wonder cause I wonder how many other women, yeah,

185
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:08.520
what if it was back in the day, like the wild West, like pride days,

186
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.820
like pride days where the wild West, like during pride,

187
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.500
like I talked to Ensign any way he described about as co his contract literally

188
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:19.830
in capital letter said we will not test you for steroids.

189
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.140
And Ensign was laughing about it.

190
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.560
It was like fucking everybody was on shit back then. I took that question.

191
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.500
I think I probably would have if I'd have been offered it. I don't know.

192
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:30.090
But then you think about that and then you think about,

193
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.630
okay 2011 was just on the cusp of being the wild West. Right.

194
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.130
So if she did take steroids, if she was on something,

195
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.970
isn't that just what everybody else was trying to do? Some people were,

196
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:45.720
I don't think Gina was doing it. [inaudible] did it at all? No,

197
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.260
some women definitely did for sure. I mean, you look at the old pictures,

198
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.460
the fighters, the generation before me, and I'm not throwing accusations,

199
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.950
I'm just saying people with musculature, like, like Becky,

200
00:10:55.951 --> 00:11:00.330
Levi and people like that. You kind of wonder like, okay, how much of that was,

201
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.960
you know? Sure. Well I know girls that just compete in jujitsu tournaments,

202
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.210
that deuce desktop testosterone. I mean,

203
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.910
they just want to be stronger and better and there's no money in it.

204
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.390
They're just trying to get an edge. And it's kinda weird, you know, it's,

205
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.000
it's weird. It's, you know, they're,

206
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:19.050
it's amateur and no one's testing and they say everyone's doing it.

207
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.500
So they're doing it. So you go, okay, I got no position on this. I mean,

208
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:23.430
I don't know. I don't know what to say.

209
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.540
But when it comes to MMA and when it comes to professional sports,

210
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.590
and back then if it was the wild West, I'm sure a lot of people were doing it,

211
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:32.723
you know?

212
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.570
But Chris cyborg became sort of the poster girl when she looked apart and then

213
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.040
tested positive. Right? What, I mean, what do we do with that now?

214
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.530
That's a good question. What do you do with it?

215
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.660
I think she's a phenomenal woman.

216
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:49.380
I think she's a kind and good woman and a wonderful fighter for people to look

217
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:54.040
up to. So I don't, I don't know what you do with that now. I think that what

218
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 0>has to go on the table is just we take everything by what happens today.</v>

219
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.730
And if a person doesn't test positive, we take them at their word.

220
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.091
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.210
The real problem though with what's going on today is they're offering these

222
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:08.560
massively steep,

223
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.360
steep sentences for people and suspensions for people. So like firsts,

224
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.321
if you get caught,

225
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:17.800
I think the first suspension is like two years and then if you get caught again,

226
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.410
it's even deeper and then three years, it's three times.

227
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.260
If you get caught a third time, it's like life. Yeah.

228
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.310
Like Vandelay Silva one is the most disturbing one to me because he ran away

229
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:31.390
from a test and they banned him for life. Like that is fucking, that's abusive.

230
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.940
<v 0>Yeah. You got wonder how many other fighters have run away from it,</v>

231
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.800
but it just wasn't as public like you know.

232
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.240
<v 1>Sure. Well not only that,</v>

233
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.840
but when you talk to [inaudible] son and about how sketchy the USADA people were

234
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:41.621
when they came to him,

235
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.800
like they made them do it in a broom closet and give blaze like this is this

236
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:47.650
sterile? Like who are you? Do you have an ID? Like they don't even,

237
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.850
they don't want to give you ID.

238
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.480
They just want to test right away and you just have to listen to them. Right.

239
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.520
<v 0>Kind of understand in the case of him where they may be trying to Hawk,</v>

240
00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:59.780
I am a little bit more just because of his past. Yeah. But it is, um,

241
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.460
I don't know. I, I don't know when it comes to regulation,

242
00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:07.310
who regulates the regulators? Like that is the question. Right.

243
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.340
But at the same time, we don't want this taken away from us. Right.

244
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.070
Like this whole thing that the, the, the moments of passion,

245
00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:18.380
the Darren elegance moments, we don't want that taken away from us.

246
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:23.270
And to have that soured by knowing that that person was cheating, that,

247
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.200
you know, it's,

248
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.070
I think there's a huge emotional investment to see a clean sport. Well,

249
00:13:28.071 --> 00:13:30.950
how about the greatest of gray areas, which is [inaudible] Belfort. Yeah.

250
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.710
They let them, yeah, they let them, I mean,

251
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.740
<v 1>who was the testosterone use exemption and when he was doing it, Holy shit.</v>

252
00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:39.150
Was he fucking terrifying?

253
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.520
He looked like 19 year old VC look crazier than 19 year old V.

254
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.530
he looked like a demon. I mean, Vito would come out and just starch.

255
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:48.120
Everybody who's smashing people.

256
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.330
We'll kick Luke Rockhold when we'd never seen him throw a wheelchair in his

257
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.850
life. He threw two wheel kicks in his entire career.

258
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.800
Look at the pictures of him.

259
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.830
This is 2007 on the left in 2000 or 2012 in the left and 2017 on the right.

260
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.790
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
