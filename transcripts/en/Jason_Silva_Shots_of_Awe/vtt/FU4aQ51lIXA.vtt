[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.850
SUBJECT: The philosopher,
Ernest Becker,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.340
in his book, "The
Denial of Death,"

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.410
says that the human
situation (LAUGHS)

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.010
is so terrifying,
when you really

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220
consider the big picture,
that, to not go mad

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.090
would amount to another
form of madness.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.520
Now, the philosopher,
Kierkegaard,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.990
has an interesting definition
of the schizophrenic,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.950
and he compares and
contrasts the schizophrenic

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.529
to the depressive.

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:43.445
Now, basically, he says
that the schizophrenic

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.760
is overwhelmed by
too much possibility,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.740
that the schizophrenic is
privy to too much vision,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.200
too much ecstasy.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.400
He simply is overwhelmed, he
is flooded by an overbearing

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.340
amount of sense
impressions, impregnated

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.770
with so much meaning, with
so much signification,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.591
that he is torn apart
by the simple fact

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:03.090
that there's no
possible way that he

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.298
can ride every single one
of those sense impressions.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.720
He can't be here, and
there, everywhere.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.110
The schizophrenic is torn
apart because he simply

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.150
is obliterated and is
not grounded in any way.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.080
He's pulled in the
every possible direction

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.830
he could be pulled, unfiltered,
terrified, like a living

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.784
wake-walking nightmare.

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:23.200
The depressive,
on the other hand,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.650
has the illusion that the
walls are caving in on him.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.290
He simply cannot envision
a different situation

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.170
for himself.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.605
The depressive is subject to
a failure of the imagination.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:36.870
He is stuck with too much
entropy, too much gravity.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.640
The here and now sucks, and
he cannot imagine another

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.010
possibility for himself.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.700
In other words, the
world is caving in.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.070
There is nothing but despair.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.730
He is too grounded.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.140
So again, the schizophrenic,
not grounded enough,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.310
pulled apart by too
much possibility.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.430
The depressive, too
grounded, too in his body,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.360
cannot transcend his own weight.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.730
It's a failure of
the imagination.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.590
Two contrasts, two extremes,
loosely-defined, most of us

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.430
probably finding ourselves
somewhere in-between.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.710
But nonetheless, an interesting
definition, and a creative

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.445
challenge to each
and every one of us.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:13.450
How do we partake in
these beautific visions,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.890
these ecstatic visions, and
nightmarish perspectives,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.030
and leverage them, and try to
create life for ourselves that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.900
is, at the very least, filled
with a little bit of grace?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.250
