Thank you for
coming over.

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:03.971
I've never
seen him this depressed.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.606
You know, I think it
hits men especially hard

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.274
when they're unemployed.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.742
Yeah, but even
worse than that

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.911
is the new therapy
that he's on.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.615
Hey, Mark.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.183
Oh, hey, Colleen.

You need help, you want me
to get you something?

No, I don't need help,
I'm not five.

Oh, I got it,
it was at the books.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.730
Why is he skipping?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.131
That's the therapy.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.566
The doctor told him
to skip

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.800
as a way to
trick himself

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.102
into feeling happier.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.037

I saw something about this

on that show
"The Doctors."

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:39.640

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.041

unwatchable.

was curt with you,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.780

a little better.
