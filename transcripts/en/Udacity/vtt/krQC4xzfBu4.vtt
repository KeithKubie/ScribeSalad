00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:03.119
Well this one actually – this is not how pressure

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.726
works. If I hold my hand out right now,

00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:08.105
I don’t just feel the weight of air coming

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:10.085
from above, I actually feel that pressure

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:12.924
pushing from all directions which is why

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:14.541
air pressure isn’t a burden. It doesn’t

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.544
prevent me from standing up. It turns out that

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:18.961
the reason why humans like high pressure

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.991
so much is because with all that high density of

00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.105
air, means that with every breath we

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.572
get a ton of oxygen and this makes the

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:30.000
mitochondrion in our cells very happy.
