00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.590
RENEE BROWN: Great.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.890
Great.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.556
Well, thank you.

00:00:07.556 --> 00:00:09.170
It's great to see all of you.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.490
And I want to thank
Google for the invitation.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.907
I'm a fan of the
company and have

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:14.990
enjoyed working with all
of you through the years.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.130
So it's good to have
faces with the company.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.770
So thank you.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.610
And so in talking to a couple of
the folks prior to this event,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.240
the term intersectionality came
up, where I think all of you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.100
are focusing on the
intersection of all

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.690
of our different
parts of our lives

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.070
and how that comes together.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.486
So I'm probably
going to come back

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:34.610
to that as we talk through
some of the questions

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.560
and hopefully take
some of your questions.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.470
But just by way of
introduction, to think

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.960
about all the
different hats I wear,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.800
yes, I'm an executive
during most days.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.590
I'm also a mom of a 15-year-old
and three-- well, two dogs

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.140
and one cat, a wife.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.600
I serve on a national board.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.140
I am the chair of the board of
my daughter's private school.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.570
And I also am a
deacon at my church.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.880
So you think about
all the intersections

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.500
of the LGBT family, your work
family, and then all the ways

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.899
we try to give back to the
different parts of our lives

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.690
that are important.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.840
So hopefully we can
touch on a number

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.980
of those different areas.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.855
And I probably have
other hats that I totally

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:16.867
forgot and whatnot.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:18.200
But a little bit about my story.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.380
I'm from South Louisiana.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.677
So I am one of the
real Cajuns, even

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.260
though my last name doesn't show
it, my mother was a Primeaux.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.180
And if you have any
Cajun jokes, it's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.870
the Thibodeauxs,
Boudreauxs, Primeauxs, OK.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.270
So I am I'm one of
those Cajun folks.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.102
And so from a very
young age, I always

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:35.810
knew I was different
from a lot of folks.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.210
So like many of you
probably, I took

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.740
upon myself to be like
perfect at everything,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.470
be whatever, the
head of everything,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.780
so that once people figured
out that I was different,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.940
they would still kind
of maybe like me.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.240
And so I took that path.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.050
And I know a lot of people took
similar paths in their life.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.600
My coming out story is kind
of a funny one in that my--

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.450
the story goes like this.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.150
I was at college and my mother
called in a panic saying,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.220
oh my god, Renee, your
sister is a lesbian.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.970
But I've always known about you,
but, really, your sister too?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.650
I was like, well,
great, thanks mom.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.858
That was always very obvious.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.450
So that's an important
part of my story.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.560
My parents went two for
two and have two gay kids.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.740
My sister runs the MCC
church for a little bit,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.396
so she's the gay pope.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.770
So you can look
up Rachelle Brown

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.990
and you'll recognize the
resemblance or at least

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.500
the voice.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.155
But throughout my career,
you know being a lesbian,

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:40.610
as you know starting in banking,
it's a very conservative field.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.240
And so I wasn't out there
in my first several roles.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.150
And it really wasn't
until my partner

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.690
and I decided to start a family
that the whole coming out

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.489
process started in earnest,
because if you're pregnant

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.030
and you're coming out, you have
to come out, because you have

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.900
to explain your relationship.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.880
And so that process really
was a real turning point,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.490
not only in my personal
life in starting a family,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.380
but also in my
professional life.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.590
And a lot of people have said,
well, does having a child

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.080
and coming out, does
it harm your career?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.660
In my situation, I
left on maternity leave

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.947
as a person on the brand team
at Wachovia, and came back,

00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:21.530
and they immediately said you're
the head of brand management,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.200
you're a senior vice
president, it starts now.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.330
And it's like, OK, I didn't
interview for anything.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.400
I think that's against
a lot of HR policies.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.660
But you know, I started
and just jumped right in.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.969
So my experience was a very
positive one on that front.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.510
But you know, through
my career, I've

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.380
been in financial services
marketing for a very long time

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.509
and I've served in a
lot of different roles.

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.550
I've had a chance to do
a lot of different things

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.590
across financial services.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.450
And I think a part of
that is because I'm

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.700
really open to taking on new
challenges and new experiences.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700
And so as we go through
some of these questions,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.860
I hope to share some
of that, because I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.370
think the intersections
of all of our experiences

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.550
make us a better worker
for whatever company

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.080
we're serving at the time.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.272
So anyway, that's just a
little bit more about my story.

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:09.980
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.445
Thank you.

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:13.070
And could you tell
us a little bit more

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.560
about the leadership
role that you're in now?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.510
What are you tasked with
and what kind of team

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.135
do you oversee?

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:20.065
And just to build
on your last point,

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:22.190
we'd also love to hear
about some of the challenges

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.770
that you're most excited
about approaching

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.620
in your current role.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.620
RENEE BROWN: Absolutely.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.460
So I'm running marketing
for the retail side of TIAA.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.010
And so for folks not
familiar with TIAA,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.620
it's a 100-year-old company
that's known for retirement

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.440
and helping universities
and not-for-profits

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.540
in their retirement space.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.190
And we just launched
into retail.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.190
And so it's a very young
part of the company.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.180
It's really a startup
with the exception

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.560
we do have an advisor
force, which is very small,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.830
about 850 advisors.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.230
The last company I left
had 15,000 advisors,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.110
so a very different scale and
scope, and a very different way

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.580
of going to business.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.030
But we just purchased a bank.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.520
And so we're
integrating that bank

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.650
over the next several weeks.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.836
The goal, and what my
team is responsible for,

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.960
is figuring out how do we
go to market differently.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.870
We're a not-for-profit
organization.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.050
And how do we go up against
the B of A, Merrill, Chase,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.750
others in the financial
services industry like Fidelity,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.410
and show up differently and
show our not-for-profit heritage

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.150
and really try to
disrupt the marketplace?

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.160
And so that's the challenge
I'm taking on now.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.220
I have a small team.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.070
I haven't counted.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.580
I don't know how many people,
probably about 50 people

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.600
on the team now.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.820
And it's really
exciting, because--

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.890
so I was with Wachovia
Wells for 20 years.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.730
And in that whole process,
even in brand management,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.440
we were constantly trying to say
how is this company different.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.530
Well, we're on
every street corner.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.390
With the Wells example,
we have ponies.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.240
We can give out plush
ponies to people.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.620
Yes, that's a thing.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.040
But there wasn't anything
like heart and soul,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.660
whereas TIAA has a soul.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.150
And we're trying to
uncover that, and show

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.942
this really cool
company, and show how

00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:59.150
it's different in the market.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.879
So it sounds like
it might be easy,

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.420
but it's going to
be a challenge just

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.990
with a lot of different
structures we have.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.539
So yeah, we met
with our Google team

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.580
a little earlier to talk
a little bit about that.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.060
And so I'm excited
about the opportunity.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.560
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.150
And you touched on
this a little bit

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.320
about sort of your promotion
during your maternity leave,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.750
but what path did you take
to your current role at TIAA

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.700
and your path to
this previous role?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.230
RENEE BROWN: Gosh, I think--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.800
you know, some people actually
had plans for their career

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.740
and I definitely didn't.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.070
The only thing consistent
with my journey

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.360
is that I always took on a
job no one else wanted to do.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.200
And that has been
kind of my hallmark.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.444
And I discover that
if you raise your hand

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.860
and do something
no one else wants

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.870
to do that you're beloved
by the management,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.870
because it's typically something
that's hairy, complicated,

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.490
political, and people
don't know the answer.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.940
And even if you can get in
and move it just a little bit,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.940
people love you and you're
kind of marked with that.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.210
So I started my career on
the regular banking side

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.330
doing tons of integrations
in New Orleans for Hibernia

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.190
Bank, which was
bought by Capital One,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.140
so that's how long ago that was.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.090
But it was fun being single and
26 living near Bourbon Street.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.652
And then with Wachovia, I was
on the small business side.

00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:15.110
And that was really
cool, because I

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.809
got to learn how
business bankers go in

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:17.600
and help companies.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.765
And I found that to
be very fascinating.

00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:21.515
And then when First
Union bought Wachovia,

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:23.090
I moved into brand management.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.660
And that was a great
learning, a great ability

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.330
to kind of step back and say,
how can a company be different

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.014
but not just how it's expressed,
but how people actually

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:32.930
behave at the company.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.820
And that's where
magic can happen

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.620
with different institutions.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.080
But I quickly realized that
everyone's a brand expert.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.740
I don't know if
you all know that.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.660
And I got really
burned out with some

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.910
of the components of branding.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.680
And so no one at
the company wanted

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.620
to support the
financial advisors,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.230
because they are known
as cowboys, and cowgirls,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.897
and mean people.

00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:53.229
And I'm like, I'll take that on.

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:54.500
So I went and got my series 7.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.749
And I'm like, OK, I'm going
to do this whole brokerage

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.960
thing, and retirement
asset management.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.480
I did that for seven
years pre and post-merger

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.290
with Wells Fargo.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.270
And so that was
really great learning.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.680
Did the AG Edwards integration.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.640
That was the biggest brokerage
integration in history.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.410
It was awesome.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.620
Learned so much.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.590
And then after that, I raised my
hand for another problem, which

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.720
was Wells Fargo's social
media was a disaster.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.329
And so the board was kind of
standing on the management

00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:23.870
and said, you guys
have to centralize

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.953
this, which the company
didn't centralize anything

00:08:25.953 --> 00:08:26.640
at the time.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.520
So I was the person who
brought social media together.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.775
And that was really fun.

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:32.900
I kind of got out of
marketing for those few years,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.750
because, as you know,
standing up a social media

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.549
platform for a
company that large,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.490
you're dealing with HR
issues, because employees

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.946
love posting things that
they should not post, and PR.

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:47.570
And it was a lot less
marketing than it

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.520
was some of the managing
kinds of things.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.552
And so the last
role I had at Wells

00:08:53.552 --> 00:08:55.010
was actually in
the community bank.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.930
And all of you know
where that is right now,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.840
so I'm happy to be at TIAA.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.680
So you know, I mean each of
those twists and turns involved

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.690
some component of no
one wanted to touch it.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.250
Like my last role,
community banking,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.080
no one wanted to touch
that, because everyone

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.310
knew there were
problems and things

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.559
were getting ready to blow up.

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:13.340
And that's what happened.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.170
So, yeah.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.010
Does that help?

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.635
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.612
Just taking a step
even further back,

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:24.320
what was the first
job that you ever had,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.740
and did you imagine in that job
that you would find yourself

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.325
here in this current role?

00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:30.780
RENEE BROWN: Mm-mm.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.180
I think all of you would say
the same thing, I would assume.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.700
I started my first
job at the age of 16

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.260
on my birthday at 6:00 AM.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.490
I was a radio announcer.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.590
And the reason is my sister
was a radio announcer

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.190
and we sound a lot alike.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.220
And so that's how
I got my first job,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.330
because I sound like my sister.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.310
But she continued in radio
for a lot longer than I did.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.040
But that was really great.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.850
I learned a lot.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.870
I did radio announcing
from that age into college.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.840
And I was actually a traffic
reporter in Baton Rouge

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.007
where there's awful traffic.

00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:02.673
If you all have ever
been through there,

00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:05.420
you know, but I actually flew
in the airplane every morning,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:05.920
every night.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.090
And I was uptown Renee
Brown for a long time

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.110
through graduate school.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.110
And every job I ever did--

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.115
and during college,
I took any job

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.740
I could working my
way through college.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.270
I was a receptionist for
an architectural firm.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.210
I worked at the library.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.210
You name it just to get money,
because, believe it or not,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.720
being a radio announcer
isn't very lucrative.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.110
But what I learned announcing
traffic in particular

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.430
is you have 30 seconds.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.124
And you know, sometimes you'd
have two interstates shut down.

00:10:36.124 --> 00:10:38.290
You had all this stuff to
say and you had 30 seconds

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.220
to get it done.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.440
And how did that translate
to my later jobs?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.270
I mean some of my
roles, and you have all

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.330
experienced that, you go
in for a big presentation

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.660
with somebody and they
want the 30 second version.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.650
And so to have that
experience of saying,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.930
OK, I have 30 seconds.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.449
What are the three things
I can say in 30 seconds?

00:10:55.449 --> 00:10:57.490
And believe it or not,
that has been very helpful

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.310
for my career.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.690
So even though knowing
media and that side of media

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.060
has been helpful for
my marketing career,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.060
that's the piece that probably
was the biggest learning for me

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.272
as a younger person growing up.

00:11:09.272 --> 00:11:10.730
But I did also
learn a lot in radio

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.630
of exactly what not to do
from an HR sexual harassment

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.314
standpoint.

00:11:16.314 --> 00:11:17.230
Very different indeed.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.750
SPEAKER 1: And then
pivoting towards--

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.620
again, you're an out
LGBTQ identifying woman.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.150
How do you feel like identifying
as an LGBTQ woman, or generally

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.330
more broader as a woman,
has positively or negatively

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.932
affected your career
and your growth?

00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:38.890
RENEE BROWN: You know,
I think one thing that's

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.710
true across LGBT and
other diverse segments

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.700
is I think people gain
more empathy growing up

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.590
when you are the
subordinated group

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.020
for the majority of your
upbringing or your lifetime.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.750
And so understanding
what it feels

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.520
like to be not in
the dominant group

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.950
and having empathy and
tracking, because I

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.490
used to pay attention a lot to
people's emotions in the room.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.830
I think some of you
probably have experienced

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.480
that too to kind of
sense when things

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.740
are going in the wrong
direction and redirect them.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.510
And so I think that empathy
is critical for anybody

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.150
who is a leader of people
to really understand

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.840
how to read a situation and
use that level of empathy,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.280
and also knowing how to
be both aware when you're

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.706
in the dominant group and how do
you help people that aren't is

00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:26.830
an awareness level that a
lot of people don't have.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.829
Because usually when
you're in a dominant group,

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:31.270
and you have power and
authority and all that stuff,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.810
you're unaware of it.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.937
And the best place to
look at this is airport.

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:36.520
We were kidding
around about airports.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.940
It's so fun when like
something happens

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.100
and everyone gets
messed up with a flight.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.760
It's fun to watch the super
privileged people freak out

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.000
and just lose their mind because
they're being inconvenienced.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.580
And that's a sure
example of people

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.224
who are very unaware that
they have all this privilege.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:56.140
And once they're put in
a position without it,

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.090
they don't even know how to
deal with the world around them.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.430
And so I think, for me,
being an LGBT leader

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.170
and a female leader,
I kind of try

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.350
to carry all that background
of when I wasn't an executive,

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.070
and I didn't have the
power or authority,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.620
and how do I use
that for good as I've

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.890
moved through my career.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.660
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.750
Do you recall a moment in
your career or in your life

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.600
when you realize that
being visibly out

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.980
would actually be an asset to
you, either in your career,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.290
or in your work with
nonprofits on boards, et Cetera

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.040
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.520
You know, I think probably
the moment when-- you know,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.730
for a long time I was executive
sponsor of LGBT groups

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.646
at Wachovia and then at Wells.

00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:42.270
And when we transitioned
over to Wells,

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.650
there was a lot of conversation.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.840
And no one really
wanted to go talk

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.450
to the head of compensation
around the whole gross up.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.210
This was before domestic--
when we had domestic partner

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.070
benefits and you needed to gross
up people's taxes on health

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.220
care for their partners.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.970
And that was the moment where
I realized I had access,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.940
I knew the head of HR, I knew
this guy in compensation,

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.480
and the people in the ERG
didn't have that access.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.630
And it's like, OK,
this is a win-win,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.822
because I can go knock on
a door, and open a door,

00:14:11.822 --> 00:14:13.530
and have a conversation
that's different,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.150
because we're working with one
another on different things,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.920
not just this.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.920
And so that's a real asset.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.840
And what I have found
through the years

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.210
is a lot of times there
are LGBT folks who

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.810
are not out at higher levels.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.570
And that's a real shame, because
they're missing an opportunity.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.390
And you know, other
diverse groups

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.154
aren't as supportive
one to another.

00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:33.570
And that's a shame,
because that's

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.360
where we can really have a
voice and be able to have

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.720
conversations differently.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.350
So that's how I've
seen it as an asset is

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.230
to open doors for others
who weren't able to do that.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.150
SPEAKER 1: Have you
ever experienced

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.066
adversity, and kind
of the converse side,

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:51.440
as a result of
being out at work?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.080
And would you be OK sharing
one of those stories with us?

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.830
RENEE BROWN: Sure.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.300
And this is probably
less at work.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.070
It's probably more a side
effect of being so comfortable

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.830
at the office.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.640
And so this situation happened.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.650
I don't know what
the year was, but I

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.760
was getting in a taxi in St.
Louis heading to the airport.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.920
You know, the AG
Edwards, now Wells Fargo,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.140
Securities' headquarters
is in St. Louis.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.560
And so get in the taxi, you know
normal chit chat conversation

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.087
with the driver,
and he said, OK, so

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.170
what does your husband do?

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.070
I said, I don't have a husband.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.850
I have a wife.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.970
And she stays home
with our child.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.956
And he left the interstate
and went someplace

00:15:28.956 --> 00:15:30.830
that I knew wasn't on
the way to the airport.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.184
So I realized, great, I
just totally got some guy.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.600
And he's going to go chop me
up in little bits and pieces.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.750
And so I immediately
got on the phone with HR

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.440
and I was just chatting with my
HR partner, because I'm like,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.190
I'm going to be on the
phone with somebody

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.990
while whatever happens happens.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.640
And he wound up
driving through a park

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.931
and then getting back on track.

00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:49.220
But he was very--

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.240
he did not appreciate the fact
that I was very out and honest

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.520
about my personal situation.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.530
And so that was like
a lesson for me.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.660
Like within the walls
of your workplace,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.240
you can be very honest, and
sometimes in other places

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.090
it's good to say,
you know, whatever,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.040
not answer the question.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.040
But yeah, that was one
big learning for me

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.140
that got me a
little bit worried.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.640
SPEAKER 1: I can
definitely say I've

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.810
had similar Uber experiences.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.370
How do you and your wife balance
your career and your family?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.310
RENEE BROWN: You know, I don't
know if there ever really

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.450
is work/life balance.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.960
A lot of people
ask that question.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.147
And I think there's
times of throttling up

00:16:30.147 --> 00:16:31.730
where you're completely
out of balance

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.220
and it's needed at whatever
time that is in your career.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.350
I mean, if you fundamentally
change jobs or change

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.922
companies, it's not
like you're going

00:16:37.922 --> 00:16:39.630
to have a whole lot
of work life balance.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.629
And so I think it's
important just to name that.

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:43.136
But you can't
always have the out

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:45.190
of balance kind of situation.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.070
And it's not always throttling
up and spending 20 hours a day.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.150
And so we have routines,
like many others,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.310
you know whether it's the
Sunday evening dinners,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.850
or another work/life
balance thing is actually

00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.960
turning the phone off.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.820
I do stop in the evenings
and have some quiet time,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.210
particularly as my
daughter has gotten older.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.200
Now she's 15.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.160
She's taller than me.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.260
She's smarter than
me, literally.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.700
Her SAT score is way better than
mine was as a senior already.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.369
But it's harder to have
a teen talk to you.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.416
And so we have to really
make time and have quiet time

00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.040
as a family in the
evenings to actually

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.079
have a conversation happen.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.302
And then the other piece
is we do take vacations.

00:17:26.302 --> 00:17:28.010
And so I was telling
them I'm heading out

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.690
next Wednesday, which
is a little stressful,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.440
but we're going to go
on a two week vacation.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.840
It's critical to actually
get some downtime,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.680
because it's easy to let
both relationship and family

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.110
kind of fall apart with
all the things pulling

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.220
at you from your work.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.650
And so we try not
to have that happen.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.410
I don't know if we're
successful all the time though.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.110
SPEAKER 1: No one's perfect.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.650
RENEE BROWN: No.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.570
SPEAKER 1: And you had
mentioned your sister

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.930
and also that you serve as
a deacon for your church.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.810
How does religion
come into your life,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.430
and especially since it can
oftentimes be perceived as,

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.080
by members of the
LGBTQ community,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.250
as being at times at odds
with being LGBTQ identified

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.960
and being open
about it, so I would

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.740
love to hear how you address
that with your own identity

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.970
and with your own faith.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:17.450
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.900
I thought that would
be an interesting area.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.060
And I don't know if that's
something all of you

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.950
have seen at Google.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.560
But with other companies
and other ERGS,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.800
working with Out and
Equal, for example,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.390
it's interesting that, as
companies expand and get

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.960
faith ERGs, that
people see that there'd

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.660
be a conflict between a
faith employee resource

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.340
group and an LGBT resource
group, or LGBT and military.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.512
It's all kinds of
interesting thoughts

00:18:41.512 --> 00:18:43.220
around different
diverse groups and where

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.604
they might agree or disagree.

00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:46.520
And I have a very different
perspective on it,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.280
particularly in the
last year and a half

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.120
as we've seen all diverse
groups attacked equally

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.290
by the administration, by
parts of the media where,

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.150
if you're a person
with disabilities,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.720
somebody is picking on you,
you're a person of color, LGBT,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.320
you name it.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.880
Everyone seems to
be under attack.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.330
And so as we think about all
these different diverse groups,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.730
I think we as a collective
need to figure out

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.410
how to work together and really
help the cause of anybody who's

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:15.920
diverse.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.212
And so I think that's critical.

00:19:17.212 --> 00:19:18.836
And I don't think
we've figured it out.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:21.530
I mean, if you think of all the
diverse groups in the country,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.210
if we all actually
got together, we

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.120
would have a huge voice against
what's happening in our society

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.840
right now.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.430
And folks aren't doing that.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.280
And I think it's an opportunity.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.440
And with religion
specifically, that's

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.290
where I've had the most dialogue
across difference with folks,

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.680
because I welcome people
having a conversation who

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.080
might feel like their
religion says that they

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.070
can't support LGBT folks.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.200
And so those have been
difficult conversations.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.460
But everyone has helped move
forward just a little bit.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.560
My upbringing-- I
spent three days a week

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.670
in a church that really thought
LGBT folks were going to hell

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.740
and said it frequently.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.160
So I was damaged by my early
childhood religious experience.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.880
And so it wasn't until
we started a family

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.640
and my wife made
me go to church,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.950
and we shopped for a
church and found one.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.290
And it took years of
healing, honestly,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.070
to be in a church
that basically feels

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.010
the same way Pope Francis
feels is that all of us

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.580
are made in God's image
and loved equally.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.384
And it takes a long time to
heal from some of the scars

00:20:27.384 --> 00:20:29.050
if you've heard other
tapes in your head

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.490
throughout your upbringing.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.010
And so I just wanted to name
that, and then my sister

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.070
being a minister, and a
reverend, and leading a church.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.310
I think it's an
important thing to name,

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.170
because I know
other LGBT folks who

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.380
left any semblance of
faith out of their lives

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.510
for any number of reasons.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.100
You know, pride parades, people
holler and screaming at you,

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.880
things like that.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.340
It can be very disconcerting.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.200
But you know,
times have changed.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.850
And I think it's
time for us to have

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.770
good dialogue and a
real understanding

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.710
of different areas
of faith, and open up

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:05.110
dialogue between an LGBTQ
ERG, and a faith ERG,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.700
and be visible in that, because
to say I'm a lesbian Christian,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.020
I'm very comfortable
saying that now.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.520
Now.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.946
Years ago I wasn't for
a number of reasons.

00:21:14.946 --> 00:21:16.820
But I just think that's
an important dialogue

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.061
that a lot of companies aren't
having that conversation.

00:21:20.061 --> 00:21:22.560
SPEAKER 1: It sounds like also,
based on your earlier coming

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.260
out story, that it's something
your sister also deals

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.440
with in her faith as well.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.190
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.690
Yeah.

00:21:30.416 --> 00:21:32.040
SPEAKER 1: And you
also touched on this

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.540
in terms of working together
as different minority groups.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.740
But how do you--

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.590
it's easy to talk them out
in practice or in theory

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.930
of how do different employee
resource groups work together,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.020
how do different minority
groups work together,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.420
and you know their
strength together

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.760
is greater than the sum
of each individual parts.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.620
But how does that work?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.320
And how can employee resource
groups in different minority

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.504
groups work together effectively
to advocate for one another?

00:21:58.504 --> 00:21:59.670
How do you see that working?

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.420
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.980
I think having a
common set of goals

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.690
is probably the most
critical component.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.910
We've had so many
events in society

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.370
of late that could
be rallying cries

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.000
for groups of different ERGs to
come together and do an event

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.805
or have some kind of activity
that could be meaningful.

00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.430
You know, you think
of Charlottesville.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.780
And what are the
LGBTQ ERNs doing when

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.282
situations like that happen?

00:22:26.282 --> 00:22:27.990
And I think that's
the consciousness that

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.040
needs to come up.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.820
I've seen some
companies pool members

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.770
of each of the diverse ERGs
and have dialogue across those,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:43.800
like the Asian-American group
to include parts of the world

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.500
that someone might think a
military person might not

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.230
want to sit by them, or you know
have an LGBTQ military veteran

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.710
have a conversation with
somebody in a faith group.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.140
You know, all of those
kind of mixing and matching

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.260
this diverse-- it kind
of creates a tension.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.120
And so having panels
like that is something

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.890
that I would recommend.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.350
And then with my work
with Out and Equal,

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.390
we're doing a lot of
focus on companies

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.840
who are international in
scope, because, as you know,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.810
as you move out of the US, there
are a lot of countries where,

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.510
if you move different employees
around and they aren't out,

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.390
it can be very
challenging for them

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.590
in countries where you could
get killed for being LGBT.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.930
And so we're working through
trying to help give resources

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.350
to institutions on
how do you facilitate

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.270
those kinds of
interactions, and how do you

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.160
work in a country
like India that

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.520
has laws that prohibit a lot
of openness around people's

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.530
LGBTQ orientation.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.814
So that's an emerging space
that isn't going to change,

00:23:47.814 --> 00:23:49.980
because our world keeps
getting smaller and smaller.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.230
And those kinds of issues
will continue to come up.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.230
And also the other
thing I'd name

00:23:55.230 --> 00:24:00.600
that is a growing space is
our next generation, which I'm

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.390
sure all of you
have plenty of Gen Z

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.064
here at the Google headquarters.

00:24:06.064 --> 00:24:07.980
You know, when we think
about that generation,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.680
the gender fluidity, and
issues at work around that,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.470
and the lack of understanding
of senior leaders of most

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.660
companies around that
space is really critical.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.110
I mean, I've gotten some
questions that I didn't even

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.260
know the answer to,
which is my own learning

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.840
that I have to keep growing
and learning in that space.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.920
So anyway, those are all
areas that I know Out

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.120
and Equal's focused on.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.530
And a lot of
companies are trying

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.672
to make sure there's education
and understanding across that.

00:24:38.672 --> 00:24:41.130
SPEAKER 1: And actually touching
on the Out and Equal piece

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.440
again, how does your
position as an executive

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.720
affect how you
approach organizations

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.580
like Out and Equal,
your service there,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.380
and other causes
that you support?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.130
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.630
You know I have served on
the board of the Red Cross

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.310
for years.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.030
And part of the reason
for that is just

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.220
being from South Louisiana
and having hurricanes

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.200
in the backyard every
weekend just about,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.390
and seeing the fact that that
organization is always there

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.720
for people no matter what.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.770
And the Red Cross and Red
Crescent internationally

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.270
is an amazing organization.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.210
And I just kind of--

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.910
I share values with
that organization.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.010
I moved from that group
over to Out and Equal.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.980
And it's been a really
great learning for me.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.646
And one of the things
I have appreciated

00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:25.230
is just the ability
to meet people

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.300
across industries who
are making a difference

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.290
in their organizations and
helping, not only LGBTQ causes,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.010
but a lot of others.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.950
And so that's been
invaluable for me.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.020
And in fact, that
organization, Out and Equal,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.970
just had a new CEO come
in, really exciting.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.290
We're going to be having a
strategic off-site in Disney

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:43.890
in a month.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.330
And I'm looking forward to that.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.280
I think we're going
to blaze a new path,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.710
because Out and Equal's
known for their summit, which

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.840
is going to be in
Seattle in October.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.112
But also we have to
do more webinars.

00:25:54.112 --> 00:25:55.320
We have a lot more education.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.403
There's a lot more that
we have to do and catch up

00:25:57.403 --> 00:25:58.950
with the times,
because you guys know

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.241
in-person summits are really
hard for people to get to.

00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:03.120
Of course, the
Gaygglers have always

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.246
been a loud group at summits.

00:26:05.246 --> 00:26:06.120
I will give you that.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.070
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.570
And so, anyway-- so yeah.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.470
I find board work, whether
I helped our church

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.482
with long range
planning or I'm now

00:26:18.482 --> 00:26:20.190
leading the board of
my daughter's school

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.130
as I mentioned, I find
that a great distraction

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.150
and a great learning.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.700
So oftentimes
when-- so I've been

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.380
in marketing a million years.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.660
And it's not that I'm
not learning in the role,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.020
but I don't get to get
out of that box as often.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.630
So right now our school
is buying property,

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.280
and going through
all the rezoning,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.810
and doing all kinds of
things that it's like, I

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.101
don't have a chance to do that.

00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:44.310
So I find it stimulating
and interesting.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.640
And also, it helps
to put a face,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.100
with that group in
particular, a face

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.030
to the LGBT world in a
different way for those parents

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.469
of other kids.

00:26:55.469 --> 00:26:56.760
And I think we have to do that.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.440
We have to be out
in our communities

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.569
and serving in roles that
might not be as expected.

00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:04.110
And I think it just
helps people know

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.894
it's like, OK, me and my wife,
we have kind of the same life

00:27:06.894 --> 00:27:09.060
that all of the other parents
around the table have.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.744
We're doing the
best we can trying

00:27:11.744 --> 00:27:14.160
to deal with all the things
that you face with a teenager,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.850
and comparing notes on
does this work or not,

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.320
going through the
circle of life.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.660
And to share that
with people who

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.910
are not in our core LGBTQ
community is critical.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.530
And I learn a lot
from the process.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.600
SPEAKER 1: And I know that was
the end of my formal questions

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.100
here.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.130
But I know we had some
questions on the Dory.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.710
And I think one of
them in particular,

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.200
just to touch back on a
comment that you made earlier,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.819
was about advice
that you would give

00:27:42.819 --> 00:27:44.110
to young people in your career.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:48.314
And you had mentioned that,
specifically in your career,

00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:50.230
you always found it to
be very helpful to take

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.560
on that big, hairy role that
no one wanted to take on.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.800
So I'd love to hear a little
bit more about sort of the--

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.450
obviously, there's
a huge opportunity

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.550
that comes with taking
on something that's

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.530
challenging and potentially
has high visibility,

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.442
but also a lot of risk
associated with that.

00:28:05.442 --> 00:28:07.150
So I would love to
hear a little bit more

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.330
about how you've also
balanced the risk associated

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.060
with taking some of those
challenging roles along

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.960
with the opportunity.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.710
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.390
And probably taking on
social media at Wells

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.090
was probably the
highest stakes one.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.110
The ones prior to
that were more,

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.410
OK, it's a gap that
needs to be filled

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.290
and I'm going to
go fill that gap.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.510
But in that role, it
was really, really clear

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.250
that the company was
on the wrong path.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.130
And there were huge
issues going on

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.650
that if any auditor
would come in,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:37.412
it would be a flaming disaster.

00:28:37.412 --> 00:28:39.370
In fact, our internal
audit showed up two weeks

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.570
after I started and
freaked me out completely.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.350
So instead of resisting
them, I just brought them in

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.390
and said, OK, here's
everything I've seen.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.280
We have no exit strategies.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.650
We have no strategies
for any platform.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.110
We have no controls,
no governance.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.402
It was just, you name it.

00:28:54.402 --> 00:28:56.110
Everything that would
freak somebody out.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.175
And I took it as an
opportunity to say, audit,

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:01.300
can you help me put this
together in the right way?

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:01.810
And they did.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.768
And they were fabulous.

00:29:02.768 --> 00:29:06.890
And they didn't ding me
too badly on that survey.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:07.990
But it was a huge risk.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.320
And the way I balanced that
is as I took the role on,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.090
I went and talked to several
executives at the company.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.040
And I said, look, a lot of
people see this as play time

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.180
or not serious or
something to be controlled.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.470
And you guys know social
media can't be controlled.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.420
And that was part
of my challenge,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.110
is talking to the
baby boomers who

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.390
are trying to control
the younger generation.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.560
And it was so clear that
you can't control it.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.100
And it's so clear
also in our society,

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.840
things can be right and
wrong at the same time,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.960
depending on what perspective
you take on an issue.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.080
And so translating that was
a critical part of my role.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.640
But I talked to a
lot of executives

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.500
and just said, how do
I take on this effort?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.810
And the resounding feedback that
I got is use risk as the key.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.380
Because if you can outline
all the risks associated

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.600
with what's happening
and how to mitigate them,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.980
they're going to give
you a blank check.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.354
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:30:04.354 --> 00:30:07.310
The company said, OK,
what number do you need?

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.290
And so we opened command
centers on both coasts

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.680
and set up the entire system
the way it should be set up.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.320
And the really unfortunate
thing about that

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.930
is the command centers
weren't used until everyone

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.250
found out about sales practices
issues at the company.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.420
And so that was when the command
centers really came into use.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.844
But I'm glad at least I was
there to put that together

00:30:27.844 --> 00:30:28.510
for the company.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.950
I would have preferred
the company use those

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.660
for something really
positive, as opposed

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.440
to a huge ding for the
brand that they may never

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.300
recover from now.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.120
But that was the
biggest risk in taking

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.250
on something that was hairy.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.510
And I think getting the counsel
of many different people

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.640
and being clear on
what is the role,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.440
and what are the
truths and non-truths,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.180
and how do they
all come together.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.581
And how then can you
articulate it to the audiences

00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:56.080
where it makes
sense, whether that's

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.420
the board of directors
or the employee

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.200
who thinks talking about smoking
joints during office hours

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.760
is a good idea.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.757
We had a lot of that.

00:31:05.757 --> 00:31:07.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:10.840
SPEAKER 1: Well, that's
definitely an interesting note

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.240
to end on for the
formal questions.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.870
But I wanted to open it up
before we go the Dory to anyone

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.520
in the room who would
have a question.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.080
Or we can switch it over.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.830
AUDIENCE: One of the
questions I have is--

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.640
I really admire the
sense of responsibility,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.850
it seems, that you have
as identifying as LGBTQ

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.070
and taking that on.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:39.160
And I'd be curious to know
if there was sort of a moment

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.960
where you felt
that responsibility

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.310
or if it maybe was more
equated to maturity,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.610
or where during your life or
career that you said, wow,

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.920
I really need to make
sure that I use my voice.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.250
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.374
Thank you for the question.

00:31:52.374 --> 00:31:56.290
And I think I would go
back to when I supported

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.700
that large brokerage firm.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.510
And so anybody knowing Wall
Street brokerage firms,

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.320
they're mainly male
and typically 56.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.610
I'm sure that age is higher now.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.340
And pretty much straight with
only very few exceptions.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.490
And so it was in that role
that I realized I really

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.240
need to show up not
only as a female leader,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.720
but also be authentic.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.430
And one of the ways that
that was made easy for me,

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.810
that I should name, is that
having a kid is an equalizing

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.270
force to where you can really
connect with somebody if they

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.000
also have kids and just
talk about their children

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.080
and that situation.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.450
You don't have to name the
family structure or anything,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.140
but it just makes a common--

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.140
you have some
common ground there

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.810
that I found was a
really important platform

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.930
that then I could use to
explain the differences

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.307
between our families when
there were differences.

00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:50.640
I mean, now, thank goodness,
there are so many different

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.110
things, where I'm
actually married,

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.700
as opposed to when we weren't.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.040
And the financial
situations my family

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.640
had were very different from the
people I would be talking to.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.910
And sometimes I had a chance
to do that kind of education,

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.770
you know, that moment.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.639
But it was then when
I realized, OK, I

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:09.180
can create a common ground with
people who probably had never

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.080
talked to a lesbian
leader before, honestly,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.850
or saw them in any
way where there

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.440
was some kind of common ground.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.340
And that's where it cemented for
me that I need to be a leader

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.270
and show up in the right ways.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.470
And then also, as you start
getting older in your career,

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.110
you realize people younger than
you are actually watching you.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.500
And so I feel responsibility
around that, where it's like,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.000
I need to handle myself
in a way that is something

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.980
people would want to follow.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.480
Thank you.

00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:43.970
AUDIENCE: Thank
you again so much

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.370
for coming and talking today.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.840
My question for
you is how do you

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.940
think that the folks
running the LGBT ERGs

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.730
can best engage with more
senior folks, especially given

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.520
that time is frequently
difficult to come

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.950
by as folks get more and
more senior in their career?

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.700
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.120
That's a great question.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.690
And one of the things
that really surprised me

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:11.880
when I joined TIAA last year,
we had a panel, LGBT panel.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.969
And I think it was
on Coming Out Day.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.090
It was October 11 last year.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.690
And what really surprised
me is as the panel started,

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.730
in walked the entire
executive committee,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.190
our CEO and all of his
direct reports except

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.090
for maybe two who
couldn't make it.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.570
And that was the first
time in any of the time

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.312
I've done this,
in the two decades

00:34:31.312 --> 00:34:33.020
I've been playing
around with this stuff,

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.590
that the entire executive
committee joined an LGBT event.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.780
And that just floored me.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.070
And it was really impactful.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.409
It made me realize
TIAA really walks

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.190
the talk around the
importance of all of the ERGs

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.860
because they would do that with
other employee resource groups.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.940
And so I don't think that
is unusual for the company,

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.280
but I think that's something
where you guys should

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.530
ask leadership to
actually join and be

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:02.980
visible in different events
because that goes a long way.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.930
Certain folks might show up
for some events and not others.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.740
It tells a story about
who's not present.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.490
So that would be one
thing, is making sure

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.120
that the leadership is present,
but finding the right network.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.560
So I'm sure within--

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.910
how many employees do
you guys have at Google?

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.015
AUDIENCE: 80,000 or
something like that.

00:35:19.015 --> 00:35:19.410
RENEE BROWN: Oh, really?

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.350
OK, I thought it was
a little bit bigger.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.920
If you think about the
entire organization, have you

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.310
guys mapped out where
the rising leaders are,

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.290
and really making sure
that they have a voice

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.190
and are using their voice
both for LGBT and otherwise.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.120
That's important.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.390
And with talent review--

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.390
I'm sure your company
does talent reviews, where

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.180
people go through and say
who's the upcoming talent.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.540
And they always flag whether
they are in a diverse group.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.000
You've got to advocate to
have a rainbow on there.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.740
And so I'm doing that
now at our company.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.156
It's complicated
because there are

00:35:50.156 --> 00:35:52.550
some legal issues around
it, but if you just

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.500
are showing if
somebody is a female

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.870
and whether they're a person
of color, that's great,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.030
but we also need to have
the LGBT thing there.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.363
Because that's one of the
reasons people don't come out.

00:36:01.363 --> 00:36:02.780
They don't see it
as an advantage

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.560
as they're moving
up in their career.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.850
So advocating as an ERG
to have talent reviews

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.360
include people who are
openly willing to share that.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.840
Because to me, I
hired a friend of mine

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.460
who's an
African-American gay man.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.830
I'm like, that's a twofer.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.190
We need to get double
bonus points for that.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.360
And so anyway, advocating
for that at the company

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.850
is important because
every diverse group

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.970
that somebody has within
them, every additional one,

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.850
is more experience around
things that all of us

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.722
need to learn from.

00:36:32.722 --> 00:36:34.430
So those are some of
the thoughts I have.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.596
But engaging your senior
leadership to attend events

00:36:36.596 --> 00:36:41.504
is a very outward display of
support that I would recommend.

00:36:41.504 --> 00:36:43.670
AUDIENCE: In the vein of
this question that you just

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:50.570
answered, how do you think that
your own rise over the years

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:55.370
have affected your ability to
do what you just said, advocate

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.480
and whatnot?

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.140
RENEE BROWN: I find that I've
been very lucky in my career

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.107
as I've moved up.

00:37:03.107 --> 00:37:05.440
But honestly, I think a lot
of it is a lot of hard work,

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.500
just like all of you have
experienced, that you have

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.150
to do a ton of
hard work and a ton

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.170
of caring for people, and
then doors are open for you.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.900
But having a voice on
LGBT, I'll tell you,

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.270
I've had many situations
where I've come really

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.920
close to not saying anything.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.260
Being the person in the
room saying excuse me,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.990
you just use language that
really isn't appropriate

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.930
and can be offensive to people.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.710
That's important.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.620
But one thing I
would tell you is,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.520
it was about midway
through my career

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.240
that I realized I have less
a voice on LGBTQ matters

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.630
than I do watching out
for my people of color

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.350
because I'm not a
person of color.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.980
I have more of a voice
going after something

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.710
if I see an issue around
that because I have nothing

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.610
to gain in it.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.359
Whereas some people
will see, well, that's

00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:52.780
just the angry lesbian
or the angry gay man

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.200
fussing about something.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.460
So that's why I point out,
how do we help other ERGs?

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.170
How can we give voice to
people who don't have voices?

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.940
And I think that's
where power comes in.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:06.210
So I try to go beyond being
an LGBT leader to being,

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.870
I'm a leader trying
to help diversity

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.570
at the company and inclusion,
which is super critical.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.610
Because when you get to
the point of inclusion,

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.290
it goes to a lot of things
that a lot of companies

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.160
don't talk about.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.510
It gets to how people look.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.270
It gets to their social
class and social status.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.890
It gets to weight.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.050
It gets to-- let's
start naming things

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.810
that cause people to
be in the out group.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.520
That area of
inclusion is something

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.110
that all of us who understand or
have ever been on the receiving

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.480
end of being excluded
for something,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.550
we all have to be a voice
to make sure everyone

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.520
is included in things.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.610
Because that's how
companies do a better job,

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.795
teams do a better job.

00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:43.730
So I'd say yes, I've
had a voice with LGBT.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.810
But I've seen more power helping
other groups that I'm not

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.840
a member of every day.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.360
AUDIENCE: But you
have, over the years,

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.080
more recently, do
you feel like you

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.810
were more or less able to
do that because of the roles

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.402
that you take now?

00:39:00.402 --> 00:39:01.360
RENEE BROWN: More able.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.860
Yeah.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.930
I mean, the more resources you
have, the more budget you have,

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:05.770
it's really great.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.186
Like so yeah, I
can write a check.

00:39:07.186 --> 00:39:09.454
AUDIENCE: But time
is not an issue?

00:39:09.454 --> 00:39:10.870
RENEE BROWN: Well,
I mean, we make

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.710
time for whatever
is important, right?

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.430
OK, good.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.592
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:39:16.592 --> 00:39:18.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:18.496 --> 00:39:19.924
RENEE BROWN: [LAUGHS]

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.250
No, I mean, time
management, it's funny.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.470
We can get as much
done as we prioritize.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.620
Yeah.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.770
So I guess there's something
to be said for if somebody

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.920
is in one of the
companies that you

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.190
work at that's in an ERG at
Google or TIAA or wherever.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.990
Then it's almost that
person is, I guess, already

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.340
in a position of more
privilege than someone else

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.960
because they do have
a seat at the table.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.780
So how do you advocate
for those people,

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.860
whether they're in the queer
community or people of color

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.980
or really any of these
intersectional groups

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.460
who don't have that
seat at the table?

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.220
When we look out at
our ERGs, they're

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.750
not there because for various
reasons in our society,

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.120
they haven't been
afforded that opportunity

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:25.330
to even be here, not having the
access to the social capital,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.770
the educational capital, to
even get somewhere like here,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.790
to have that voice.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.180
How do you advocate for those
people that are basically

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.179
outside of the system?

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:35.720
RENEE BROWN: That's
a great question.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.636
I don't know if I have
an answer for that one.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:38.490
I would love to.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.830
Can you help me figure it out?

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.539
AUDIENCE: I'll try.

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:43.830
RENEE BROWN: That'd be awesome.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.330
Yeah.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.350
But no, I agree with you.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:49.170
As our society has spread
from the haves and have nots,

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.630
it's even more of
an issue, where

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.780
being able to figure out how
to get people out of situations

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.800
where they feel completely
without any power to change

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.020
anything is very hard.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.660
So thank you for the
question, but I--

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.850
yeah.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.010
I don't have an answer.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.740
AUDIENCE: Appreciate the honest
answer because I don't know

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.907
if anyone does have the answer.

00:41:10.907 --> 00:41:12.240
I guess we have to work on that.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.040
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.623
That's what we're thinking the
next generation is going to do.

00:41:17.945 --> 00:41:19.820
Because the next generation
is always smarter

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.569
than the last one.

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:21.120
Yes, sir?

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.090
AUDIENCE: I have
one more question.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.430
So I feel like just
hearing you speak,

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.850
you have this amazing
confidence about your identity

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.920
and sort of your role.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.830
And you talked about
sort of what made

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.900
you come out in the workplace.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.430
But I guess my question
is more, have you

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.700
always had that confidence or
has it developed over time,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.440
especially, I guess, along
with how general perceptions

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.610
of LGBTQ people have changed?

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.360
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.318
That's a good question.

00:41:54.318 --> 00:41:57.470
I mean, I think I've always
enjoyed being a leader

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.400
and have had some level
of confidence, but not

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.940
with myself, personally.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.120
I was probably 26
before I really

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.570
was comfortable with myself.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.080
And I think that whole
process of coming out

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.230
and talking to people and
being honest with people.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.560
Because for so long, I wasn't
fully honest with people.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.349
And yeah, just a funny
story, when I was pregnant

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:23.390
and I'd walk into rooms--

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.670
I had this job where I had to
meet with all kinds of people.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.780
And when you're
obviously pregnant,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.487
it's the same
question every time.

00:42:28.487 --> 00:42:30.070
It's like, oh, Renee,
you're pregnant.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.829
Congratulations.

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:32.120
I didn't know you were married.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.950
And I'd say, well,
I'm not married.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.437
And they would be like,
OK, what do I say now?

00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:38.020
They were like, oh,
she's just a slut.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.343
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.343 --> 00:42:40.670
No.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.790
And then I would just start
talking and helping them

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.502
understand the whole story.

00:42:45.502 --> 00:42:47.960
But I had to do that over and
over and over and over again.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.720
And if I didn't
have to do that, I

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.636
don't think I would have
gotten as comfortable

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:55.710
as quickly because it was
awkward and all of that stuff.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.490
And then it gave me a platform.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.297
And so anyway, it
was almost like not

00:43:02.297 --> 00:43:04.130
being a straight person
is not a good thing.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.921
It's not something
you'd put on your resume

00:43:05.921 --> 00:43:07.380
or that your parents
are proud of.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.800
And so it takes a lot of
years before you're like,

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.510
OK, this is me.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.740
It's who I am.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.440
I'm doing cool stuff.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.560
And I'm good with myself.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.230
So I think it takes actually
being comfortable with yourself

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.620
and getting through all that.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.442
And some people never are.

00:43:24.442 --> 00:43:26.700
Or people around them don't
let them be comfortable

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.610
with themselves.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:31.740
But thank you for the question.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.670
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.620
I don't know if we had
any other questions

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.585
in the room or
questions from the Dory

00:43:36.585 --> 00:43:40.230
that maybe we didn't
cover off yet.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:42.349
RENEE BROWN: The Dory.

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:44.140
AUDIENCE: I can ask
about the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.335
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
that would be great.

00:43:45.335 --> 00:43:46.126
RENEE BROWN: Uh oh.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.192
AUDIENCE: So I think the two
that we didn't really touch

00:43:52.192 --> 00:43:54.400
on-- because we already
touched on what you would say

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:54.520
to someone--

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.353
RENEE BROWN: Advice.

00:43:55.353 --> 00:43:57.870
AUDIENCE: --younger
in your career.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.310
And I think you have
broached this a little bit.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.340
But for sort of
the next generation

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:10.360
of folks who are identified
as queer, which issues do

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.784
you see as highest
priority in the workplace?

00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:14.200
RENEE BROWN:
Education is probably

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.380
the top one because there's
so much confusion around,

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.540
well, what does that
mean if somebody says,

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.387
I'd like to be referred
to as they for somebody

00:44:23.387 --> 00:44:24.220
who's a baby boomer.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.760
And they're like, what in
the hell are you doing?

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.850
What's going on with
the whole pronoun thing?

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.980
And how do we
educate in a way that

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.360
helps people not feel like this
is some sort of change that

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.420
isn't needed.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.200
And so I think that dialogue
across a very different

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.450
perspective is important
for the next generation.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:45.250
I mean, how do you explain a lot
of the continuums people are on

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.890
related to gender and
explain it in a way that

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.500
doesn't completely freak people
out to where they shut down?

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.020
I think that's the biggest
challenge in this space

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.290
because it is change to
some fundamental pieces

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.230
that particularly the
boomer and older generations

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.960
have held as capital T truth.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.450
And our next generation
is questioning

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.140
all of that capital T truth.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.675
And I like that.

00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:09.550
I think it's awesome.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.655
So I would just try to
say, how do we educate

00:45:12.655 --> 00:45:13.780
in a way that's meaningful?

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.660
And I actually have some friends
working on a concept that

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.610
could really help with that.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.110
And it's called identiversity.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:22.720
And it helps understand
all the elements

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.380
of gender, sexual
orientation, expression,

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.440
because all of those things
can be confusing if you don't

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.880
know how to think about them.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.220
And so I'm working with
them to get that out

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.510
into different workplaces
to help explain and get

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:42.850
into gender fluidity isn't
something to be scared of

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.370
and all of that.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.580
But we need to figure out how
to educate, would be my answer.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.820
AUDIENCE: It's kind of tall.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.010
I'm wondering-- it's a
lot of responsibility,

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:55.370
like you said, to educate
people to take moments and think

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:57.320
about what's a
teachable moment, what's

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.714
an appropriate moment
when you hold back.

00:45:59.714 --> 00:46:01.880
What's a question that you
wish people would ask you

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.010
more often that would enable you
a platform that you could speak

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.980
about something that people
are uncomfortable to ask you,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.760
either professionally
or related to LGBTQ?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.110
RENEE BROWN: Yeah.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:18.050
I think differences in
family is one of the ones

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.550
that I find
interesting because we

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.190
didn't know starting a family
what might be different.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.847
And come to find
out, it's really not.

00:46:26.847 --> 00:46:29.180
Because when you have a
teething baby-- somebody in here

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.970
has a teething baby, I
remember talking-- yes.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.730
Doesn't matter if
you're straight, gay,

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.290
anywhere on the continuum,
it's still a teething baby,

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.050
and to be able to have people
that you can come together

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.540
with and ask help for.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.480
So that whole
family piece is one.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.940
But I've had some people ask
some pretty crazy questions.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.930
And so there's always
interest in conception.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.710
It's like, you wouldn't
ask that of anybody else.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:59.875
So there's some extremes people
go to around different things.

00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:02.000
I don't know if there's
ever been a question people

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.470
aren't asking enough about.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.930
But yeah.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.560
Yeah.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.170
But the whole family piece
is probably important.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.780
And definition of families
have changed so substantially

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.890
in our society, where
having an LGBT family, that

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.180
was our experience
in the childbirth.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.270
We thought people might
be weird at the hospital,

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.240
and this was back in 2003.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.525
And it was quite the opposite.

00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:26.150
All the nurses were
like, we're just so

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.564
happy more than
one parent is here.

00:47:28.564 --> 00:47:30.230
Because they have a
lot of people coming

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.320
in who are single parents
going into a situation

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.720
that's going to be really tough.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.136
And so they're
like, we don't care

00:47:35.136 --> 00:47:36.890
what the makeup of
the family is, as long

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:39.587
as there's more people
to help the child, which

00:47:39.587 --> 00:47:40.420
I found fascinating.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.918
It was real interesting
learning for me there.

00:47:43.918 --> 00:47:44.418
Yeah.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.270
Yeah, and I'm also
raising a straight ally.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.280
So I hope I do a
good job with that.

00:47:54.419 --> 00:47:55.210
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.640
Well, thank you again so
much for your time today,

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.290
for being so open, and sharing
all of your stories with us--

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.490
and your thoughts.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.940
