00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.050
Hey y’all Trace here for Ahrgggg!

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.660
Ugh aww man a Charley Horse.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.370
That one hurts.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.950
Hey there horsey charlies, Trace here for
Dnews.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.810
We’ve all had one of those nights when you’re
jolted awake with pains in your leg so severe

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.340
that you’re left temporarily paralyzed.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.360
We've all had that, right?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.680
Scandinavians call this affliction a wooden
leg.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.690
Australians call it a ‘corky’.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.370
Here in the United States we call it a 'charley
horse.'

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.710
But whatever the colloquial term is, the feeling
is universally unpleasant.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.680
I'm not running in my dreams, so what is happening
during these nocturnal leg cramps?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.140
And why, despite all our advances in medicine,
do we still have to deal with them?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.400
Well, just like any other cramp, a charley
horse happens when your muscles suddenly and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.490
involuntarily contract.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.160
This can result in anything from mild twitching
lasting a few seconds to intense throbbing

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.250
pain lasting several minutes.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.320
Not only is the whole thing extraordinarily
painful, but it’s totally out of your control.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.510
During a charley horse, we lose the ability
to relax the affected muscles, and as a result

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.560
we are left powerless, waiting for the pain
to subside.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.249
So, like many things in science, no one really
knows why we get charley horses4.

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.310
Because these cramps are short lived and,
in most cases, harmless, the medical community

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.490
hasn’t invested a whole lotta money in figuring
out a cause.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.920
One possible cause could be simple muscle
fatigue from high intensity exercise or too

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.069
much standing.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.579
Staying in one place for too long, like sitting
at work or on a plane, is also thought to

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.000
lead to cramps.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.700
Another could be dehydration, because when
your body’s fluids are low your muscles

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.310
receive less oxygen and can easily go into
spasm.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.679
And this makes sense, because dehydration
can also lead to an electrolyte imbalance

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.939
which is a likely cause of uncontrolled cramping.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.799
This one makes a lot of sense, because electrolytes
are how our body sends electrical signals

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.450
from the brain to the muscles and tells them
when to relax or contract.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.349
If the balance is off, then those muscles
can “misfire” and contract without the

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.450
ability to relax again..

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
Potassium and magnesium are particularly important
because they play an essential role in muscle

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.950
relaxation.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.810
In fact, it's a little morbid, but... potassium
has been a key ingredient in lethal injection

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.290
mixes because in high doses, it prevents muscle
from contracting - including the heart.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.790
Of course, this would also make it hard to
study, because the imbalance is localized,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.650
and temporary… so scientists would have
to somehow know there was an imbalance and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.349
then be watching the misfire when it happens.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.790
Which is basically impossible.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.560
Anyway, if you get regular charley horses,
some doctors advise that you gradually increase

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.439
your intake of potassium and magnesium to
reduce their risk.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.960
Of course, we’re not doctors, so talk to
yours before you actually do anything.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.220
Since we're not 100 percent sure why these
cramps occur, it should come as no surprise

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.200
that we also don’t have a cure.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.240
But there are some things you can do to get
that horse off your back.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.829
Many people swear by a hot bath or shower,
or a gentle massage to relax the muscles.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.489
And although it may seem counterintuitive
when your muscle is as tense as a horse's

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.209
rear in fly season -- stretching is also said
to be beneficial.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.909
Sidebar: Why the hell are they called Charley
Horses?

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.530
Legend has it was 19th century slang for leg
cramps that affected professional baseball

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.530
players.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.151
Some historians it was named after the horse
“Charley” that pulled the roller at the

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:13.750
Whitesox baseball.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.049
Others point to Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn,
a pitcher who often suffered from the condition.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.400
But in reality it's a big old shrug.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
No one knows.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.530
DNEWS En Español
Did you ever hit that button on the remote

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.590
that says, "SAP" that switches to the "secondary
audio programming" in old TVs -- it usually

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.470
meant the audio was dubbed into spanish.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.800
YouTube doesn't have SAP, so click here to
watch an episode of DNews en Espanol about

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:48.349
what happens if we don't go to el baño.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.540
Besides cramping, what else happens to your
body when you get dehydrated?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.440
Good news, I looked into that too!

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.920
You can find out about it here.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:10.549
So do you get cramps at night?
