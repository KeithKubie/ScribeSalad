the scientific method again that was

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
the scientific method again that was
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.679
the scientific method again that was
talked about this morning and the

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689
talked about this morning and the
 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.729
talked about this morning and the
scientific method was a method for

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739
scientific method was a method for
 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.600
scientific method was a method for
ascertaining the truth and there's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
ascertaining the truth and there's
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.039
ascertaining the truth and there's
several aspects of it that have been

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049
several aspects of it that have been
 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.410
several aspects of it that have been
brought out the fact it's based on trust

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420
brought out the fact it's based on trust
 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.280

be here if you were reading the
literature just but you trust and why do

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
literature just but you trust and why do
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.160

so it's not that you just trust somebody

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
so it's not that you just trust somebody

open transparency and the benefits of
 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.009
open transparency and the benefits of
this have been enormous if you look at

this have been enormous if you look at
 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.659
this have been enormous if you look at
what happened to standards of living for

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669
what happened to standards of living for
 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.509
what happened to standards of living for
literally centuries before that there

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
literally centuries before that there
 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.530
literally centuries before that there
have been no change and the big break

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540
have been no change and the big break
 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.659
have been no change and the big break
was the Enlightenment with the

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669
was the Enlightenment with the
 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.300
was the Enlightenment with the
scientific method we began to learn how

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310
scientific method we began to learn how
 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.789
scientific method we began to learn how
to do things better and that led to

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799
to do things better and that led to
 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.210
to do things better and that led to
increases our standard of living very

it's very disturbing to those of us who
are committed to science and advancement

the best experiment evidence of this you

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370
the best experiment evidence of this you
 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.270
the best experiment evidence of this you
can see is what happened in the 2008

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280
can see is what happened in the 2008

were cheating and lying and when the
 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.420
were cheating and lying and when the
crisis occurred they knew that they

they also knew that they couldn't trust
 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.469
they also knew that they couldn't trust
anybody else so what happened no bank

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479
anybody else so what happened no bank
 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.779
anybody else so what happened no bank
would lend to any other bank and the

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789
would lend to any other bank and the
 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.779
would lend to any other bank and the
whole financial system froze and our

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789
whole financial system froze and our
 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.830
whole financial system froze and our
economies went into the great recession

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840
economies went into the great recession
 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.589
economies went into the great recession
so it is a it was a consequence of the

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599
so it is a it was a consequence of the
 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.950
so it is a it was a consequence of the
breakdown of trust for our democracy

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960
breakdown of trust for our democracy
 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.059
breakdown of trust for our democracy
it's exactly the same thing we talked

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069
it's exactly the same thing we talked
 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.890
it's exactly the same thing we talked
about the rule of law due process well

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900
about the rule of law due process well
 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.240
about the rule of law due process well
all these things require knowing what

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250
all these things require knowing what

all these things require knowing what
some version of the truth is we have we

some version of the truth is we have we
 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.870
some version of the truth is we have we
want out

did somebody commit the murder but we
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.430
did somebody commit the murder but we
also want to know has he been treated

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440
also want to know has he been treated

can't have any system of rule of law we

democracy so the the the importance of

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229
democracy so the the the importance of
 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.969
democracy so the the the importance of
trust for the functioning of our economy

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979

and for the functioning of our democracy
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.149
and for the functioning of our democracy
and our society is absolutely vital now

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159

to me the modern assault on trust and

mentioned that this morning the reason
 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.719
mentioned that this morning the reason
that was so important was so much money

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729
that was so important was so much money
 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.870
that was so important was so much money
was at stake and it was so clear what

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880
was at stake and it was so clear what
 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.730

very serious consequences and
 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.570
very serious consequences and
and that meant people like the Koch

episodes of that one was about a half
 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.670
episodes of that one was about a half
century ago when evidence came that

and the scientific evidence was
 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.070

for the cigarette companies and they
 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.990
for the cigarette companies and they
began an assault on the science they

to do that and then the other episode

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220
to do that and then the other episode
 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.170
to do that and then the other episode
was the attack on evolution which many

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180

is the fragility of truth and what I

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:28.900
is the fragility of truth and what I
 

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.560
is the fragility of truth and what I
want to argue is that actually our

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:31.570
want to argue is that actually our
 

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.149
want to argue is that actually our

that's an example of at least if you

that's an example of at least if you

David gross gave that point this morning
 

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.009
David gross gave that point this morning
that people the liars can give a sense

00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:56.019
that people the liars can give a sense
 

00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:00.509

by the social media I think the answer

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120
by the social media I think the answer
 

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.020
by the social media I think the answer
is unambiguously yes there are many

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.030
is unambiguously yes there are many
 

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.550
is unambiguously yes there are many
things that we can do not necessarily

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560
things that we can do not necessarily
 

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.250
things that we can do not necessarily
perfect fixes but they would make things

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260
perfect fixes but they would make things
 

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.370
perfect fixes but they would make things
much better but here's the problem many

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380
much better but here's the problem many
 

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.710
much better but here's the problem many
of the things that we might do to

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720
of the things that we might do to
 

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.230
of the things that we might do to
correct the problem

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240
correct the problem
 

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.750
