00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I've added 1 more test,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but I've added a bunch of new hands,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and since it seemed to be getting complicated,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I documented what each hand is.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the key point here is one particular hand

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or one particular set of rankings which is a straight

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that goes from ace through 5.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
An ace, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's almost a straight flush, but we just missed, but that's not important.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What's important is that it's a straight

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and that the ace is low,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and this is the only hand or the only set of rankings

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in which the ace counts as a low card rather than a high card,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and in our program, we'll mess that up in 2 ways.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One is we won't even recognize this as a straight

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because we're counting the ace as being a 14, not as being a 1,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so we won't know that it's a straight, and secondly,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
even if we did, we'd want to count the 5 as being the high card

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in this hand, not the ace.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We've got to come up with something to deal with that,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so let's see, what are the possibilities?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, perhaps we want to modify the function straight.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We also want to return the correct hand rank for this hand,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so maybe we have to modify the function hand rank.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And third, the card ranks probably have to change as well.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We want the card ranks for this hand to have

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a 1 for the straight rather than a 14.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And what do you think about the prospects of making 3 changes?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Would you say that that's okay because the changes that you envision making

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
seem to be small ones to the 3 functions?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Would you say it's okay regardless of the size of the change?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That's just the way it is. We have to put up with it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Or would you say we should be able to do better?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And we should look for a solution that doesn't require

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
changing all 3 functions.

00:02:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What would you vote for?
