00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.360
In this first problem
over here, we're

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.780
asked to find out the length
of this segment, segment CE.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.430
And we have these
two parallel lines.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.440
AB is parallel to DE.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.770
And then, we have these two
essentially transversals

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.420
that form these two triangles.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.940
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.850
So the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.080
is that this angle and this
angle are vertical angles.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.870
So they are going
to be congruent.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.650
The other thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.580
is that angle CDE is an
alternate interior angle

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.890
with CBA.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.444
So we have this transversal
right over here.

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:36.110
And these are alternate
interior angles,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.900
and they are going
to be congruent.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.340
Or you could say that, if you
continue this transversal,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.924
you would have a corresponding
angle with CDE right up here

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.340
and that this one's
just vertical.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.440
Either way, this
angle and this angle

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.920
are going to be congruent.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.180
So we've established that
we have two triangles

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.380
and two of the corresponding
angles are the same.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.732
And that by itself is enough
to establish similarity.

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:01.940
We actually could show that
this angle and this angle

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.500
are also congruent by
alternate interior angles,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.007
but we don't have to.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.715
So we already know
that they are similar.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:09.173
And actually, we
could just say it.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.130
Just by alternate
interior angles,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.720
these are also going
to be congruent.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.630
But we already know enough
to say that they are similar,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330
even before doing that.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.770
So we already know
that triangle--

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
I'll color-code
it so that we have

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.470
the same corresponding vertices.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750
And that's really important--
to know what angles

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.550
and what sides
correspond to what side

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.750
so that you don't mess up
your, I guess, your ratios

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.830
or so that you do know
what's corresponding to what.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:48.000
So we know triangle ABC
is similar to triangle--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.540
so this vertex A corresponds
to vertex E over here.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.800
It's similar to vertex E. And
then, vertex B right over here

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.660
corresponds to vertex D. EDC.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.320
Now, what does that do for us?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.050
Well, that tells us that the
ratio of corresponding sides

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.080
are going to be the same.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.140
They're going to be
some constant value.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.950
So we have corresponding side.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.110
So the ratio, for example,
the corresponding side for BC

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.520
is going to be DC.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200
We can see it in just
the way that we've

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.366
written down the similarity.

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.020
If this is true, then BC is
the corresponding side to DC.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:41.310
So we know that the length
of BC over DC right over here

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.090
is going to be equal to
the length of-- well,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.480
we want to figure
out what CE is.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.660
That's what we care about.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.190
And I'm using BC and DC
because we know those values.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.230
So BC over DC is going
to be equal to-- what's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.630
the corresponding side to CE?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.230
The corresponding
side over here is CA.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.200
It's going to be
equal to CA over CE.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.270
This is last and the first.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.440
Last and the first.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.152
CA over CE.

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:18.540
And we know what BC is.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.130
BC right over here is 5.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.055
We know what DC is.

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.190
It is 3.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.090
We know what CA or AC
is right over here.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.700
CA is 4.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.485
And now, we can
just solve for CE.

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:36.450
Well, there's multiple ways
that you could think about this.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.350
You could cross-multiply, which
is really just multiplying

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.430
both sides by both denominators.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.230
So you get 5 times
the length of CE.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.750
5 times the length of CE is
equal to 3 times 4, which

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.810
is just going to be equal to 12.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.280
And then we get CE is
equal to 12 over 5,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.990
which is the same thing
as 2 and 2/5, or 2.4.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.700
So this is going
to be 2 and 2/5.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.730
And we're done.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.570
We were able to use
similarity to figure out

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.740
this side just
knowing that the ratio

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.830
between the corresponding
sides are going to be the same.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.300
Now, let's do this
problem right over here.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.050
Let's do this one.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.633
Let me draw a little
line here to show

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.400
that this is a
different problem now.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.240
This is a different problem.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.700
So in this problem, we need
to figure out what DE is.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.900
And we, once again, have these
two parallel lines like this.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.000
And so we know corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.800
So we know that angle is going
to be congruent to that angle

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.840
because you could view
this as a transversal.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.420
We also know that this
angle right over here

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.290
is going to be congruent to
that angle right over there.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.340
Once again, corresponding
angles for transversal.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.120
And also, in both
triangles-- so I'm

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.530
looking at triangle CBD
and triangle CAE-- they

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.560
both share this angle up here.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.150
Once again, we could have
stopped at two angles,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.730
but we've actually shown that
all three angles of these two

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.340
triangles, all three of
the corresponding angles,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.440
are congruent to each other.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.660
And once again, this is
an important thing to do,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.399
is to make sure that you
write it in the right order

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:21.690
when you write your similarity.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:34.590
We now know that
triangle CBD is similar--

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:50.349
not congruent-- it is similar
to triangle CAE, which

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.140
means that the ratio
of corresponding sides

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.790
are going to be constant.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.460
So we know, for example,
that the ratio between CB

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.000
to CA-- so let's
write this down.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.810
We know that the
ratio of CB over CA

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.662
is going to be equal to
the ratio of CD over CE.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.220
And we know what CB is.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.550
CB over here is 5.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.559
We know what CA is.

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:23.850
And we have to be careful here.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.930
It's not 3.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.380
CA, this entire side is
going to be 5 plus 3.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.300
So this is going to be 8.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.690
And we know what CD is.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.980
CD is going to be 4.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.390
And so once again, we
can cross-multiply.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.020
We have 5CE.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:46.370
5 times CE is
equal to 8 times 4.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.810
8 times 4 is 32.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:57.400
And so CE is equal to 32 over 5.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.590
Or this is another way to
think about that, 6 and 2/5.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.747
Now, we're not done because
they didn't ask for what CE is.

00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.830
They're asking for just
this part right over here.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.210
They're asking for DE.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.680
So we know that this entire
length-- CE right over here--

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.500
this is 6 and 2/5.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.120
And so DE right over
here-- what we actually

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.900
have to figure out--
it's going to be

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.420
this entire length,
6 and 2/5, minus 4,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.790
minus CD right over here.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.140
So it's going to be 2 and 2/5.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.157
6 and 2/5 minus 4
and 2/5 is 2 and 2/5.

00:07:32.157 --> 00:07:32.740
So we're done.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.850
DE is 2 and 2/5.
