00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.190
When you meet someone you shake their hand
and judge them every SECOND YOUR HANDS ARE

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.190
TOUCHING.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.220
Deny it if you want, we all know it's true.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.250
Good morrow, friends!

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.740
Trace here for DNews with a breakdown of an
often studied physical greeting, the handshake.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.859
Handshaking is not at ALL universal, and though
it's spread across the planet thanks to globalization,

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.980
there are places where it's not common and
some where it's not cool.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.470
Regardless, studies have analyzed handshakes
up and down and found we can determine life

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.570
expectancy, and health!

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.470
Handshakes are really important, socially
speaking.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.401
No one is exactly sure where they came from,
you might have heard it came from Rome and

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.430
had to do with not holding a weapon, but that's
a hypothesis, honestly, no one knows.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.570
Even still, people tend to create an immediate
judgement of character when they shake your

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.570
hand.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.990
It's widely known in the business and professional
world, but back in 2012 a scientific study

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.270
in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience revealed
the true power of a handshake in the brain.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.390
Always shake hands.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.409
Always.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.590
Neurologically, it's an extremely positive
non-verbal behavior.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.649
Researchers at MIT found shaking hands is
like a social lubricant, it starts people

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.610
off in a positive light.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.179
In fMRI's on participants' brains, the amygdala
lit up with positive feelings when participants

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.520
observed interactions with handshakes as opposed
to those without them.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.530
Plus, a brand new study in Plos One found
your hand-grip reveals the true age of your

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.530
body.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.799
Because the number of years old you are isn't
an accurate measure.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.259
Everyone knows a 22 year old whose body is
already worn out, right?

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.770
The researchers took 50 worldwide handshake
studies and found a strong correlation with

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.710
age and education level.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.510
Using hand-grip strength to determine the
true age of the body, they found, "a 65-year-old

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.139
white woman who had not completed secondary
education has the same grip as a 69-year-old

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.319
who HAD."

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.639
Basically, white women with higher levels
of education aged slower.

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.270
Which brings us to women and handshakes.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.770
In the year 2000, The Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology found women with a firm

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.860
handshake were less neurotic, more extroverted,
liberal and intellectual!

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.519
I read a few articles discussing women's handshakes
and hand-grip strength, but with practice

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.950
a good handshake is good regardless of sex.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.200
Bottom line, handshakes are not JUST grabbing
and shaking.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.909
There IS such thing as a good and bad handshake.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.470
A study in the Journal of Applied Psychology
found handshakes indicate overall personality

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.470
differences.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.069
For example, people with strong handshakes
scored better in job interviews, and were

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.069
better liked.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.200
The University of Manchester broke down the
shake and found the biggest complaints were

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.340
"sweaty palms, limp wrists, gripping too hard
and lack of eye contact."

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.329
The perfect handshake, according to science
applies to both men and women, and according

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.401
to the studies should be with the RIGHT hand;
have a complete grip and a firm squeeze (but

00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:58.520
not too strong).

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.400
The palm should be cool and dry and you should
shake three-ish times with a medium level

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.670
of vigor.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.840
Overall 2-3 seconds and boom.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840
Done.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.739
What do you think?

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.500
Are handshakes ancient overanalyzed wastes
of time?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.370
Or super important non-verbal queues to someone's
inner self?
