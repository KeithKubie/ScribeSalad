00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.840
 Flipkart is a leading Indian e-commerce company. 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.680
 Its mission statement was always in 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.880
 Find ways to improve 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.180
 Life experiences and lifestyles of Indian users 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320
 By offering the most suitable products at a price 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 The highest quality 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.550
 For all user segments within the country 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.490
 Using technology. 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 One of the most important lessons learned from the user base 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.560
 Is that there are many devices containing 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.480
 Memory capacity less than 1 GB, making customers cancel shopping tours 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.640
 Because their phones do not meet storage or computing requirements 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.550
 So we launched our Android Go app. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.520
 If the pages load more quickly, 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.920
 I can provide this extra time to the user, 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 Which gives him a much better experience 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.680
 During his shopping tour on Flipkart. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 The space required to install the app according to the Android Go guidelines 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.950
 Must be less than 40 MB. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.360
 With some good guidance from the Google team 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 This area has been reduced. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.840
 We use Android Studio Refractor and ProGuard 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.480
 They are useful in reducing the volume 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.920
 Resources and code base. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.170
 We also use WebP 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.160
 Which gives us a reduction of 20% 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.010
 In the size of the images download. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.840
 The instructions we received indicate that the size is relatively specific 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.070
 Must be less than 50 MB. 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.480
 So, we've made a lot of changes to resource allocation 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.440
 In the code base. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.360
 We reduced the cache size from two to half screen. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.320
 We reduced the amount of temporary memory for bitmaps 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.080
 From 4 screens to one screen. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 By working on the Android Go app for Flipkart, 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.160
 Our application has become much faster, 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.560
 And best in performance. 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 And experienced the current user base 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.480
 A 34% reduction in uninstallation rates. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.120
 The crash rate of newer application versions dropped 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.720
 At a rate of ten times less than in older versions, 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 With an average rating of 4.4 or more. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.960
 We have reached this stage after much effort. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.800
 We're excited that with Android Go, 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.560
 We will exceed 200 million downloads very soon 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
 And very easily, because we believe 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 That the next group of users online 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 They will use Android Go devices 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.160
 The appropriate mediator to deal with. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.600
 So if you are an app developer 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.260
 Applications are designed for Indian users, 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 Understand user needs. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.960
 And tried to tailor technology to meet these needs. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 You will then get an application 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.120
 Admire users.
