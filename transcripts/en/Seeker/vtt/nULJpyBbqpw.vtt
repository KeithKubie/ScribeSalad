00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.279
932 deaths from ebola might seem like a lot,
but the real pandemic terror is lurking elsewhere...

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:15.580
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews. Throughout
history, there have always been outbreaks

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.160
of one disease or another. But on occasion,
those diseases are so AGGRESSIVE, so DEADLY,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
that they strike fear into the hearts of human
beings for centuries to come. Here’s a review

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.840
of the top 5 deadliest pandemic diseases --or
diseases that went international-- that humanity

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.369
has somehow survived.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.370
#1: Smallpox - It’s estimated that smallpox
first emerged around 400BC, but it first changed

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.731
history in the 16th century when it killed
off ⅓ of Central and South Americans. In

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:47.140
the 18th century it went on to kill 60M Europeans.
And in the 20th century it killed 300-500

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.079
MILLION people. The disease was viral, causing
spotty bumps all over the body, and it was

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.520
transmitted as easily as facing someone. In
1980, thanks to a worldwide vaccination effort,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.579
the WHO declared smallpox the first and only
disease to be completely eradicated.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.280
#2 is the Bubonic Plague, otherwise known
as the Black Death. The Black Death swept

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.390
in during the 14th century, a bacterium carried
by fleas that caused egg-sized swellings on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
peoples’ bodies called “buboes”. Buboes
meant you had no more than a week to live

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.290
and even being near someone with them could
pass them on. The plague started in China

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.530
and India before spreading to Europe. It killed
between 75 and 200 million people, nearly

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.240
HALF of Europe and a sizeable chunk of the
entire world’s 450 million person population.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.960
#3: The 1918 Flu, AKA The Spanish Flu - which
wasn’t actually Spanish. At the time, during

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.049
World War I, the military was censoring the
news and many people didn’t even know it

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.340
was happening. In Spain, where the news WASN’T
censored, it received tons of press. This

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.799
flu came and went in a terrifying flash, infecting
1 billion people worldwide -- half the global

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.530
population. The flu would fill peoples’
lungs with fluid, targeting the young and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.579
healthy. By 1919 it went as fast as it had
come, having decimated the global population.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.799
#4: Malaria. Malaria is a blood disease caused
by protozoan parasites. The parasite is transmitted

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.209
widely through female Anopheles mosquitoes
- they suck up infected blood and then pass

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.569
it on to the next person they bite. Every
year, there are over 200 million cases of

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.109
malaria worldwide and about 2 million of those
people die. There are drugs to treat it, but

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.799
resistance is spreading.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.680
#5: Lastly, is HIV/AIDS, disease that surfaced
in the 80s and is often sexually transmitted

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.919
because it hides in bodily fluids. HIV decimates
the immune system, making it hard or impossible

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:40.040
to fight off other infections and illnesses.
Over 36M people worldwide have died of AIDS,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.480
most of which were in Africa. 33 years later,
and scientists still haven’t found a cure.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.180
This is just a handful and of course there
have been MANY more - cholera, polio, tuberculosis.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.880
Statistics-wise, the 21st century is a relatively
good time to be alive. Thanks for joining

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.599
me for DNews everyone! I’ll see you next
time.
