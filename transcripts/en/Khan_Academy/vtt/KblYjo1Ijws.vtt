00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.698
- [Voiceover] So we
have the function f of x

00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:04.878
is equal to x to the sixth
minus three x to the fifth

00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.121
and we want to know over what
intervals is f decreasing

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.104
and we're going to do
it without even having

00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:13.104
to graph y equals f of x

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.116
and the way we do that is
we look at the derivative

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.555
of f with respect to x

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.623
and think about, well, when
is that less than zero?

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.774
If the rate of change
of f with respect to x

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:24.945
is less than zero, well
over those intervals

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:26.537
it will be decreasing.

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:28.737
So let's first take the derivative.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:32.582
So f prime of x is going to be equal to,

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.149
just use the power rule here,

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.801
it's going to be six x to the fifth power

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.218
minus five times three is 15 x to the,

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:44.414
let's decrease that exponent by one,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:47.029
x to the fourth power
and so let's think about

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:50.011
when this is going to be less than zero.

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.636
Over what intervals is six x to the fifth

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.803
minus 15 x to the fourth less than,

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:58.532
less than zero?

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:03.654
So let's see, we could factor
out a three x to the fourth,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.463
so three x to the fourth times,

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.729
see if we factor out a
three x to the fourth here,

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.479
we'll just be left with a two x minus five

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:18.358
is less than zero.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.839
Did I do that right?

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:22.025
Let's see, if I were to distribute it,

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.154
three times two is six,
x to the fourth times x

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:27.254
is x to the fifth, three times five is 15

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.848
and x to the fourth, yep, that's right

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:31.837
so if I'm getting the
product of two things

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:34.326
and I want it to be less than zero,

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.978
well, there's only way for that to happen

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:38.188
is that one or I guess you could say

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:39.631
there's two ways for that to happen.

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:41.063
Either the first thing is positive

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:42.591
and the second is negative

00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.561
or the first is negative
and the second is positive

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:46.685
and so let's do that.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:50.834
So either, either three x to the fourth

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:51.751
is negative

00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:54.364
and,

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:58.414
and two x minus five is positive

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:01.531
or,

00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.213
let me just put the or
in a separate color here,

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:07.463
or three x to the fourth

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:10.196
is positive

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.092
and

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:16.052
two x minus five is negative.

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:19.075
So let's see.

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:21.424
This is x to the fourth,
three x to the fourth

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:22.530
being less than zero.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.021
Well, if we divide both sides by three,

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.092
this is just going to be x to the fourth

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:29.796
needs to be less than zero.

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.015
And is there any way for something to be

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:35.184
to the fourth power to be less than zero?

00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:37.393
Well, we're assuming we're
dealing with real numbers here

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:39.601
and any real number to the fourth power

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.581
is going to be greater
than or equal to zero

00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:43.738
so it's actually impossible

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:45.810
for something to the fourth
power to be less than zero.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.191
This thing is never,

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:50.013
this thing is never going
to be less than zero

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:53.244
so we can actually rule
out this first case.

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:56.877
So we can rule out that
first case right over there.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:59.088
And so we're only going
to worry about this case.

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:03.655
So three x to the fourth
being greater than zero,

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:05.820
well, that's going to happen as long as

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.737
x is not equal to zero.

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:10.643
So this is,

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:13.007
because for any other x,
this is going to be true.

00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:14.068
x could be negative.

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.704
You take it to the fourth
power, multiply it by three,

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:17.662
it's going to be greater than zero

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:19.324
so this is really just the condition

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:22.521
that x cannot be equal to zero.

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:24.116
And let's see the second one,

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.628
two x minus five less than zero,

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:29.796
that means two x is going
to be less than five

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.308
and then x

00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:33.391
is less than five halves.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.634
So as long as x is less than five halves

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.893
and x is not equal to zero,

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.617
this thing will be decreasing.

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.660
So if we wanted to write it in terms of,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.606
it we wanted to write it
in terms of intervals,

00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:49.356
we could say x is,

00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:53.358
let me do this in a new color
just to ease the monotony.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.108
So we could say that,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:58.309
having trouble picking a color,

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.686
so we could say that x is less than zero

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:03.519
or zero is less than x

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:07.820
is less than five halves.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.763
So x is less than zero, this
is all the negative values

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:13.417
and then we're essentially
just excluding zero

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:15.770
and then going all the way to,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.736
all the way to five halves

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:19.031
and remember, all I did is say,

00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.667
well, when is our first
derivative negative

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.645
because if the first
derivative is negative

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:26.611
then the rate of change of f
with respect to x is negative

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:30.028
or f is decreasing as x is increasing.
