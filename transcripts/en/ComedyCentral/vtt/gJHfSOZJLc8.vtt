00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.775
(upbeat funk music)

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.381
- Oh hey, are you Brian?

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.248
- Are you David?

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.082
- [David] Yeah.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.283
- Hey.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you so much
for doing this.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:18.885
I really appreciate it.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.286
- It's no trouble to me.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.921
I saw your ad on craigslist.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
I know these storage
lockers well,

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.725
but this does provide
college credit, right?

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well it's unpaid,
the rest is up to you,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.430
but aren't you a little
old to be in college?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.466
- Yeah, I'm trying to finish.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
What had happened was I
went into a coma in my 20s.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.706
I mixed Ambien with a
Terrence Malick movie.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You must have been
in a dark place.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.810
- I was.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.411
A theater.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.879
(tape recorder clicks)
- Basically, I need you

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.915
to interview me for a podcast.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.483
You know, build some buzz.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.751
I was hoping it'd
happen organically,

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.919
but no one booked me on--

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.053
- Okay, how about this?

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.555
David, tell me about...

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.291 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I wrote some
questions for you.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.093
- David,

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:04.230
what do you think of the
current state of comedy?

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.265
- Oh I think it's
great, you know?

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.499
A lot of diversity.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.967
All types of comics now.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
In the old days, it was almost
exclusively funny people.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.005
- Should I laugh?

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.007
- If you want to.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.275
- I'm not gonna laugh.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.110
Okay.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.845
David, why do you think

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
the industry has
scorned you so unfairly?

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.184
- Well I wouldn't say that.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.185 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just think Hollywood doesn't
know what to do with me.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.188 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's like if I was 5%
funnier, I'd be a millionaire,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.923
and if I was 30% less funny,

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.692
I'd be a multimillionaire.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.029
(exaggerated laughter)

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.197
- Okay, David,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.599
the Hollywood establishment

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.702
has clearly marginalized you.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.537 align:start size:81% position:19%
What is it that
they're afraid of?

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.273
- Well, I've always been
kind of a rebel, you know?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.008 align:start size:84% position:16%
And comics today,
they're not like that.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.310
They all wanna be
on T.V., you know.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.778 align:start size:81% position:19%
If you wanna speak
truth to power,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.714 align:start size:81% position:19%
you gotta get your
teeth whitened.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.949
There's no edge, no
defiance anymore.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.352
In comedy or anywhere really.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.820
Well there is one place.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.724
(wheels squeaking)

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.364
(electric guitar music)

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.173
- You lost, pal?

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.741 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, I'm just
surprised I'm at--

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.575
- The library?

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.843
Yeah, it's sick, right?

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.511
Ever since all the
dive bars and clubs

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.714 align:start size:88% position:13%
turned into like cupcake
shops and condos,

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.751
we had to find a new place
to sleep and take shits.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.252
And it's got free internet.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.086
Grab a seat.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.021
- [David] Thanks.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.990
(books bang on the floor)

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.758
- So what's your deal,
man, what do you do?

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.026
- I'm a comedian.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:42.995 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What do you mean, like
a clown or somethin'?

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.697
- Yeah, it's more like a mime,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.198
if a mime talked.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.433
- What's the point of that?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.267
- Exactly.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:49.936
- Right on, I guess.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.440
- How did you get
into this scene?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.407
- You know what man?

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.110
I just stopped givin' a fuck.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.111
- Could you please--

00:02:59.111 --> 00:02:59.946
- Shut up.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.449
- This is a library.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.351
- No, it's not, it's like
a homeless jack off center

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:09.021
that rents films to poor people.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.957
- Look, nobody's happy.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.097
- That was awesome.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.299
Man, 30 years ago, this
is where nerds hung out,

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.402 align:start position:0%
and now it's like the stronghold
of anti-establishment.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:26.272
- "Whatever satisfies
the soul is truth."

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.373
Walt Whitman.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.242
- Well I'm just happy you
guys are here, you know?

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.444
Doin' your thing.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There are no
rules, only options.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.980
- Whitman?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.948
- Nah.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:36.783
Jerry.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.321
(fly buzzes)

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.321
- Is he dead?

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:43.323
- I hope so.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.457
- Cool.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:49.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So there are cool
people at the library?

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.664
- Not really, well there
was this one guy, Jerry,

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.099
who seemed kinda fun.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.602
- The guy that did heroine?

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:57.437
- Yeah.
