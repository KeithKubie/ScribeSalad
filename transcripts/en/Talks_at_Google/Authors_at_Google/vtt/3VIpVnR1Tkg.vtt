CATHY CHEN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm Cathy Chen, and I am
a product manager here

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.890
in Cambridge.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.660
I just wanted to kind
of express how excited I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.520
am to bring Debbie here to
Cambridge to talk to all of us.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.110
I'm actually a grad student at
Columbia University full time

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.080
in a masters degree
program in something called

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.910
organizational psychology.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.130
And one of the things
that we cover there

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.140
is leadership and a lot of
things around gender, also

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.470
negotiations.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.130
So I've had the privilege
of having Debbie

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.370
as a lecturer for my course.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.780
And so my class actually
ranges from people

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.330
who are politicians,
like there's

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.460
a mayor of a small
town in Connecticut,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.970
all the way through like a
chief of staff to a senator.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.830
And then there's other people
who are like chief of IT

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.530
for a hospital,
that kind of thing.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.560
And even then in that class,
like of very experienced

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.610
people, everybody learned
something about negotiations

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.020
when Debbie was there.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.069
So another day during
class, Debbie actually

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.360
talked a little bit more
about diversity and leadership

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.160
training.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.330
And so I'm really
pleased to have her here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.010
to talk a little bit about both.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.940
Debbie is a Deloitte
Ellen Gabriel Professor

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.430
for Women in Leadership
Emerita-- she doesn't look

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.810
retired, but she is-- and a
distinguished research fellow

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.740
at the Center for
Gender in Organizations

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.410
at Simmons School of Management.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.820
And for those of you who
don't know much about Simmons,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.770
the center is actually funded
by the Ford Foundation.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.050
From 1991 to '94, Debbie
was executive director

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.790
of the Program on Negotiations
at Harvard Law School.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090
And she currently
is a senior fellow

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
of that program, where she
co-directs the negotiations

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.120
at the Workplace Project.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.400
She's also an adjunct professor
at INSEAD business school

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.380
in Fontainebleau, France.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.290
Debbie runs women's
executive leadership programs

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.980
for places like Time Warner
and Deloitte and Deutsche Bank.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.120
And using what she's
observed about executives

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.800
there in these
leadership programs,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.180
Debbie has integrated those
stories into this book.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.180
So the book is based on
women's real-life examples.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.190
She's also written
many books and articles

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.390
about conflict and mediation and
is an authority on negotiation.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.890
So today, she's here to
talk about her fourth book

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.790
on negotiations and gender.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.509
And if you want
more any information

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.300
about those other books
that she's written,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.910
you can find her bio
and the website link

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.100
on Go Negotiating at Work.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.610
There's also a Dory there
if you have questions,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.880
and she's going to talk
for about half an hour

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.560
and then take
questions at the end.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890
So with no further ado,
here's Debbie Kolb.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.160
DEBORAH KOLB: Thank you, Cathy.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.128
Can you hear me?

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:52.090
God, this is hard.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.340
The light is right in my eyes.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.200
I'm delighted,
actually, to be here.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.480
In preparation, I read
the book about Google

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.340
by your former CEO and
Jonathan Rosenberg.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.400
And I can tell you, negotiation
is an important part of work

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.690
there, it seemed to me.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.310
So let me just place
this book in context

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.740
before I sort of talk about
some of the principles

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.500
of negotiation that
are in the book.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.200
So I've written a lot of
books about negotiation.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.480
The one that was most well
known was something called

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.930
"The Shadow Negotiation."

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.140
And in that book, what I
did was I looked at-- we

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.200
know about getting to yes,
about principles of mutual gains

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.580
negotiation.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.220
In "The Shadow
Negotiation," I talked

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.460
about building relationships and
how you advocate for yourself

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.690
and connect with others.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.670
And so that book
has done quite well.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.880
It came out in paperback
with a different title.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.040
But through my leadership
development activities,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.910
both leadership programs
for women, but also more

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.920
generally-- so Cathy's
program is obviously

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.970
a mixed group-- I
really started to see

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.050
how experienced
leaders manage some

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.040
of the challenges of
internal negotiation.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.790
And the actual
motivation for this book

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.700
came from-- I run a program
in Chicago that brings people

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.110
from different companies
for several module

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.600
program on the academic
advisor, and I teach in it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.082
And at the end of one
of these programs when

00:04:24.082 --> 00:04:25.540
you're saying
goodbye to everybody,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.490
and everybody is
hugging and kissing,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.330
this woman came up
to me and she said,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.600
the negotiation
module change my life.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.590
I'm thinking, wow, that's
really pretty terrific.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.540
There must be a story here.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.670
And so she told me her story,
and from her setting this idea

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.250
in motion about stories, I
started to collect stories

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.960
from experienced practitioners.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.850
So this is a book about stories
from experienced practitioners.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.020
I've done a lot of
work on this topic

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.241
before when I've interviewed.

00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.990
But this is a different
book, because it's

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.530
got these stories in
it from practitioners.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.750
So let me ask you a question.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.672
How many of you would
describe yourselves--

00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:09.130
so this is a question
that I always

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.963
ask at the beginning
of a leadership program

00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:12.590
that I teach in negotiation.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.230
I ask the question, how
many have you would describe

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.680
yourself as successful
in dealing with clients,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.830
customers, suppliers,
places where

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.700
you are acting as an agent,
either for your group

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.780
or for Google?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.780
How many of you would describe
yourself as successful in that?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.750
OK.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.880
And then I can ask-- I have
no way of verifying this--

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.940
what makes you successful?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.310
So what makes you successful?

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.810
Yeah?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.030
AUDIENCE: The ability to
accomplish your original goal.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.655
DEBORAH KOLB: Yeah,
so being positioned

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:45.500
to accomplish your goals.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.679
And what makes you get into a
position to accomplish that?

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:50.970
AUDIENCE: Largely relationship.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.303
DEBORAH KOLB: OK, so you build
relationships with people

00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:54.210
externally.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.540
What else makes you successful?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.720
What else makes you successful
when you act as an agent?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.415
Yeah?

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.970
AUDIENCE: I'm really nice.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.050
DEBORAH KOLB: You're nice.
[LAUGHS] What does that mean,

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.250
nice?

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.812
You're collaborative?

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:13.270
You're willing to
make concessions?

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.103
What does nice mean?

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:15.790
AUDIENCE: I'm willing
to talk to people.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.957
I like to listen to them.

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:18.790
DEBORAH KOLB: OK, so
you're a good listener.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.915
Right, you're trying to
find some kind of agreement

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:22.570
that both of you are happy with.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.670
So that means nice.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.621
What else makes you successful?

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.120
?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.998
Yeah

00:06:28.998 --> 00:06:32.600
AUDIENCE: Knowing who to go to
[INAUDIBLE] person situation.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.080
DEBORAH KOLB: Right, so
knowing the right people.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.590
People always say, I'm
very well prepared.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.870
I know the right people.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.410
I know what they're
likely to do.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.590
I'm very well prepared
under those circumstances.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.880
I listen.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.050
I look for mutual
gains, agreements.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.410
I assume that's
what's behind nice.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.590
And so then I ask
the question-- that's

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.740
negotiating as an agent, what
I call this capital letter N

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.040
Negotiation.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.350
And then I ask the
question, what's

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.810
different when you're
negotiating for yourself?

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.140
You're not an agent.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.090
You're what we call a principle.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.822
So what's different when
you negotiate for yourself?

00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:11.530
What's different?

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:16.960
Nothing?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.192
It's the same?

00:07:18.192 --> 00:07:20.687
AUDIENCE: It's not usually
as mutually beneficial.

00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:21.520
DEBORAH KOLB: Sorry?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.610
AUDIENCE: It's not usually
as mutually beneficial.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.776
DEBORAH KOLB: It's not so
clear how you can discover

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:26.950
what's mutually beneficial.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.230
It might depend
on the situation.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.500
What else is different?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.000
Yeah?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.749
AUDIENCE: I think
people react differently

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:37.120
when they see someone asking for
something on behalf of others

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.040
versus for themselves.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.050
DEBORAH KOLB: Right,
because what do they see?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.163
So what do they see and
then what do you feel?

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:44.696
AUDIENCE: Even if
you don't feel it,

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:46.320
it's easy to feel
like, oh, I shouldn't

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.850
be asking [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.420
Even if you don't, people
just see it differently.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.680
DEBORAH KOLB: And so
they see it differently

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.596
and you sort of incorporate
that a little bit.

00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:57.860
You can feel a little
bit greedy asking, right?

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.830
And so it might make negotiation
a little bit more emotional.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.590
What else?

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.033
AUDIENCE: All the
emotions can run

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:04.957
higher if you feel
like a personal attack,

00:08:04.957 --> 00:08:08.330
if you feel like an imposition.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.930
DEBORAH KOLB: We're
bothering people.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.660
It's just sort of much
harder in negotiating

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.700
with this what I call this sort
of lowercase n negotiations.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.540
It's hard to get
negotiations started.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.030
We don't have a
structure for doing it.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.832
It's often hard to figure out
what you want in this context.

00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:28.540
When you're capital
letter N Negotiating,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.580
it's pretty clear about
what you're going after.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.140
You might change your ideas.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.848
But when you're
negotiating for yourself,

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:35.669
sometimes it's hard to do that.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.669
It might be hard to
stay in the negotiation.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.349
Yeah?

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:39.515
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:42.057
When you say lowercase
n negotiation,

00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:45.640
are you referring to both
parties being individuals,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.348
or are you referring
to where one of them

00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:49.806
is an individual or principle
and the other one is actually

00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:50.562
an organization?

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:52.020
DEBORAH KOLB: I'm
actually thinking

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.850
about-- you could be
negotiating-- what's

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.190
an example of you as a little
n negotiation negotiating

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.560
with an organization?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.300
AUDIENCE: Well,
one, for example,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.734
say you're negotiating
a salary increase.

00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:05.538
It's an example of
where you're not really

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:08.887
negotiating with your
superior as an individual.

00:09:08.887 --> 00:09:11.172
You're negotiating with
them as a representative

00:09:11.172 --> 00:09:12.569
of the larger--

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:14.110
DEBORAH KOLB: But
it manifests itself

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.920
as an individual
negotiation, right?

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.620
The position they take
is they are representing

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.260
the total organization,
and when they

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.847
respond to what
you ask for, that's

00:09:21.847 --> 00:09:22.930
what they're representing.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.710
But it actually is two
individuals actually sitting

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.327
down and negotiating.

00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:27.910
Is that right?

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.365
AUDIENCE: But how would
that be any different

00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:31.365
from an uppercase N
Negotiation, where it's still

00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:32.531
two individuals negotiating.

00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:34.700
DEBORAH KOLB: Well, that's
what I'm asking you.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.530
Is it different?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.300
AUDIENCE: Well,
I would think so.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.110
Because--

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.290
DEBORAH KOLB: Because in the
first situation, in capital N

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.740
Negotiation, you are
representative negotiating

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.840
with a representative.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.920
In lowercase n
negotiation, you're

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.110
negotiating on behalf of
yourself as an individual.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.730
And you might
negotiate with somebody

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.060
who's representing something
else, but you're the agent.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.350
And so, is it different?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.370
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.010
I guess what I'm trying to ask
is that are you distinguishing

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.110
the two cases where
you as an individual

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.310
and negotiating with an
organization versus you

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.110
as an individual--

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.720
DEBORAH KOLB: I'm distinguishing
when you are negotiating

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.080
on behalf of yourself.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.885
I don't care who you're
negotiating with.

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:19.250
AUDIENCE: All right, got it.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.666
DEBORAH KOLB: It
could actually be

00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:22.760
buying a car, could be
a little n negotiation.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.468
You're negotiating
with a car dealership,

00:10:24.468 --> 00:10:26.218
but you want the best
price, and it's you,

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:27.676
unless you're
negotiating on behalf

00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:30.070
of your parents, your children,
your spouse, or somebody.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.590
You're negotiating
as a principle.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.220
So the thing that's
important to me

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.170
is who you are in
those negotiations.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.590
We'll also talk about who
the other person is as well.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.930
So let me ask you some
questions about what

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:48.486
kinds of little n negotiations
do you have at Google?

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.610
What do you negotiate about
when you're negotiating

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.860
for yourself at Google?

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.370
What kinds do you have?

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.030
AUDIENCE: Who gets
assigned a bug.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.950
DEBORAH KOLB: Who gets assigned
a bug. [LAUGHS] So work, right?

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.470
What else?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.380
And you have a preference
about that or not, right?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.150
AUDIENCE: Not me.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.410
[LAUGHING]

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.280
DEBORAH KOLB: What?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.088
What did you say?

00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:07.084
AUDIENCE: Not me.

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.000
DEBORAH KOLB: You don't
want to get it, right?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.931
OK, what else do you negotiate
about, little n negotiations

00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:12.430
at Google?

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.990
Yeah?

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.790
AUDIENCE: Career development
or growth opportunities.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.050
DEBORAH KOLB: Yeah,
career development,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.280
growth opportunities.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.390
Those are negotiations.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.750
You're trying to get
things that you can do.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.722
That's a little a negotiation.

00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:29.430
You're negotiating on
behalf of yourself.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.759
What else do you negotiate for?

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:33.050
AUDIENCE: A desk where you sit.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.356
DEBORAH KOLB: A desk to sit, OK.

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:36.730
I didn't really
think about that,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.230
but I guess that that would
be true, a desk, where to sit.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.470
What else?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.450
AUDIENCE: Also flexible
work arrangements.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.116
DEBORAH KOLB: Flexible
work arrangements

00:11:44.116 --> 00:11:45.350
can be that as well.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.100
So I think as we
go through this,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.520
it would be useful for you to
have in your mind a little n

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.927
negotiation that you
might be struggling with.

00:11:52.927 --> 00:11:54.510
So that as we talk
about it, you might

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.710
be able to think about it.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.520
So what I want to
do is add gender

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.269
to our story of
little n negotiations.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:03.560
And I want to say a few things.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.810
So we have a class here.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.320
Gender is not just about women.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.710
And when I talk
about gender, I'm

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.084
not talking about
the differences

00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:12.320
between men and women.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.630
I'm talking about what we
call second-generation gender

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:21.320
issues, that is, policies and
practices and culture that

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.780
on its face looks
natural and neutral

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.940
but can have differential
impacts on men and women

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.760
and different groups
of men and women.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.310
And I always like to say
when we talk about women

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.430
and these issues, I
always like to say

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.680
it's like the
canary in the mine,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.840
that we sort of understand
some of the issues that

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.360
might be affecting a minority
group, which is true at Google,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.660
might have implications for
the majority group as well.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.570
So one of the ways we like
to talk about what it means

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.670
to talk about second-generation
gender issues,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.830
is to use the example
of the US Capitol.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.260
So the US Capitol was
built in the 1800s.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.270
100 And of course
when they built it,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.770
they had no ladies
rooms, because they

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.150
had no ladies, right?

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.750
And in 1917, the first
woman was elected

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.620
to the US House
of Representatives

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.380
and in 1932, the
first to the Senate.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.220
Prior to 1962, congresswomen
shared a single bathroom

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.040
far from the chamber,
even though there

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.120
were many in the House.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.300
In 1992, the women
senators were given

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.600
restrooms on the same floor
as the Senate chamber.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.950
In 2011, four stall bathrooms
were put in the House.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.410
And in 2013, they actually
put women's restrooms

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.220
in the Senate near
the chamber when

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.140
there were 20 women senators.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.270
And so the idea is that nobody
was doing this explicitly

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.950
to discriminate.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.090
It just was there were no
women, and so there wasn't

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.330
need for a women's restrooms.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.910
And that's sort of the idea
about second-generation gender

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.760
issues.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.610
That is, they come
into existence

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.850
because they fit the
lives and the work styles

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.200
of a certain majority group.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.412
And we don't think about
how it works for people

00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.620
that aren't in that majority.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.670
So let me give you some
examples about where

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.890
negotiation comes in there.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.140
The first is people
are offered jobs

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.010
that they don't want to take,
like fix the bug, right?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.820
And you're expected to say yes.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.300
And so what are some of those?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.440
Well, in financial
service organizations,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.670
it is often the
case that women get

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.830
assigned managerial operational
jobs, that is, run the office,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.780
run a country.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.110
And there's not a
lot of value to that.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.590
Obviously the value is in
sales in financial services.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.144
Or in a major manufacturing
company I know of,

00:14:45.144 --> 00:14:47.060
women get channeled into
human resource roles,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.440
because the idea, the belief is
if they're in operations, which

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.180
is really the
privileged place, they

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.000
won't be able to manage it
because of work and family

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.510
issues.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.180
Or in professional
services firms,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.500
women often get put in
chief of staff roles, right?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.350
And the key thing there is
you're asked to do something,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.440
you might not want
to do it, and so

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.270
the key is how you
negotiate to make it

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.660
fit with what you want to do.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.650
The second is we have
outdated job criteria.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.170
So often people
aren't on the screen.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.530
So somebody mentioned
negotiating for opportunities,

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.860
and that's one of
the things there.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.170
So in one organization,
people say, hire like me.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.817
At a certain level
in an organization,

00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:30.400
people don't know
exactly what they're

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.820
looking for in leadership.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.540
So the best thing is,
let me find someone

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.200
who looks just like me, right?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.430
And so if you don't fit that, if
you don't look just like that,

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.360
it's up to you to negotiate
for that opportunity.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.194
I do a lot of work in Africa.

00:15:43.194 --> 00:15:44.735
And there is a story
about this woman

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.040
who lived in rural Nairobi.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.010
She's a PhD scientist.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.850
And all the important
work was in Nairobi.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.090
But nobody ever offered
her an opportunity

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.140
because they assumed
she wouldn't move,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.770
that she wouldn't leave her
family that was in rural Kenya.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.070
Or another woman
who picked up work

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.220
when her boss left
and was actually doing

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.211
the work of a vice
president, and she did it

00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:06.710
for three months,
but nobody thought

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.670
to offer her the actual role.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.590
So she had to negotiate it.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.382
Women often get asked to
do more invisible work.

00:16:14.382 --> 00:16:16.340
There was just a column
in the "New York Times"

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.670
by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam
Grant about housework at work,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.526
being asked to do things
like mentor other people.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.150
I think this happens
for people who are

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.360
different as well, diversity.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.080
Mentor other
people, run a group,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.250
be on the diversity committee,
all those kinds of things

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.530
that are extra work and they are
presumed that you will do it.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.250
It's invisible work.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.084
And so part of the challenge
there is negotiate value.

00:16:43.084 --> 00:16:44.500
And one of the
things that we know

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.310
is that when people
do invisible work,

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.110
it actually has a benefit
for organizations.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.920
And so we have to
claim value for that.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.810
Integrating work
and family, right?

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.830
So somebody said flexible
work arrangements.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.700
Well, it isn't just
flexible work arrangements.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.660
We have this vision
of the ideal worker,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.860
and boy, the ideal worker
at Google is alive and well.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.770
I think you're supposed to
be there all the time, right?

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.260
The heroic stories
in this book were

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.950
about people who worked long
weekends and long nights

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:12.900
to do all the work.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.550
So if you have family
responsibilities,

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.819
that becomes sort of an issue.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:20.254
And the way is, how do you
negotiate to make that work?

00:17:20.254 --> 00:17:22.170
One of my favorite stories
is about this woman

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.839
who was in procurement
in and oil and gas.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.070
And to get promoted, you had
to relocate, in this situation,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.290
to Ghana.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.540
And she had a family.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.600
She didn't want to live
in Ghana for three years.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.700
But what she was
able to negotiate

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.040
was sort of a
commuting relationship

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.835
so that she was in Ghana
for a few weeks at a time

00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:42.510
and then would
come back to Dallas

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.420
and go back, so negotiating
to make work arrangements work

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.650
in the face of expectations
about the ideal worker.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.020
And the final thing is
about mandate for change.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.390
So there's this research
that's about the glass cliff.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.620
And here's the story.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.670
The story is that when
organizations are not

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.460
doing well, the
likelihood that a woman is

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.650
going to be put in a senior
leadership role goes up, right?

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.570
Think Marissa Mayer.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.630
Think Mary Barra
at General Motors.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.830
Think Meg Whitman
at Hewlett Packard.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.590
And so the glass cliff
means that you're

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.124
put in charge of these
risky enterprises.

00:18:21.124 --> 00:18:22.540
And I guess the
reason it's called

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.990
a glass cliff is if you
succeed, great, if not,

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.600
you're off the cliff.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.860
But the idea is when you take
on one of these risky roles,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.910
you need to
negotiate for support

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.904
so if it doesn't do all that
well, you're sort of protected.

00:18:38.904 --> 00:18:41.070
So what I want to do is
talk about three challenges.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.262
I've spent a lot of time
talking about the context.

00:18:45.262 --> 00:18:47.720
So I want to talk about three
things-- getting negotiations

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.803
off the ground, because
the structure doesn't look

00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:53.410
the same in little
n negotiations; get

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.980
their situation, that is, really
trying to understand where

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.300
they're coming from; and
dealing with their resistance

00:18:59.300 --> 00:18:59.870
to change.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.947
So here's the challenge.

00:19:05.947 --> 00:19:07.780
"Excuse me, I'm here
to talk about resources

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.530
for my project." "Yeah, later."

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.250
So little n negotiations
don't have a structure, right?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.249
You have to construct
them out of whole cloth.

00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:20.290
So what are some of the
ways you get negotiations

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:20.914
off the ground?

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.480
There are two major ways that
we write about in the book.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.820
There are others as well.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.050
The first one is to
make your value visible.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.330
People negotiate
with you because you

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.580
have something they want.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.230
And you need to make it visible
in what we call a currency that

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.900
matters to them.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.460
So it isn't just
that you work hard.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.300
It's what they think about
that matters to them that

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.230
makes a difference.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.300
Because you're trying to build
in some kind of reciprocity.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.670
That is, you're trying
to get them to the table.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.944
So let me tell you a story.

00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:54.860
This is about a woman.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.070
She was a director of external
relations at a very large

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.300
Midwest manufacturing company.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.800
And she was asked by people in
another division-- they were

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.900
the legislative
division-- to help

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.450
save a really important client
that they had at the state

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.950
level.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.540
They were about to
lose the client,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.910
and it was going to be a very
big-- this is a company that

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:23.920
supplies resources, all
kinds of equipment and stuff

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:30.230
to companies and businesses and
buildings, stuff for buildings.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.090
And so she did it.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.540
She helped.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.430
She saved this client.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.940
She got a huge amount
of kudos, presented

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.560
to the board, the CEO.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.920
It was terrific.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.010
But then they kept asking
her to keep doing it.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.180
They would call her
up, and they would say,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.210
we need your help
again in another state.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.840
And she really liked to
help, so she would help.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.870
But she found that
she was spending

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:58.517
a lot of time doing this
work, and it was not her job.

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:00.850
So the first thing that she
did is she goes to her boss,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.810
and she tries to make her value
visible in a currency that

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.790
matters to him.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:10.970
So she costs her contribution,
how much time she's spending

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.630
and what it costs.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.260
And then she talks
about what how

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.930
she's really saved the client,
what a benefit it has been.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.330
So she makes her value
visible in what she thinks

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.980
is a currency that has value.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.500
And he says, it's terrific,
but the time isn't right.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.495
You need to be patient.

00:21:31.688 --> 00:21:33.146
So that's making
her value visible.

00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:34.330
It didn't actually work.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.020
So the second is
using your leverage.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.704
And what do we mean
by your leverage?

00:21:38.704 --> 00:21:40.370
Well, there is a
concept in negotiation.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.810
Probably many of you know it.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.270
I mean, I think a lot of you
have taken negotiation courses

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.370
here at Google.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.860
The concept of BATNA--
everybody know BATNA?

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.030
Your Best Alternative To
a Negotiated Agreement--

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.180
you ask yourself, what happens
if I can't reach agreement

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.680
here?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.390
What am I can be forced to do?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.680
What are they going
to be forced to do?

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.390
So in her situation,
her BATNA is what?

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.170
What's her alternative
if she can't

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.242
get her boss to negotiate?

00:22:09.242 --> 00:22:09.950
What's her BATNA?

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:15.190
It's actually to stop doing
the work for this other group.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.810
But she does it in a way that
we call smoothing out your BATNA

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.450
so it isn't so abrupt or
so threatening, maybe.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.370
So the first thing that she
does is she uses questions.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.590
She goes to this other group
the next time they ask her,

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.100
and she says, this is really
taking too much of my time.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.460
I'm really concerned.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.420
How will you handle this
if I don't do it, right?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.830
So she's letting them know
about her alternative,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.920
but she's doing it in a
way that's very engaging.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.029
And so they say, well,
there is somebody that's

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:47.820
supposed to be handling
it, but that person

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.980
doesn't do a very good job.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.570
So I don't think it
would really work for us.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.570
We really do need you.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.752
Then she says to them,
let's focus on the purpose.

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.460
I always like to say,
you want to connect

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.060
what's good for you to what's
good for the organization.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.760
And so she talked
to them about why

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.280
it would be good for her to have
this work as part of her job.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.400
And they say,
right, it would be.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.740
And so they become her ally.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.880
And they go to her
boss and they say,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.210
we really need-- this
woman's name was Isabel--

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.470
we need Isabel to do this.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.680
And that gets her
boss to the table.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.730
So she gets him to the table.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.660
They reorganize her job.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.780
She now has the legislative
part as part of her work.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.310
And the key thing was is
that she used her alternative

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.379
with somebody else who could
act as an ally for her.

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:38.670
So I'm interested-- do you
have problems getting people

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.700
to the table?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.186
And what kinds of
things have you used?

00:23:42.186 --> 00:23:43.840
What are some of
the things you've

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.870
used to get people to the
table to negotiate with you?

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.600
AUDIENCE: So in a
salary negotiation,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.210
I used an offer from
another company.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.043
DEBORAH KOLB: Right.

00:23:52.043 --> 00:23:54.660
So there's a really
interesting way to do that.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.691
In the book we call it
smoothing out your BATNA.

00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:58.190
So one of the things
you can say is,

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.650
I have this other offer, right?

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.500
That's just letting
them know your BATNA.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.370
Smoothing out your
your BATNA is saying,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.040
I have this other offer,
but I'd much rather

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.320
stay at Google, right?

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.200
So you let them know
about you BATNA,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.270
you do it in a very
engaging kind of way.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.710
And I think this idea about
smoothing out your BATNA

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.910
is a really nice concept.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.350
It lets people know
you have alternatives,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.920
but you do it in
a way that I think

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.669
is consistent with a
collaborative culture

00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:28.730
at Google.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.090
Any other things that people
have used to get people

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.070
to the table with them?

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.240
Nothing else?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.460
No other hints?

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.270
OK, well hopefully
you'll use some of these.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:43.880
No?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.510
OK.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.870
So let me go to the next
point that I want to make,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.390
which is the idea about
getting who they are

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.410
and what they want.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.570
So we had this sense
that in negotiation, we

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.940
want to focus on people's
interest to come up

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.140
with mutual gains agreements.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.640
But there's more
behind what people

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.134
want than just the issues
that are on the table.

00:25:08.134 --> 00:25:09.550
The person you're
negotiating with

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.580
considers him or herself in
the context of the larger

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.540
organization.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.517
So for example, if you're
negotiating salary,

00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:17.850
if somebody is going to give
you a salary that you want,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.390
they want to think about,
what's the implication of this

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.130
to other people, right?

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.880
So this notion of how they
think about themselves in

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.790
relation to the things
that they might give you.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.950
And so I usually like
to put this slide up,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.890
because one the things
we think about is we

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.080
tend to see ourselves
as the heroes

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.190
and heroines of our stories.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.720
So we like to say
we're strategic,

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.250
we take the long-term
perspective,

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.160
we see the big picture, we
act in the organization's best

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.019
interest, we're flexible
and collaborative.

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:49.810
They, on the other
hand, are opportunistic.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.976
They're short-term thinkers.

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:52.010
They have narrow vision.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.249
They're out for themselves,
rigid and uncooperative.

00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:56.540
And I have to tell you, nobody
wakes up in the morning,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.700
looks at him or herself
in the mirror, and says,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.533
I'm opportunistic, I'm
a short-term thinker,

00:26:00.533 --> 00:26:03.454
I have narrow vision, I'm
out for myself and are rigid.

00:26:03.454 --> 00:26:04.870
Everybody thinks
they're operating

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.260
on that left-hand
side, that what they're

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:13.340
doing and responding to you
is legitimate and strategic

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.110
in their view.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.940
So what I like to say is
when you think about getting

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.780
their perspective, is to
think about their good reasons

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:30.230
for saying no to you, good
reasons on that left-hand side.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.470
What were their good reasons
for saying no to you?

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.640
Because that's the hidden agenda
of any of these negotiations,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.140
right?

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.180
It's their reasons
for saying no.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.740
So let me tell you
the story actually

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.780
about the women I told you
about right in the beginning.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.290
So she's a vice president,
chief financial officer

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.910
of a division of
an energy company.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.770
And the condition of taking this
job was that she move to Texas.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.670
And she moved to Texas, and
she was there for two years.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.206
And her family said at
the end of two years,

00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:02.580
we're going back
to Pennsylvania,

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.892
which is where they were
from, with or without you.

00:27:05.892 --> 00:27:07.850
And that's what she said
to me, the negotiation

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.431
changed my life.

00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:12.180
Because what she
recognized, first of all,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.280
was that she had leverage.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.060
And her leverage was that
the chief financial officer

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.410
of the company relied on her to
have a relationship with people

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.160
in the field.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.381
So that made her feel like
she had value to negotiate.

00:27:24.381 --> 00:27:25.880
The second thing
that she did, and I

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.730
think this is really
important-- when

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:33.310
you raise an issue in a little n
negotiation, chances are you're

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.490
raising a problem.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.020
And when you raise a
problem, you're the problem.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.860
And so it really makes sense
to come in with good options.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.690
We call it in the book
anchor with options.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.180
Because if you anchor
with options, you come in,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.735
and it frames the negotiation.

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.360
So let me tell you
what this woman did.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.380
Her name is Cheryl.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.869
So Cheryl negotiated with
the chief financial officer.

00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:58.660
And she came up with
this idea of something

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.080
she called the
tri-office, which was

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.580
some time in corporate
headquarters,

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.940
some time in the field, and
some time in Pennsylvania.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.320
But then she thought
about, what are

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.210
his good reasons for saying no?

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.560
By the way, when we tell
people about negotiation,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.500
we always say, prepare,
prepare, prepare.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.450
And when you prepare,
prepare, prepare,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.880
you often can't hear what
the good reasons are.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.270
So it's really important to--
we call it being mindful.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.770
So when she thought
about his good reasons,

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.780
first she thought he
might think she wouldn't

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.704
be able to do the
job, if she wasn't

00:28:33.704 --> 00:28:35.620
in corporate headquarters,
she wouldn't really

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.460
be able to do the job.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.000
So she built into her
offer performance criteria.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.207
They would look at
performance criteria.

00:28:43.207 --> 00:28:44.665
The second thing
is, she thought he

00:28:44.665 --> 00:28:45.915
might think it was too costly.

00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:49.440
He paid for a move
already, and he might not

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.320
want to do it again.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.600
So she built in a
cost-sharing provision.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.200
The third thing was, he
was afraid if she left,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.950
he would lose his
connection to the field.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.670
So they built in a way that
she could deal with the field.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.560
He thought that she would
get tired of the commute.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.190
So they had periodic check-ins.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.909
And the final thing
was he wouldn't

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:10.950
want to change precedent.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.160
There's nothing she
could do about that.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.560
But what she did was think about
his good reasons for saying no.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.970
And in the negotiations,
I always like to say,

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.770
if you know a good
reason that people

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.300
are going to say no, it's
great to start there.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.130
So she was saying,
I think you're

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.497
worried about my
performance, that this

00:29:29.497 --> 00:29:30.580
is going to jeopardize it.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.790
He said, right.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.110
And once they're able
to talk about it,

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.810
it sort of can lower the
resistance a little bit.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.700
It's a nice story.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.630
They did a pilot.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.591
It worked.

00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:41.590
And now she's vice president
and general manager

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.705
of that division.

00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:45.330
So the final thing
I want to talk about

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.180
is what we call dealing
with resistance.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:52.520
That is, you raise
something, so here it is.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.490
You put out an idea.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.198
The persons says,
"This will never work."

00:29:55.198 --> 00:29:56.720
You say, "Yes, it will."

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.900
And he says, "You're wrong."

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.410
And she says, "No,
no, I'm right."

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.160
And what happens in
these kinds of things,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.820
I talk about this as
moves and counter moves.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.950
So when people don't want
to give you what you want,

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.240
they say things that can
put you on the defensive.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.790
They're resistant,
and so they defend.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.150
They question your competence.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.186
They say, this budget
is way out of line.

00:30:19.186 --> 00:30:20.310
Everybody else can do this.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.340
Why can't you?

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.660
Or they criticize your style.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.850
You're being unreasonable.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.622
Or, don't get so upset.

00:30:25.622 --> 00:30:26.580
They demean your ideas.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.329
Where did you ever get
these numbers from?

00:30:28.329 --> 00:30:29.314
This will never work.

00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:30.480
Or they appeal for sympathy.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.300
This is really the
killer, I think.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.890
I really need your help on this.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.070
I'm very stretched,
so please just hold.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.070
It's what the boss
did in Isabel's case.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.002
Or they flatter
you, another killer.

00:30:41.002 --> 00:30:41.960
You're so good at this.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.140
Why wouldn't you want to keep
doing it, all 80 hours of it?

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.740
And so what happens is, we get
into this move and counter move

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.850
like this, as
opposed to thinking

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.890
about what we call turns.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.870
And turns change the dynamics.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.355
So the first turn you can
always use is interruption.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.320
Silence-- it's
very heavy, right?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.440
You take a break.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.770
You interrupt.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.260
Because you never come back
to exactly the same place.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.590
Or you can ask a question.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.260
You can correct it, or
you can solve a problem.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.870
So let me give you an example.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.190
This is a story about a woman.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.460
This is again from Africa.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.670
She is a PhD economist,
works for a large NGO.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.020
The coin of the realm is
doing research but also

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.590
having your work make a
difference on the ground.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.160
So her name is
Rosalie, and she's

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.520
coming to talk-- you can
tell this organization--

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.527
to the assistant
director general.

00:31:46.527 --> 00:31:48.610
You can get a sense of
what this organization must

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.000
be like with an assistant
director general.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.900
And she comes and
she says, I've come

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.540
to talk to you about
funding to present

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.480
to the next
International Congress.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.050
I just published an
important article

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.230
in "The Journal of
Agricultural Economics,"

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.140
and I want to present it.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.730
And he says, I'm not
familiar with that journal,

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.725
but as you know, we need senior
people to come and present

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:08.600
at these conferences.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.580
That's where we meet with
donors, and you're not ready.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.750
And she says, I can't
believe you're saying that.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.540
I am ready to present.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.347
And he says, look, I really need
you to support the work here.

00:32:19.347 --> 00:32:21.430
You're best at helping me
and the director general

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.290
get ready for the conference.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.170
And she says, no
way am I just going

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.720
to help you present my data.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.190
I need to be there, too.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.980
And he says, don't get so upset.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.360
And she says, I am not upset.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.280
So that's an example of
resistance, counter resistance.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.590
So let's look at it from
a perspective of turns.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.896
So she says the same thing.

00:32:43.896 --> 00:32:46.310
He says the same
thing, But instead

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:51.360
of responding in a counter
move, she asks a question.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.280
Help me understand
the criteria you

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.720
use to determine whether
people are ready.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.260
So she opens it up.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.010
And so he says pretty
much the same thing,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.220
but she hears it
differently, right?

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.780
She asks a question,
he gives a reason.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.700
Then knowing that,
she can correct it.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.240
I understand what a
priority this project is,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.170
and I want to support you
and the director general

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.580
so you can meet with donors.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.160
And he says, I'm
glad you understand.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.990
OK, so now she's
getting cooled out here.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.420
That doesn't work.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.592
So she jumps to the problem.

00:33:26.592 --> 00:33:28.800
And she says, since I am
most familiar with the data,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.950
I think the best way to
support the project is

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.850
for me to do the presentations
and be available to answer

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.320
questions the donors have.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.070
That would help the
donors have confidence

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.000
in our junior
researchers, right?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.710
So she expands the
problem from just herself

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.650
to something that's good
for the organization.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.800
It's good for junior
resources and for donors

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.890
to know that junior researchers
are doing important work.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.040
And so he says, actually,
I think that will work.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.560
I'm going to run it by the DG.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.640
Now obviously, this is a very
stylized kind of situation.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.030
But the idea about
being prepared

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:04.060
for when people are going to
use these moves that put you

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.640
on the defensive-- and what
we like to say in the book,

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.270
which I didn't talk
about today, is

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.889
knowing what you know about
the person you're dealing with,

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.090
what they do in these
kinds of negotiations,

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.830
so you can be prepared.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.600
So the final thing I'll
just say is this book--

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.230
the subtitle of the book
is called, "Turning Small

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.426
Wins into Big Gains."

00:34:24.426 --> 00:34:27.120
And our notion about
this is that these kinds

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.250
of negotiations
over these issues

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.480
actually make some change.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.409
So if you think about Isabel
that was doing this extra work,

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.650
she becomes a role model
for changing the idea

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.639
that invisible work and
just helping has no cost.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.040
It has a cost.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.739
And it should be
built in to a job.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:50.020
Cheryl in this tri-office
actually changes a precedent.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.389
It is no longer the
case that it is expected

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.340
that people will move
to the corporate office

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.540
as a condition of taking on
a very senior leadership job.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.910
They might, but
it's now negotiable.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.930
It's not just assumed.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.310
And Rosalie changes the role
of the junior researchers.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.280
Now the leadership
of the organization

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.275
is open to the idea
that it's actually

00:35:13.275 --> 00:35:16.610
a good thing for junior
researchers to present.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.690
So negotiation becomes
a way to change

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.610
kind of cultural practices.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.740
So I think it's not
just good for you.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.600
I think it could be good
for the organization.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.790
So we have some
time for questions.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.040
People have questions?

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.190
CATHY CHEN: This
one is from Becca.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.810
I'd love tips on helping
a manager understand

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:40.460
the value of work that is done
outside of one's core role,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.070
for example, training
or mentoring others.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.560
It's important for the greater
good, Google or [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.865
but can be hard to defend in the
face of an ambitious team goal.

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:53.490
DEBORAH KOLB: Right, so again,
I think the most important thing

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.214
there is how do you
connect why it's good?

00:35:57.214 --> 00:35:58.130
What are the benefits?

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.190
You have to be able to quantify
those benefits in some way.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.510
Sometimes people say,
when we mentor people,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.450
it means that they stay.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.540
In reading this
book about Google,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.430
losing talent is something that
Google isn't so happy about.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.270
So the idea if you're
mentoring people

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.300
to stay, especially if they're
in a minority group, the idea

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.150
that you're helping
them stay would

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.350
be putting this in a currency
that has value, presumably,

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.000
to the person
you're dealing with.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.510
Other people have suggestions
for how you do that as well?

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.210
I don't think I have to be the
one answering that question.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.970
How do you make invisible work
that you do that isn't just

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.570
generically valued because it
doesn't contribute directly

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.370
to the work you're doing, how
do you claim value for it?

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.030
Anybody have any other ideas?

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.950
Have you done it?

00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:49.942
Yeah.

00:36:49.942 --> 00:36:52.686
AUDIENCE: Can you talk about
[INAUDIBLE] reviews with

00:36:52.686 --> 00:36:54.955
your manager, and--

00:36:54.955 --> 00:36:56.580
DEBORAH KOLB: Build
it into your goals?

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.996
AUDIENCE: Just be very explicit,
talk about it in reviews,

00:36:58.996 --> 00:37:04.324
make it an explicit goal,
and check in on [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:06.240
DEBORAH KOLB: Yeah, and
I think the idea there

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.619
is to connect what's
good-- I always like to say

00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:10.410
there are a few principles
that I have here

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.330
that I had in my notes but I
didn't say it, and one of them

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.410
is connecting what's
good for you to what's

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:16.493
good for the organization.

00:37:16.493 --> 00:37:19.130
And you need to be able to
talk about why it's good.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.360
And the degree to which
you can do that I think

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.270
makes a difference.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.103
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:37:24.103 --> 00:37:26.030
Can you please either
repeat that or can you

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.446
repeat [INAUDIBLE] microphone
so that [INAUDIBLE] can also

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:29.850
hear that?

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.740
DEBORAH KOLB: So the
answer was in reviews,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.560
bring it up and have it
built into your goals.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.050
That's a good time,
and I say, negotiation

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.920
doesn't present itself as
sort of clear opportunities.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.300
But reviews are often
a place to do that.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.580
And in the book, we
have a lot of examples

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.710
about how you build in
these kinds of things

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.910
to ongoing conversations
like reviews,

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.840
like project reviews, how
you stop that conversation

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.400
and build something else in
that you want to accomplish.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.420
Yes.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.900
AUDIENCE: So you
started by talking

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.670
about framing your
value in a way that

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.000
matters to the other party.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.150
But in my experience as
a young professional,

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.670
when I was negotiating for my
first job prior to this one,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.980
I had no idea what my value was.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.840
I had grades, and
I had no idea how

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.310
to explain that grades
would be useful.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:29.220
And I got a job, so somehow
they thought I had value.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.655
But it was never clear
to me what they saw

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:34.290
or how I could highlight that.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.970
DEBORAH KOLB: Right,
but when you're

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.570
getting hired right
out of school,

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:42.110
you don't have value on the
currency that has value yet.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.290
They have to
determine what it is.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:48.720
But over time in working,
you do have value

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.800
in a currency that has value.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.390
I think the hiring is
sort of different, right?

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.730
I think Google looks for
talent and good grades, right?

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.570
So somebody thought
you had talent,

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.350
and you probably had good
grades, and they thought, OK.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.770
I mean, what I gather
from reading about Google,

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.180
the interviewing process
is a really important part.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.024
But I think over time--
that's not a little n

00:39:10.024 --> 00:39:10.940
negotiation, actually.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.300
That's more you're
negotiating to get hired.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.530
It is a little n in
some ways, but it's not

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.290
in terms of the ongoing work.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.760
So now you do have a value
and want to change things

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.090
or you want opportunities.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.080
That's when you really, I
think, have to show your value.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.340
AUDIENCE: So then I guess what
the persistent question is,

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.540
how do you know your
own value, especially as

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.720
a younger professional?

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.761
DEBORAH KOLB: Well, if
you don't know your value,

00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:33.080
they won't know it, either.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.730
And also talk to people.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.890
So one of the things is we
always think we're on our own

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.230
in doing this.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.370
Talk to other people
in your network.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.920
Get some advice from people
who have done it before.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.400
How do they see their value?

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.001
What are the kinds of
things that matter?

00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:52.000
One of the things in the
book that we talk about

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.630
is knowing what you know about
the person you're dealing with.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.140
How do they like to hear things?

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.255
What do they value?

00:39:57.255 --> 00:39:58.880
So finding information
about the person

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.440
you're going to negotiate with
can also help you do that.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.970
But you're not on
your own, exactly.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:04.380
Do you have a
comment about that?

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.921
AUDIENCE: So I actually sit on
our New Grad Hiring Committee.

00:40:06.921 --> 00:40:08.100
So I see this go by a lot.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.120
I tend not to see
what the offers are,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.180
but I do see the
candidates go by.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.070
And as far as knowing what your
value is in that situation,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.635
shop yourself around, right?

00:40:19.635 --> 00:40:21.760
Often when I want to know
the value of an old piece

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.291
of electronics, I
go to eBay and see

00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:24.540
what people are paying for it.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.567
Shop yourself around.

00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:26.900
See what Twitter will offer you.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.274
See what Facebook
will offer you.

00:40:28.274 --> 00:40:32.550
See what any other company
out there will offer you.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.437
And then come back to
Google, because you

00:40:35.437 --> 00:40:37.770
wanted to work at Google even
though you're interviewing

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:38.610
at all these other places.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.401
But come back to them
say, well, these guys

00:40:40.401 --> 00:40:41.650
are going to offer me this.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.884
I have a competing offer.

00:40:42.884 --> 00:40:45.300
Nothing gets the recruiters
into action faster than having

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.840
competing offers,
and I think you'll

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.720
find that true throughout
your professional career,

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.736
no matter what level you are
applying to be hired into.

00:40:53.736 --> 00:40:57.270
DEBORAH KOLB: Getting
anothher offer is a BATNA.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.410
The research suggests
you need to be

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.510
a little bit careful about
how you use that directly.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.300
One of the things
that I like to say

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.930
is, when you have another
offer, you know your value.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.170
And so therefore, what you're
asking for feels defensible.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.040
You can stand behind it.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.220
Some of the research
suggests, especially

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.930
with women, when you drag
out that other offer,

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.130
people don't hear it so well.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.900
I think you're an experienced
person on the hiring committee.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.681
Other people might
sort of not do it.

00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:25.180
But it's--

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.128
AUDIENCE: I definitely
want to mention

00:41:27.128 --> 00:41:30.527
I am not involved directly in
negotiating people's salaries.

00:41:30.527 --> 00:41:31.860
I'm just involved [INAUDIBLE] --

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.210
DEBORAH KOLB: To sort of
looking, do they look good?

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.680
Right.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.580
AUDIENCE: And I was
just going to say

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.325
in terms of knowing your
worth, talk to your peers,

00:41:37.325 --> 00:41:38.744
talk to people in peer reviews.

00:41:38.744 --> 00:41:39.660
DEBORAH KOLB: Exactly.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.040
When

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.456
AUDIENCE: We have yearly perf,
think that's a great place.

00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:44.630
And just get real-time
feedback, right?

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.400
You don't have to wait to
go-- just don't go and get

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.370
an offer, right?

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.800
I'm from HR.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.860
But I think it's
more than just--

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.700
there are a lot of other ways
that just going out to see

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.530
what Facebook would pay you.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.363
DEBORAH KOLB: Great.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.964
Other questions?

00:42:02.964 --> 00:42:05.130
CATHY CHEN: There's some
more questions on the Dory.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.339
I think you can see them now.

00:42:06.339 --> 00:42:08.088
DEBORAH KOLB: Yeah,
so in a collaborative,

00:42:08.088 --> 00:42:10.010
scrappy work culture,
teams and individuals

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.440
are pulled in many directions.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.170
Do you have tips for managing
a wide range of requests

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:18.230
and opportunities for
multiple unique sources?

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.930
Well again, it's a little bit
about knowing what you want.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.560
You can't get what you want if
you don't know what you want.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.720
And so if you're just
being buffeted by requests

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.370
and you can't anchor on
something that matters to,

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.204
I do think you need to
get advice about that.

00:42:37.204 --> 00:42:38.620
Because if you
keep getting pulled

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.260
in all these
different directions,

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.670
that's what's going to happen.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.680
And so you're not going to
be able to carve yourself

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.360
out a career and a program,
a program to progress.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.550
So I think yes, you
need to have people that

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.950
can help you think about that.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.280
That's why mentoring
is so important, right?

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.770
In a culture where
this happens a lot,

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.820
mentors are really key to
be able to talk to people

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.990
and get advice from them about
what makes sense here for me

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.460
and what doesn't
make sense for me.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.380
So I think there is sort
of anchoring and knowing

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.130
what you want.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.862
Because you can't get
it if you don't know it.

00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:19.320
And I think it is
one of the things

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.180
that there's so
many opportunities,

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.400
it's hard to focus on it.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.290
But I think if you don't,
it's very hard to push,

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.580
to negotiate for the thing.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.220
Then you can't really negotiate
for the things you want, just

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.452
been pushed back and forth.

00:43:30.452 --> 00:43:32.660
Now, you might want to narrow
it down to a few things

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.400
and use these things to
trade off of each other

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.690
so that it might help you
get exactly what you want.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.830
I think there are a
lot of choices here.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:45.680
And so I think
focusing is really key.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.542
I think it this sounds
like a theme here.

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.530
There are sexy projects
and grunt work projects

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.120
on every team.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.290
How do I negotiate
for the ones that

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.165
will set me up for
success, which are usually

00:43:59.165 --> 00:44:00.072
the sexy ones?

00:44:00.072 --> 00:44:02.280
So I guess I would say,
again, knowing what you want.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.710
But doing a little of the
grunt-- we call this if-then,

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:08.560
right?

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.060
So I'm willing to do
this, if then I do that.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.690
So you connect these
different parts

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.410
of what you're
being asked to do.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.440
And that way, you really do
make it sort of a negotiation.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.939
So there's a cost for
you doing the grunt work.

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:25.480
But if you're the
kind of person that

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.730
always says no to
that grunt work,

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.860
I think it's going
to be an issue.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.810
But if you're the
kind of person that

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.810
always says yes
to the grunt work,

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.290
all you do is get grunt work.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.630
So the issue is really
to make it a negotiation.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.620
If-then, if I do this,
then I want to do that.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.960
So always connect these tasks.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.997
We talk in the book about how
to turn asks into negotiations.

00:44:43.997 --> 00:44:45.080
Because that's really key.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.210
You get asked all the
time, and how do you

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.490
make it into a negotiation?

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:52.820
So if-then, which
builds in reciprocity.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.960
I'm willing to do this,
but then something else.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.450
And I think that's important.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.552
Yes?

00:44:58.552 --> 00:45:00.010
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.930
about some of the basics, such
anchoring, which you talked

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.070
a little bit about,
whether it's you

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.290
starting the negotiations
at a certain point

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.840
then ratcheting back.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.060
How big do you make
your initial ask?

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.940
DEBORAH KOLB:
Right, so anchoring

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.070
comes from negotiations when
you're tending to negotiate

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.360
about a single issue, right?

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.510
So you have an idea
of a bargaining zone,

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.730
and we make offers, and we move
back and forth on that zone.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.760
It tends to be the
case, if you have

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.120
good information about the
other side's alternatives,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.357
it pays you to make
the opening offer.

00:45:41.357 --> 00:45:43.440
I don't think this is
little n negotiation advice.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.240
This is external kind
of advice, because I

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.229
think there's consequences to
doing what I'm about to say.

00:45:48.229 --> 00:45:49.270
It will end negotiations.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:50.680
So let me be clear.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.820
But when you have
good information

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.060
about the other
person's alternatives,

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.440
it behooves you to
make an opening offer.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.620
That's what we call a
large opening offer.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.900
Because you frame the
negotiations and you

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.354
anchor it in a way that's
advantageous to you.

00:46:05.354 --> 00:46:06.770
If you don't have
good information

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.710
about the other
side's BATNA, you

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:13.052
run the risk of either
anchoring too low, in which case

00:46:13.052 --> 00:46:14.760
you cut off a lot of
the bargaining zone,

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.560
or anchoring so
much off the charts

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.140
that people sort of walk away.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.440
The way I like to use anchoring
in little n negotiation

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.684
is anchoring with solutions.

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:29.600
So you're asked to do
grunt work, for example.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.610
Well, can you anchor
with a solution

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.870
about what you would do, some
of it, or who else would do it?

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.940
So anchoring becomes
solutions to problems.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.780
Because you're always
trying to make trades.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.530
I meant to tell my
trade story, so I guess

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.874
I'll tell my trade story now.

00:46:44.874 --> 00:46:46.540
You're always looking
for making trades.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.134
In all negotiations,
you never want

00:46:49.134 --> 00:46:50.550
to negotiate about
a single issue.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.820
You always want to negotiate
about more than one issue.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.170
Because you want to do if-thens.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.780
You want to have trades.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.420
So here's my story about trades.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.780
This is a story about
an anthropologist who's

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.000
studying the Navajo in Arizona.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.870
She finished her field work, and
she's driving back to Phoenix.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.360
And she passes a Navajo
woman on the road,

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.760
and she asks her if she wants
a ride back into Phoenix.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.910
And this woman says, sure.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.880
And this woman gets in the
car and is totally silent

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.559
for most of the ride.

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.600
Except for when they're
getting close to Phoenix,

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.670
the Navajo woman notices that
in between the two seats,

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.090
there's a bag.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.620
And she asks the anthropologist
what's in the bag.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.630
And the anthropologist
says, it's

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.070
a bottle of wine for my husband.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.030
And the Navajo woman
says, good trade.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.970
[LAUGHING]

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.290
So it's important to
think about trades, right?

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.180
Trades are important.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.930
It's always sort of if-then.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.360
I didn't really talk about
that that much in this talk,

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.870
but there's a lot of it in the
book, always about if-then.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.770
And so anchoring in a single
offer kind of situation,

00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.826
those are so rare.

00:47:59.826 --> 00:48:00.950
It's not what you're doing.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:02.260
Even when you're
negotiating salary,

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.468
that's not what you're doing.

00:48:03.468 --> 00:48:05.760
There are so many other
pieces that are part of it.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.160
So anchor with solutions.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.070
Because I think it
does the same thing.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.850
It frames the negotiation
in a situation

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.350
that's advantageous to you.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.077
Because you've sort of thought
about how you frame it.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.390
OK, so suppliers--
I'm not really

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:30.070
talking about that, suppliers,
how you negotiate with supplies

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.360
on a short timeline to pull
in dates due to urgent demand.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.900
Again, I think it's an
if-then kind of thing.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.050
Will they do it this time,
and in return, you'll

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.341
give them something else later.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.530
And then the then
could be how we

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.835
keep each other informed so that
we know more what's happening.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.800
Yeah, so somebody is
negotiating on behalf of you,

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.170
and they don't negotiate well.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.980
How would you prepare
them to negotiate?

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.896
Well, I think that's a
really important issue.

00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:04.546
When you are counting on
people to negotiate for you,

00:49:04.546 --> 00:49:07.050
you want to have the first
negotiation with them.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.100
What is it you want them to do?

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.530
And sometimes they actually
might need some help.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.577
When they have to
negotiate on your behalf,

00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:17.910
there may be a consequence
to negotiating on your behalf

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.500
that they don't want to pick up.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.910
And so I think you have to
find ways to sort of help

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:27.880
them do that, help them
figure out exactly how they

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.405
would negotiate on your behalf.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.660
You may not have
all the information

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.090
that they have about
options and policies.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.410
You want to ask them
for that information.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.500
So this negotiation
with your manager

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.030
is actually the
first negotiation.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.060
It's not something that you're
just sort of talking to them.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:50.320
It is negotiating to get them
to buy in to be your advocate.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.450
And that's what you're
asking them to do.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.310
Sales teams--
that's an open-ended

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.220
question that I don't actually
have a lot of advice for.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.520
I would suggest you talk to
other people on your sales team

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.200
to get advice for that.

00:50:14.675 --> 00:50:15.550
All right, that's it.

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:23.020
I interviewed some
people before I came here

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.384
to get some other information.

00:50:25.384 --> 00:50:26.800
And so one of the
things I learned

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.630
was the key scarce
resource at Google is time.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.975
So one of the major things
that you're negotiating about

00:50:33.975 --> 00:50:35.240
is really time.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:40.690
And so it's trying to
think about creative ways

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.510
to negotiate about time.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.070
And so we have some ideas
in the book about that

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:49.200
as well, especially in terms
of negotiating about work

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.471
and personal life issues.

00:50:53.471 --> 00:50:54.845
So are there any
other questions?

00:50:57.914 --> 00:50:58.580
Well, thank you.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.120
It's been a real pleasure.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.020
I hope you like the
book and you use it.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.950
And if you do have
questions, Cathy

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.560
has ways to get
in touch with me.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.660
I'd be happy to sort
of answer them online.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.010
I think there's sort
of a theme here about

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:13.060
the kind of questions.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.162
You're overwhelmed with choices.

00:51:15.162 --> 00:51:16.870
And you're having a
hard time negotiating

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:18.390
about those kinds of choices.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.550
And I think it really starts
with you being clear about what

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.930
it is you want.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:28.910
I guess the other thing
that I didn't say,

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.760
I said connect what's
good for you to what's

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.410
good for your organization
and convert an ask

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.320
into a negotiation.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.099
The way you do that
is always, yes and.

00:51:40.099 --> 00:51:41.390
That's what builds [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.630
Yes, I'm willing to do this,
and here's what I need.

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.420
So you're always thinking
about connecting it and making

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.370
it a negotiation.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.450
People always say, I
need more help saying no.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.710
I don't think that's right.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.230
I think you want to have
help saying yes and.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.880
And when you put the
and out, they may say,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.150
well, I can't do that.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.483
You say, well, then maybe
it's not going to work, right?

00:52:00.483 --> 00:52:02.850
But at least you've had
a negotiation about it.

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:06.630
So I would encourage you
in this negotiation culture

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.520
to think about some
of these principles.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.070
So thank you.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:14.020
[APPLAUSE]
