00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.690
In the last video, we saw that
if you took some solid zinc

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.750
and stuck it in a solution
of copper sulfate,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.670
that the zinc will essentially
give electrons to the copper.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.610
So then you have zinc cations
that are in the solution.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240
So essentially, it'll become
a solution of zinc sulfate.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.670
And the copper, once it
gets those two electrons

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.920
is going to go into
it's solid state,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.440
and it's going to precipitate
out of the solution.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.370
And we saw the reaction
right over here-- solid zinc

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.390
plus copper sulfate
in solution and water.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.740
It's an aqueous solution.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.830
You have the solid
copper precipitating out.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.020
And now it's a solution
of zinc sulfate,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.660
that the zinc has
essentially been oxidized.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.120
It lost two electrons.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.450
It went from
neutral to positive.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.100
And the copper went from
positive to neutral.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.080
So the copper took
those two electrons.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440
Zinc was oxidized by copper.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.510
It lost electrons to the copper.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.600
Copper was reduced by zinc.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.880
Its charge was reduced by zinc.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.710
It gained electrons from zinc.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.290
Now, this by itself
is interesting.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.190
It's an interesting
redox reaction.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.600
Something was oxidized,
something was reduced.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
But wouldn't it be interesting
is if we could somewhat

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.450
separate these
two half reactions

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.780
and make these electrons
travel over a wire.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.100
Now, why would that be
interesting to make electrons

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.730
travel over a wire?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.780
Well, electrons traveling
over a wire, that's a current.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.390
And you could make current
do useful things, like power

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.147
a motor or a light or
whatever it might be.

00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:32.730
And so essentially,
if we can do that,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.550
we would have constructed
something of a battery.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.049
And if we can keep
that going, if we

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.890
can keep the current
flowing, we would

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640
have constructed
something like a battery.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.960
And what I have here,
this is a picture

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.640
of a galvanic-- sometimes
called a voltaic-- cell.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.060
And this is doing exactly that.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.580
It's separating these
two half reactions

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.440
and separating them with a wire.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.450
So zinc can gave
copper its electrons,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.180
but it forces the electrons
to go along this wire

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.350
and produce an actual current.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.100
So let's think about
why this is working.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.250
So you have solid
zinc right over here.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.200
We've already said that
look, the solid zinc

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.519
wouldn't mind giving
its electrons to copper.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.810
Copper wouldn't mind taking it.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.870
Copper is more electronegative.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.210
And so you have a reality where
the solid zinc could give away

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.880
its two electrons and
become the cation zinc, so

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.330
a positive charge, and then
it dissolves in the water.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.440
Once it has a
positive charge, it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.200
easy to dissolve into a
polar solvent like water.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.810
And then you have
those two electrons.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.680
Where are those two
electrons going to go?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.780
Those two electrons can then
go and be given to the copper.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.160
And both zinc and copper
are great conductors

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.790
of electricity.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.873
They're transition metals.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.660
They have these
seas of electrons.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.970
So electrons can travel
within them fairly easily.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.587
And so you have
your two electrons.

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:03.170
So those are your
two electrons that I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.830
showed traveling in green.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.760
And they can come all the way to
the bottom of where this copper

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.660
bar is in contact with the
copper with the copper sulfate

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.640
solution.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.570
And now you're going to have
a cation, an ion of copper,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.150
that when it comes into
contact with those electrons,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.305
it's going to nab them
up and become neutral.

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:33.130
And when it becomes
neutral, it's

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.260
going to precipitate
out of the solution.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.330
It's going to precipitate
onto that bar.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.470
Now, you might be saying,
look, if more and more positive

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.826
things, if more and more
of this positive zinc

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.200
is flowing in this, wouldn't
this make this an imbalance?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.440
And if this solution
becomes too positive,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.170
then the electrons wouldn't
want to leave as much anymore.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.060
So if this starts becoming
very, very, very, very positive,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.130
and similarly, if all the
positive stuff, all the copper

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.279
cations are capturing
the electrons,

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.570
the solution is going to
become more and more negative.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.060
It's going to have more sulfate
and less of the positively

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.880
charged copper ions.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.230
So what can we do to
make sure that doesn't

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.860
happen too quickly?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.570
Well, what we do is we use
something called a salt bridge.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.640
And the salt bridge
right over here, this

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.504
helps neutralize that effect
that we just talked about.

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:36.170
And with a salt bridge,
you can view it.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.070
It's not going to be
liquid, because then

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.630
everything inside of
it would just fall out.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.560
You can view it as
a goo of a salt.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.590
In this diagram, we picked
sodium sulfate as our salt.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.290
So for every sulfate molecule,
you have sulfate anion.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.930
You have two sodium cations.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.340
And so what's going to
naturally happen here?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.220
Well, as this becomes more
and more positively charged,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.760
as more and more positive zinc
ions go into the solution,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.550
the negative sulfate
ions are going

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.490
to want to come out of here.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.630
So the negative
sulfate ions are going

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.340
to want to leave all of
their negative friends

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.312
right over here, go
into the salt bridge,

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:27.520
and then the ones that are
already in the salt bridge

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.580
are going to want
to come out here.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.130
Similarly, the sodium
right over here

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.210
will be tempted to
help neutralize.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.280
The sodium-- let me
do it this way-- could

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.930
go in this direction
and help neutralize

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.500
any negativity that's
happening there.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.590
And so that will keep
each of these solutions

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.640
from becoming too
positive or too negative

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.530
and allow this
current to continue

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.269
to flow and do useful things.
