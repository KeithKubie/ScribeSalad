00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.720
My parents are Haitian immigrants, they
came to the United States over 50 years

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.700
ago, my mother actually came to the US as
an au pair for a French American family

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.349
living the Boston suburbs, she eventually
moved to New York to join her mother and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.390
her siblings; my father went directly to
New York and proceeded to earn an

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.120
engineering degree from the City College
of New York.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.969
My mom eventually became a registered
nurse and when I went to college I went

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:47.920
with the expectation from my family that
I would pursue a major that's very

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.420
closely connected to the kinds of jobs
that existed in their universe so I was

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.589
either going to be an engineer or a
doctor or a lawyer; a lot of my

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.950
decision-making as an undergraduate was
really sharply structured around those

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.140
kinds of expectations, the idea of
eventually becoming an academic, it was

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.950
not even something that was in the range
of choices that were presented to me as

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.380
as possibilities. One of the ways in
which my experience as the daughter of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.860
Haitian immigrants has influenced the
approach that I take to teaching and

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.430
mentoring is that I often work with
students who are either first generation

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.280
or also from immigrant families and they
come into college with clear

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.409
expectations about the choices they're
supposed to make. Part of my role as a

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.289
faculty member and as a mentor is to
respect the sort of the hopes and dreams

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.490
of many people often rests on the
shoulders of these students and that I'm

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.750
not only engaging with the student but
I'm probably engaging with the students

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.960
family; it's possible to pursue not only
educational choices that are legible to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.140
your family and that provide a sense of
economic security but also to pursue

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.490
your intellectual passions; I think
bringing that kind of sensitivity to my

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.170
interactions with students that's something
that's so deeply influenced by my own

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.720
experience as the daughter of Haitian
immigrants.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.080
One of my greatest passions

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.300
in my time in the role as dean of social
science for the last three years has

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.070
been nurturing what is the Inequality in
America Initiative and the initiative

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.820
itself in the first instance is
motivated just by the growing

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.590
recognition of the problem of inequality
and the broad impacts it has on

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.210
everything from individuals to families
to neighborhoods to entire societies so

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.420
there is a real-world urgency that
really calls for our engagement on this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.570
issue, but is also the initiative has
been motivated by the sense that while

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.710
the study of inequality and teaching
about inequality has been really a core

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.880
strength for Harvard and for the FAS in
particular for some years that there's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.810
actually a lot more that we could be
doing in this space; we actually joined

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.580
collaboratively and defined the study of
inequality as a collective enterprise

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.520
Over the last three years I've viewed my
my position as an opportunity to have

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.380
this this passport that allows me to go
and visit anthropology, attend seminars,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.190
and understand what motivates and
excites anthropologists and then the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
next day visit economics and attend a
job talk to learn what motivates and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.820
excites economists and now with this
role it is as if I'm stepping from the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.430
balcony to a rooftop view and really
being able to survey the full rich

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.990
diversity of the FAS and learn more not
only about what's happening in social

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.850
sciences but now also what excites
classicists in arts and humanities or to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.510
learn more about engineering. I would
also say that one of the things that's

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.190
tremendously rewarding about being in
this kind of position is that you have

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.720
the opportunity to to shape and support
the faculty and so the opportunity to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.550
bring to our campus the best minds
across a variety of fields and to help

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.090
set the conditions that allow them to do
their best work and I find that to be

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.840
incredibly rewarding
