Hsu: Hi. I'm Allan Hsu
from imeem.

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:05.400
And I wrote the imeem
application for Android.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.868
When you start
the application,

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:10.267
we give you a series
of, uh, default stations

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.534
that you can listen to.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.133
But you can also search
for some of your favorite bands.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.167
One of my favorite bands
is Death Cab for Cutie.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.934
Now I'm listening to the Death
Cab for Cutie station.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.501
On the station,
we also present new artists

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:30.167
that are similar
to Death Cab for Cutie,

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:31.567
um...

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:34.033
and, uh,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.868
among other
Death Cab for Cutie songs.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.234
Uh, if I like this station,

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:41.834
I can actually, uh,
choose to Favorite the station.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.501
And now, when I go back,

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.334
Death Cab for Cutie's been added
to my Favorites station.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.801
We decided to build
this application

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.634
for the Android platform
because we thought the platform

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.701
was a really good fit
for our existing user base.

00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.934
We built the very se--
search-centric, uh,

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:03.934
user experience on the phone
around, uh,

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.167
the SQLite databases
on the phone

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:09.300
as well as, uh, the Java
Regular Expressions engine.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.467
We used, uh,
the Apache HTTP components

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.767
as well as
the JSON libraries

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.801
and the, uh, Java Crypto
frameworks

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.434
to integrate
with our web services API.
