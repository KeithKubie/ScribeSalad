1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,140
All right. Can I pause here? Leptin is
produced where? Yeah, Leptin is produced.

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,990
Yeah. Let's talk about Leptin a little
bit. It's produced in fat cells, um,

3
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:11,560
and it's produced in proportion
to the size of fat tissue.

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:14,610
So the amount of body fat you have,
the more fat you have,

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,480
the more Leptin you have in the
circulation. And basically what this is,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,000
it's what's called a
negative feedback loop,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,620
which is a really simple engineering
term that works like a thermostat.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,990
So with your thermostat,
you,

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,600
if you set your thermostat to 70,
if it starts getting a little bit hotter,

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,140
your ac turns on to bring it back
down at the starts getting lower,

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,290
ac comes on or the heat
comes on to bring it up.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,060
That's called a negative feedback system
and it maintains the stability of the

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,320
temperature of your house.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,300
We have many negative feedback loops
in the human body to regulate body

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,750
temperature, to regulate blood pressure,
to regulate all sorts of things.

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,940
One of the negative feedback loops we
have regulates body fatness and the

17
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:04,710
hormone. So your, your thermostat measures
temperature by using a thermostat,

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,230
a, sorry, a thermometer,

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,370
your brain measures body fatness using
this hormone leptin that's in the

20
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,930
circulation. And then particularly
when your body fat level drops,

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,300
your Leptin levels drop and your brain
hears that and it kicks in a starvation

22
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,380
response basically.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,010
And this is the main reason why weight
loss is so difficult because your brain

24
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:30,390
is like, no, I don't want to be
losing fat. And it makes you hungrier.

25
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:34,770
It increases your cravings. Yes. Is that
at a certain level of body fat as a sub?

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,740
So here's this, just when you're
losing body fat in general,

27
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,160
like even if you're a large
person that's overweight, correct.

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,490
When you're losing body fat in general,
your body exacerbates your hunger.

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,121
And this is,

30
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:48,880
this is the thing that's really important
to understand about obesity, um,

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,590
is that people with obesity
have a higher set point.

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,990
So it's like turning your thermostat from
70 to 80 and then your thermostats or

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,460
regulating around 80 people with obesity,

34
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:03,480
they're not regulating around one 70
anymore. They're regulating around two 50.

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,230
And so when you cause a
lean person to lose weight,

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,040
you see the same thing is when you cause
a person with obesity to lose weight,

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,340
you see this reaction in their brain
circuits that regulate body fatness that

38
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,000
drives them to increase their cravings
and their hunger to the metabolic rate

39
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:25,380
drops. So it'd be an
evolutionary mechanism to force
you to seek food. Correct.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,960
And not just the forest city to seek food.
That's the main thing.

41
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,000
But it also slows your metabolic rate,

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,380
does everything it can to get more energy
in your body and have less leaving.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,980
And it keeps doing that until the fat
comes back. Can I pause here? Yeah.

44
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:42,660
So when you're eating a sugary
die at a high high calorie diet,

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
you will produce more fat. Your
body will get fatter, right? Um,

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,100
it depends on how many calories
you're eating. If you're overeating,

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,550
you consuming a lot of sugar, a lot of
carbohydrates, your body will get fatter.

48
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Correct. Your body will
produce more Leptin. Correct.
So it comes from the Diet.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,250
Um, yeah. Indirectly. Definitely

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,050
are. Yeah. Yeah. Pause please.

51
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,220
So the Leptin is produced not just in
response to the size of the fat cell,

52
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,221
but in response actually to glucose
mediated uptake into the fat tail,

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,980
which is mediated in part by insulin.
So you come back to insulin,

54
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:18,670
even with the Leptin, you raise
blood sugar and that's the carbs.

55
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,260
You eat the carbs, you raise blood sugar,
you raise insulin, you raise fat storage,

56
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,500
the glucose, and then you get
more leaped. And um, again,

57
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,060
one of the things you have to understand
about this is everything that says has

58
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,720
two interpretations depending on
which paradigm you're looking at.

59
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,910
And these are fundamentally
different paradigms.

60
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,240
So in Stephen's world, and again,
correct me if I'm wrong though,

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,300
the Leptin is signaling few all
availability in the fat cells.

62
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,860
The way I would think of it,
and in my very small world,

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,600
Leptin is responding to fuel
availability in the rest of the cells.

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,860
So it's basically a molecule that
can tell other cells that there's fat

65
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:03,910
available and you could burn that fat for
fuel and then you don't have to go eat

66
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,220
or it can tell that there
isn't fuel available. And if,

67
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,670
depending on how much left in there is
the cells and then that what were spawned

68
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:17,180
by a signal to eat or not to
disinhibit eating behavior, um,

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,640
everything we're talking about with
Stefan and I'd first sort of fell out,

70
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,000
I dunno, eight years ago at, um,

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,910
the ancestral health symposium when I

72
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,060
acted improperly inappropriately.
But one of the problems I tell,

73
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,430
the way I think you
should think about this,

74
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:40,180
you have a hypothesis and
this is the fundamental thing.

75
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,400
Is it obesity caused by overeating?

76
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,810
Because we know if you're getting fat
or you're storing more calories in your

77
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,280
expense, that's just the, yeah, that's
like if her room is getting more crowded,

78
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,070
more people are entering them,
leaving. That is the simplest.

79
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,130
But it doesn't tell you why
the room's getting crowded.

80
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,000
It doesn't tell you why the f
you're getting fatter. And again,

81
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,690
what I've been arguing is the why you're
getting fatter part is a bit left out.

82
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:09,130
And people decided that overeating was
somehow an explanation and then they went

83
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,910
to the brain to look at why
people might overeat. So what I,

84
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,790
one of the questions I asked
to find eight years ago,

85
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,180
and it keeps coming up as if we're going
to blame obesity on the modern food

86
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:23,500
environment, epidemics
of obesity. You know,

87
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:28,501
simple question to ask is can we find
epidemics of obesity without this modern

88
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:33,910
food environment? I mean, that's the
sort of science one o one, right?

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,240
And it turns out that
the world is falling.

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
The first one I've found in the literature
was in 1902 in a population of the

91
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,120
Pima native American tribe,

92
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,950
the PM on living in Arizona and
observer saying these people are poor,

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,920
they're malnourished,
they're suffering through famines,

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,460
they've been suffering through a
famine for 40 years and famines.

95
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,260
It's hard to overeat during a famine.

96
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,520
And yet the women of the tribe who do
virtually all the work that they were

97
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,300
treated as pack animals and effect,
we're obese.

98
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,290
So now we can disassociate obesity from
the modern food environment and we could

99
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,990
disassociated from,
uh,

100
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,070
this ultra processed foods we eat
and start to ask the question,

101
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,810
what is it about, can we find what might
have driven obesity in that population?

102
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:27,950
Despite the existence of famine.
So it's from very simple observation.

103
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,850
Once we get into these kinds of studies,
say this in human genome studies,

104
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,500
say that,
um,

105
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,380
I actually rarely do that in my books
because you can find studies that will say

106
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,460
anything and you'll see in the studies,
um,

107
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,590
people misinterpreting them what was the
cause of the population of women to be

108
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,490
obese. So one of the thing that happened
during the very beginning in the 1960s,

109
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,000
the PMO were put on the reservoir.

110
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,710
They moved on to reds or
they were reservation eyes,

111
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,820
whatever the verb form would be.
And they began eating western foods.

112
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:06,500
And back then it was sugar flour and lard
for the most part and sugary beverages

113
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,100
probably.
So that's a reasonable hypothesis.

114
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,230
And you could find the same thing in
the Sioux native American to population

115
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:19,300
living on a reservation in
1928 where you had, uh, uh,

116
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,850
both obese men and women
living with malnourished,

117
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,350
stunted children who clearly
wasn't getting enough die,

118
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:29,630
but they were on a reservation, they were
getting western foods. So ultimately,

119
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,850
you know, the question you ask in
science determines the answer you get.

120
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,880
So the question I was asking is we have
this observation that any population

121
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:45,461
that transitions to western diet or
western diet and lifestyle gets obese and

122
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,180
diabetic, they, they develop
what's called Metabolic Syndrome,

123
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,940
which is insulin resistance
and all these issues.

124
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,460
And we know that's true
all over the world,

125
00:07:55,461 --> 00:08:00,461
from the annual to the Pima to
south Pacific islanders to Africans,

126
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,560
to European.
So the genetics aren't that important.

127
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,350
The question is what's triggering
it in the environment? And again,

128
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,900
Stephan would say,

129
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:13,901
well there's too much food available and
it's too palatable and we can't say no.

130
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,280
And I had a lot of problems with the,
we can say no part.

131
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:23,540
Cause if we're lean it means that they
can say no and they being the people with

132
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,970
obesity. And I don't believe
that's true. And then,

133
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,810
or is it some specific item or
some specific group in this,

134
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,210
these foods that travel
with western populations.

135
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,640
And so the exists the ability.

136
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:42,641
And today if you look up a dual
burden of obesity and malnutrition,

137
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:45,470
I have a Dropbox folder.
I could share with you,

138
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:49,100
there's probably 50 studies all over
the world. You see the same observation,

139
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:52,790
incredibly poor populations,
malnourished. The children are stunted,

140
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,550
which means they're protein
deficient in their calorie deficient.

141
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,360
And often the mothers are,
the ants are obesity.

142
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,970
Obesity tends to run in the females,

143
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,180
which suggests it has a female sex hormone
related effect that I don't believe

144
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,060
works in the brain because we're dealing
with populations that could not have

145
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,100
overeaten if they could have
overeaten why are the kids starving?

146
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,600
That's sort of the question and know
this was the first thing that I think we

147
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,000
fought about back then.
And it's still,

148
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,830
if you can find populations
with obesity epidemics,

149
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,590
but without the modern food system,

150
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:36,180
without Snackwells and without
Lay's potato chips, um,

151
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,090
and if you know that they're going through
a famine or you know that the kids at

152
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,500
least aren't getting enough food,

153
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:47,730
how do you explain obesity and the mothers
without assuming that the mothers are

154
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,910
overheated? Let's pause
right there. Stephanie.

155
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:55,911
Is there a population of people that
are obese that are not eating a western

156
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,940
diet?
They're not eating being

157
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,080
sugary foods?
Um,

158
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,880
that are obese and that are not
eating sugary foods? Probably not.

159
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,890
Because generally once you have an
industrialized food system that's going to

160
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,760
include sugar,

161
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,380
but there are populations that eat
a lot of sugar and are not obese.

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,510
And we should talk about some of these.
Actually let's,

163
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,090
let's talk about the peanut
goes back to the, yeah, sure.

164
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:24,500
Let's talk about the FEMA first.
Uhm, now Gary has told his story.

165
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:28,460
He's told his version of the Pima story.
Let me tell the story,

166
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:33,320
the version of the story that appears in
the scientific literature. Now, the Pima,

167
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,620
um,
originally they were agriculturalists.

168
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,210
They were eating traditionally a very
high carbohydrate diet based on unrefined

169
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:45,080
carbohydrates. Originally it
was corn, beans and squash.

170
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,110
Primarily they were hunter gatherers on
agricultural. They were primarily Gary.

171
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,450
Okay. They were primarily
eating agricultural foods.

172
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
They were also collecting some
wild foods. That's correct. Um,

173
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,920
they were fishing and
eating the skeet pods,

174
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,010
primarily agricultural and,
um,

175
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,980
data are very clear on that, Gary.
So yes, they are. Look, we have data.

176
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:13,430
I can say things like that to happen
because we're going to die. Well, let's,

177
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,030
let's, let's move on. You think they
ate mostly fish? That's incorrect. Okay.

178
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,780
According to the data, that's, I
remember you saying that in your book.

179
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,670
Something to that effect. But you've
got my book where you load. So anyway,

180
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,980
let's go on. I'm going
to move on here. Um,

181
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,650
now the Pima traditionally
were agriculturalists and what,

182
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,570
what happened basically is you had all
these farmers moving into their area,

183
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,270
settlers, uh, of European descent,

184
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,430
and they diverted the water from
their river, the Gila or healer river,

185
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,600
if he allowed pronounced healer.

186
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,140
And so they were no longer
able to grow their crops,

187
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:54,220
their agricultural crops
that they were dependent on.

188
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,090
And therefore the government started
providing them with foods to eat.

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,280
And these were calorie dense refined
foods. They were like Gary said, uh,

190
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,200
flour,
lard and sugar.

191
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,800
And then they became very obese.

192
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,720
Now there was a population of Pima right
across the border from them in Mexico,

193
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,100
also very similar culturally and all
that then maintain their traditional high

194
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:21,670
carbohydrate lifestyle and
agricultural lifestyle.

195
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:26,360
And there've been studies comparing
those two populations and the, um,

196
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,950
ones across the border with their
traditional lifestyle or a lot leaner and

197
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:34,690
healthier, not surprisingly than the
ones eating lard, flour and sugar. Okay?

198
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,070
But Gary, uh, you seem to believe
that people can gain weight.

199
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,780
You kept referring to famines and things.

200
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:45,781
You seem to believe that people can gain
weight even if they are eating very few

201
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:51,130
calories. And you ever refer to this many
times in your writing. Um, and you know,

202
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:55,870
these are very casual observations
that you're making kind of these casual

203
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,200
correlations and storytelling.

204
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,600
But if you actually look
at the data on this,

205
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:06,601
what you see is that if you just measure
calorie intake and people who have

206
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,284
obesity,

207
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,530
it is 20 to 35% higher than people who
are lean after correcting for height,

208
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,190
physical activity level. Um, and
that I've got that references.

209
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,540
This is what we're getting. We're getting
a little bit into that means here.

210
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,780
Let me give you an exact number.
Seven, can I pause you guys right here?

211
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,250
So these people,
they have essentially the same lineage.

212
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,050
One group lives in Mexico.

213
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,430
They're not eating these sugary
foods and this a western diet.

214
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,970
The ones that live in America are the
ones that live in America are becoming

215
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:43,270
obese. The ones that live in Mexico or
not, is that correct? Correct. Yeah,

216
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,750
and so now if you have
someone with obesity,

217
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,230
like I've said that the most accurate
measures that we have suggests that they

218
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,480
habitually consume and
expend more calories and now
Gary's model says that that

219
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,930
is downstream of the fattening effect.
It's not causing the fattening effect.

220
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,580
It is a result of the fattening effects.

221
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,130
Whereas my model says that
that is actually required
for the fattening effects

222
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,810
to occur. It is upstream. So now
what happens? What happens here?

223
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,330
What happens if you reduce their
calorie intake by that same amount,

224
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,500
20 to 35% it doesn't matter if you
do it by restricting carbs or fat.

225
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,940
These experiments have been done.

226
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,040
They lose weight when you restrict
their calorie intake down to that as the

227
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:30,640
argument,

228
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,350
what you're saying that you consuming
low amounts of calories but high amounts

229
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:39,760
of sugar does, it doesn't make sense.
You can get obese that way. Um,

230
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,250
so you're saying it's a
cowrie. Yeah, correct.

231
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,430
And that's referenced number nine and 10.
Um,

232
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,590
to support what I just said and I want
to talk about another one that really can

233
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,900
you out on stuff. Yeah, that's what I,

234
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:52,850
the reason I was using dual burden example

235
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,980
is because we have to explain how those
women were eating all those calories.

236
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,240
So usually women,
again,

237
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:03,860
it's just often it was intro off in
these studies were done by diabetes

238
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,430
researchers who were studying diabetes
in these populations and the men had high

239
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:11,630
levels of diabetes in the women
who had high levels of obesity. Um,

240
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,410
to give you an example where
that measurement was done
in Trinidad in the 1960s

241
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,410
and again, all I'm doing, this is the
role I played as I asked the question,

242
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:24,980
can you find populations that
don't have a lot of food? Okay.

243
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:28,070
You could say that the obese expend
a lot of energy and they eat a lot of

244
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,890
calories. The question is can they
get obese without a lot of food?

245
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,110
And so can we find populations like us?

246
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,900
Can you find a population
that gets obese without sugar,

247
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,280
which was exactly the question to ask.
So in Trinidad,

248
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,630
in the 1960s there's a
mountain nutrition crisis.

249
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:45,710
The US government sends a team of
researchers down to study this and the

250
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,710
researchers come back and say, yeah,
there's malnutrition, there's stunting,

251
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,180
there's deficiency diseases.

252
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,100
And two thirds of the adult women are
obese and this is a medical problem.

253
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,760
And the next year and MIT nutritionist
goes to down to do exactly what Stefan

254
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:03,761
ass for and to actually measure the diets
and obese women and lean women and to

255
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,540
study it. And this is the
population where it's not like,

256
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,430
I mean this is a very poor Trinidad
and population and reports that they,

257
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,210
I think it was 1800 calories a day with
the obese woman reading was actually a

258
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,930
little less than what the lean people
seem to be eating and that it was lower

259
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,740
than what the Food and
Agricultural Organization
considered for a healthy diet.

260
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,461
So again,

261
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:29,180
what my role in this is to point out
when you have populations like that,

262
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,430
I don't see how the overeating hypothesis
tells me the brain is in control of

263
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:38,030
how much they eat. Tells me anything
about why the women were obese,

264
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,590
especially when their kids are starving.
This is the paradox of the stool burden.

265
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,760
An obese mother with a starving child,
if they're obese,

266
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,670
mother has to eat superfluous
calories to get fat.

267
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,310
Why isn't she given those calories to
her kids? Because she doesn't need them.

268
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:59,270
She clearly doesn't eat them. She's
got fuel. So what's going on there?

269
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:04,040
If you posit a hypothesis as I did where
it says that the obesity is triggered

270
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,500
by the macronutrient content of the Diet,

271
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,730
then you can explain.
I mean there are plenty of animal models.

272
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:14,000
A famous quote I use in my
books from Sean my year,

273
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:18,620
it was like the fame leading
Harvard nutritionist who
studied an obese strain of

274
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,480
animals in the 50s he said, my animals
will get fat even when half starved,

275
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,590
they will make fat out of their
food even when half starved.

276
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,430
These are generally animals with
mutations. In the Leptin. Um, it doesn't,

277
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,080
whatever [inaudible] whatever Janet is.

278
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:39,081
It's kind of the question is if like I
can make fat out of my food at levels of

279
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,610
caloric levels that for instance,
a lean person can't,

280
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,370
then I'm going to get fat eating the
same amount that fat accumulation

281
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,350
is going to be, you know, means I'm
taking in more calories and I expand.

282
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,800
But the point is I'm fro some
metabolic hormonal reason.

283
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,880
I'm taking the fuel NIAID and turning
it into fat and storing it in the fat

284
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,840
tissue. What does your
responses, yeah, so I'm,

285
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,850
my response is that if
you want the best answers,

286
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,230
you have to use the best methods to
answer to answer the questions. Okay.

287
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,150
Do you want a question answered properly?

288
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,980
You have to use accurate methods to
answer that question. Now, as you know,

289
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:24,210
Gary, it's very difficult to measure
food intake and free living individuals.

290
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,050
Particularly you're traveling to a
country you've never been to before.

291
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,750
It's very difficult to
get accurate measures.

292
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:35,190
So just because some guy went to Trinidad
and claimed woman, actually. Okay,

293
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,150
it's fine.

294
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,810
Just because some woman went to Trinidad
and claimed that people were eating

295
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:43,350
1800 calories and becoming obese does
not mean that that's what actually

296
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:47,850
happened. Now, let me, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Gary, I'm responding now.

297
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,120
We have studies where researchers used
accurate measures to measure calorie

298
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,060
intake in people who had obesity.

299
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,920
Many of these people were saying,
we're only eating 1200 calories a day.

300
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,590
When they actually measured
their calorie intake.

301
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:09,591
What they found was that
they were consistently eating
more calories than lean

302
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,580
people.
So this,

303
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,610
this phenomenon that Gary describes is
something that is only observed when

304
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,920
inferior methods are
used to measure calories.

305
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,760
But the reason I'm using these
populations, like I said,

306
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:27,030
I'm just giving you an observation.
Obese mother with a starving child,

307
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:31,590
the dual burden of malnutrition,
obesity, this isn't one observation,

308
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,150
it's not one nutritionist.

309
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,420
The existence of the starving children
strongly suggests that there's not a lot

310
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:44,580
of food available and we have to
explain obesity in the motto. You know,

311
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,510
I would like you to respond. Okay,
fine. I will respond to that. Now, look,

312
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,550
I haven't looked at these
studies in particular.

313
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,090
I brought them up eight years ago.
We got in the fight a battle.

314
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,830
We won that last eight years
ago. It ruined our, you know,

315
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:59,970
it's like are we used to
be buying? So now look, um,

316
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,060
there are many reasons why a child
could be malnourished in a nonindustrial

317
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,050
situation.
And this is,

318
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:11,700
I do a lot of work related to this and
what you see in nonindustrial situations,

319
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,230
you see a lot of infectious disease.
You see a lot of um,

320
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,610
malnutrition.

321
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,450
So people not getting enough essential
minerals and vitamins not getting enough

322
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,284
protein.

323
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,400
And you see a lot of children who are
just barely hanging on because of this

324
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:30,540
collection of really bad stuff that's
happening in their lives and set our

325
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,360
sights on. Yeah. Yeah. Parasites, malaria.

326
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,680
I don't know if there's
malaria in Trinidad or not,
but I mean all the diarrhea,

327
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,260
pneumonia, these are the things that we
all had before. We had modern medicine,

328
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,000
great sanitation. And then the
country, like the United States,

329
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,950
30% of kids didn't even
make it past childhood.

330
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,520
And so there's a lot of things
that could have caused that. Gary.

331
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,550
It's not necessarily because you know,

332
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,170
it's not necessarily the reason
that you attribute it to now.

333
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,410
I'm not attributing it to a reason.
I'm just asking. Okay, well great.

334
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,690
Well I don't have the explanation,

335
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:09,520
but I'm throwing out possibilities that
are alternative to the one that you're

336
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:13,190
implying quite possible. Okay. So now, um,

337
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,340
I, so again, when you use accurate
measures of calorie intake,

338
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:22,900
you find that these people with magical
metabolisms who have obesity and don't

339
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:27,820
eat very much seem to not exist
anymore. Um, and furthermore, I want to,

340
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,150
I want to get this to another type of
study that's really going to differentiate

341
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:36,151
between this metabolic effect driven
by insulin and the effect of calories.

342
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,420
So we have a lot of studies that compared
diets in which calories were the same

343
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,330
but carbohydrate and fat intake deferred.

344
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,200
And the ones that I really want to focus
on right now that I think are key here

345
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,680
are this studies where they
increased calorie intake.

346
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,930
So they fed people, they, they f
one study in particular. And um,

347
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,130
let's see. I'm going to
give you a number here. Um,

348
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,070
let me see if I can give you
a number here. Sorry. Why
don't you look at that. Um,

349
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,563
can we,
uh,

350
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,930
bring up another issue because what we're
talking about ultimately as why people

351
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,930
get fat, okay, I don't, I
don't want to divert here. I'm
in the middle of something.

352
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,190
So,
um,

353
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,930
now if we want to understand
why people get fat,

354
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,290
we can look at studies that overfed
people on fat or carbohydrate exclusively.

355
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,520
So this one study, um, the first
one that I want to talk about first,

356
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,250
they figured out people's
baseline calorie intake,

357
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,610
figure out how many calories
they need to just to maintain,

358
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,880
and then they increase that by 50% by
exclusively giving them fat or exclusively

359
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:50,500
giving them carbohydrate. Okay?
Study was, this is Horton. Okay.

360
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,060
Um, give me a yes, a
number 16. Number 16. So,

361
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,590
um,
now if Gary's hypothesis is correct,

362
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,510
these people should have gained body fat
on the carbohydrate overfeeding but not

363
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:07,630
the fat overfeeding because
that increases your insulin.

364
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:10,630
It has these effects on your
fat cells, et Cetera. Okay? Now,

365
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:13,880
these were very rigorous studies.
I want to emphasize that I pause here.

366
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,060
They monitor the, the actual calories they
got, correct? Yes, they were. They were,

367
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,830
they had a baseline. They use prison or
something per month they provide, no,

368
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:27,310
that's incorrect. This was a different
study. So they had a baseline.

369
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,870
And did they require them to maintain
the same diet and then add additional fat

370
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:34,540
or additional carbohydrates?
Yes.

371
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,040
So the same food and then they just bump
it up with that [inaudible] it up with

372
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:43,720
carbohydrate or there wasn't sims. It was
Ethan Sims. What's talking to the mic?

373
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,130
That was,
which study did he do that was not

374
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,550
prisoners? What was the, uh, he didn't
have a metabolic, you know what?

375
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,500
Let me just finish describing
this study. We can, Gary,

376
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,200
that's an irrelevant detail.
Okay.

377
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,680
What's relevant is that you
just didn't implied that.

378
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,500
I don't know what I'm talking
about. Gary are, you know what,

379
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,280
I don't actually know. Maybe it was
in prison, so thank you. All right.

380
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,500
You're welcome. Now. Um,

381
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,970
but it was not the Sims overfeeding
study that was done in prisoners.

382
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,680
That's what I know. Okay. Okay. So what's
the reference? Yeah, it's on my website.

383
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,180
You can go to my website,
uh,

384
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,590
Stephanie g and a.com and it's referenced
numbers 16 and they're both there.

385
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,430
Okay.

386
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,600
So this was what's called a metabolic
ward study where these people were in a

387
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:31,601
research facility where the researchers
could monitor and control every morsel

388
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,000
of food. So there was no
cheating, no inaccuracy.

389
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,960
And they were measuring changes in body
fatness using a gold standard method

390
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,820
called underwater weighing.
Okay.

391
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,390
And so what they found was that at the
end of a two week period of overfeeding,

392
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,320
the carb in the fat groups gained
the exact same amount of body fat,

393
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,390
exact same amount of body fat.

394
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,460
There was another second study that did
the same thing and found the same result,

395
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:02,150
independent lab group, very similar
experiment. Three week long.

396
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:05,990
Instead of two weeks, they found the
exact same thing, same amount of fat gain,

397
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,750
different insulin responses,
different amounts of carbohydrates,

398
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,050
that exact same amount of fat gain.

399
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,320
So this demonstrates that insulin is not
in cars or not what controls what gets

400
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:22,070
fat into fat tissue.
Calorie intake is what controls that.

401
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,980
So let me explain again.
Remember I talked about everything.

402
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,100
The paradigm you work in
determines the question you ask.

403
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,600
And this experiment is a classic example
because they assume that people get fat

404
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:36,440
by overfeeding.
So then they say if we overfeed them,

405
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,440
we've just doing what happens naturally.

406
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:43,790
Everything about the experiment is based
on the assumption that they're supposed

407
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:48,320
to be testing, which is Ken. People
get fat by overfeeding. And so the,

408
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,540
from the very conception of the experiment
they've built in the paradigm that we

409
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:57,410
want to test the hypothesis,
I'm on top of it. Uh,

410
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:00,950
if it's a typical sims experiment,
I actually wasn't familiar with this one.

411
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,630
Oh it was a, it wasn't,
Sims was a James Oh,

412
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,020
JCP and of James Hill was funded for them

413
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,900
from about 1998 to about
2008 by proctor and gamble.

414
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:19,040
Cause he was in a less dra
shill. I hate to say that, Jim,

415
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,650
I apologize,
but I think it's a fair assessment.

416
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,290
And then when he stopped being
funded by proctor and gamble,

417
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,060
he was funded by the sugar industry.
He's,

418
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,690
and JC Peters was the head
of the proctor and gamble,

419
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,760
Astra and Leicester, which is now
something that no one eats. Yeah,

420
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:39,761
Lester was a fat substitute and the
problem was you got like run out shit like

421
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,030
that.

422
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,810
But the whole idea of a Lustra
was to replace fat in the Diet.

423
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:50,730
So every study Helen Peters did implicated
dietary fat as a cause of obesity.

424
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:53,690
I don't think we could ever use, I
hate to say it, I'm typically, I,

425
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,230
I don't think funding influences
results, but I wouldn't use it. James.

426
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:00,880
He'll study to make that point that

427
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,320
because you think it's a biased
study that was in everything. Hell,

428
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,280
everything Helen Peters did and one knows.
I mean,

429
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,320
I talked about this in good calories,

430
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,510
bad calories when they reported
their results. I actually,

431
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,640
I did a foyer on James Hill because he
works for the University of Colorado's.

432
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,250
He could actually,

433
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,670
and I got all his documents back and
forth between him and the Lester.

434
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,750
I'd be happy to share them with you
if you'd like there. Rebel that,

435
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,560
I mean him and proctor and gamble,

436
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,320
but he basically held proctor
and gamble for ransom.

437
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:31,800
You would get a $500,000
unrestricted gift,

438
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,350
and then he would do a study and then he
would ask it and it would conclude that

439
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,740
fat is bad and carbs are good, and
therefore a Lester as a viable product.

440
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:46,741
Then he would ask for proctor and gamble
for more money before he then published

441
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,733
study.

442
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,010
So it to particularly egregious
example of someone who's,

443
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,670
I suspect it was just his belief system,
he believed dietary fat was bad,

444
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,200
fat causes obesity.
Uh,

445
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,860
Lester is a good thing because you eat
that instead of fat, you don't absorb it.

446
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,230
And then every study he did confirm that,
um.
