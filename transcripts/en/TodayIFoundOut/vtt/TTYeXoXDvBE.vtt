00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:37.449
As we’ve covered before in our video on
What Happens to Undeliverable Mail with No

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.120
Return Address? the individuals tasked with
processing mail often go above and beyond

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
what is expected of them in their quest to
ensure that every piece of mail gets to its

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.100
intended destination.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.760
And, at least in the United States, it would
appear that this admirable dedication to the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.050
job includes sifting through letters that
have the correct postage attached to them

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.530
with tape instead of a stamp.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.790
Yes, as weird as it may sound, in the United
States it is, in fact, totally possible to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.241
send a letter by simply attaching money equal
to the value of the required postage for a

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:09.610
given letter and still have it delivered.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.070
It's also fully possible to do a hybrid of
this where perhaps you needed two stamps for

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.360
a given letter, but only had one, so affix
one stamp and then some change to cover the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
rest.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.110
Unfortunately, the same does not appear to
be the case in several other countries we

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.409
looked at, such as the UK, or at least we
couldn't find any examples of people successfully

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.350
doing this, nor stated rules that appear to
allow it.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.939
In fact, in the UK taping coins to an envelope
equivalent to normal postage for the letter

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.150
itself even if it was processed could see
whomever you were sending the letter to being

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.299
charged extra because any letter more than
5mm thick qualifies as a “large letter”

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.290
under Royal Mail rules and thus, requires
the sender to pay slightly more for the privilege

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.290
of sending it.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.240
Moving back to Freedom Mail, to quote a the
Mailing Standards of the United States Postal

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.710
Service Domestic Mail Manual, part 2.3.3 Mail
Collection:

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.689
“Generally, mailable matter is collected
from a mailbox if postage is fully prepaid

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.680
or money equal to the required postage is
left in the mailbox.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.710
Money in a mailbox is left at the customer’s
risk.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.670
When postage or money is insufficient to cover
postage, the mail is not collected, or if

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.030
the sender cannot be identified, the mail
is treated as unpaid mail.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.739
Mailable matter not bearing postage found
in, placed on, attached to, supported by,

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.000
or hanging from boxes is handled under the
applicable standards.”

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.130
There are some potential caveats here, however.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.269
For starters, mail with the correct postage
in change attached instead of a stamp usually

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.970
needs to be sorted by hand, something that
will obviously result in the letter being

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.970
delayed somewhat.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.510
Also, it’s noted that as much as mail workers
endeavour to find and process these letters,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.920
sometimes, particularly if you dropped the
letter off instead of mailed it from your

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.220
own mailbox, they end up being processed by
the automated sorting machine which has a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.600
tendency to chew up letters with foreign objects
attached to the outside of them.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.770
So be wary of that too.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.100
According to one time Post Office mail facility
manager Fran Eagle, the usual process when

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.070
dealing with letters with coins and the like
attached is to remove the money and replace

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.090
it with a stamp before simply feeding it back
into the sorting machine to continue on its

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.160
merry way like any other piece of mail.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.170
This can, however, potentially create a problem
as, with some caveats, it is a federal crime

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.190
to knowingly open someone else's mail, something
that can easily happen by accident when removing

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.199
tape from a thin paper envelope.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.010
As such, some postal workers may be wary about
trying to remove the change in some cases,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.510
even if it is the correct amount.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.930
In these cases, they may either send it back
to you or to the Mail Recovery Center (more

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.150
colloquially known as the Dead Letter Office).

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.930
As we’ve discussed in our article on the
subject, workers in the Mail Recovery Centre

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.790
are incredibly committed to their jobs so
there’s a good chance the letter will probably

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.340
still get delivered even if this happens.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.500
Moving on, it turns out that the United States
Postal Service has a number of obscure rules

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.150
related to mail and postage that vary in accordance
with geography.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.440
For example, if you live well outside a major
city and far from any suburb or the like,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.440
your mail will in all likelihood be handled
by a rural letter carrier.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.970
Due to the nature of their work, rural letter
carriers are granted a host of perks not enjoyed

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.750
by traditional mail carriers.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.590
These include the ability to wear their own
chosen clothing and drive their own vehicle

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.850
if they so wish.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.880
More relevant to the topic at hand, beyond
the perks, they also are empowered to function

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.760
as a sort of mobile post office.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.150
For example, if you'd like to buy stamps,
just wait at your mailbox for the rural mail

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.830
person to arrive or leave appropriate funds
in the mailbox with a note of what it is for

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.350
and they'll generally happily sell you some.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.310
They can also process Express Mail and Priority
Mail or do what's needed to help you mail

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.750
a package (even with insurance), sell you
a money order, and process certified or registered

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.410
mail, all essentially the same way postal
workers would do it if you actually went to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.410
the post office.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.630
As you might have guessed from all this, if
you simply leave the required money for postage

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.250
for a piece of mail in your mailbox, perhaps
in a separate envelope papercliped to an envelope

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.191
or Priority Mail item you wish to mail with
instructions on what the money is for, they

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.160
should happily process that for you the same
as if you'd gone to the post office to have

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
it done.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.220
And, in this case, if you leave extra money
for a book of stamps, they should leave that

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.220
too.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.370
The idea here being that people that live
out away from more populated regions often

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.910
have to drive a long way to get to the post
office, so they simply empower their rural

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.900
carriers to do many of these tasks right at
your mailbox.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.380
Finally, at this point you might be wondering
how often people actually send mail with money,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.910
instead of postage, attached.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.190
It turns out not very often relative to the
number of letters processed daily.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.430
According to USPS, they process approximately
187 million pieces of first class mail every

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:44.860
day, of which, only a couple dozen items per
day have money, instead

00:05:44.860 --> 00:06:13.240
of stamps, attached.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:37.000
Bonus Facts:
• Speaking of weird U.S. government related

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.050
services that a lot of people don't know about,
it turns out if you every find yourself with

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.090
a torn piece of money, say where maybe 1/3
of the bill is missing, you can just mail

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.660
it to the Department of Treasury with your
info and in most cases they will mail you

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.420
back a check for the amount of the bill.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.440
That said, there are caveats, such as that
you must send in greater than 50% of the bill,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.770
or if you don't have that much of it left,
must provide sufficient evidence to show that

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.990
the other part is destroyed.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.020
• Given it is a federal crime in the U.S.
to open someone else's mail, with some shockingly

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.530
severe consequences if you're caught, you
might at this point be wondering if that one

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.100
time you accidentally opened your neighbor's
mail that was mistakenly left in your box

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.290
means you now may be facing a lengthy jail
sentence if you're discovered.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.680
It turns out that, contrary to popular belief,
no.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.970
There are exceptions in cases where it's reasonable
to assume you may have accidentally opened

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.980
the piece of mail, such as if found in your
own mailbox among many other letters where

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.820
you may open a series of letters without actually
looking at who a given letter was addressed

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.820
to.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.870
That said, if you then throw that letter away,
instead of put it back in your mailbox with

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.340
a note like "return to sender" or "wrong address",
well, now you did just commit a crime via

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.419
intentionally obstructing the delivery of
U.S. mail.

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:48.580
Another caveat to all of this is if someone
gives you permission to open their mail, even

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.750
though you definitely in these cases know
it's not addressed to you, you have not committed

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.960
any crime in this case either, though of course
if you want to be completely safe, perhaps

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:10.990
best to get written permission if you don't
trust that person.
