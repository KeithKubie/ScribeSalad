00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.166
So here's our guide, our steps that we could follow to add rational expressions

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.674
together. First, we want to factor the denominators and find the LCD. Next, we

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:13.820
multiply each fraction by the missing factors of the LCD to get equivalent

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.775
fractions. Finally, we add the numerators together and then we check if we can

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:23.587
simplify this by cancelling any factors. And again, don't make the mistake of

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:27.832
canceling terms. We can't cancel these since this is addition in the numerator.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.433
We can only cancel factors.
