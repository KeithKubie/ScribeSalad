[MUSICAL NOTES]

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.080
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: I want
to start by telling you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.500
what it's like to be
at boarding school

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.800
and get a parcel in the post.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.890
Now this is not something that
happened to me very often.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.450
So when at the age of
15, a small package

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.930
arrived with my name
on it, it was literally

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.204
the most exciting
thing of the year.

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.000
I remember it so clearly,
the box, the brown box

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.340
with my name on it.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.860
Half a dozen or so of my best
friends, all really excited.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.120
We're still in our pajamas
because the post arrived

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
after breakfast, everyone
jumping on the bed,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.772
"Open it, open it!"

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:47.480
because they were sure
there'd be sweets,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.000
there'd be chocolates
for everybody to share.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840
So there I was.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.280
I turned over the box
ready to break the seal,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.660
but something stopped me.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.400
The writing on the back
looked cold, unfamiliar.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.642
I read it with despair.

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:11.340
Her Majesty's Prison
Service, Holloway, London.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.720
Anxiety choking
me, I tentatively

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.880
opened the box and a
pile of letters cascaded

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.030
to the floor, all with this
same familiar handwriting on it,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.564
my handwriting, all
addressed to one person--

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:37.064
Mum.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.770
Is there anything
more devastating

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.710
when the moment when
something you've

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.440
been trying to
hide and hide from

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.710
reveals itself for all to see?

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.488
There was a letter inside.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:06.390
Dear Caroline, your mother
is no longer in our custody,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.310
so we're returning
your letters to you.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.460
Yours sincerely.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.240
Devastating.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.360
According to the children's
charity Barnardo,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.965
the UK charity, children of
offending parents, parents

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:25.310
who spent time in
prison, are twice as

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.000
likely to have mental
and misconduct problems.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.520
They consistently
underperform at school,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.310
and they're three times
as likely to end up

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.630
being offenders themselves.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.510
Growing up as a black
kid, as a daughter

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.870
to a mother who
was barely there,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.300
to parents who never
lived together, let alone

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.370
were married.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.580
As the sister to siblings who
themselves were constantly

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.680
arrested, to a sister who
had a teenage pregnancy,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.580
all her children taken
into foster care.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.820
Being cousin and
niece to relatives

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.470
who valued teenage pregnancy and
state dependency more than they

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.340
valued achievements, education.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.680
Aspiring to succeed, to
do well, to be secure,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440
to be free in that
environment was

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.660
a battle of extraordinarily
difficult odds.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.890
My name is Caroline Flanagan.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.280
As you've heard, I'm a
coach, I'm a speaker,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.976
and I'm an author.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:41.710
But I am extremely passionate
about empowering people

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.410
to fight and win
battles they think

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.160
they have no way of achieving.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.990
That day I opened the box,
I discovered a secret,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.260
the secret to toppling
giants, to winning battles

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.030
that you think you have
no chance of winning.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.440
And it's the single
most important factor

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.270
in my journey to date and
every success I've achieved.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.029
Getting used to
scrolling down here

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.760
because the clicker
isn't working.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.930
It's also the single
most important factor

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.530
in helping me to succeed as a
mother of four fantastic boys.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.420
This picture is amazing.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.400
Not just because it
shows my lovely boys,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.690
but to have all four of
them in the same picture,

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.630
still for long enough
to take the picture

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.690
and actually looking at
the camera and smiling,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.925
is nothing short of a miracle.

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:52.750
Dylan, Noah, Luca, and Maxwell.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.580
Today I want to share with
you the secret to fighting

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.270
difficult battles and winning.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.600
That secret is this.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.300
No matter how hard
the challenge,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.080
how strong your opponent, or
how daunting the circumstances,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.820
you can win that battle
if you do one thing--

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.180
if you focus only on
what you can control.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.785
Focus your attention on
what you can control.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.850
Balance is definitely a battle.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.690
It's hard.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.990
It's so hard, in fact,
we almost don't even

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.970
talk about it anymore.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.450
I find when I go in to meetings
and I talk to my clients

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.334
about balance--

00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.500
and particularly corporate
clients, they say no, no.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.430
It's work-life integration,
working agility.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.860
No one's talking
about balance anymore.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.370
I feel like, have
we killed it off?

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.230
Is it something that's
so hard to achieve

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.770
you decided to just brush
it under the carpet?

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.010
Just for fun, I did a Google
search on work-life balance is

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.450
dead--

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.650
5.6 million results.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.740
I didn't look at them all,
but certainly the first page

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.820
was all about the end
of work-life balance.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.520
It's a battle of
extraordinary odds.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.080
Why is that?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.080
The way I see it, there
are three reasons.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.070
The first one is that work-life
balance is quite difficult

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.692
to define.

00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:45.000
Can anyone give me
a quick definition

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.880
of balance, work-life balance?

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:52.320
You don't have to
prove me right.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.990
If you've got the
perfect definition,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.690
then please come forth with it.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.210
Anyone?

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.626
Anything come to
mind immediately?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.420
AUDIENCE: To find an
equilibrium between two forces.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.810
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: To find an
equilibrium between two forces.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.740
Brilliant.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.360
Balance, in other words.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.482
But what does that
mean in real life?

00:07:09.482 --> 00:07:12.115
AUDIENCE: To spend as much
time on your personal life

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.240
as going to work.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.990
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: To
spend as much time--

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.910
for those of you who didn't
hear-- on your personal life

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.282
as you do on your work life.

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:20.073
Thank you for that.

00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:20.802
What's your name?

00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:21.290
AUDIENCE: Al.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.630
CAROLINE FLANAGAN:
Al, thanks for that.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.270
That's pretty
good, pretty clear.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.216
Yes?

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:28.447
AUDIENCE: Meeting your
work and your own goals.

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.780
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: Meeting
your work and your own goals.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.890
Excellent, thank you.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.645
What's your name?

00:07:32.645 --> 00:07:33.270
AUDIENCE: Neru.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.270
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: Neru?

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.700
Thank you, Neru.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.340
This is a snapshot
of a conversation

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.540
I had with a client
early on this year.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.416
So you want better balance,
better work-life balance.

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:46.540
What does that mean to you?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.500
What does it look like?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.460
My client-- well, I want
my life to be balanced.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.322
So I'll feel much more balanced.

00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:03.660
Me-- OK, so let's dig
a little bit deeper.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.090
What does it actually look like?

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.330
On a day-to-day basis,
what are you doing?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.260
Client-- well, at home,
I'm doing all the stuff

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.790
that makes me feel balanced.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.910
And work-- yeah,
work's balanced.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.550
Yeah, I know I've
got work-life balance

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.200
because I'll feel balanced.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.220
That conversation
is surprisingly

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.740
typical with my clients.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.990
It's quite hard to
define, and I think

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.400
Al and Neru did a very
good job of coming close.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.470
Now this is a problem
because as research shows--

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.800
as you would have almost
certainly have heard--

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.660
if you want to achieve
goals, it really

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.790
helps if they're smart goals.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.350
So they're specific,
they're measurable.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.060
They are achievable, they're
realistic, they're time bound.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.860
Research shows
that that increases

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.320
your chances of succeeding
in achieving a goal.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.820
And it also shows that
if you can write down

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.240
what your goal is,
you can articulate it,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.680
that increases your chances
of succeeding even more.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.150
When was the last
time you sat down, you

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.520
wrote down your specific goals
for having work-life balance?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.083
Lady in the pink who
answered the question first.

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.200
Ever?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.560
Anybody ever do that?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.600
It's hard to define, and
that makes it even harder

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.100
to achieve.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.720
The myth of work-life balance.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.900
The second reason why it's so
hard to achieve, no one size

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.990
fits all.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.580
What works for me just
might not work for you.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.910
You may prefer to work
from home five days a week,

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.330
but perhaps your preference is
actually to be in the office

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.730
those five days, get all
the work done so that you're

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.330
much freer when you're at home.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.080
And just to complicate
things more,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.705
if you have children, what works
for you when your children are

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.870
really young won't necessarily
work when they're older,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.470
when they're teenagers.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.530
So what does this mean?

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.600
It means we have to create
our own personal solution.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.900
We can gather together all
the different components,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.490
the productivity apps and the
time management strategies,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.950
and the well-being routines.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.050
But the important bit is how
we bring all of these together.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.320
And there's no universal
blueprint for that.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.520
You have to find our own way.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.400
So the third reason why
balance is difficult,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.560
and arguably the
biggest, it's just

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.710
the nature of the world we live
in and the way we work today.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.580
All those wonderful
technological advances

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.610
that have brought
so much freedom,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.000
connected us in ways we
could never have dreamed of,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.910
even 50 years ago.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.650
They've all come at a
price, haven't they?

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.840
We are always on,
always connected,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.041
constantly working,
constantly moving.

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:30.250
And of course, the demands
of our working environment,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.530
competitive, the importance
of performing or proving

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.930
your value, competing
against our peers.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.840
And add to that what's
going on internally.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.120
This is the battle,
the second battle.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.675
This is the two
fronts, what's going

00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:47.710
on on the outside
with work environment,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:52.190
but also internally, our
inability to restrict,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.310
control how much
we use technology.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.260
We've become slaves to it.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.690
And add to that, even
our feelings of I'm

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.660
an impostor, impostor
syndrome, perhaps.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.156
Or just your innate need
to achieve, to progress,

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:12.550
your innate ambition.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.120
All of this conspires
to make it very hard

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.910
to walk out of the
office, switch off

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.110
completely, and enjoy
the bits of your life

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.220
that don't involve work.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.020
I want to tell you
three stories that

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.080
underline my message
about how you

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.890
can win this battle for balance,
a battle which, as I've just

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.820
explained, is a difficult one.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.980
It's a battle against the odds.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:55.180
It's the 28th of August, 1963.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.860
Martin Luther King,
leader of the Civil Rights

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.690
Movement in the 1950s
and 1960s in America,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.210
he's standing on the
new Lincoln Memorial.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.800
There are 250,000 civil rights
supporters there in the crowds.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.960
And he delivers
this iconic speech.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.030
I have a dream.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.300
For those of you who don't know
or recall what that dream was,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.690
it was a dream for equality.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.950
It was a dream for a day when
the children of black slaves

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.260
and the children of
black slave owners

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.900
would be able to go to school
together, be treated equally.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.510
It's hard to imagine a more
challenging battle than the one

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.930
they faced at that time.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.610
This was the period of Jim
Crow, of state-sponsored

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.680
discrimination and aggression.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.660
It was the time of lynchings,
of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.220
It was the time when segregation
in hospitals, on transport,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.754
in schools was
completely normal.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.810
And yet, 1964, the Civil
Rights Act was passed.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.310
In 1965, the Voting
Rights Act was passed.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.000
And although discrimination
continues today,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.360
the battle for equality goes
on, particularly in America.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.310
There is no doubt that those
two bits of legislation, which

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.190
made it illegal for people
to be treated differently

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.470
because of the
color of their skin,

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:39.930
they were iconic victories,
defining moments,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.630
and an incredibly
important battle.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.610
How did they do it?

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.200
How did they win?

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.420
Four things stand out for me.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.050
First of all, they had a vision.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.960
That's what's so powerful
about this speech, the "I

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.460
Have a Dream" speech.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.640
It was rousing,
it was motivating.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.030
It didn't focus on how difficult
and impossible that vision was

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.360
or that dream was.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.690
It focused on what that
dream would look like.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.350
And I urge you to
go back and watch

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.470
the footage of
that speech, and I

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.620
challenge you not to be
completely inspired by it.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.800
So the vision was there.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.250
The second thing that stands out
for me is they were prepared.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.030
So they had a strategy of
how they would do this.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.520
And this involved
non-violent protests

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.590
in the form of marches,
sit-ins on public transport.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.770
Non-violent protest
was only ever going

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.270
to be met with violence.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.660
And that's the key
to their strategy,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.670
was actually saying
not just this

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.090
is what we want, this is
how we plan to get it,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.730
but anticipating what
the challenges would be,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.220
what obstacles they would face.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.980
And those obstacles
were really very real--

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.420
violence, being thrown in jail.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.700
Martin Luther King
was arrested 29 times.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.390
They were ready for that.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.040
In fact, they actually
trained in how

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.060
to cope with violent aggression
and how to stay peaceful.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.010
In other words,
they were prepared

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.890
and they practiced the
skills that they would

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.100
need to further their cause.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.780
And they kept on.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.967
Every time they were
arrested and then released,

00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:37.300
they would continue their fight.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.840
The second story I
want to share with you

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.699
is a story from childhood, the
story of David and Goliath.

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:50.240
Is everyone familiar
with that story?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.851
Hands up if you're not familiar
with the story of David

00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:54.540
and Goliath.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.890
Great, so you all remember the
story of David and Goliath.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.290
It's from the Book of Samuel.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.910
And it's the story about
this fierce giant, Goliath,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.480
and how David, a small,
innocent shepherd boy

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.280
with a single slingshot
was able to topple, to kill

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.339
this terrifying warrior.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:21.470
And so win the battle for his
people against the Philistines.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:26.420
Now it's hard to imagine
a more intimidating foe

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.970
or daunting prospect.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.770
How in the world
did David do that?

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.720
What was his secret?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.220
Was he just lucky, really?

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.320
With one slingshot?

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.930
This is the subject
of a fantastic

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.670
book called "David and
Goliath" by Malcolm Gladwell.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.190
And in it, Gladwell
seeks to challenge

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:59.570
our perception of what makes
us strong, what makes us weak.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.950
People and things
we think would give

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.880
an advantage, and
those things that we

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.875
think make us disadvantaged.

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:10.310
And what's wonderful about
the David and Goliath

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.630
story, if you read
behind the headlines,

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:19.540
is David, that small,
weak shepherd boy,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.220
he knew exactly
what he was doing

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.940
when he went to face Goliath.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.680
He knew that Goliath
was this big warrior,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.510
that he would be decked out
from head to toe in armor.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.140
On the day in question,
he carried a spear.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.310
Goliath carried a spear, he
had a sword, he had a shield.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.670
He was there in all his glory.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.240
David knew this.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.220
He knew that Goliath
would be slow

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.710
because his armor was heavy.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.600
He also knew that Goliath was
short sighted because Goliath

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.697
had said, where are you?

00:18:53.697 --> 00:18:54.280
Where are you?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.320
Show yourself to me.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.540
Show yourself to me.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.110
The other thing that
David knew was that he

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.960
was an excellent slingshot.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.780
He was very good at his skill.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.680
This is a skill he used
everyday to protect

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.780
his sheep against predators.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.280
He knew that that skill
perfected was enough in one

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.985
shot to topple the giant.

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.100
That's what happened.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.390
The third and final story
I want to share with you

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.425
is the story of Victor Frankl.

00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:36.780
Victor Frankl is a
Holocaust survivor.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.002
He died a few years ago.

00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:43.020
But he wrote a book called
"Man's Search for Meaning,"

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.110
which is one of the most
extraordinary books I have ever

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.670
read, and I highly
recommend you read it.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.270
It tells the story of his
experience in concentration

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.620
camps and his
fight for survival.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.590
It's hard to imagine
circumstances

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.850
that could weigh more
heavily against you,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.910
the torment, the horror,
the misery of being

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.100
in a concentration camp.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.150
How did Victor Frankl
and the very few

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.030
that managed to survive
when millions didn't, how

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.730
did he do that?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.840
What made the
difference between those

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.960
who kept fighting,
fighting to stay alive,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.300
and those who didn't make it?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.870
And this question,
answering this question,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.560
is the subject of Frankl's book.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.590
And he came up with one thing.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.890
Despite everything
that was taken away,

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.790
everything physical,
the emotional torment,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.725
there was one
thing he discovered

00:20:49.725 --> 00:20:51.990
that could not be taken.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:57.030
And that was his
attitude, his mindset.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.630
He realized the power of
his thoughts, thoughts

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.830
that he could control no matter
what happened on the outside.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.700
He would always remain
in control of those.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.150
And that is what he
attributes to his

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:16.074
and many of the others survival
in those awful circumstances.

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:21.510
So those three stories have
the following in common.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.400
They are all examples
of people who

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.450
faced extraordinary odds, people
who wanted to fight the battle.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.440
They are stories of people
who won against those odds

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.570
because they focused not on
the impossibility of the task,

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.740
how powerful and overwhelming
were the odds against them.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.380
They focused on what
they could control.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:02.106
Focus your attention on
what you can control.

00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:03.730
I've already explained
to you that that

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:12.830
was an instrumental factor in
my journey from then to now.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:18.720
There's just one small problem,
small blip in that journey.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.520
If only I'd remembered
that lesson,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.930
that lesson that I learned
all those years ago

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.850
when I was a working parent.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.660
When I returned to Cleary
Gottlieb, which is the law firm

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.590
I was working in when
my first son was born.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.170
Dylan was six months old.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.330
And I returned
full of enthusiasm,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.950
positive, determined to make a
success of balancing my career

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.090
and my new family.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.560
Wow, that was.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.880
The first year of
being a working parent

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.680
was the hardest
year I've ever had.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.960
I struggled.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.240
The demanding hours,
the competition,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.430
the air of competition, the
culture of presenteeism.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.940
That awful feeling is
the only non-partner,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.330
non-male who was there,
who had a child, who

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.630
had to leave the office and
run and be there for her child.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.460
That feeling when I got home,
despite being exhausted,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.580
despite having to
log on and keep

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.160
going with my work and all the
pressure I was under at work.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.760
The feeling at home and
had to learn the ropes.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.750
coming to grips with being
a mother for the first time.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.920
And I was doing
everything at home.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.130
My husband-- who I'm happy
to say is much better trained

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.570
now--

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:49.190
at the time, his
career, his life

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.730
remained surprisingly unimpacted
by the arrival of our new baby

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.070
boy.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.770
It was the hardest
year of my life.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.615
I fought very hard,
but I struggled.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.320
What was my strategy
in those circumstances,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.830
in that really hard battle?

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.550
I had no strategy.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:26.165
I was just too blind to be
able to even spot the things

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.440
I might be able to
control, let alone focus

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.140
my attention on those things.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.560
I went from day to day, my head
in a spin, putting out fires.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.310
That's what I did.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.100
I had a year of just
putting out fires,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.340
always exhausted, always
stressed, always worried

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.290
that I'd forgotten something,
that I was underperforming

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.335
in all these different areas.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:59.080
Is it any wonder that that
battle ended in failure?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.490
When my second son was
born, I walked away

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.010
from a career I had
been leading up to,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.100
spent my whole life
building, for all the reasons

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.160
that I hinted at at
the beginning of this.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.200
It took a lot for
me to walk away.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.030
I thought I was powerless.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:29.351
Alice Walker, Pulitzer Prize
winning author and poet.

00:25:29.351 --> 00:25:32.770
And she said, "The
most common way

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.260
that people give
up their power is

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.375
by thinking they
don't have any."

00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.310
I know I felt
completely powerless

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.380
when I was trying to
juggle my legal career

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.936
and getting used
to being a parent.

00:25:47.936 --> 00:25:53.590
But it turns out, I
wasn't powerless at all.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.110
The book that many of you
are holding in your hands,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.540
I wrote that because
I wanted others

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.920
to learn from my failure.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.310
My failure was to
become your success.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:12.435
And the whole purpose was to
show you that you are powerful,

00:26:12.435 --> 00:26:16.854
that if you focus your attention
on the things you can control,

00:26:16.854 --> 00:26:17.818
you can succeed.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:33.470
I was at a lunch, a business
awards lunch a few weeks ago.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.885
And I found myself
sitting next to a partner.

00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:37.790
She's a partner at KPMG.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.525
And it turns out, she's been
playing rugby for the England

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:43.560
rugby team for
about 15 years now,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.550
but she's recently retired.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.460
And we got onto this
subject of where

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.940
you focus your attention,
how people succeed,

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.360
what holds people back.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.850
And she said, yeah, of course.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.490
She goes, that's
absolutely right.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.617
Control the controllables.

00:27:00.617 --> 00:27:02.020
What?

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.520
She said, control
the controllables.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.050
That was our mantra the whole
time I was in the England team.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.400
That's what we did.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.050
We knew we could do nothing
about the size, the reputation

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.370
of the opposition.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.950
We couldn't do anything about
the weather, about the pitch,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.980
even about the mood of the fans.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.740
So we put our head down.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:30.330
We focused on our training,
our attitude, our mindset,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.290
our preparation.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:35.720
And that's how we
went into our matches.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.750
And that's how we won.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.770
Control the controllables.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.980
Don't you just love that?

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.010
I wish it hadn't been the
mantra of the English women's

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.500
rugby team because then I
could've had it as mine.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.930
But it sums it up
just beautifully.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.130
And that's exactly
what I'm doing now,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.370
what I've been doing
for the last 10 years.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.930
I am controlling the
controllables in my life.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.535
From the time I wake up
in the morning and what

00:28:05.535 --> 00:28:07.600
I do when I wake
up in the morning--

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.540
to how I get to work,
what I do on my way

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.550
to work-- to what I
say yes to, what I

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.760
say no to, who I say
yes to, who I say no to.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.200
What I think about at
the beginning of the day,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.130
what I think about at
the end of the day.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.780
There are an infinite number
of controllables in your life.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.774
And your only job
is to control them.

00:28:35.582 --> 00:28:37.518
And that's how I'm winning.

00:28:41.874 --> 00:28:45.140
I'm not winning very well at
scrolling down on my laptop,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.020
so bear with me.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.310
What does this mean for you?

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.780
How is that useful?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.730
How can this be practical?

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:57.320
I want to introduce you
to The Babyproof Method.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.120
Just adds suspense.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.990
It's disappeared and hopefully
it will come back again.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.910
The Babyproof Method is
quite simply a framework

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.000
that I've created to help
my clients do exactly that.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.960
Know where to focus
their attention,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.610
know what the controllables
are, and what they can do,

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.570
how they can control those
in a way that helps them

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.725
win the battle for balance.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.353
There are four steps involved.

00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:32.940
Step number one is
all about the picture.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.230
Remember I started talking
about defining balance,

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.260
knowing what that was?

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.530
Have a really clear
picture in your mind

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.380
about what balance looks like.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.170
It's not enough to
call it balance.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.550
It's not even enough to
say it's an equilibrium.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.960
It's not even enough to say
it's the same amount of time

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.670
at work or at home.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:30:01.250
What is your ideal version of
balance right now, for you?

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.900
Until you are able to
answer that question,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.094
the best tips in the world are
not going help you get there.

00:30:10.094 --> 00:30:14.450
Remember Martin Luther
King's vision, his dream.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:19.060
You need to dream in a
vision of that intensity

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.300
if you have any
chance of succeeding.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.700
But it's not just
about the dream,

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.470
it's also about making
that dream come alive.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.520
So if you're living your
ideal version of balance,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.500
you are there for three out
of four of your child's school

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.670
activities.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.910
You are leaving
work at five o'clock

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.120
at least two days of the week.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.410
You down tools, turn your
phones or technology off always

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.380
at eight o'clock.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.700
Whatever your version
of balance is right now,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.110
you also have to have,
in your mind's eye, what

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.190
might get in the way of that.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.230
What are the obstacles
you might face?

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.610
And crucially, how can
you prepare for those?

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:12.080
How can you prepare
to meet them?

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.910
Which is step number two
in The Babyproof Method,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.160
is to prepare.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.720
Preparing is all
about asking yourself,

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.860
what can I do now,
what can I build now

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.630
that I will need when the time
comes, that I will need later?

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.320
The best way of
describing this is,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.000
I often use the metaphor
of running a marathon.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.060
Nobody wakes up
one day and says,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.502
I'm going to run
a marathon today.

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:44.960
What they do is
they say, I'm going

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.120
to run the London
Marathon in April.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.982
And they probably
say, wow, OK, I'm

00:31:49.982 --> 00:31:51.440
going to have to
do a lot of stuff.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.910
That's quite daunting.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.730
Oh, that's quite a big task.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.480
But they know.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.110
And if they do the
right training,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:04.400
they get the right support,
and they practice, by the time

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.810
that day comes, they're
going to be prepared

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.000
not just to succeed,
but actually to enjoy it

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.380
if they've done the work.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.620
And this is what The
Babyproof Method is all about.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.320
Having that picture
I talked about,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.719
seeing yourself
running that race

00:32:19.719 --> 00:32:21.760
if you were running a
marathon, running that race

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.490
and enjoying it.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.140
The preparation is
the bit, whose support

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.270
are you going to need?

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.800
And it's the same with
the battle for balance.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.010
Whose support do you need
to get better balance?

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.950
Is it your partner?

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.820
Is it the support of your
boss or your manager?

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.120
Is it the support of your
friends, of your mother-in-law?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.020
Whose support will you need,
and how will you get it?

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.630
The third step in
The Babyproof Method

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.720
is to practice the skills.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.340
Think of David.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.975
He didn't show up to face
Goliath ready to throw

00:32:58.975 --> 00:33:00.965
a slingshot for the first time.

00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:03.850
It takes practice
to become an expert.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.650
And the good thing is,
if you do practice,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.390
you will become an expert.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.230
So the practice step is
all about looking at,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.330
what skills am I going to need?

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.830
Very simple.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.590
I'm going to need to
be extremely organized.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.170
I'm going to need to be very
good at knowing what to say yes

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.120
to and what to say no to.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.815
I'm going to need to be very
good at looking after myself.

00:33:27.815 --> 00:33:30.650
What's my strategy for
keeping myself healthy--

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.980
mentally, physically?

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.530
All really specific,
very tangible skills,

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.660
things that you
can be doing that

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.810
make all the difference
in the battle for balance

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.840
that require practice.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.710
They require you to
get good at them.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.830
And in the fourth and final
step in The Babyproof Method

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.500
is perseverance.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.910
How do you persevere?

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.090
How will you keep going?

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.670
When, not if, when
you reach a point

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.830
that you want to give up, when
things seem like they're too

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.550
hard, that inevitable moment--

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.989
Martin Luther
King, the 29th time

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.219
he's arrested, how does he
convince himself to keep going,

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.040
to keep trying?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.250
Victor Frankl, how does
he, despite everyday

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.176
all the evidence
to the contrary,

00:34:25.176 --> 00:34:29.610
convince himself that it's worth
fighting for, to keep going?

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.269
Picture, practice, prepare.

00:34:36.269 --> 00:34:40.920
Picture, prepare,
practice, persevere.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.650
This is something I
do with my clients.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.100
And I've created
an online course

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.659
to take that all over
the world, so people

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.210
can access this
process that is so

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.880
empowering in a way that
fits in with their lifestyle

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.239
and really easy.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.270
And I'm really
excited that Google

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.644
is going to be piloting
this course sometime

00:34:57.644 --> 00:34:58.310
in the new year.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.900
And I think Kristi's going to
talk a little bit about that

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.190
at the end.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.970
She's disappeared, but
she'll be back to do that.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.977
But back to the present.

00:35:06.977 --> 00:35:07.810
What can I give you?

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.090
What can I leave
you with that you

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:16.160
can start doing right from the
moment you leave this office?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.890
So I've got one
suggestion for you.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.070
It's just one controllable that
I want you to experiment with.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.890
Getting up early.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.391
What time do you all get up?

00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:30.390
What time do you get up?

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.390
What time do you get up?

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.720
You're all having
a nice chuckle.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.750
What time do you get up?

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:35.480
AUDIENCE: 7:15.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: 7:15.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.815
What time do you get up?

00:35:37.815 --> 00:35:38.440
AUDIENCE: 6:00.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.510
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: Six o'clock.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.340
What time do you get up?

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:40.810
AUDIENCE: 9:30.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:41.833
AUDIENCE: When my
daughter gets up, which

00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:43.117
could be five or four o'clock.

00:35:43.117 --> 00:35:44.450
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: Five o'clock.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.690
Five o'clock, four o'clock.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.850
Anyone else?

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.530
AUDIENCE: 5:30.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:47.810
CAROLINE FLANAGAN: 5:30.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.953
It's a competition now.

00:35:48.953 --> 00:35:52.320
5:30, 5:00, 4:30.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.320
AUDIENCE: Eight o'clock.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.834
CAROLINE FLANAGAN:
Eight o'clock.

00:35:54.834 --> 00:35:56.670
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.600
Whatever time that you
ordinarily start your day,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:13.670
I want you to get
up one hour earlier.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.969
This is the goal.

00:36:15.969 --> 00:36:17.885
We're going to start
with a smaller challenge.

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.315
We'll start with a
smaller challenge

00:36:26.315 --> 00:36:29.360
and explain that in a moment.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.930
Getting up early, I love it
because everybody gets up.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.670
We all make a decision about
what time we set our alarm for.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.711
We all make a decision about
how many times we press snooze.

00:36:39.711 --> 00:36:40.460
How many snoozers?

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.960
Raise your hand if
you're a snoozer.

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:45.510
Are you sure?

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.385
Are you being honest?

00:36:46.385 --> 00:36:48.130
Hands up if you're a snoozer.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:49.370
Yeah.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.760
At least 50%.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.355
I wrote a blog about
getting up early.

00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:58.770
It has been undoubtedly
the most successful blog

00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.760
I've ever written.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.830
It has so many downloads it's
unbelievable, which shows me

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.130
it's touching a nerve.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.672
And I called the blog when I
first posted it, "Never Press

00:37:07.672 --> 00:37:10.080
Snooze, Ever."

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.870
And it had such a brilliant,
and in some cases,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.090
quite strident reaction to it.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:19.080
But it got people thinking
because right from the moment

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.780
you start the day, it gives
you that sense of making

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:27.300
a decision, making a decision
about what time you get up.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.130
Getting up early is a
controllable for everybody.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.346
Let me tell you just three
of the many reasons why

00:37:34.346 --> 00:37:36.512
for me, it's one of the
most important controllables

00:37:36.512 --> 00:37:38.690
in my life.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.970
The first one is it
gives me me time.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:47.255
That essential time
at a time in the day--

00:37:47.255 --> 00:37:50.860
in fact, the only time in the
day over which I could have

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.240
control.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.210
It means even if that me time
is 10 minutes, 15 minutes,

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.290
I have time to think about
myself in a way that prepares

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.950
and allows me to be
available for everybody

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.350
else for the rest of the day.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.840
It is a me time
that is so sacred,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.780
that on the odd occasion
where I think, oh, I'll

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.170
lie in tomorrow, that
voice my head says,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.610
how could you do that to me?

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.995
How could you take away the
most important bit of my day?

00:38:23.995 --> 00:38:26.650
You can ask my husband,
it drives him mad.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.210
I have got to the point where
it's so beneficial to me,

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:34.080
I'm almost incapable
of lying in.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.350
It is so powerful
and important to me.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.600
The second reason
is it's a moment

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.190
in the day, everyday, where
I can have perspective

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.320
on that day, on my week.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.630
I can look with some distance
and say, what's working?

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.800
What am I doing today?

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.260
What have I been doing in
the last few weeks that's

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.720
working well for me,
that's making me feel good

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.030
like I'm in control?

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.120
And what's not working?

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.570
What is it that
I need to change?

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.020
And it gives me that
moment of reflection

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.200
to come up with solutions, to
come up with different things

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.070
to try.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:17.530
And trust me, you create the
space for solutions and ideas.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.030
Hey, that's what
you guys do here,

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.310
we create space for
ideas for innovation.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:28.600
You will come up with solutions,
different things to try.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.290
And the third and
final reason, it

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:34.230
helps to keep me connected
with the big picture.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.020
So hard to remember
the big picture

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.420
when you're busy all the
time, completely working hard,

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.330
overwhelmed, being stretched
from one task to the next.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.650
The big picture is just the why.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.020
Why are you doing this?

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.670
Why do you have a family?

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.080
Why do you care?

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.784
Why are you still working when
you know that you would also

00:39:53.784 --> 00:39:54.950
like to be with your family?

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.285
What does work give you?

00:39:56.285 --> 00:39:59.730
And connecting with
that on a regular basis

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.420
makes all the difference when I
turn around to my six-year-old

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.220
and I say, I can't
come to this event

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.962
today because mommy's got to
go and do this piece of work.

00:40:09.962 --> 00:40:11.920
But don't worry, when I
see you at the weekend,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.750
we'll do X, Y, and
Z. And I do not

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.200
feel guilty about
the number of things

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.350
that I say no to, because in
my head always is a compass,

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.410
is the big picture, is the
life I want for my children,

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.960
for my family, and for myself.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.795
There are just three of many
reasons why getting up early

00:40:34.795 --> 00:40:37.530
is such a powerful
controllable feeling.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.210
And I want you to
experiment with it yourself.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:43.800
So I want to set
you a challenge.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:49.760
I've called it The
30:30 Challenge.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.050
Super easy.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.220
Whatever time you get up,
even if it is four o'clock,

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.720
set your alarm to get
up 30 minutes earlier.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.630
But there are rules--

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.140
no work.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.000
This is not a license to
extend your working day.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.490
That is worse than lying in
bed until the last minute

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.680
and pressing snooze.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.810
No one, no devices, no news.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:23.940
Sounds so simple,
very hard to do.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.750
But it's a skill.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.460
Practice.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.200
30 minutes earlier for 30
days, the next 30 days.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.850
This is my challenge to you.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.910
What will you do with that time?

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.000
Look at the big picture.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.600
Think about the week
you've got coming up.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.494
What's working,
what isn't working?

00:41:48.494 --> 00:41:49.410
What could you change?

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.866
What could you do differently?

00:41:51.866 --> 00:41:56.560
Controllables every
step of the way.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.370
Good luck and let
me know how it goes.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.820
[APPLAUSE]
