00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
This is our sun.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
holy crap.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.469
NASA just released AMAZING 4K footage of the
sun.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:12.179
I'm gonna get off screen so we can just drool
at how beautiful it is.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:23.690
This ball of incandescent nuclear fusion holds
our solar system together, and it's beautiful.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.730
Every 10 seconds, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory
takes pictures of 10 different wavelengths,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.090
temperatures, and layers of our sun.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.370
In a star elements like helium, hydrogen and
iron are found in the sun’s atmosphere (the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.360
corona), and each emits light at different
wavelengths.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.470
Each color filter is a different heat level,
and wavelength so scientists can look at the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.070
sun's layers.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.670
NASA chose Gold for plasma here, and Bright
Green or Aqua for the flares

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.190
Purple and Blue are active regions in between
at 2 to 2-and-a-half million Kelvin

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.190
For example, this purple flash shows a flare
ripping through TWO layers, yellow and pink.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.800
This is the first time we’ve seen our sun
in such high definition.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.240
Now we can study the interaction.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.180
For example, we’ve never seen coronal loops
this small.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.610
These tiny eruptions are hot magnetized plasma.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
(yellow)

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.640
Flare plasma is about 1 million kelvin, but
the flare itself can be 6 to 10 million Kelvin

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.229
-- by using and layering the colors, they
can show off how plasma moves through the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.229
star.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.790
Nothing on the sun is cold.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.729
The "dark spots" are just cooler relative
to the bright spots.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.310
Dr. Ian O'Neill Space Producer for DNews told
me HE looks at the small sparkles rippling

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.119
across the sun.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.740
These are microflares -- basically small scale
flares that are sparked when magnetic field

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.580
lines interact with and accelerate the plasma
in the star.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.170
Fibrils -- tiny plasma structures in the lower
corona that oscillate, like a shimmering pond.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.310
Large flares like these are unimaginably gigantic.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.060
Several tens of EARTH WIDTHS across.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.290
But instead of rock and gas and you and me,
they're superheated plasma at millions of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.480
degrees kelvin.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.590
This is a magnetic eruption called a prominence.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.319
The goopy stuff it threw off is called a coronal
mass ejection.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.480
It's a stunning example of how magnetic structures
filled with cool plasma can be so powerful

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.230
they're hurled into space.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.900
Solar storms can mess with satellites, affect
air travel, and knockout communications on

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900
Earth.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.140
Taking pictures of our star isn't easy.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.150
If you point your camera at a light bulb it
washes out all the detail.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.940
The sun is even harder to capture.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.010
By capturing these, the SDO scientists are
learning loads about how the sun works, because

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.710
honestly, we don't know that much about it.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.370
And it sure is beautiful.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.560
For the full explainer including what THESE
are, check out our DNews' video on YouTube.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.319
