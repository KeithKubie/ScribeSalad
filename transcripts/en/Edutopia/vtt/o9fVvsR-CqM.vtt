&gt;&gt;Richard: Thank you
all very, very much.

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:15.986
It really is just a delight
to be here and an honor

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:21.416
to be considered a part of
this amazing collaborative

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:27.446
which I have been a champion and
fan of from afar and it's just great

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.536
to be here and, in a very
short amount of time,

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:36.526
share with you what has been
some absolutely amazing work

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:41.036
that has been going on in
neuroscience and its relevance

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.366
to social and emotional education.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:49.006
And if there's one take home message
that I'd like you to walk away

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.106
with from my presentation today it's

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:55.076
that social-emotional
learning changes the brain.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.946
And the brain is really the organ

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:01.746
that is the target of
these interventions.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:06.226
So this is a very ambitious
outline of what I hope to cover.

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:09.756
I'm going to tell you a
snippet about neuroplasticity,

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:14.596
the idea that the brain is the
organ that's built to change

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:16.136
in response to experience.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:20.746
I'll then tell you a little bit
about what we know about one

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:25.246
of the key attributes which is shaped
by social and emotional learning

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:30.416
which is a child's capacity to
regular her or his emotions.

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.256
And finally, I'm going
to conclude by suggesting

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:37.066
that we can change the
brain by training the mind

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:39.526
through social and
emotional learning.

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:44.116
We know that environmental factors
influence and shape the brain.

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:47.746
We know that the emotional
environment in early life,

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:52.926
in particular, is absolutely central
in shaping the circuits of the brain

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:59.206
in ways that persist throughout an
organism's entire adult lifespan.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:03.206
The brains of children are
constantly being shaped.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.826
They're literally being molded
by experience, both of a negative

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:09.946
and positive sort, both
wittingly and unwittingly.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:13.346
And I think our task
must be to take the reins

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:18.986
and to promote positive brain changes
and one of the central vehicles is

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.566
through social and
emotional learning.

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:24.026
One of the things I
tell my students is

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:27.186
that behavioral interventions
are biological.

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:32.896
That is, if you do something
to intervene in a way

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:35.996
that changes behavior
it's got to be the case

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:37.476
that you're changing the brain.

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:42.236
There is no other way that we
know for behavior to change other

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:44.426
than through it's change
in the brain.

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:47.066
And, in fact, there's
every reason to think

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:52.606
that behavioral interventions can
produce more specific brain changes

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:56.916
than any quote biological
intervention like a medication

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:00.786
because behavioral
interventions have the capacity

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:04.876
to affect very specific
brain circuits in ways

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:08.016
that modern medicine does not have.

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:15.096
So I'm going to invite you to
consider the idea that social

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:17.736
and emotional learning
can change brain function

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:24.286
and actually brain structure and
can produce adaptive emotional

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.866
and cognitive functioning
as a consequence.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.026
So, for those of you who
are not used to looking

00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:36.426
at brains all the time I want
to just show you a little bit

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:40.696
about where these things occur in
the brain, what these circuits are,

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:44.456
and time does not permit me
to spend a lot of time on this

00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:46.486
but I'll just tell you
a little bit about this.

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:49.866
So, the upper left here is the
ventral surface of the brain,

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:51.106
the bottom side of the brain.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.806
If you turn the brain upside-down
this is what you would see.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:59.636
And the area that's shaded in
green here is very important

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:04.556
for making emotional
judgments about information,

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.756
deciding whether something
is good or bad,

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:09.946
and that's called the
orbitofrontal cortex.

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:14.186
Now, this diagram here,
the blue area,

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:17.076
is the dorsoateral prefrontal cortex.

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:20.446
This is the area of the brain that
historically has not been considered

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:24.326
to be important for emotion
but it's critical, we now know,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:29.226
for certain aspects of emotion
particularly the capacity

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:32.996
to guide decision-making
through positive emotions.

00:04:32.996 --> 00:04:40.096
So if a child has a goal to
achieve a certain positive outcome

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:43.396
and is directing her or his
behavior to the achievement

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:47.236
of that goal we know that the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.326
is critical.

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:54.286
These areas in this bottom
diagram here are areas

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:57.546
in lower brain regions,
subcortical regions,

00:04:57.576 --> 00:05:01.346
that play a very important role in
emotion as well and the area shaded

00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:04.266
in orange, I'll specifically
mention in a few minutes,

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:09.326
called the amygdala is a key site,
particularly for negative emotions,

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:11.656
for detecting threats and so forth.

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:16.986
And this is another important area
called the anterior cingulate that's

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:25.006
very important conflict resolution of
both a cognitive and emotional sort.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:29.716
And, again, I'll say a little bit
more about these a little later

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:36.156
but right now I want to talk a little
bit about the prefrontal cortex,

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:37.866
this area that Dan mentioned,

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:43.046
which up until quite recently
was regarded much more in terms

00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:46.256
of its role in thought
than in emotion.

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:50.846
Now this is a very
interesting study and I want you

00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:53.456
to mostly pay attention
to these pie charts here

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.596
and I'll give you a
definition of what these mean.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.086
This is a study that's done
with kids, with adolescents

00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:04.356
and with adults all of whom
were performing the same kind

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:06.446
of working memory task.

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:10.336
This is a task where if, for example,
I give you a telephone number

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:13.036
and I ask you to remember
the telephone number.

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:16.326
I'm going to ask you what that number
is in just a couple of minutes.

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.336
This is what working memory is.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.496
It's maintaining information
in a conscious buffer.

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:25.566
And it turns out that the prefrontal
cortex is very important for that.

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:32.546
And if you look at the area that's
shaded in blue in these pie charts,

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:36.116
it indicates the amount of the
prefrontal cortex that's activated

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:41.026
as a child, as an adolescent, and
as an adult does at this task.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:45.676
And you can see in the kids, the
area in blue is really a thin slice

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:50.486
but then the adolescent is
using a much larger expanse

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:53.506
of prefrontal cortex,
much more of the brain

00:06:53.506 --> 00:06:56.226
that is activated is
the prefrontal cortex,

00:06:56.556 --> 00:07:01.966
and in adults you see the
most extreme form of this.

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:06.056
And so there's a huge
developmental change between children

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:08.986
and adolescents and, in
fact, adolescents is a period

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:13.556
when the prefrontal cortex is really
coming online in very important ways

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.986
and plays a critical role in the
integration of thought and emotion

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:20.316
and particularly in the
regulation of emotion.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.496
Now, this is a diagram that's meant

00:07:24.496 --> 00:07:28.486
to illustrate one very important
aspect of the regulation of emotion

00:07:28.486 --> 00:07:33.766
and it illustrates two hypothetical
kids, Person A and Person B,

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:37.186
and imagine that something
bad happens at this point.

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:40.906
There is an episode of
bullying or some other--

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:43.916
someone says something
nasty to a child

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:48.476
and on various physiological
parameters we can measure the time

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.986
course of a child's response.

00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:56.966
And Person B is shown to recover
much more quickly compared

00:07:56.966 --> 00:08:02.186
to Person A. Person A shows a much
more long-lasting, a perseverative,

00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:04.556
response to this negative event.

00:08:04.906 --> 00:08:08.456
And we've been learning about
what are the brain systems

00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:12.166
that may be involved in these
differences among kids and,

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:15.036
of course, our goal in social
and emotional learning is

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:18.746
to foster this kind of pattern,
a more adaptive pattern,

00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:25.066
where following a negative
event a child is able to better

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:29.316
and more effectively regulate his or
her emotions so that they can calm

00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:33.836
down more quickly permitting
a more effective kind

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:36.296
of thinking in that situation.

00:08:36.606 --> 00:08:39.946
Now, this is the kind of experimental
stimulus we might use in a study

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:45.366
which depicts, in this case, a child
with a tumor growing out of its eye

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:51.196
to provoke some negative emotion
and there are dramatic differences

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:54.426
that occur in the amygdala,
which is this part

00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:58.326
of the brain I mentioned earlier,
very important for negative emotion

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:04.906
if an individual learns to actively
reappraise that negative stimulus

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:10.496
in a way that facilitates a more
positive and adaptive response.

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:14.886
And so, the bar graphs
here indicate--

00:09:14.886 --> 00:09:20.676
in the yellow, when an individual is
actively reappraising this stimulus

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:25.466
in a healthy way, we see that
there is a decreased response

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:26.206
in the amygdala.

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:32.866
And so what this simply shows is that
using skills that are very similar

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:35.206
to those taught in social
and emotional learning,

00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:39.336
and in this case the
training was only one hour,

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:43.626
these were older adolescents who
were being studied in this case,

00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:47.736
what we see is that they can
actually change their brain.

00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:51.136
The brain changes in
a very systematic way.

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:54.196
Now, it turns out that people
who are the most effective

00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:58.766
in down regulating their amygala
show activation in this part

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:03.236
of the prefrontal cortex, which is
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:07.266
and there is a tight reciprocal
relation between this part

00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:09.246
of the prefrontal cortex
and the amygdala.

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:14.006
So this is a part of the prefrontal
cortex that modulates activity

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:19.556
in the amygdala and this
shows that relation.

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:22.646
And I won't bore you with
the technical details

00:10:22.646 --> 00:10:24.886
but what this means
is that people who--

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:30.076
these dots represent individual
participants, and that people who are

00:10:30.076 --> 00:10:34.546
up in this corner of the
diagram, those are individuals

00:10:34.546 --> 00:10:37.716
who show very strong activation
of the prefrontal cortex

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:41.766
and they show much diminished
activation in the amygdala,

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.016
which is plotted here, indicating

00:10:44.016 --> 00:10:46.886
that these are very
effective emotion regulators.

00:10:47.256 --> 00:10:50.506
Now one question that we've
asked is whether this matters

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:52.046
in terms of people's health.

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:56.776
And one of the ways we
assess this is by looking

00:10:56.776 --> 00:11:02.346
at a hormone that's very important
in stress called cortisol.

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:05.286
And we asked the question
whether people

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:09.066
who are good emotion
regulators, defined on the basis

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:14.176
of their brain pattern, actually show
a more adaptive profile of cortisol

00:11:14.176 --> 00:11:17.656
where they show lower levels of
cortisol particularly in the evening.

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:21.826
And it turns out that not
only are these strategies

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:24.086
of the emotion regulation
good for your brain

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.656
but they're good for your body!

00:11:26.226 --> 00:11:31.686
They actually lower the level of
the stress hormone cortisol which,

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:36.216
it turns out, if it's present in high
levels is actually very deleterious

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:39.846
to the brain and interferes
with both your emotions as well

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:40.906
as with learning and memory.

00:11:41.216 --> 00:11:42.946
Now, I want to just show you--

00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:46.976
this is from a very new study
that we've done in adolescents.

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:51.036
This is from a group of
about seventy adolescents,

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:55.236
average age about fourteen, and what
we did is we showed the very same

00:11:55.326 --> 00:11:56.516
thing in these kids.

00:11:56.826 --> 00:12:01.106
That is, those kids who are showing
strong activation in this area

00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:05.946
of the prefrontal cortex when they
are regulating their emotions have

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:08.966
lower levels of cortisol
in the evening.

00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:13.516
And what this means is that,
particularly when it persists

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:18.506
over time, good emotion regulation
skills is good for your brain

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:23.106
and good for your body and lowers
your levels of this stress hormone.

00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:28.576
When this stress hormone is
present in high levels cumulatively

00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:34.116
over time it actually interferes
with circuits in the brain,

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:37.356
specifically the amygdala
and the hippocampus both

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.126
of which are very important
for learning and memory.

00:12:41.786 --> 00:12:45.786
Now this is other work
where we have shown

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:52.536
that if you make a individual
anxious, this is done in adolescents,

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:58.546
you actually interfere with your
ability to perform certain kinds

00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:02.116
of working memory tasks, the sort
of tasks that I described earlier.

00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:04.976
And this is a study
that involved very,

00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.196
very careful experimental controls.

00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:10.746
We were able to show that
it's specifically the anxiety

00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:15.946
that is interfering with this
particular kind of working memory

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:20.436
and the more anxious a person
is the worse their working

00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:21.926
memory performance.

00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:26.606
We've replicated it in another
study here and we've shown

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:31.176
that it's specifically through
changes in the prefrontal cortex

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:36.516
that the interference
in memory occurs.

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:41.476
And so, the implication here is
that if you can lower your anxiety,

00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:46.866
if you are learning skills to calm
you, you will improve the function

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:48.016
of the prefrontal cortex.

00:13:48.016 --> 00:13:54.596
It will be less jangled by threats
that occur in your environment

00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:58.386
and you'll actually not
only show improved emotion

00:13:58.626 --> 00:14:02.526
but you will also show improved
cognition, you will do better

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:05.966
on tests like this of working memory

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:11.246
which other research
indicates underlies a lot

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:13.586
of academic performance.

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:17.286
Now, I want to just
show you, before I end,

00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:21.776
that there are new imaging techniques
that we can now use non-invasively

00:14:21.776 --> 00:14:26.706
and this is the just really, really
cool stuff that we're doing now.

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:30.116
This actually shows the
individual connections

00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:33.326
between the prefrontal cortex
and the amygdala anatomically!

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:39.226
We can now visualize this and
quantitate it in individual kids,

00:14:39.306 --> 00:14:45.386
which we are now doing, to
determine the impact of interventions

00:14:45.386 --> 00:14:48.146
like social and emotional learning
not just on the functioning

00:14:48.146 --> 00:14:53.816
of the brain but literally on the
connections between these regions

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:59.516
that are absolutely essential
to effective emotion regulation.

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:02.486
So let me summarize and conclude.

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:06.086
I've tried to show you
that the brain is plastic.

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:08.866
It's built to change in
response to experience.

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:12.406
The prefrontal cortex
is absolutely key.

00:15:12.736 --> 00:15:15.876
We call it a convergence
zone for affect

00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:17.536
and cognition or thought and feeling.

00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:22.126
And we also know that negative
emotions will interfere

00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:28.176
with cognitive prefrontal function
that is with cognitive operations

00:15:28.486 --> 00:15:31.296
that are occurring in
the prefrontal cortex.

00:15:31.356 --> 00:15:35.276
Social-emotional learning is an
empirically verified strategy

00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:40.436
to improve skills of emotion
regulation and social adaptation and,

00:15:40.436 --> 00:15:46.846
as such, social-emotional learning
likely produces beneficial changes

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:47.436
in the brain.

00:15:48.756 --> 00:15:53.796
Education that shapes the child's
brain and likely produces these kinds

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:57.606
of alterations lay the
foundation for all future learning

00:15:57.996 --> 00:16:00.946
for emotion regulation and
for social functioning.

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:05.926
Qualities such as patience,
calmness, cooperation

00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:09.496
and kindness should
really now best be regarded

00:16:09.496 --> 00:16:12.076
as skills that can be trained.

00:16:12.646 --> 00:16:18.236
They are not traits that
we are irrevocably given

00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:24.526
by our early environment or by our
genetics but everything we now know

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:28.346
about the brain, including down
to the level of gene expression,

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:32.226
indicates that training like social

00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:34.776
and emotional learning
can shape the brain

00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:38.436
and literally change gene
expression in the brain.

00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:43.306
And research is critically
needed now to document the impact

00:16:43.676 --> 00:16:45.106
of social-emotional learning.

00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:50.006
&gt;&gt;Question: Is there any age at
which point it may not change?

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:51.616
&gt;&gt;Question: How old is the child?

00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.686
&gt;&gt;Richard: Here's the good news.

00:16:53.906 --> 00:16:55.556
Definitively no.

00:16:55.866 --> 00:16:59.296
No age. It occurs through--
plasticity occurs throughout life

00:16:59.846 --> 00:17:02.516
and we know-- there's
hard data to show this.

00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:05.766
So we know that, for
example, neurogenesis,

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:08.996
which is the actual growth of
new neurons which, by the way,

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:14.046
is an idea that when I was a graduate
student was regarded as fiction.

00:17:14.046 --> 00:17:16.476
We thought that the brain was
different from other organs

00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:18.116
in not regenerating cells.

00:17:18.556 --> 00:17:21.146
We now know that that's
just definitively not true.

00:17:21.146 --> 00:17:23.066
Neurogenesis occurs throughout life.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:28.346
It is the case, though, that there
are sensitive periods of plasticity.

00:17:28.736 --> 00:17:31.486
We don't exactly know what
those sensitive periods are

00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:33.006
for social and emotional learning.

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:36.586
They are probably not the same
kind of steep curves that you see

00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:40.366
for something like learning a
second language where we know

00:17:40.366 --> 00:17:45.756
that the period of plasticity
it dramatically drops off

00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:49.716
after you pass early adolescence.

00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:55.076
So there are likely to be sensitive
periods but I would say that,

00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:59.746
based on what we now know, I
don't think there's any period

00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:05.276
after which we need to say that the
door is closed although it may take

00:18:05.276 --> 00:18:09.816
more intensive intervention
after a certain age.

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:11.316
&gt;&gt;Question: Larry Aber from NYU.

00:18:11.646 --> 00:18:19.086
The affective chronometry, comment
about how everybody's aroused

00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:20.666
when the tiger's about to eat us

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:24.856
and then there's patterns
of change after that.

00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:29.886
I think it's pretty important
to help non-scientists think

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.576
about context dependence.

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:36.356
We don't want to not flee from the
tiger, so any thoughts about that?

00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:39.316
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, that's
a very helpful point

00:18:39.316 --> 00:18:48.396
and I appreciate you making
it and I actually tried to--

00:18:48.396 --> 00:18:57.066
[inaudible] I tried to
illustrate the graphs in such a way

00:18:57.066 --> 00:19:02.116
that they both reached the
same amplitude of responding

00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:05.226
yet they differed in the
rapidity with which they recovered

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:06.626
but you're absolutely right.

00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:13.346
When certain kinds of stress occurs,
when something dangerous occurs,

00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:17.586
it's adaptive for certain
physiological systems to kick in.

00:19:17.926 --> 00:19:21.296
What's not adaptive is for
those systems to persist.

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:25.806
It's also the case that in our
modern culture the honest truth is

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:31.276
that we are rarely confronted
with the evolutionary dangers

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:33.646
that have been part of our
philo-genetic past.

00:19:34.316 --> 00:19:37.086
And yet these same
systems are recruited

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:41.876
when our self-esteem
may be questioned

00:19:41.906 --> 00:19:44.446
or when a child is being bullied.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.966
They are not physical
threats to our survival

00:19:47.966 --> 00:19:50.776
but they hijack the same
biological machinery.

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:55.716
And that is, I think,
where the importance

00:19:55.986 --> 00:20:00.716
of social-emotional learning is in
helping to modulate those circuits

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:05.286
and I think those are things
that we can see in the brain

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:08.506
and in the body using the
right kinds of methods.
