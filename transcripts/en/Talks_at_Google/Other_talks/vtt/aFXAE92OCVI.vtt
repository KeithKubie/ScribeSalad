00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.679
&gt;&gt; I'm thrilled to introduce Sharon Meers,
a former managing director at Goldman Sachs

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.410
who, together with coauthor Joanna Strober,
has figured out how husbands, wives, and kids

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.779
all thrive when couples share equally as breadwinners
and caregivers.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.630
After interviewing hundreds of parents and
employers and doing a great deal of research,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.160
Sharon and Joanna have put together their
book, "Getting to 50/50.”

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.750
The book has been an inspiration to me as
a working mom, and I'm grateful to have Sharon

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.280
speak here at Google today.
Sharon speaks frequently to professional organizations

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.760
about work/life balance issues, a topic that
we value here at Google.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.659
I'll let Sharon tell you the rest.
And now, introducing Sharon Meers.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.020
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.269
Sharon Meers: Thanks so much, Stacy.
And thanks to all of you for joining us this

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.670
afternoon.
First of all, I have to say, I am particularly

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.320
honored to be back here at Google.
Google was, in fact, the site of our very

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.520
first booktalk back in March.
And, in fact, many Google employees have been

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.360
particularly insightful and thoughtful advisors
to us in the three-plus years it took to research

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.290
and pull this book together.
So again, I am very interested in what we're

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.840
going to do today, which is really the project
of the book.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.079
Which is to share some information and talk
together about how we might collectively change

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.790
the dynamics and the framing of the discussion
on "work and family.”

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.380
One of the things that we've found -- we've
now been wandering around the country for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.649
a little over three months, and we've spoken
to probably 2,000 people on corporate campuses

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.090
and university campuses.
And one of the fun things for us is, about

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.591
half the people who are showing up are guys.
Which sort of reinforces something that we

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:13.000
have had a sense of which is, that men and
women share this concern that we need to evolve

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.950
the way we think about work and family so
that men can have the joys of full parenthood

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.390
and women can have the joys of full careers.
So, part of the reason we got interested in

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.720
writing this book was, we were sensing that
the very nature of the conversation was having

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.870
some unintended and negative consequences.
Back in 2004, Joanna and I were speaking at

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.840
Stanford Business School at a course called
"Work and Family", taught by a labor economist

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.260
there.
And we were both struck by the nature of the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.400
conversation and the nature of the questions
we were getting from students in their late

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.850
20's -- students who had signed up aiming
to be leaders of industry, paying hundreds

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.010
of thousands of dollars collectively for the
right for those seats so that they could pursue

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.950
those careers.
And as they sat in that room thinking how

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.030
the work part was going to come together with
the family part, there was an incredible amount

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.370
of anxiety.
And you can't blame them.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.600
One, because it's awfully tough.
It's much more tough than it needs to be,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.840
because the world hasn't evolved in the way
many people expected it would.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.660
But the thing that concerned us was, there
was a sense of resignation, as if things might

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.950
be impossible.
That it would be necessary to give up on either

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.370
a significant portion of career goals or a
significant portion of family goals.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.120
And while we see tradeoffs every day in our
own life, we sense that the level of anxiety

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.030
was more a function of the misinformation
out in the world rather than the function

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.300
of what we were going to try to do, which
is, improve the flow of communication about

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.380
the real facts, the real research, and put
more of a spotlight on the dual-career couples

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.870
who actually are figuring this out.
So that we can all think about how this can

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.540
help us and apply in our own lives.
To take it back another step, I was asked

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.490
to speak at a women's leadership conference
at a very competitive university where a couple

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.600
hundred women competed for 40 slots to come
in the week before school started, to hear

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.500
from various different leadership coaches.
And I was on a panel and kept getting questions

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.780
 -- myself, along with the other men and women
on the panel -- we were being asked,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.630
"Well, what if I'm away from my job for two
years? Or seven years? Or five years?”

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.150
And I finally looked at the crowd, and I said,
"Wow, can I ask?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.030
How many of you think you are going to want
to leave your job for more than a year when

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.290
you have children?”
And I ask all of you, What percentage of hands

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:16.790
went up?
Any guesses? I hear whispers. Anyone venture?

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.850
20 percent? 90 percent? 70 percent?
Seventy percent of the kids.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.140
And I said, "Wow. I really, really hope that
can work out for you.”

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:37.120
But so far, in my professional experience,
I don't know of a large number of significant

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.780
jobs where you can have a leadership role
and pull out for multiple years at a time.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.110
So those things -- either the world has to
change a lot, or this idea of 'the need to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.400
pull out' needs to change.
So, at any rate, what we'd like to do in engaging

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.450
you in this conversation and share what we
learned in our research and then open it up

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:09.180
to a conversation among all of us here.
So, as Stacy mentioned, we did two kinds of

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.240
research.
First, we surveyed the social science -- everything

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.990
from the research on child development and
child care, research on marriages, research

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.490
on the psychological well-being of men and
women, organizational behavior research.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.510
A lot of that is written up in the 50-50 Fact
Sheet you have on your chair, and you can

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.810
look up the citations, and happy again to
talk about that in more detail in a few minutes.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.190
But let me come to something that struck us
as most incredible as we read through all

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.980
the social science.
It seemed that a great opportunity we have

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.520
in reframing this issue is to see a fact,
which is that, Men and women really have more

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.150
in common than we have differences as it relates
to work and family.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.389
And, if you look at the surveys, men and women
equally poll as wanting change.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:13.800
Eighty percent of dads -- for the last couple
decades -- working dads say they want more

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.360
time with their kids.
That is at least as high as the percentage

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.350
of working moms who say they want time with
kids.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.230
And people think that's because working moms
in general feel they have more license to

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.460
walk out and be with their kids, whereas working
dads -- due to cultural norms -- don't feel

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.680
that way.
Secondly, according to the National Institute

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.930
of Mental Health and a number of other big
research institutes, the idea that our dads

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:49.120
or uncles or husbands or brothers need their
careers more than our sisters and mothers

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.669
and female friends is just wrong.
There is not scientific basis for that.

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:58.270
It may feel that way.
That may be the stuff of social lore, but

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:04.210
if you actually look at the factors that predict
long-term mental health and actually long-term

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.340
physical health in men, they relate to strong
relationships with family and that the men

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.949
who suffer most -- in terms of physical stress
and also mental stress -- are the men who

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:21.930
have allowed the family relationships in their
lives to break down.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.360
So it's an interest for all of us to allow
men to invest in family just as we allow women

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.340
to.
So, the other part of our research was going

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:38.250
out and talking to working couples.
We surveyed 1100 working moms, and then we

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:46.240
went and found slightly over 200 men and women
in dual-career homes and asked them how they

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.640
did it.
We looked at people in all kinds of jobs in

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:56.540
all different parts of the country.
And three general messages came away for us.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:03.500
The first is, Mindset makes all the difference.
The way you frame and think about work and

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:10.490
family determines whether it's easy for you
or easier for you or really hard -- and we'll

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:17.310
talk about that in a second.
Secondly, there is a 'game plan', a way of

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:24.290
talking and acting that allows some couples
to negotiate much more fairness in their marriages

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.750
without a fight.
This is not, you know, "Who's Afraid of Virginia

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.710
Woolf," that movie where the husband and wife
shout at each other the whole time.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:39.480
This is about finding collegial fun, sometimes
funny ways to talk with each other about stuff

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.250
that is typically very emotionally laden -- to
take the emotion out of it so we can get to

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.390
happier solutions.
And the third point is that -- when you take

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:57.920
this back to work -- happy working couples
all seem to have some sense that they could

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.050
control the norms in their office.
And not all these people were super-senior

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.500
executives.
Many of them were mid-level in their career.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.110
But they had some sense that they could innovate
and change their job in some way to give themselves

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.570
enough latitude so they could do what they
needed to do for their kids.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.390
We're going to go into each one of those takeaways
in a little more depth.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.250
But let me start first with this question
of "mindset" -- how you think about work and

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:34.560
family drives everything.
And again, all the details behind this section

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.990
are embedded in that fact sheet you got.
The first thing we notice in talking to all

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:47.300
these dual-career couples was, they seem uniformly
comfortable with the idea that two working

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.940
parents are actually good -- not a necessary
evil, but good.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:59.470
And that they are good for kids and mothers.
And they're also good for dads and marriage.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.610
So we were very curious as we dug into the
social science.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:07.810
You know, are they just optimists, or is there
a scientific basis for this?

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.190
And it turns out, there is a ton of research
that supports this point of view.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:18.190
To begin with, kids do equally well whether
their moms work or not.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:24.050
How many of us knew that?
Certainly not what I read in the newspaper.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:30.940
But we have the opportunity to talk to the
leading social scientist at the largest universities

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:37.170
in this country who all fed into something
called the NICHD Study of Child Care and Child

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:43.589
Development, the largest-ever study of child
care and child development done in human history.

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:51.740
It wrapped up in 2006.
It sadly had basically a tiny P.R. budget.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.830
So what we read about it in the New York Times
was not very informative at all.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:03.490
But if you go and talk to the lead researcher
at Harvard who worked on that or at University

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.839
of California or at University of Texas or
any of the big places that were involved,

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:13.311
they will tell you the bottom line was, there
is no respected research that says, "Female

00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:17.250
employment harms children".
In fact, it may be the opposite.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:27.440
When they look at the issue of 'Depression
vs. Well-being', there is a mountain of research

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.480
that says when any of us pull away from employment
 -- when we reduce the number of sources of

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.970
self-worth that we have -- we increase our
risk of depression.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.550
Probably fairly intuitive that that would
be the case.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.820
But they have documented what happens to women
 -- not only in white-collar professions,

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.210
but also in blue-collar jobs -- when they
pull back from the work force, and there's

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.820
something like a 30-percent spike in risk
of depression.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:01.050
And that's been in the psychology literature
for a long time.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.330
Unfortunately, what we've gotten caught up
in are little findings and little studies

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.920
about day care.
And that is a legitimate thing to be concerned

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.830
about, but not if you are a parent and not
if you're planning to pay attention, which

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:20.310
I would assume everybody in this room does
and plans to do.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:28.290
So I can talk about that later.
But basically, the thing we came away most

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:33.100
excitingly was this idea that working mothers
 -- or working fathers for that matter -- had

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.670
anything to feel guilty about.
It just really had no rational basis.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.589
The third point here, though, I think is most
exciting in terms of the idea of men and women

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:49.410
working together as equals, because there
are a number of studies that say, How involved

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:56.380
a dad is, is a function of a mother's attitude
more than a father's attitude.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:05.930
So there are studies that say, "If you give
men and women opinion/attitude questions,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.040
and you ask, What's maternal instinct?
Do you believe in maternal instinct?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.990
Do you believe men are naturally fit to comfort
infants?

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:21.680
Do you believe that women are more nurturing?
Those sorts of questions.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:30.330
Women who hold a strong belief that they,
as women, are naturally more able as parents

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.650
and nurturers tend to have husbands who help
less.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:41.769
On the other hand, women who are willing to
believe that husbands are naturally as capable

00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:47.830
 -- that the raw talent is there, expressed
or not -- those women have husbands who help

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.750
more.
And interestingly, they control for questions

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.510
like, you know, How conservative is the husband?
And at the end of the day, the driving factor

00:14:54.510 --> 00:15:03.460
was what the women believed.
So, how does this all play out for dads and

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:09.209
marriage?
So, the very wonderful thing in bringing men

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:15.390
into the picture of work and family is, the
research says, Men make a huge difference

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.720
in outcomes for children.
We spent all this time worrying about 'maternal

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.589
involvement', but the swing factor really
appears to be 'paternal involvement'.

00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:29.930
There's a lot of stuff in the book about Time
Diary studies, where they've looked at the

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.910
difference in time with kids of working moms
vs. nonworking moms.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:40.370
And it's not a huge difference.
But among fathers, the difference is massive.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:47.610
And it's mostly sort of cultural -- microcultural.
So the good news is, When dads are actively

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:56.810
involved, they get dramatically better results
for kids, even in two-parent families.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:05.019
Active fathers are seen as the driving determinant
of things like better grades, more self-confidence,

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:10.450
better behavior -- more so even than moms.
And part of the reason for this again, gets

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:15.310
to this massive difference in the way men
behave.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.279
There's a big Department of Education study
that looked at 20,000 kids.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:27.670
And they found that -- among married couples
 -- 73 percent of fathers went to their child's

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:41.019
school either 'twice a year' to never.
And whereas, you know, among working mothers

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:47.589
it was basically the opposite.
The interesting point was when dads got divorced,

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:54.579
dads acted exactly like divorced mothers who
are almost as involved as married mothers.

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:57.300
So it's not that men's jobs keep them from
going to school.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.140
It's the sense we have that if there is a
mother around, she's taking care of it and

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.789
that that's all good.
And what the research says is, It's better

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:15.100
if we can make room for dads.
So the other way this is all useful is, The

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.569
effect on marriage are also quite helpful.
When we launched this book in the middle of

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:25.949
the pit of the market crash, this second point
 -- that Two career bets are better than one

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:31.700
 -- was much less controversial than we thought
it was going to be.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.989
You know, the silver lining of what we've
all been through in the last year is that

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:43.139
it reminds us that, In a world where men and
women really are raised and educated to be

00:17:43.139 --> 00:17:48.429
more equal than not, we all have the ability
to be pretty strong engines.

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:54.390
And if you have a choice of flying in a plane
with one engine or two, what are you going

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.760
to pick? Particularly in a storm.
It's awfully nice to have another functioning

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:07.539
engine so that, if you get into a spot -- one
spouse doesn't like their boss, they can change,

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:12.850
they can start a company, all those good things.
But then, the fun stuff is really this last

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:20.239
point which is, more sharing equates to both
lower divorce and more sex.

00:18:20.239 --> 00:18:29.989
On the divorce side, in 2006, the University
of Chicago Sociology Review published what

00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:35.090
was a groundbreaking finding.
And that is that, couples in the United States

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.470
who've gotten married since the mid-80's,
of that population, those with the lowest

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:47.009
divorce risk are the couples that most evenly
share earnings and housework.

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:52.239
That was a surprise to a lot of sociologists,
because historically, the belief was that

00:18:52.239 --> 00:18:58.600
if a woman earned more money that unhappiness
was evenly distributed among couples.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.549
If a woman earned more money, she could more
easily walk out.

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:07.049
So that, a woman earning more money was thought
to be correlated with higher divorce.

00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:12.539
Amazingly, no one bothered to look at the
behavior of men.

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:16.679
And when you actually look at the pools of
government data that also look at how housework

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:23.840
is divided and put that together with the
earnings data, you find that, When husbands

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.070
do more around the house whether or not their
wives work, they dramatically cut divorce

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.809
risk.
But when you put those two things together,

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:37.820
equal sharing in the housework and in taking
responsibility for paying bills, that seems

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:44.929
to be the most protective of marriage.
But the one factoid that everyone likes the

00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:50.169
most -- when I go to largely male crowds,
this gets me the largest guffaws -- and that

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:55.619
is, there are tons of pieces of research from
the child care and child development researchers

00:19:55.619 --> 00:20:01.889
to the marriage researchers who have found
that couples who report having the most sex

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:06.789
coincidentally are the couples that report
that the husband does the largest share of

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.909
housework.
So these good things go together, no matter

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:18.090
who's working.
So if 50/50 is good for kids, good for marriage,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:28.159
good for men and women, How do we get more
of it in our lives given that most parts of

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:38.100
society don't set us up to do this successfully?
If we pattern ourselves after the way most

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.629
couples work on television -- after our own
parents -- in all likelihood, it is going

00:20:43.629 --> 00:20:51.629
to be a little bit challenging to share as
equally as we might want to share ideally.

00:20:51.629 --> 00:20:55.490
And there's actually interesting research
 -- there's some folks out at Berkeley who,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.720
for the last 30 years have been studying couples.
And they've come to the conclusion that, no

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.279
matter how liberal a couple is going into
the process of having children, there is almost

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:12.999
always some backsliding into traditional roles
 -- for a whole bunch of reasons we can talk

00:21:12.999 --> 00:21:17.820
about -- and it would be fine if everyone
was thrilled about the backsliding into traditional

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:25.499
roles, but unfortunately, it also correlates
with a higher degree of discord in the couple

00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:31.029
where people feel misunderstood and shoved
into roles that they didn't intend -- to the

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:37.200
man feeling like he's not getting a lot of
help/support when he feels more pressured

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.519
to earn money to pay for a baby, and the wife
feeling like she's not getting enough support

00:21:42.519 --> 00:21:47.090
dealing with the grand chaos that is early
childhood.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:52.479
So here are three things that happy, working
couples told us -- this is based on our interviews,

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:57.789
but also from talking with the big marriage
experts and negotiation experts -- there's

00:21:57.789 --> 00:22:02.119
a whole section in our book from the authors
of "Getting to Yes" which you might recall

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:07.009
is a big negotiation classic.
This is all very similar.

00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:10.479
And the first thing people told us they did
was, Make a masterplan.

00:22:10.479 --> 00:22:16.350
That the big problem people get into is, we
don't treat our home lives with as much respect

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:21.190
as we treat our office lives.
You know, you're having a conflict with the

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.460
person in the next office over, and you're
working on a project, you're going to at some

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.929
point say, "Hey, I need to sit down with you.
Let's figure out why this isn't working.

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:32.499
Let's take out a piece of paper, a whiteboard,
whatever.

00:22:32.499 --> 00:22:36.370
Let's write down what we need to do and how
it's going to happen in a way that we can

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.220
work well together.”
It's not that emotional a conversation; you

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.470
just do it, because it's for the good of the
project.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.960
And what we heard happy, working couples do
 -- more often than not -- was, say, "You

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.489
know what?
I was really pissed at you all week.”

00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:55.490
Not going to say that.
I'm going to say, "You know, this week didn't

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.229
work so well.
Can we go grab a Starbucks and take out a

00:23:00.229 --> 00:23:04.999
pad of paper, and let's try to figure out,
What were the three things that went the most

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:08.519
wrong?
And How is that not going to go wrong next

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:13.759
week?”
And they would treat it as a problem-solving

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:18.090
activity.
The second thing was 'letting go'.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:23.220
You know, when you're sitting there at Starbucks
with your lists -- being willing to throw

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:29.109
aside things that your mother and great aunt
or father might not.

00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:35.820
So, you know, my husband -- golf game sometimes
have to go.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.169
With my case -- elaborate kid's birthday parties
sometimes have to go.

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:43.099
And you know, I might emotionally fight, "It's
important.

00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:47.881
Our children care.”
And my husband will say, "Really? I think

00:23:47.881 --> 00:23:53.519
our son just likes cake." So.
I think that the concept is, We have to be

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:59.039
willing to laugh about it a little bit.
In our Today Show appearance, Joanna brought

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:06.029
up this hysterical conversation we had with
a man who indignantly told us, "My wife thinks

00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:12.229
you have to make hospital corners on every
bed in our house every day before we walk

00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:14.259
out the door.
It's infuriating.

00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:19.509
I don't like doing beds, period.
There are four beds in the house.

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:24.299
And we just want to get our kids off to school
with enough food to eat every day.

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:28.960
And this is just not a good use of time.
Why does it have to be -- why do I have to

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.809
accept that that's part of my 'to do' list?”
And we thought about it, and we're like, He's

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:37.349
right, you know?
Why? Why does she get to make that call?

00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:43.149
And who would die if the beds weren't made?
Certainly, without hospital corners, no one

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:47.500
would die.
So it's, again, giving men and women equal

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:54.999
votes in the home in the same way we give
men and women equal votes in the office.

00:24:54.999 --> 00:25:00.029
And the third point is, I think, we saw a
lot of happy working couples.

00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:10.019
They were motivated to share, because it allowed
them to escape this sense of guilt that we

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:16.559
have heard talked about for way too many decades
 -- that, if you really know your spouse is

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:22.320
interchangeable with you, it may be hard and
sad to leave your child.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.049
Like last night, I had to leave my daughter
in the middle of the day to get on a plane

00:25:26.049 --> 00:25:29.221
to come here.
And she was not happy about it.

00:25:29.221 --> 00:25:32.799
She's five.
She was not happy about it until my husband

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:38.989
came up and said, "Hey, let's go for a swim.”
And she's like, "Oh, good-bye.”

00:25:38.989 --> 00:25:44.200
And while I did feel bad that she felt bad
that I was leaving, I also knew that she was

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.181
now in the hands of a parent she loved as
much as she loves me and was going to go do

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:53.499
something really fun and when we talked on
the phone, it was going to be okay.

00:25:53.499 --> 00:26:04.229
But I think very frequently, when we see either
mom and dad as having unique and very different

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:10.889
qualities, it makes it harder to mix things
up that way.

00:26:10.889 --> 00:26:20.240
So if we agree that this can be good for families
and it is doable in a constructive way, how

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:26.029
do we bring 50/50 into the workplace?
God knows I have never worked in a particularly

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:31.940
50/50 environment.
I have worked pretty much only in 24/7 environments,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.580
and I know that you all work in something
quite similar.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.139
So one of the questions we had to ask ourselves
 -- particularly bringing this book out in

00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:47.710
the middle of a recession -- is, How can pro-parent
be pro-profit?

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:52.320
Is there a way of aligning those two values?
And we came to the conclusion that Yes, there

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.460
really is.
Because a lot of the research we looked at

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.519
comes straight out of the business schools,
and I'm going to share just a few 'thought

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:02.429
experiments' with you.
And you can think about how they might fit

00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:09.659
into your lives, but they are just examples
of people doing things dramatically differently

00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:15.139
so that workers in high-stress jobs can take
more control of their time.

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:23.460
The first is a case study from Harvard Business
School that shows how much 'more metrics'

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:30.340
can free people up.
In the late 1980s, Lehman Brothers was in

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:36.590
a terrible shape in its research department.
Their research department was ranked number

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.549
15 in the industry.
There's a magazine called Institutional Investor,

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:42.369
which is the only barometer of how you're
doing.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:46.590
And Institutional Investor -- or I.I., as
it was called -- ranked them number 15.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:53.229
And, you know, you might as well close shop.
And so, they brought up a guy named Jack Rivkin

00:27:53.229 --> 00:27:57.369
to turn the research unit around.
And Rivkin was a very unusual guy.

00:27:57.369 --> 00:28:03.540
His view was, you know, "I'm not going to
spend a lot of time chatting with all the

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.409
analysts and getting to know them and whatever
else.

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:10.289
I'm simply going to give them a list of metrics
that I'm going to measure them on.

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:13.859
And it's not just, How good was your earnings
estimate?

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.410
How good was your ebitda estimate? What have
you.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.669
It's also, all the different things that I
think drive being a good analyst.

00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:29.129
How many times did you call the CEO?
The CFO? The suppliers? The clients?

00:28:29.129 --> 00:28:34.450
The salespeople who represent your research?
The portfolio managers who read your research?

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.159
How many special projects did you do for those
portfolio managers?

00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:43.529
All these different things that drive performance
in that job, Jack Rivkin was willing to put

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:48.320
on paper and say, "I'm counting for each one
of you how you do.”

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.409
And by the way, if you wanted to come and
spend hours schmoozing with me in my office,

00:28:53.409 --> 00:28:58.009
that does not count.
At the end of the day, you'll be paid on this

00:28:58.009 --> 00:29:01.590
list and only on that.
The result was unbelievably dramatic.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:08.749
It was dramatic in the sense that they went
from number 15 to number one in three years.

00:29:08.749 --> 00:29:15.080
By 1990, they were ranked number one by Institutional
Investor.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.759
Everyone on the team -- the percentage of
analysts who were doing well jumped dramatically.

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:26.249
But the most extraordinary thing was that
the percentage of women who were ranked as

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:34.179
top analysts by Institutional Investor, went
from almost none to 80 percent.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:39.609
Guys went from 20 percent to 40 percent.
So it was good for everyone, but it was dramatically

00:29:39.609 --> 00:29:43.649
good for women.
And the thought -- in these case studies -- is

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:51.879
that it allowed women to A, control their
time and produce what was important, and that

00:29:51.879 --> 00:30:02.220
their contributions could be objectively evaluated.
The second thing is, some research on fire

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.210
drills and interruptions.
There's a woman named Leslie Perlow, who started

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:11.460
her research at MIT and she's now ended up
as a tenured professor at Harvard Business

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.700
School.
And her whole realm of study has been workers

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.480
and technology and consulting and investment
banking and trying to understand if there's

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.450
a way to rethink how all we white-collar workers
produce excellence.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.889
And one study that she looks at -- she went
to a high-tech firm, and she said, "I want

00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:40.570
the name of three, offshore suppliers that
produce exactly the same thing at exactly

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:47.590
the same quality.”
And she ended up with a firm in China, a firm

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:53.799
in India, and a firm in Hungary.
And she sent a team of researchers to go and

00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:58.960
observe in each of those places.
And while they were all producing the same

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.299
thing at the same level of quality, she found
they all did things differently -- all with

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:11.202
the sense that 'their way' was the 'only way'.
So, the folks in India worked a 14-hour day

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:13.619
on average.
Everybody -- when people had questions -- they'd

00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:18.100
go run around and ask each other questions,
because it was part of the culture to, you

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:25.149
know, bond with your peers and exchange information.
Very individualistic.

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:30.729
In China, it was like study hall.
Everybody sat there quietly.

00:31:30.729 --> 00:31:37.940
There was a boss and there were the engineers.
And they worked that way for eight hours a

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.750
day.
And they were hugely efficient, and they were

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:45.019
producing as much per day as the folks in
India working 14 hours a day.

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:51.239
Go to Hungary.
In Hungary, they had a much more fluid view

00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:56.159
of things that the cycle of every project
went up and down and that their work hours

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.799
would go up and down like this.
And so, on average, they were working something

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:09.700
like ten hours a day.
But it peaked and troughed based on when deadlines

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.299
were.
And there was a lot of sense that you could

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:13.299
actually go home and get more work done from
home.

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:16.460
They had a lot of managers who were very supportive
of that.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.549
So, Perlow's view -- when she was starting
to do a lot of stuff in Harvard Business Review

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:24.440
about this is that, You can go to a big management
consulting firm or an investment bank, places

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.049
where this is unthinkable.
Say, You know what?

00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:33.190
You think that the only way to produce this
kind of excellence is to be here 24/7 looking

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.469
at it.
Well, it's not right, because there are other

00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:41.159
people who do it differently and produce work
of quality that is equivalent to yours and

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:45.259
they do it differently and they allow people
not to blow up their lives.

00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:49.769
So there is going to be, I think, a lot more
of that coming up in the business journals

00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:54.840
in the next couple of years.
The last piece I'll talk about is sort of

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.019
'microgood process'.
There was a woman we interviewed who had been

00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:04.749
at Sullivan and Cromwell as an associate.
And she had been offered a partnership role

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:10.779
in a boutique securities litigation firm.
And when she went to court the first day as

00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:16.019
the junior partner watching her senior partners,
she was shocked, because the judge -- at the

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:22.860
end of the day -- turned to her new senior
partner and said, "Hey, I need you to file

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:30.669
this by tomorrow morning.”
And her new senior partner said, "Your Honor,

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:34.889
we really aren't staffed for that.
Can you give us three days?”

00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:39.580
And the judge said, "Sure.”
And this young woman from Sullivan and Cromwell

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.289
said she almost fell over.
If she had tried to pull a stunt like that

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:49.210
representing Sullivan and Cromwell, you would
have been shot, because that's just not the

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.259
image Sullivan and Cromwell wants to have.
You say, "Yes, sir.”

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:55.979
When somebody -- a judge -- tells you to turn
something in the next morning.

00:33:55.979 --> 00:34:00.139
You are not given the sense that you have
the latitude to say,

00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:04.499
"Why? Why tomorrow morning? Why not in three
days?”

00:34:04.499 --> 00:34:10.270
But the material difference is, at her new
firm, they do not need to run associates ragged

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:15.750
 -- from time to time they do -- but they
are much more thoughtful about when a deadline

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:21.020
is truly 'overnight,' and when work can be
spaced out in a more thoughtful way.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.650
So I just throw that out to you.
So I'll just close with this.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:31.020
This quote, "Every male CEO should have a
working wife." was spoken by a former colleague

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:37.429
of mine, Abby Joseph Cohen, at Goldman Sachs.
And it was spoken, I believe, in about 1996.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:46.950
And at the time, I was a young V.P. at Goldman,
and I was very inspired by, "What a nice thing.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:51.429
Let's imagine the day when every male CEO
has a working wife.”

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:58.160
And I'm afraid we're not that much closer
to it today, 13 years later.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.671
So, while I believe she is correct that one
of the things that needs to happen is that

00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:09.880
more people who get to make decisions about
how we all work need to get what dual-career

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.920
life is about.
But in the meantime we have lives to lead,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.931
careers to succeed in, children to raise happily,
and what are we going to do?

00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:24.940
And we come away thinking about three things.
First is, finding 50/50 friends and colleagues.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:30.490
All of the sociology research says it's so
much easier to live the way you want if you

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.421
have a buddy system.
If you can find -- not everybody has to be

00:35:33.421 --> 00:35:41.060
just like you -- but you can find other people
who support the way you live and help you

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:47.050
stand against norms that are unhelpful to
your living the way you want to live.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.860
Secondly, knowing it's not 50/50 every day.
It's 60/40 or 90/10.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:57.350
That's not really the point, the actual split
of, you know, who does the dishes and the

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.210
laundry and the kid pick-up.
It's really a mindset that says, "Dads need

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:06.900
their kids, and women need their jobs and
over the course of life that should work out.”

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:13.820
And we think the more that people -- all of
us -- change the dialogue about work and family

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:20.540
and talk about these things, and about the
real facts about dual-career families, the

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:27.980
more we will help people see that we can share
the load between men and women and we can

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.160
change the way we work, and that will change
the world.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.401
So with that, I am very eager to hear what
your thoughts are. Thank you.

00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:39.789
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:43.170
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:51.850
Sharon Meers: Anybody? Thank you.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:59.310
Q First, thank you for coming.
And I'm sure my question is probably somewhere

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.720
in the book, but one thing that my husband
and I do is we keep 'scoreboard'.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.300
And we always try to keep each other from
doing this, where every weekend it's, "Well,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.230
how many diapers have you changed?" and, "Who
did the grocery shopping?”

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.750
Are there any tips that you picked up from
working parents, especially the time -- whether

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.970
it's at night or on the weekends -- how to
keep from going into scoreboard?

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.210
Sharon Meers: How old are your kids?

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.710
Q Two. One kid -- two years old.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:28.510
Sharon Meers: Okay. So one thing I jokingly
say is, when our second child turned three,

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.292
I told my husband I thought we had rounded
the tip of Tierra del Fuego -- you know, that

00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:38.350
very nasty part of South America where like,
boats crashed into the side of the cliffs

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:45.470
and things like that?
I think early parenthood is just exhausting.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:52.780
There's just way, way, way too much to do.
And so, the survival of that period is -- I

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.030
think what's very helpful to keep in mind
is it's, in the terms of a lifetime, it's

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.810
short.
So it will end.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.380
And then it gets a lot easier.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.640
Q Good to know.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.840
Sharon Meers: But, that said, people said
a couple of things.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:11.200
So I will tell you, with my husband and I
when our kids were really young, we truly

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.740
had a "Two hours you. Two hours me. Two hours
you. Two hours me.”

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.700
Because we felt it was just the right thing
for our sanity.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:24.520
Like, we could be great with our kids for
a period of time and, you know, maybe at Hour

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:30.180
Four we were still as cheery as at Hour Five,
but typically, if we could switch off, the

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:35.270
kids would get an up, happy, rested person.
And then we could go do our work or we could

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:42.520
go lie down or we could read a book, you know,
in our times off. So that helped.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.400
You know, in the book, we do talk about a
two-lawyer couple that actually had what they

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:53.140
called the "Waking Hours Spreadsheet.”
And it was more -- I think you can have a

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.840
sense of humor about it.
Your scoreboarding is not terrible, because,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:03.730
you know, it is again, a period of a couple
years where you are just being pummeled by

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:10.000
the amount of work there is to do.
The other thing to think about is, we periodically

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.090
go through 'triage' weekends.
"We are dying.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:20.140
What is on our list that has got to go?
Like, what thing are we just going to agree

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.599
we're just not doing?”
So, one thing that's happened in our house

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:29.190
 -- I recently discovered we had something
like five photo albums that had either been

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.920
given to us or we had purchased since having
children.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:40.730
They are all empty.
We have umpteen Kodak Gallery O Photo accounts.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:45.340
And I think we have just come -- we have explicitly
come to the agreement that, when our children

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.440
are tweeners and they can help, we'll do it
together.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.200
Between now and then, just forget about it.
But, I think, you know, everybody -- for all

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.730
of us -- there are little things that sort
of nag at us, "Got to do this. Got to do this.”

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.740
And just ask yourself, What would happen if
you didn't do it?

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.480
What would happen if you didn't do it?
Because I think it's all about reducing the

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:10.850
level of stress, which is a function of having
this enormously long list of things that feel

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.650
like they have to happen.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.640
Q It's really helpful to just hear that it
gets easier.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.620
And I'm seeing, as he gets more independent,
that it's getting easier.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.330
But it comes with a whole other side of things
that have to get done.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.730
But thank you, that was helpful.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.260
Sharon Meers: Thank you.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.220
Q I have a question.
First of all, thanks for being here.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:39.610
And it's a great lecture.
Well, I have a technical question, a "what

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:45.170
if" scenario.
So, what if the wife is more successful at

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:51.869
career, should the husband feel more pressure
to get ahead -- work harder to get promoted

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:55.660
 -- or should he spend more time at home like,
do more housework?

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.820
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:03.120
Sharon Meers: So, you know, obviously every
couple is different, so they'll look at this

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.500
differently.
So, you know, my husband and I had a lot of

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:15.730
conversations about this when we were dating.
And I think, you know, it's my view that we

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:23.840
are lucky enough to live in a time when husbands
and wives really do have access to great jobs.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.100
It's not a perfect world yet, but we have
access to good jobs.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:33.740
So women actually -- in a world where things
are fair, if a husband and wife go into the

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.570
same job, kind of 50-50 chance she's going
to do better, right?

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.220
And you know, there is some statistic that
says a third of women in married couples earn

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.990
more than their husbands, which is dramatically
different than 20 years ago.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:53.240
But I think the way we looked at it is, long-term,
who knows, right?

00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:00.670
She can invest her career in a fabulous company
that, you know, turns out to be Enron or Merrill

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:09.120
Lynch or a company that disappears.
So it's awfully helpful for both members of

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:16.130
a couple to maintain their market-readiness
because you just don't know.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:22.340
It's a marathon; it's not a sprint.
And so, I think what we found in talking to

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.990
couples was, there certainly were times when
one person's career was going better.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:37.200
And, you know, I think there is social pressure
for men if their wives' careers are going

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.520
better.
There are all sorts of weird vibes that can

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.260
sometimes happen.
And if men can rise above that and say, "Hey,

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.440
this is great.
And I can help out more now.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.850
And oh, by the way, I have ambitions too.
There are other things that I want to do with

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:57.470
my life.
And maybe there's not enough space and, you

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:02.420
know, enough time for me to do them now, but
How about in three years or five years or

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.480
seven years, you know?”
One of the couples that I liked the most in

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.120
the book were two doctors.
And they very explicitly talked about 'baton

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.920
passing', where she came out of medical school.
She started into a job working three days

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.650
a week.
And he had a very big job, ultimately led

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:28.230
part of a hospital.
And after seven years, he was totally burned

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.960
out.
He felt he wasn't getting to see his kids.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.790
And she was chomping at the bit, saying that
she wasn't using her training in the way that

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.830
she wanted to.
And she came back full-time.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:47.620
He scaled back to 80 percent time, though
retaining his role as head of this piece of

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:53.410
the hospital.
And she then became head of internal medicine

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.320
at a very large hospital.
So she's now working seventy hours a week

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.891
 -- a little different than three days a week
 -- and he's doing much more around the house.

00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:06.690
But the idea is that, over time, they'll go
back and forth, and allow each other to keep

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:14.400
growing.
Does that get to what you are talking about?

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.670
Q Yeah. Thanks.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.760
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.530
Q Hi. Thank you for coming.
This is definitely helpful.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:28.040
I think part of what my husband and I struggle
with the whole thing is not having family

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.161
around.
And I'm not sure if you're going to talk about

00:44:30.161 --> 00:44:35.740
 -- if the book talks a little about it.
Just having that, aside from like friends,

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.600
nothing is like family where you can kind
of disconnect, take time out with your husband

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.680
and kind of like, "Okay, let's learn what
made us fall in love.”

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.910
My sister was telling me the other day -- she
was like, "Oh, I'm so in love with this guy

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.010
that I'm going to marry.
Go back to you guys, when you used to date.”

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.850
And I'm just like, "What?”
I just laugh about it.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.061
I'm like, "I don't even want to think about
that."

00:44:59.061 --> 00:45:09.220
But how much of family and having that closer
network of support was important on the interviews

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.220
you had?

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:16.630
Sharon Meers: So I think it is really important.
That said, I think family can have two different

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.940
aspects.
But I think the thing that's important is

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.790
support.
And support so that you have enough time with

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:27.520
your spouse and you don't feel you are so
overwhelmed that you can't remember what it

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.690
was like in the first place. [laughter]
It's very easy to forget.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.860
The trick is sort of, you know, trying to
again, offload as much of the friction, the

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.440
stress, and giving yourself as much time as
possible.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.410
And I'll just tell you a funny story.
So my sister has just had her -- her second

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.910
child is now 13 months old -- and I was getting
very worried.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:55.320
She's just one of these very-focused moms,
and she works full-time, and she just didn't

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.690
appear to be sleeping at all, to me.
And so, I was telling Joanna, my coauthor,

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.360
about this.
And I said, "You know I think I need to take

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.320
Kira away to get a weekend.
She just needs to sleep.”

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.940
And Joanna looks at me and she says, "Your
sister does not need a romantic weekend away

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:16.470
with you. [laughter] She needs a romantic
weekend away with her husband.”

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:23.850
So my kids and I designed this, you know,
camp for our cousins, which was a tremendous

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.420
amount of fun.
Now, we don't live close together.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.400
She lives in L.A.; I live in the Bay Area.
But she and her husband were game and they

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.300
came and they dropped the kids and they got
to go wander around in Napa and have a nice

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.150
weekend.
And so, I think you have to be -- it's harder

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:43.380
when your family isn't there.
And so, I mean, my mom very nicely sometimes

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:48.130
comes out look after the kids.
Sometimes we leave the kids in D.C. where

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:53.960
she is.
You know, in the book, we have couples who

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.060
had their parents literally move in with them
from out of the country while the kids were

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:02.180
very young.
And they talk about, "Well, yes, that was

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.550
very nice, because they got to sleep.”
There were also challenges of basically going

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:10.070
back to your family of origin with that much
closeness.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:16.560
The other thing people talk about was, in
effect, coming up with 'pseudofamily'.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.170
Coming up with a bunch of other parents who
have kids exactly the same age whose parenting

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.930
values you agree with.
So that it doesn't work very well when your

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:32.050
kid is one, but when they're four, they can
have sleepover at the Jones'.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:36.190
Then the other parents can actually have a
little bit of rest.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:41.320
But it does come up and it's challenging and
there are alternatives.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.920
Q But it will get better.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.150
Sharon Meers: But it will get better. How
old are yours?

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.150
Q Two.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:52.580
Sharon Meers: Two. Yes. Age three -- 36 months.
It's coming.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.270
Q Thank you.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.500
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:03.050
Q Can you talk a little bit about your views
about -- there seems to be a contrast between

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.711
this two-engine view vs. the two-income trap.

00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:14.260
Sharon Meers: So I have to say I'm quite befuddled
by this two-income trap concept.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:21.650
Because as I understand it, it's this idea
that somehow two very bright people could

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:27.930
get themselves into a situation where they
are spending a lot of money and then one person

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:32.870
decides they don't want to work and then,
they can't stop spending that money?

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:41.950
And I'm just confused. I'm just confused.
I think if we are rational people, you know,

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:48.260
what I think we talk about a lot in the book
is coming to peace with and learning to talk

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.830
about these decisions early and often and
honestly.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:56.720
Because I think if you do, you don't end up
in situations like that.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:03.950
So, you know, a lot of times the research
says that something like 84 percent of women

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:09.730
who leave white-collar jobs don't really mean
to leave them.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:16.500
They don't leave because they want to.
They leave either because they have a misunderstanding

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:22.180
with a direct boss who may have a very flexible
policy but refuses to implement it or implements

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.670
it in a way that feels alienating to the woman,
so she leaves.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:31.330
Or they have a spouse who somehow conveys
the idea -- or she accepts the idea -- that

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.160
his career is more important regardless of
whether or not he makes more money.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.770
Because of this belief that we talked about
in the beginning that somehow careers matter

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.840
more to men than to women.
So if you haven't thought about that to begin

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.910
with and you've built up a very expensive
lifestyle, and then bing! You say, "Oh, my

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:51.150
God! I'm supposed to be home with my children,
because I read X -- Dr. Laura's -- as I'm

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:56.170
supposed to." you're going to have a problem.
But I still don't find it so difficult for

00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:01.960
people to de-leverage, right?
If you're a sensible person, you can sell

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.130
the house.
You can pay down the debt. You can do all

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.350
these things.
But I think it's all much easier if you think

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:18.600
about it in the beginning, because my perspective
is, There's really no reason if you want to

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:25.200
work, there's no reason you can't do it.
Am I answering your question, or not really?

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.370
Q Yeah. I mean, I don't think there's a right
answer.

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:36.100
In one case, you have one person making all
the money with none of these benefits, but

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.960
there's only one point of failure there.
And in the other case, you have two people

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.200
making money, but that's two points of failure.
That's sort of redundancy, but then you have

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.630
to readjust and I don't know.
It doesn't seem like there's a right answer.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:54.240
But I think you're right.
You just basically have to do your planning

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.180
well and are willing to be flexible when things
change then that seems like the best that

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.220
you can do.
Thanks.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.260
Sharon Meers: That's good.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.990
Q Thank you for coming.
That was sort of similar to my question.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.540
So along this same vein, I've seen a lot of
 -- more so friends; we're very fortunate

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:19.270
at Google so less colleagues -- you know,
that both people achieve all this advanced

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:23.770
education and do all these things and then
get to the point where, from a practical standpoint

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:28.830
 -- in particular, I think living in places
like the Bay Area or New York or more expensive

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:35.160
living areas where there's a breakdown, not
so much in maybe the communication between

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.560
the couple, but in that, "Okay, if we're going
to have a nanny.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.460
How are we accommodating all these things
that there seems to be a point at which, Does

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.130
this actually make sense for two people to
be working when, This is how much time we're

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.370
going to have with our children, and This
is how much time we're going to be working

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:53.400
and then, you know, When we break out the
excel, this is how much money we can put in

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.900
savings, and things of that nature.”
So I was wondering if you could just expand

00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:04.150
a little bit more on -- from a practical standpoint
in terms of, you know, whether it's positioning

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:09.871
sort of like you said 'passing the baton'
in terms of maybe working three days a week

00:52:09.871 --> 00:52:15.120
or just different strategies perhaps that
you had learned from interviews about, you

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.591
know, ways to approach sort of in those early
years and still being able to have both partners

00:52:19.591 --> 00:52:20.591
working?

00:52:20.591 --> 00:52:25.450
Sharon Meers: So, yeah, great questions.
In the middle section of the book, we have

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:31.241
a chapter called, "Women want to work.
Women don't leave because they want to.”

00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:39.930
And there's a whole array of examples of women
in demanding jobs who change the nature of

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.850
them.
A woman who runs part of engineering at a

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:48.500
big tech firm who works at home a number of
days a week for the last 12 years.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.621
You know, people who do all sorts of creative
and different things.

00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:56.590
But the first thing I want to get to is this
business about the economics calculation in

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:01.540
child care.
Because a lot of people we interviewed have

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.320
been like, you know, have been surprised when
we say this.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:10.200
But if you actually do do the math, and you
are willing to look at anything beyond the

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.300
first five years, it makes no sense for anyone
to quit period, right?

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:20.860
Because, like even if you start at a fairly
low level, the power of compounding over a

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:28.530
30-year career is pretty big.
And so, it overwhelms child care cost.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.141
And then, beyond that, people say, "Well,
how do you survive the short-term child care

00:53:32.141 --> 00:53:35.460
costs?”
And that's really, I think, about being open-minded.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.860
And it's everything from -- you know, there's
a couple in our book who also worked at a

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.180
high-tech company and they were both doing
very well.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.920
They asked to job share.
So they, husband and wife shared one job.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:58.450
So they each worked three days a week.
And the day that they were both at work, his

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:04.390
dad, who had moved to be with them, looked
after the child.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:10.700
So they had no child care, period, right?
So that was an expensive 'zero'.

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:16.160
There's a two-teacher couple who arranged
their schedule with the principal so they

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.320
could hand off a child in the hallways. Not
joking.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.780
So there are people who do really inventive
things.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:28.970
I'm sure we all have friends who are in less
well-compensated professions where they, in

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:35.520
effect, group -- they have a group babysitter.
Somebody finds a really talented person.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:41.370
They don't want the whole expense.
They bring in one or two other children so

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.510
that, you know, you have -- or reduce by two-thirds
 -- the hourly cost.

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:51.360
So there really are ways of getting that cost
under control if you are willing to see it

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:57.040
as a worthy enterprise to be innovative about.
I think people get very emotional -- we are

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.630
too fast to just switch it off and say,
"It's too hard. It's too hard. Give it up.”

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:07.100
Mostly because we believe the Dr. Laura arguments
that somehow it would be better if mom were

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.450
at home.
And we don't look at what the research really

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:12.960
says.
And so, if we do know what the research really

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.560
says, then it's much easier to say, "Oh, I
should spend a little bit more time over here

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.241
being inventive about, you know, How are we
going to come up with a situation we feel

00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:24.270
comfortable with that's cost-effective for
us and How are we going to look ahead and

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:29.910
say, "Oh yeah, in ten years we're going to
be miles ahead of where we would be if one

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:34.220
of us completely stepped out.”
But to your question -- our argument is that

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.300
we just want both men and women to feel they
can keep a toe in while they have little kids,

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.170
because to knock all these smart people out
of the work force is crazy.

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:47.210
It's crazy given all the educational dollars
that go into all of us.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.050
It doesn't make any sense.
So how do you keep these people, you know,

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:56.000
continuing to build their skills, if at a
slower rate?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.440
And we talk about a lot of companies -- even
law firms -- that have kind of pushed themselves

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:08.040
to get outside their normal frame.
Like, there's a guy who runs managing partner

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.820
of a very large law firm.
And he said he went into a partner meeting

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.160
to talk about -- they had like five different
failed, part-time programs.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.200
And everyone's like, "Ugh, part-time, ugh.”
Whining women. They quit. "Ugh.”

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:25.340
So they said, "Okay, it's not 'part-time.'
It's called 'modified hours'.”

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:32.180
And some partner says, "I need every associate
working 150 percent on every matter I have.”

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.920
And the managing partner said, "That is just
baloney.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.720
You have no associate working 150 percent
on anything.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.190
Because every associate here is at least on
four matters.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:47.490
So, at best, you got 25 percent.
So, what do you care if the other 75 percent

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:50.510
or 25 percent is spent at home?
You should not care.

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:54.610
All you care about is that the time you have
the associate, they're really, really good.

00:56:54.610 --> 00:57:00.080
And so, a lot of it gets to sort of, you know,
not just workers changing the way we think,

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:07.590
but managers sort of getting out of this sort
of anti-communist mindset that we have that

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.540
makes it really hard to innovate and come
up with creative solutions.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.010
Q Thank you so much.

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.480
Sharon Meers: You're very welcome.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:25.280
Q It seemed to me that, at one point, you
were kind of -- you were implying that there's

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:33.440
a lot of value in having equivalent income
of the husband and wife.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:40.481
My wife's a preschool teacher and she always
wants to work with the children.

00:57:40.481 --> 00:57:42.510
And this is what she really enjoys.
There's no way that she'll ever make even

00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:50.680
a third of what I make.
So, how important is it that husband/wife

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:59.720
make the same kind of money?
How do I come to a 50/50 agreement with my

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.010
wife in this kind of circumstance?

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:07.520
Sharon Meers: So let me explain.
So the study that I was talking about, you

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:14.000
know, is -- that's just sort of one of the
data points in the study.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.610
And the thing that was more important was
the husband contributing more equally to the

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:23.730
housework.
That was actually -- that was a bigger deal

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:29.201
than equivalence of income.
And what the marriage research really says,

00:58:29.201 --> 00:58:34.880
it's about having mutual respect, which is
easier when you can both have a sense of what

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.380
the other person's up against.
So if you have some sense of what it's like

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:44.010
for her to go and teach every day and not
get paid that much for it, it's easier for

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:47.390
you to support her in that.
It's easier for her to support you in long

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:51.580
hours at Google when she has a keen sense
of what that's like. You know that.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:59:00.030
So I think what the marriage research says
really -- more than anything else -- is that,

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:06.060
If we can throw aside this idea that men's
careers come first and that, no matter what

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:12.490
a person earns, it is important for them to
be involved in something outside their family.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:16.200
That that's what the psych research says.
And oh, by the way, it's important for both

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.130
parents to be engaged with their children.
Then, you can sort of mix it up.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:25.290
But we interviewed a lot of people where the
husband was in business or a big lawyer or

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:32.240
whatever it was, and had a wife who was a
teacher or a professor or worked in nonprofit,

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.890
and had them talk about why their wife's career
was valuable to them.

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:42.600
You know, what it brought to the marriage
that she was doing stuff that they thought

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.640
was valuable.
And just sort of one of the funny stories

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.550
that I love.
We were at a panel and one of the people on

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:56.710
the panel was talking about how her stepdaughter
was a public school teacher and that she quote/unquote

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:02.710
had to quit, because her income did not cover
child care.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:07.470
And the woman sitting next to her was a technology
executive with three children, and she just

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.800
started laughing.
And she said, "My husband teaches at a private

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.220
school.
I guarantee he makes less than your stepdaughter

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:20.260
working at a public school.
Can you imagine if I went home and said, "Sweetheart,

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:26.160
you don't make enough for our child care.
Have you thought about quitting?”

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.580
That just isn't going to happen, right?
We're much more logical when we think about

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.290
men and the value of their careers than we
are when we think about women and the value

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:38.130
of their careers.
And so, one of the things -- and we kept -- a

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:42.601
feeling was, Why can't we be more logical
when we look at women and the value of their

01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:55.180
careers?
[pause] Anybody else? Thanks very much.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:00.140
