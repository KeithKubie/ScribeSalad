00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:03.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.580
Good afternoon.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.520
Thank you, again, for coming
to one of our most recent NASA

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.270
at Google Talks.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.050
We do these monthly, so it's
good to see some familiar faces

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.904
coming back again and again.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:15.570
Today, we have something
really special.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.560
Dr. George Nelson is here from
the International Space Station

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.570
project.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.035
This is a live stream
of the Space Station.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:25.390
That's what we're
looking at right now.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.220
Originally from Maine, Dr.
Nelson's affiliation with NASA

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.690
began in 1998 as a graduate
student research fellow.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.390
He began a full-time
NASA career in 2001

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.050
in the training of flight
controllers and as-- sorry,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.360
and astronauts on the electrical
and thermal systems of the ISS.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.270
After serving as the
Configuration Manager

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.780
for the Space Station
through much of the assembly,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380
he began his current tenure as
manager of the Space Station

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.410
Technology Demonstration
Office, through which

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.440
all of the engineering
and technology research

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.990
is conducted on
the Space Station.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.640
He's based in Houston currently.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.348
And without further
ado, Dr. George Nelson.

00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:02.264
GEORGE NELSON: Thanks.

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.066
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.050
Hi.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.290
Thanks for coming, guys.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.480
As she said, this is
a live view from ISS.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.190
It's from a payload, which
is our term for an experiment

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.270
or an investigation
on ISS called HDEV

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.730
for high-definition
Earth viewing.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.390
And we're looking aft.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.350
You can see a couple of
Russian transport vehicles.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.820
The Canadarm is
there, as well as

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420
just a tiny bit of
the US segment there.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.071
We're flying over the Pacific,
and I had a tracker up here.

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.570
We're flying over
the Pacific, and I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.779
think we're headed south by
now, and we're about to-- yeah,

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:40.570
we're headed south.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.150
We're pretty close to
the Hawaiian Islands,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.400
and we won't really
see any land probably

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.990
until we cross maybe southern
Patagonia in a while.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.740
But because of the way
we got this set up,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.420
I'm going to take this down
and throw up some slides there

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.170
for you.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.580
And this is available any time
you guys want to look at it.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.730
We stream it 24 hours a day.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.250
When you're at night, you
don't really see very much.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.080
We have the cameras not
tuned to pick up city lights

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.560
or-- you can't see
any stars or anything.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290
But we had this
specifically to test out

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.510
some sensors for different
commercial off-the-shelf

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.009
cameras.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.560
So there's four
different cameras.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.030
There's two looking aft,
one looking forward,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780
and one looking down and
a little bit to starboard.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.822
So they rotate through,
and we take a look,

00:02:26.822 --> 00:02:28.780
and they've held up a
lot better than we really

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.810
thought they would.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.310
There's a couple of CMOS and a
couple of CCD sensors on there.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.930
The radiation environment
is not very nice there,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.200
so we didn't expect
it to last too long,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.460
but they've been doing OK.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.420
We don't really even see any
pixel degradation as of yet.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.740
So if you go to ustream.tv
and search for HDEV,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.270
that's where you can find
this feed any time you want.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.820
All right.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.420
OK.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.730
So when Terry Fong
and Chris Provencher

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.621
asked me, what's the
title of your talk,

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:05.620
I thought, oh, I've got
to come up with a title.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.150
I guess I should find
one that really grabs

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.960
people, something
of some interest.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.020
And I thought that maybe
How to Travel Through Time

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.260
with the ISS, but then I
realized that, you know,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.120
maybe I need to ground it
a little better in reality.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.660
Although, for the relativistic
time guys out there,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.870
I got something for
you a little bit later.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.110
And then, there's a lot of
things you can do on ISS,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.040
but trying to identify bubbles
in commodities or other stock

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.612
markets-- no one has yet
proposed that that's something

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:38.570
that you really can do.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.540
So I ended up going with "How
Best to Use Your Neighborhood

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.610
Space Station."

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.720
And I came to that by
saying that there's

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.850
a lot of ideas on
how to best use it.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.090
And we're talking philosophy.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.360
We're talking
specific experiments,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.570
how to fund everything
that we're doing.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.810
And the fact that
it really is yours.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.990
So the whole thing was
built with taxpayer dollars.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.531
Whether you're from
the United States

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.657
or you're from a European ESA
country, or Canada, or Japan,

00:04:07.657 --> 00:04:09.740
or Russia, it was all built
with taxpayer dollars.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.180
So it really is
yours, and the way

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.680
that the United
States has it set up

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.290
is that you even have
direct access to it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.580
through a mechanism that I'll
explain a little bit later

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.079
for you.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.000
But it's open to United States
corporate and private entities

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.184
to help the tax base
of the United States.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.600
If you got a great
idea and you're

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.810
going to end up making
money on the ground

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.580
after proving
something out on ISS

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.600
and you're going to hire
Americans who pay taxes

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.210
and make the world better,
we're there for you,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.220
and we hope you get to use it.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.010
And then, being a
neighborhood space station,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.510
when you look at
the cosmos overall,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.051
it is definitely in
our neighborhood.

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.900
And really, it's only a
couple hundred miles up,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.370
so it's pretty close by.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.160
We provide you access for it.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.936
And if you guys provide the
things to do on it, well, then,

00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:59.560
that's one of the best ways you
can use your neighborhood space

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.110
station.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.610
So the vehicle itself
that you just saw,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.054
that's about the same
location, a little bit

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:08.470
further south as
we are right now.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.350
This was yesterday morning.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.340
It passed over-- you can see,
if you've ever compared it

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.810
to a shuttle flight before
we started building ISS,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.570
this goes to much
higher latitudes

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.186
than the shuttle normally did.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.030
And that's because we
wanted to have access

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.320
from our Russian partners
who launch out of Kazakhstan.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.810
And then, they try and
launch over the top of China,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.291
rather than-- or rather,
north of China, rather than

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.540
directly over the top of them.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.800
So that's the
inclination that we have,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.780
and so that sets up
the angle that you

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.290
see the orbital track
takes to the equator.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.120
OK, so I want to
talk a little bit

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.670
about what it took to build
the Space Station so that you

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.310
guys understand the challenges
that NASA and the program

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.590
itself have been trying to
tackle in properly using it.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.994
So I think the Russian
number is actually from July,

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.910
so I think you could say
that that's either 98

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.100
or 99 now total
Russian launches.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.130
Most of those have been
unmanned progress, which

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.290
is the resupply vehicle from
the Russian Space Agency,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.940
or the Soyuz spacecraft that
can take up and down three

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.400
astronauts, or cosmonauts.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.060
And that's also the primary
lifeboat-- the only lifeboat

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.310
that we have for the ISS in
an emergency to get back home.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.927
37 space shuttle launches--
so you look at it,

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.260
you think about how many we had.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.980
That's about a fourth of all
the space shuttle launches

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.120
that we did was for ISS.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.620
It was the real workhorse.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.270
It was the original intent
of the space shuttle program

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.300
to build a space station-- had
a big payload bay to bring up

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.430
all the parts.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.280
We flew the Japanese module
that the Japanese built.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.730
We flew the European module
that the Europeans built.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.030
We built-- we flew two modules
that the Europeans built

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.910
for us in exchange for
flying their module--

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.040
and a huge American
segment as well.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.160
We've flown some
commercial vehicles as

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.080
of late there as well.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.550
You know Elon's
effort through SpaceX.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.320
And Orbital space
sciences-- Orbital Sciences

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.510
is also flying commercial
vehicles to ISS, unmanned

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.230
and in a resupply fashion
for all the utilization, all

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.490
the experiments that we
try and conduct there.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.910
The Japanese have
flown four HTVs,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.330
and the Europeans
have flown five ATVs.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.850
Those are also both unmanned.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.730
The difference between
the two-- Europe launches

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.160
from down near the equator,
off of South America.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.380
Japan launches from an
island called Tanegashima.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.560
The ATV uses a Russian
system to dock autonomously

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.420
in the same way that
their progress docks

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.920
to the station, and the HTV
rendezvous with the vehicle,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.600
and then we grab it with
that Canadarm that you saw

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.340
and berth it to the
forward end of the vehicle.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.370
So I talk about all
this to say this

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.610
was-- the very first
Russian launch was back

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.720
in November of '98.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.770
Is that right, Chris?

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.720
November of '98 was
when the Russians first

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.510
launched the FGB.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.120
Now, this was a section that
the United States largely

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.705
compensated Russia to build.

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:30.080
And then, with
the space shuttle,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.640
we went up and attached
our Node 1 to it.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.940
And then we waited
for quite a while

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.530
until the Russians were able
to build their service module.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.480
And then it was a
habitable platform.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.060
And since then, we've had
continuous human presence

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.559
on ISS.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.260
So that's been since
2000-- I think also

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
at the very end of 2000, we've
had continuous human presence

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.270
up there.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.850
And the amount of
effort and time

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.080
that it took just to build
the space station-- you

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.590
can imagine that
that was the focus.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.630
Get it built.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.720
And then especially when we put
a sunset clause on the space

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.169
shuttle program itself,
there was even more urgency.

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:03.960
Let's get it built.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.350
Let's get this done first.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.960
So that was the primary focus.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.200
But now that it's built, using
it is the most important thing.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.792
So any time that you spend that
much money and that much time,

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:16.000
you're going to have a
considerable amount of inertia

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.180
that you have to overcome.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.890
And then you complicate
it with the fact

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.190
that it's a government project,
and you have even more.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.410
So it's been challenging to do
the change that was required.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.210
But what we did, as soon as
the space shuttle program ended

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.780
and we had fully
utilized its capability

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.490
to get us ready
to be without it,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.120
we reorganized a large part
of the space station program

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.860
in order to more properly
reflect the priorities

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.640
that we now have, which is doing
the science and engineering

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.920
research on board.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.250
So prior to that day,
the payloads office

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:00.120
had largely its own--
they were self-contained.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.300
They had their own
engineering support.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.060
They were like their
own little program

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.807
because they were
just off on the side.

00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:07.890
And Chris was with me,
doing a lot of the training

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.712
that we would do.

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:10.170
And in any simulation
that we would

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.211
run, as soon as a major
malfunction would happen,

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.090
one of the first things that
happens, turn off the payloads.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.976
And so that kind of
ingrains into the flight

00:10:16.976 --> 00:10:18.600
controllers and
everybody who's getting

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.050
trained at that
point that, look,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.280
that is not the important thing.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.530
The important thing
is making sure

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.060
that the facility
is still running.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.200
Everything is OK.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.410
The crew is safe.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.900
We still care
about those things,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.460
but the primary focus now has to
be on getting the science done.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.290
So one of the things
we did is we got rid

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.910
of the separate program
aspect of all the science

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.910
that we're doing,
disseminated those individuals

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.350
throughout the program.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.240
There were some
optics-type thing--

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.140
and I don't mean
optics the discipline.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.600
I mean optics the--
just how things look.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.130
By moving the program
scientists on the org chart

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:57.880
up next to the program manager--
the mail code for payloads

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.570
is OZ, so historically,
we've been

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.880
at the bottom right-hand
corner of every org chart.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.938
That's moved up as well.

00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:09.590
And we're still
working to make it

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.830
better because we've had
more than one accident where

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.730
we have loss of life.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:23.390
So we have several decades
of work building up

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.500
processes that ensure safety.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.830
But when you're trying to
do scientific research,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:36.810
you don't need to necessarily
focus on mission success.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.460
What you need to focus on--
the particular aspect of what

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.780
you're trying to discover.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.930
So all the rigor and
extra money and cost

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.520
that goes with building
a typical spaceflight

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.760
project-- we don't want to
incur those costs in order

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.880
to do research and to use the
space station like the lab

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.602
next door.

00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:55.060
And so I tell
everybody, you've got

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.380
to treat it like it's a
facility down the road,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.760
and I'm paying for your
transportation costs.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.650
I take care of the flight up.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.630
We take care of the
crew being there.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.610
We take care of the
power and the thermal

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.880
and the data, all the
stuff that you need.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.900
All you've got to do is build
it so that it works for you,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.520
not for us.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.290
So we're still working
to fix our processes

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.650
so that you and even other
people within our own agency

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.636
have better access to
using the facility.

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:23.010
And one of the
things that we did

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.840
was we set up three offices.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.510
So there was the
National Lab Office,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.470
and so that's what
I alluded to before.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.930
So anybody outside of NASA,
whether it's another government

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.350
agency, or a private
company or a public company,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.530
or an individual who has a
good use for the Space Station

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.410
platform can go through
the National Lab Office.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.720
And we hired a
not-for-profit entity

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.020
called CASIS, the Center
for Advancement of Science

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.290
In Space.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.830
And one of the
reasons we want to do

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.540
it is we trust ourselves to
choose the right investments

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.440
that NASA cares about for
space flight and space

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.500
exploration and aero
sciences and the like,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.585
but we didn't want 20 years from
now someone saying, you know,

00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:10.610
we could have cured this
disease if you guys had only

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.300
let us fly on the ISS.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.000
So we have this
not-for-profit entity

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.270
that hires the right experts
in all the different fields

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.960
where we're getting proposals
to properly vet, and evaluate,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.230
and prioritize the
different things that

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.200
are being proposed
to fly on ISS.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.030
So that's one way you can get up
there, through the National Lab

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.650
Office.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.811
The second office that was
created was where I work,

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.310
the Technology
Demonstration Office.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.595
So all the engineering
and technology research

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:40.310
that gets done on ISS flies
through this office, as well as

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.070
all the Department
of Defense work.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.800
So that's kind of like the
caveat, the exception that

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.950
proves the rule for the
National Lab Office.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.140
That's supposed to be all the
external to NASA government

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.190
agencies, but there's a peaceful
purposes clause for ISS,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.410
and so all the work the
DOD does is peaceful work.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.940
And so that's directly in
line with all of NASA's needs.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.850
So for accounting and
stuff, we keep the DOD stuff

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.680
as part of a national
lab utilization,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.457
but in practice, it
all flows through us.

00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:14.165
And the third office
that we came up with

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:15.498
was the Science Research Office.

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:20.327
So there's this whole section
of the agency called the Science

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.160
Mission Directorate.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.770
And so these are the guys
that fund the rovers on Mars

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.060
and the Hubble and the
Webb Space Telescope,

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.050
and do a lot of great stuff.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.610
But they have their own
bureaucracy, their own vetting

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.840
of what they want to do.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.440
And all of their work,
and all of the work

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.650
that they fund outside
the agency as well,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.510
flows through that
particular office.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.490
So one of the
first things we did

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.816
was set up those
three front doors.

00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:50.750
Let's see.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.830
Part of the change that
I said was challenging

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.630
was reminding everybody
who the customer is.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.730
So when you work in
a government agency,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.590
while you work for the
citizens of the country,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.730
you often consider yourself
to be the customer.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.830
You're working for the
people, but the contractor

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.090
who's supplying you
with something--

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.010
they need to understand
you're the customer.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.140
But now we're
completely different.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.749
When we're running
the Space Station,

00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:16.040
we're not the customer anymore.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.390
The customers are the
principal investigators

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.854
across the country-- and
world, in our case-- that

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:22.020
are trying to do work there.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.980
So reminding everybody of
that and reminding people

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.860
that this is not the last space
program or the one before that

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.160
even, where you have a mentality
that worked very well for us

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.640
of "failure is not an option."

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.990
But in this case, that's
a very difficult way

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.220
to run a research program.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.160
If you look at some of the more
aggressive research programs

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.950
like the DARPA runs, failure
is almost a necessity.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.210
If they are too successful
in the portfolio

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.970
that they're investing in, the
people get a talking to, like,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.450
"I don't think you're
taking enough risks."

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.160
So the risks that
we want everybody

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.867
to accept with using ISS
are not safety risks.

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:03.200
We're not asking to put the
crew or the vehicle at risk.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.130
But making bold steps and
taking risks technically

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.680
to see if we can come up
with the best solutions

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.020
is exactly something that
we want to encourage.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.710
So while we've become this
customer service organization

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:27.650
and we continue to help
everybody figure that out,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.504
we've tried to help change the
attitudes just with everybody

00:16:30.504 --> 00:16:31.670
that we work with every day.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.220
So a standard conversation,
as you're walking across

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.320
in between buildings at
Johnson Space Center, would be,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.030
did you hear about effort X?

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.840
They needed three
times to get that done.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.560
Can you believe?

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.330
Why couldn't they get
that tested on the ground?

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.450
Why couldn't they
figure that out?

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.310
And that's exactly
the type of attitude

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.810
that we're trying to
change a little bit,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:57.360
where it's OK to have
iterative tasks on orbit.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.930
We have a crew
there for a reason.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.940
You can build
something and fly it.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.440
And if it didn't
work the way it was

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.240
supposed to, well, how many
times have you been in a lab

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.040
and it worked the
first time, every time?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.310
And that's really
expensive, if that's

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.099
the way you want to operate.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.839
So we're trying to get people
to accept that this is a lab,

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.510
and it doesn't necessarily work
the first time, every time.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.099
And when you discover
how it goes wrong,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.939
that's the benefit
of using the lab.

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:25.730
So what kind of things
can you do up there?

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.819
I'm talking about
all of these things

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:27.960
that you should and could do.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.501
What kind of things
can you do there?

00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:32.300
Well, let's look at a few things
that we're already doing up

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.500
there and kind of split it down
the middle between non-NASA

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.060
and NASA.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.041
So there's biology and
biotechnology investigations

00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:41.790
that are up there.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.700
They're on both sides.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.920
Most of the human research
has been funded by NASA.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.550
There is not a lot
of commercial need

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.110
identified yet with
people spending money--

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.850
their own money-- on trying to
figure out the human effects.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.660
And it's of great
importance for NASA

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.040
if we're going to take
long-duration missions to Mars,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.620
for example.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.280
The physical sciences
are funded both by NASA

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.160
and by other
government agencies.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.380
Technology demonstrations--
that's one of the things

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.450
that I spend a lot of time
harping on other entities

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.144
about, is the fact that this
is a lab that can be used.

00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:19.310
It's really difficult within
the aerospace community

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.740
to change the paradigm that most
executives in most aerospace

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.450
companies are used to.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.350
That paradigm is we'd love to
do something for you, NASA,

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.490
and we'd love you
to pay us to do it.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.040
So I'm trying to
get to the point

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.110
where they're investing
their own money

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.720
and keeping their
intellectual property

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.730
and utilizing this national
asset at the same time.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.110
So it's a tough
thing to convince

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.040
people of because the
performance period

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.400
cycle of that particular
vice-president

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.110
is probably shorter than
the return on investment

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.589
for whatever they're going
to fly to ISS and test out.

00:18:57.589 --> 00:18:59.380
And then, when we
finally decide that we're

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.379
going to go back to the
moon or to Mars one day,

00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:03.970
we buy that one because
it did so well on ISS.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.950
So that VP is long gone by the
time his company gets that ROI,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.740
and so getting to
the right level

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.590
of the different companies
and the different corporations

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.310
and getting them to
accept this possibility

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.610
has been a challenge.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.760
We're getting there,
and I think you'll

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.110
see some things coming up soon.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.370
What else?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.410
Astrophysics-- that's kind
of NASA's mandate, right?

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.830
So we fund the astrophysics
work that gets done up there.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.490
Earth science-- there's a
lot of different things,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.260
both funded by NASA and not.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.890
We'll talk a couple
examples about that later.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.930
And then on the
education side, you guys

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.430
work for one of the entities
that does an awful lot of work

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.190
in that area, and NASA
tries to use the assets

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.950
that we have to do the
same sort of thing.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:02.000
So some of the-- you may have
seen some videos or pictures

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.160
of astronauts working
inside the station.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.670
As an exposure facility, we
have a lot of options on ISS.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.000
And outside the vehicle,
we have four logistics

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.460
carriers-- one,
two, three, four.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.600
They're on the main
truss that goes across.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.070
That was all part of the
United States' contribution.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.290
And on those, we
have some spare parts

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.904
that we flew up there that
were so big that we knew

00:20:28.904 --> 00:20:31.070
we needed to fly them up
on the space shuttle first,

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.570
so we have those
pre-positioned when

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.970
we have to remove and
replace the originals.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.320
But we have a lot of
payload spots on there.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.590
So some of the different
things that you can do up there

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:46.777
is look up, or look down,
or take material testing

00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:47.610
in that environment.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.300
There's a lot of
atomic oxygen there.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.910
There's, as I said before,
the radiation environment.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.905
If you want to do other
things in this area,

00:20:53.905 --> 00:20:56.030
you need to make sure that
your materials are going

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:01.290
to respond over periods
of time, and respond well.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.800
Both the Japanese
and the Europeans

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.460
have exposed facilities that
they have the opportunity

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.247
to put stuff on.

00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:10.580
The United States has access
to both of those facilities

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.380
as well.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.800
And then, we have
some specific areas

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.350
that we've placed different
investigations like the AMS is

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.410
not on an ELC, but it's
out there on the truss,

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.451
and we'll talk about that
a little bit later too.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:33.600
And the Russians have their own
investigative program as well.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.990
By far, it seems the United
States and its partners

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:43.341
have invested more so far
in the research side of ISS.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.230
So why would we take
all this time and money

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.560
to do this sort of thing?

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.420
Well, it's the
concept that nations

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.240
explore in order to advance.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.870
And the exploration can come
from physically going somewhere

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.410
to explore or just
for their observation

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.320
of either natural phenomenon
or things that you can observe.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.520
And that exploration drives
technology breakthroughs

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.790
and scientific discoveries.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:15.450
And without that exploration,
that cycle of improvement

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.330
can be broken.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.990
But the ISS partnership,
in the fact that it really

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.510
spans the globe, has
transformed space exploration

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.660
from an effort for
the advancement

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.150
of individual nations,
like Russia, United States

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:34.550
in the '60s, and China right
now, to an endeavor to-- it's

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.970
"committed to the
advancement of humankind."

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.980
And I read that directly because
it's a pretty heady statement,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.780
right?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.750
Get a hold of yourself.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.800
But the reason it's justified
is the fact that we have,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.670
just as of last year,
almost 70 countries

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.400
who've managed to
participate in ISS, using it.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.720
Not just the
partnership countries--

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.850
so you can see the
four main partners

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.300
at the top of that ring, the
United States, Canada, Japan,

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.630
and Russia, and then
the rest of the ESA

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.740
represented countries in
the rest of the flags,

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.260
and then all the
other participants

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.140
that I mentioned on the side.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.190
So we've gotten a
lot of use of the ISS

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.740
so far across the
world, and it can

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.780
have a significantly
stabilizing effect

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.605
beyond just individual or
principal investigators

00:23:25.605 --> 00:23:27.230
from different
countries collaborating.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.650
So carrying on with
the humans explore

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.470
concept-- so they explore
in order to advance.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.500
So you can debate
all you want about

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.700
Columbus's initial intentions
or final intentions,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.820
but it's hard to debate
about the influence

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.840
that his initial
trip had on Spain

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.630
and the subsequent
trips that continued.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.650
He didn't go once and stop.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.160
They went and continued to
go, and Spain significantly

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.810
left the Iberian
Peninsula and at one point

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.540
claimed nearly half the world.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.810
In contrast, in the-- I
think it was the 1400s,

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.410
the Ming Dynasty had
sent out a large Naval

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.870
fleet that was larger than
anything the Portuguese were

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.060
sailing through
the Indian Ocean.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.539
And then, when that monarch
died and his son took over,

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:27.830
he pulled back, and they
stopped the naval exploration.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.080
And there's one train of thought
that says that that helped lead

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.380
to the Ming Dynasty's
end, was their lack

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.902
of continued
exploration, and they

00:24:37.902 --> 00:24:39.610
weren't there when
the Portuguese came in

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.710
with much smaller boats.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.850
And like I said, you can
observe from where you are,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.230
or you can go there to
observe natural phenomenon.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.040
If you look far enough, you
can see some interesting things

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.980
and gain something from it.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.440
So you have Isaac Newton
proving everything

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.460
that he was looking
at by observing

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.480
the curvature of a comet,
and that led to calculus

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.760
and proving that.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.570
And a lot of the missions
that actually went somewhere

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.360
to explore-- the
standard way to do that

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.690
was to bring a
naturalist with you,

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.010
a scientist or a naturalist.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:24.520
So we have Captain Cook, and
it shows the resolution there.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.630
I think his first trip
was on the Endeavor,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.790
and that was to Tahiti to
observe the transit of Venus.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.840
And so the big thing
there was trying

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:40.250
to discover, or to prove,
the size of the solar system.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.650
And the problem is that
science takes a lot of time.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:49.890
So they got back from that
trip, and the Royal Society

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.680
that had funded them, based on
the recommendation of Halley

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.910
several decades
before, were completely

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.800
unimpressed with the data
that they brought back.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.700
This is no good at all.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.280
But it turns out
that, later on, when

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.400
they were able to
double-check a lot of the work

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.620
in the next transit, they were
able to say that they were

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.060
within less than-- I know it
was less than half a percent

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.400
accuracy for the size
of the solar system.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.090
So science takes longer
than the exploration itself.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.910
In subsequent trips, he was
looking for a Northwest Passage

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.520
and found Hawaii.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.470
I think that's a good
return on investment there.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.510
On Darwin's trip, this was a
trip-- the trip of the Beagle,

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:41.350
the second one, the
one that Darwin was on,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.440
he was observing a
lot of geology stuff.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.890
And that was a trip
that was specific to map

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.820
the west coast of South America.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.390
So it was a strict
exploration mission

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.030
to bring back cartography,
map out the west coast.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.640
But Darwin noticed
sea shells at altitude

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.916
when he was ashore
and then noticed

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:08.290
a lot of the other
natural stuff.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.410
And it wasn't till 20 years
later that "Origin of Species"

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.750
was actually published.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.480
So my point about all
of this is that science

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.930
takes a longer period of time
than the specific exploration

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.912
that you're conducting.

00:27:19.912 --> 00:27:21.620
So some of the things
that we're doing up

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:28.380
there-- biology, whether
it's an animal cell

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.460
or whether it's
a bacteria, we're

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.800
recognizing that, particularly
in things like gene expression,

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.480
that the microgravity
environment ends up

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.580
stressing the organism.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.170
And that stressing
of the organism

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.630
ends up expressing
itself in genes.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.805
The same way it does
in a large organism--

00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:49.430
if you stress it a certain way,
certain things come out-- we're

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.500
recognizing the same thing
in observations on ISS.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.637
And when you-- yeah, go ahead.

00:27:55.637 --> 00:27:57.470
AUDIENCE: Do you have--
what's the radiation

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.761
environment inside the station?

00:27:58.761 --> 00:28:01.410
Does that also affect
the expression?

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.780
GEORGE NELSON: It can, yeah.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.910
And I think the one
that sticks in my mind

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.570
was that Shannon Lucid did
some work on Mir before we

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:12.050
had ISS that showed higher
rates of mutation on things.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.820
But they try and back
that out and make sure

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.400
that what they're
looking at is this.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.836
And the important thing
is not necessarily

00:28:18.836 --> 00:28:20.460
that, oh, it's
microgravity that turned

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.240
this particular expression on.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.070
It's recognizing that when
that gene is turned on,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.030
this happens so
that you can then

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.460
go ahead and prevent that
or encourage that in order

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.230
to do what you need
to do on the ground.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.630
But the ISS is considered
a radiation environment,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.170
and the crew are considered
radiation workers.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.670
So we do a lot of work on
monitoring the radiation

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.530
environment.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.564
And I'll mention
that again a little

00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:48.980
bit later, when we talk about
some of the technology stuff

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.780
that we're trying to do.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.540
That enough?

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.040
OK.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.710
OK, so other biology stuff--
just larger scale systems,

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.210
right?

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.980
So plants-- it'd
be nice if we could

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.250
be able to grow plants
on a transit mission.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.500
So these are some of the
things that we're looking at.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.670
But there's also
fundamental research

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.750
involved with some of the
work that we're doing.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.660
We have plants up there.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.270
Human physiology--
there's plenty

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.850
that goes on with the human
body when we're up there,

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.440
and some of them we've managed
to even start to overcome.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.810
So we've had a lot of-- a
long time-- you've probably

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:30.480
heard about crew coming back
after a long-duration mission

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.100
basically with
osteoporosis, right?

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.490
So as soon as you
get up there, you

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.820
stop stressing particularly
your large bones

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.910
in your legs and your
back and your hips

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.350
because you're no longer loading
it every step of every day.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.240
And your body's very
efficient, and it just

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.880
starts flushing everything
out, to the point

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.011
it was beyond what we even
thought of when we built

00:29:52.011 --> 00:29:53.760
the environmental
control and life support

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.860
system for urine processing.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.330
It fouled nearly immediately
when it got up there

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.650
because it wasn't
built to handle

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.270
the large amounts of calcium
that the crew was dumping out

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.370
every day.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.290
But through some-- through
the right ratios of protein

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:20.060
and potassium, and serious
amounts of time exercising,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.690
we think we've overcome most
of those issues for the crew.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.040
And we'll see
whether that ends up

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.530
helping my grandmother or
somebody else's grandmother

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.530
later on.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.320
And that's one of the ways that
it actually does transition

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.820
into an Earth benefit when we
research these type of things.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:45.080
Plenty of physical sciences
work that's up there.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.950
So I didn't make this
particular slide,

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.630
and this one often turns--
to me, it was a little hokey,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.750
but you guys all understand
there's no convection in space

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.350
because there's
no gravity, right?

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.790
But the thing that I
didn't even realize

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.350
until a couple years
ago was that we

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.670
don't have any data
on, for instance,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.390
large-scale combustion.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.880
And we've done a lot of
work on flames in space,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.470
but it's all been very
small, very contained.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.030
And so we're going to
do some large-scale fire

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.670
tests using ISS.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.560
And at first, when I first
heard of it, I thought,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.820
we're going to do some
big "Wrath of Khan"

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.754
glowing orb that is going
to burn up out of the sky.

00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:26.670
This is going to be the
coolest looking thing.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.740
It's not going to be
that cool looking.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.400
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.190
going to take the
orbital Cygnus vehicle.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.290
That is a vehicle that normally
burns up when it returns.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.960
So we have two
commercial cargo vehicles

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.626
that I mentioned from
the United States.

00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:40.240
SpaceX has a heat shield
and is recoverable,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.560
and we bring back science to
do analysis on the ground.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.150
The orbital vehicle right
now is designed to burn up.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.850
So we put garbage
and other things

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.950
that we want to get rid
of into that vehicle,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.200
and it hits the atmosphere at
the right angle so it burns up.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.950
But we're going to
take a large part

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.320
of the inside of that vehicle.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.030
I thought we were going to set
the whole thing on fire when

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.302
the proposal came to me.

00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:03.010
But they're going to
do it multiple times

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.760
on multiple return missions
of the orbital Cygnus,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.174
and we're going to
get data from it.

00:32:08.174 --> 00:32:10.590
And it's just going to be a
large box on the inside that's

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.135
burning within the box.

00:32:12.135 --> 00:32:13.760
So it'll still be a
controlled reentry.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.259
Everything will be
fine, and it will

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:16.690
be far less like the movies.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:22.227
But it's still going to be
very interesting data for that.

00:32:22.227 --> 00:32:23.810
Astrophysics and
fundamental physics--

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.370
so way out of my league
with this type of stuff,

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.630
but-- so we got a
guy named Sam Ting,

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.000
who's got a Nobel
Prize at home, who

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.110
came up with this
particular effort.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.040
He realized that
this was the only way

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.440
he was going to get this
particular research done.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.460
He's looking at dark matter.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.910
We got a special
spot right for him.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.510
He ended up
redesigning everything

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.110
to have a permanent magnet
instead of electromagnet.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.830
This has been the work
of thousands of people

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.090
just for this one
particular experiment.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.580
And we'll see if he
doubles up on his prizes

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.070
by the time he gets
all this data together

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.540
and get all his
publications out.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.170
And this is the type of
stuff that he's looking at.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.420
I'm not sure-- this doesn't have
the info on the number of hits.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.420
So the number of data
samples that they announced

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.910
that they've had through AMS
is almost getting silly now.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.210
I think it's-- I can't
remember to which power it is,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.917
but it's at least 10 to the 20th
number of hits and particles

00:33:27.917 --> 00:33:28.750
that they're taking.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.940
And so there's vast
number crunching

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.424
that goes on with trying to
decide what they can infer

00:33:33.424 --> 00:33:35.090
from all this data
that they're getting.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.340
And so most of that is to come.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.690
OK, well, so now more
into the area that I am.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.130
I'm an engineer, so
most of the stuff

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.590
that I have a little bit
better understanding for

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.210
is in the area of
technology and engineering.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.350
So we do some stuff
up there with that.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.452
We got the Robonaut
Project Manager right here,

00:33:56.452 --> 00:33:58.160
Ron Diffler, and that's
one of the things

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.070
that we've done up there.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.250
And there's a lot that
we have to figure out

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.750
if we're going to
go somewhere else.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.800
So we got the ISS there now, and
it's state of the art, right?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.560
There's really no better space
vehicle that's flying anywhere,

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.100
regardless of the fact that
we've got older laptops

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.610
and we've got
computers that we call

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:25.388
MDMs that are running--
what are they running?

00:34:25.388 --> 00:34:26.199
AUDIENCE: 286s.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.823
GEORGE NELSON: Yeah,
286s or something.

00:34:27.823 --> 00:34:29.840
I mean, so they're
very reliable.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.360
They're rad-hardened,
and they do very well.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.949
But it's the state
of the system,

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:37.070
and it's built specifically--
the whole vehicle is built

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.179
to be where it is,
in low earth orbit,

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.050
where we can launch a
Soyuz or maybe later

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.969
on a commercial crew
vehicle or something else

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.130
and get there very quickly.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.690
Or in a real
emergency, the crew can

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.290
come home, no problem,
very quickly in the Soyuz.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.421
But if we're going to go for a
long time a long distance away,

00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:57.170
there are other things
that we want to do,

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.390
and we want to use the
Space Station to prove out

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.290
all of the technology
that we need for that.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.998
We don't want to find
out halfway to Mars

00:35:02.998 --> 00:35:05.570
the urine processor
doesn't work.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.760
That's not so great.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.830
So we tried to come
up with, all right, so

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.510
what things do we
want to do up there?

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.350
And obviously, any
engineer in this room

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:18.090
could probably come up with
most of the general areas

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.110
that we needed to do.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.990
Figure out your environment.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.520
Get your reliability
where it needs to be.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.600
Look at the logistics
that you do or don't

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.810
need for the mission
that you're potentially

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:32.170
going to do and reduce that risk
implementing it somewhere else.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.820
So we came up with
a bunch of areas,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.950
and we use the National Academy
of Sciences, the National

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.120
Research Council-- the
agency does-- to tell us

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.040
what to do a lot.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.750
On the science side, they have
something called the Decadal

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.620
Survey, and that's
like their bible.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.300
If it's not in the
Decadal Survey,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.470
you're not going to
see the science mission

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.845
director as spending
money on it.

00:35:53.845 --> 00:35:56.450
On the tech side,
we also get inputs

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.780
from the National Academy.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.630
And the underlined
ones are the ones

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.900
that they had recommended
that we focus on.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.330
Or the underlying ones are
the specific experiments

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:14.540
that address areas that we
were told to concentrate on.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.770
But a lot of them
don't necessarily

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.440
complete the problem.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.090
They don't put to
bed the problem.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.994
So we started throughout--
with all our partners,

00:36:25.994 --> 00:36:27.160
we got these teams together.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.743
And we said, OK, we're going to
figure out and prioritize what

00:36:29.743 --> 00:36:32.460
we're going to use ISS for
for technology demonstrations.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.734
And we all sat down, and we
came up with all the areas

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.400
that we thought we
were going to come up

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.670
with in the first place.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.370
And we did prioritize ECLSS,
the Environmental Control

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.190
and Life Support
Systems, as the top one.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.760
So we have a lot of
consumables that we end up

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.320
using with the ISS
version of ECLSS.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.770
We end up relying
upon a logistics

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:54.080
train, the resupply vehicles
that we have for that ECLSS.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.830
There's things that
we need to do in order

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.870
to go to Mars, for
instance, with ECLSS,

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.230
and we can identify those.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.062
So that was good.

00:37:01.062 --> 00:37:02.770
And then on the
radiation side of things,

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.060
we said we need to figure
this out too because it's

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.976
a different radiation
environment once you get

00:37:06.976 --> 00:37:08.740
outside the Van Allen
belts, and we've

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.060
got to know all about that.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.947
And so when we looked at
it, we had a million options

00:37:12.947 --> 00:37:15.280
on what to do for Environmental
Control and Life Support

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.070
Systems.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.320
And all of us were
well-rounded generalists

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.450
in the areas of
space technology.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.800
And we didn't think it was
really fair for the six

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.300
or seven of us that
were tasked to this team

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.700
to make these large decisions.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.470
On top of that, it's a political
environment that you have,

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.970
right?

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.790
So you have one idea
that comes from Alabama.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.080
You get another one
that comes from Ohio.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.570
You get another one
that comes from Texas.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.920
And no matter which
one you choose,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.920
somebody says, well,
the reason they

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.230
chose that is because of this.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.340
And then somebody calls an
elected official, and then

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.740
all of a sudden, you're
designing your spacecraft

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.120
inside the beltway instead
of where it needs to be,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.730
on a drafting table or the
modern equivalent of it.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.627
So what we did is we
said, all right, we're

00:37:58.627 --> 00:38:00.210
going to set up
teams, and we're going

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.751
to use them in the exact same
way that the rest of the agency

00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:05.040
uses, the NRC and the
National Academies,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.110
and tell us what's going on,
because while on the ECLSS side

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.670
we had a million options,
on the radiation side,

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.070
we had a real lack of options.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.090
We sensed the heck out
of radiation up there,

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.122
and that's what all
the proposals were--

00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:20.580
sensing, sensing,
sensing, sensing.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.140
So we're going to be able to
tell a crew you're smoked,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.437
but I'm not sure how we can
tell them, but you'll be OK.

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.020
So that's one of the
things that we've

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.880
tasked that
particular team with,

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.199
and we've called them
system maturation teams.

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:33.490
And we've set one up for ECLSS.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.730
We set one up for comm and nav.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.188
We set one up for
radiation, and we

00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:40.350
set one up-- the human
research program really already

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.730
existed before this, so
we said, hey, you guys,

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.606
make sure you
concentrate on that.

00:38:44.606 --> 00:38:46.480
So we did that for all
the technical areas so

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.120
that we could properly
identify-- and we told them,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.530
we just want you to evaluate
the technical solutions.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.579
First identify the
technical gaps,

00:38:55.579 --> 00:38:57.245
and then help us
identify the solutions.

00:38:57.245 --> 00:38:59.590
And we're trying to
take any politics out

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.520
of it as to whose idea--
so we have experts

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.540
from across the agency.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.900
We populated it
from every center.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.630
And when they come
to a consensus,

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.570
we've got it so that the
technology investment

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.607
teams within the
agency and the programs

00:39:11.607 --> 00:39:13.690
can say, well, what does
the SMT think about this?

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.023
And they say, oh, they think
this is their top priority.

00:39:16.023 --> 00:39:18.030
And that's how we get
things funded, and flown,

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.571
and executed.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.560
And it's important because
if you've paid attention

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.260
to any federal budget discussion
over the last few years,

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.800
it's a zero sum game, right?

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.110
So if we end up choosing
the wrong thing to invest in

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.360
and it costs X dollars, those
dollars are gone, right?

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.510
And it can't be used to
spend on something else.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.557
So when we look at the
technical gaps that we have,

00:39:42.557 --> 00:39:44.950
we have to agree that
they're general enough

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.340
that they should be
addressed now before Congress

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.760
or a president tells,
us this is your mission,

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.780
because everything we're doing
now is based on a generality.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.060
We know we want to go
out there somewhere.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.120
So we look at all the generic
solutions to these technology

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.120
problems and prioritize
filling in those gaps

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.400
based on what you need--
the lead time in order

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.500
to develop them.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.710
If you know you need four
years on an ECLSS system,

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.620
well, you better make sure you
have four years left of ISS

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.820
by the time you fly it in order
to vet it out and then make

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.130
any mods that you need
to once you're there.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.740
And we're trying to get
the teams to develop--

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.120
and some of them have already--
specific roadmaps so that we

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.850
can then say, you know what?

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.430
We're done with
the Space Station.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.260
We've met every goal-- check,
check, check, check, check.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.000
And we can hand it over
to commercial entities,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.090
or we can simply-- let's
transition to deep space

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.310
because we've managed
to address what

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.752
we need to, using this vehicle.

00:40:46.752 --> 00:40:48.210
An important thing
to understand is

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.793
that people look at
things differently

00:40:49.793 --> 00:40:51.290
depending on who you are.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.840
And actually, it's
missing-- there we go.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.515
OK, so depending
on who you are, you

00:40:56.515 --> 00:40:59.220
might look at the flow of
how the space station got up

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.547
there a little differently.

00:41:00.547 --> 00:41:02.880
If you were building it, if
you were part of the project

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.800
management, you design it,
and then you assemble it.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.499
And then you start using it,
and then you think about, OK,

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.540
do we need to use it for
a longer period of time,

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.300
or are we good?

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.620
Then you worry about extension.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.580
If you're on the science
side, well, in the design,

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.824
people are telling
me that there's

00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:18.990
going to be a Space Station.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.342
Let's hold off and see if
one actually gets built.

00:41:21.342 --> 00:41:23.800
And then we start building it,
and they're like, all right.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.180
Well, let's wait
until it finishes.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.770
And then, OK, you
guys are really done?

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.592
OK, go right ahead.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:30.550
And we really saw that.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.590
We saw this gap.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.820
After we were finished building
it, we turned around and said,

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.640
who wants to use it?

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.030
And there hadn't
been this backlog

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.910
of science waiting to use
the ISS because that's not

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.500
the way that you get your
research funded, is by saying

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.920
I'm going to go
do some research.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.750
I'd like you to give me
several million dollars,

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.250
and I'm going to conduct it on
that vehicle that doesn't yet

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.800
exist.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.520
So we had to wait.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.470
First, we had to promise
that it got up there.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.660
Then, we had to deliver it.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.860
And now, we're seeing a lot
more usage and requests for use

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:07.270
now that it's been there
and it's a proven commodity.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.737
And then, if you're just
in the organization, first,

00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:13.320
you worried about
all the requirements

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.210
and how to get the things done.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.260
Then you worried about
building the vehicle

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.692
and getting the crew there.

00:42:18.692 --> 00:42:21.150
And this is the transition that
I was talking about before,

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:24.090
this changing your
focus to research.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.960
And then, OK, are we going
to continue that or not?

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.980
And then, this kind of
just mentions the things

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.271
that I've already talked about.

00:42:30.271 --> 00:42:34.200
With operating safely,
it's probably not enough.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.920
You need to take
enough of a risk

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.400
so that you get the proper
return on the investment.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.190
And it's what I was
talking about before,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.990
that it's a real
laboratory, and it's OK

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.040
if things don't work
the first time--

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.746
and getting people to
accept the fact that that's

00:42:49.746 --> 00:42:50.620
perfectly acceptable.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.660
OK, so I mentioned some
Earth science stuff before

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.160
and said that I
would talk about it.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.370
So it turns out it's a
really great platform.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:07.122
So I mentioned that we are
at a higher inclination

00:43:07.122 --> 00:43:09.080
than a lot of space
shuttle flights would take.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.060
So we would launch
out of Florida,

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.290
and so you would--
from that latitude,

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.670
you would get to
a higher altitude

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.580
by staying at that
latitude, instead

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.562
of going to a higher one.

00:43:21.562 --> 00:43:23.020
And that's probably
where ISS would

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.100
have been if it was just Space
Station Freedom, a sole United

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:26.970
States effort.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.850
But because we wanted to
have access by our partners

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.930
to the vehicle, we're
at a higher inclination,

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:36.360
which ends up providing a lot
more access and a lot more

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.380
visibility to the ground that
we wouldn't have had otherwise.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.660
So you end up covering
85% of the Earth's surface

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.420
flying over it, where
you wouldn't have.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.710
You'd have been kind
of skinny, down,

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.570
no further north than Florida.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.510
And then, every one
to three days, you

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.740
end up passing over 95%
of the world's population.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.940
So not only is it
International Space Station

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.000
because of investment, but it's
international in that if you

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.190
go to your computer and
you look up ISS sightings,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:08.290
you can see it go right
over your head often.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.992
And it can make observations
of where you live,

00:44:10.992 --> 00:44:12.450
which could be
significant as well.

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:19.020
Some of those observations can
be in the hyperspectral zone.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.170
So this is looking
at a lot of stuff,

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:26.570
whether it be ocean temperatures
or reactions of the ocean

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.750
to changing
temperatures, or it could

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.440
be-- we've had agriculture
requests to look at things

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:39.670
like the Napa Valley for the way
that agriculture is responding

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.840
or not to climate.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.520
I mentioned the
relativistic aspect of it.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.990
So in 2016, the ESA is
going to fly the ACES.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:53.240
So this is an atomic clock.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.760
It's going to have two
clocks in it, actually.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.487
One is going to be based
on cesium atoms, I think,

00:45:01.487 --> 00:45:03.320
and I can't remember
what the other side is.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.850
But between the
two clocks, they'll

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.130
have an accuracy of
better than one second

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.790
for 300 million years.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.440
And so they're going to compare
that to very accurate clocks

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.880
on the ground and end up
proving out some Einstein stuff,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.630
or maybe proving it
to be debatable--

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:27.610
but between gravitation
and relativistic time.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.400
So even before we
said, hey, everybody,

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.910
it's open for use, open for
business, come and use it,

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.800
we'd already done some
significant things really

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.740
in the spare time.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.290
We were spending a lot
of time building it,

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.914
but in the spare
time, we still managed

00:45:39.914 --> 00:45:42.210
to do quite a lot of stuff.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.470
MAXI was a joint venture
with JAXA and us,

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:50.150
and so they were able to
observe and complement

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:53.515
another observation of a
black hole swallowing a star.

00:45:53.515 --> 00:45:55.949
It was the first time
that had been done.

00:45:55.949 --> 00:45:57.490
They noticed something
with the crew,

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.198
that there were certain
crew members that

00:45:59.198 --> 00:46:00.990
were coming back
with vision issues.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.790
So they realized
that it might be--

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:07.720
it's environmental for sure, but
it might affect specific crew

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.214
members more than others.

00:46:09.214 --> 00:46:11.130
So we've been looking
at that and whether it's

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.150
intracranial pressure or whether
it's a gene expression type

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.580
thing.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.510
Microbial virulence--
so that's what

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.580
I mentioned before about
the stressor on everything,

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.650
not just cells but
microbes as well.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:27.620
And so there's some--
resulting from that,

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.109
there's some candidate
vaccines for different things

00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:32.150
that have been out there.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.610
And I removed the slide
from it, but there's

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:40.479
that valley of death for
technologies and science

00:46:40.479 --> 00:46:41.770
research that comes out, right?

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.380
So there's this rush up
with results that end up

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.830
being obtained
from all this work,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.200
and then getting across
that final valley

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.110
to-- whether it be
something that you

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.250
can do a human
research trial on,

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:58.182
or whether it's a true
commercial product or anything,

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.890
you've got to get
across that big hurdle.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.790
So you can hear a lot of
stuff that gets to the point

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.730
that I'm talking about
right there that never gets

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.240
into a hospital or into Best
Buy or somewhere like that.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.870
Let's see.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:15.730
The NASA exploration
mission side--

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.470
that's largely what we're
tasking the SMTs to help us

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.310
come up with the proper
investments to do,

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.320
and they're well on
their way to doing that.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.270
We have had some spin-offs
in technology area,

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.160
like robotic assist
for brain surgery.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.760
There's a need for
telemedicine when

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.730
it comes to having a crew
being that far away from Earth.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:41.650
There's filtering for
air that has come out.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.240
You need the crew to breathe
the same air all the time,

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.470
and it's got to be
compatible with human life.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.180
And then, let's see-- the last
one, remotely-guided ultrasound

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.005
for maternal care-- another
telemedicine application.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.350
So my original question, or
title, was how best to use.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.935
So here's some final points
on how I would best use it

00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:09.220
and my recommendations for it.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.060
So prioritize your
resources of limited life.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.500
So the saying that a lot
of people in the NASA area

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:20.750
have heard me use a lot was
use the Space Station now.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.030
The ground's going
to be here forever.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.070
So there's a premise that
you can't fly something

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.760
until you're ready to
fly because I can't

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.620
be that guy that people
are talking about

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.340
that it didn't work
the first time.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:40.200
We flew a carbon dioxide removal
solution called Amine Swingbed,

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.500
which was going to be applicable
to the next Orion vehicle

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.570
that we're building.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.560
And we built it--
by NASA standards,

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.110
we built it on the cheap.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:51.730
And it flew up there,
and it didn't work.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.870
And we ended up using
the crew to fix it,

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.382
and it wasn't a small amount.

00:48:57.382 --> 00:48:59.840
It wasn't a small amount of
time that we ended up doing it.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.298
And we considered
bringing it home,

00:49:01.298 --> 00:49:03.600
which was also another
acceptable solution.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.100
We've paid for the logistics
so you can fly something there.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.020
If it really doesn't work and it
really can't be fixed on orbit,

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.420
we'll fly it home.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.970
We'll tweak it and
fly it again if it's

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.050
of the right priority
and the right need

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.680
for either you, the
country, or the agency.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.820
So prioritize the
work that you're doing

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.040
and fund it appropriately.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.830
You don't need to
overspend, and I

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.580
don't recommend underspending.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.680
Force the institutional
change that's required.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.910
So we did the
reorganization that we need.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.580
We're redesigning
processes still every day.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.470
There's a specific
team at JSC right now

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.630
that is changing the entire
process by which we accept

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.730
experiments to ISS because we
deemed it as too expensive,

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.540
as did some of our customers.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.700
If you guys are
providing products

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.720
that are too expensive
for people to use,

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.119
you're going to make a change.

00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:57.660
Well, as a government
agency, there's

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.500
not always the same impetus.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.180
But we have enough people
that care enough about this

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.440
that we're doing exactly that.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.150
And then, change the perceptions
of your organization--

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:12.542
how they perceive everybody who
is going to be their customer.

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.500
Have a plan and measure
your performance to it.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.500
That might scare people who are
big on fundamental research.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.980
It doesn't have to be the
results that you plan for.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.420
It just needs to be
planning appropriately

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.670
for what you want to
investigate and explore.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.690
On the tech side, we
have specific goals

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.170
that we need to get to.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:31.300
Embrace the private sector.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.000
So we're certainly doing
that in the logistics train.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.100
We don't have any
NASA-owned assets,

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.790
and that's been
something to get used to.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.100
We pay SpaceX and Orbital
to get stuff there and back.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.650
And for now, we pay
the Russians for humans

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:45.880
to get there and back.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.510
So I think we're doing that.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.740
And the part that
I discussed before

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.967
about trying to get American
entities to recognize the Space

00:50:54.967 --> 00:50:56.050
Station is there for them.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.020
They can keep all their
intellectual property.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.340
And we assume,
effectively, all the risk

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.980
if you build the
hardware, getting

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.730
that word out is important.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.334
And then, getting
word out-- it's

00:51:07.334 --> 00:51:09.500
really important that people
understand the benefits

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.370
that we're getting.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.770
So if you have people
that are properly

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.310
reporting the work that
they do, whether it's

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.250
something as significant as
"Origin of Species" or not,

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.630
it's important for
people to understand

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:25.310
this was possible
because of this asset,

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:30.010
and it's good that our elected
officials can understand,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.530
all right, this is something
that is actually benefiting

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:36.420
people in my district, people
on-- people in this state,

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.410
or just people on
the Earth in general.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:43.690
So increasing the public
knowledge is a real thing,

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:48.480
and even that is of
benefit to everybody here.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.697
So that's all I had, and so I
can open it up to questions.

00:51:52.697 --> 00:51:54.780
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of
a double-track question,

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.440
but I don't hear much about
the International Space Station

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.820
in the media.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:04.850
And in parallel, we had
Maria Klawe here last week

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.435
talking about building
inclusive environments

00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:10.480
and getting more women
and minorities involved

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.640
in STEM and CS.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.850
I don't in any way mean
to propose doing crass dog

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.190
and pony shows with the
International Space Station,

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.430
but do you have
an outreach effort

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.497
to try to get kids
of all backgrounds

00:52:21.497 --> 00:52:23.330
from all around the
world excited about what

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:24.996
the International
Space Station is doing

00:52:24.996 --> 00:52:28.690
and engaged with the experiments
that are happening there?

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.650
GEORGE NELSON: Well, very
honestly, it's not something

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.420
that, historically,
NASA's done very well,

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.560
just outreach in general.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.510
And I think that when you
have the type of people

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:47.689
that NASA historically
has been attractive to,

00:52:47.689 --> 00:52:49.230
they're all about
the mission, right?

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.260
And so if you go
to the moon, that's

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.010
going to get people excited.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.090
But when you talk
about science research,

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.550
I think of that "Big Bang"
episode where they're like,

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:59.758
let's get to work, and they
play the theme to "Rocky"

00:52:59.758 --> 00:53:01.940
while they stare at a
white board for an hour.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.300
That doesn't always get
people excited, right?

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.830
So I think one of the best
outreach activities that ISS

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.080
has had has been through
YouTube and Google,

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.660
when they were able to
get-- I can't remember

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.980
how many proposals they
got, but they ended up

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.450
selecting two to fly on ISS.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.390
That's not an
insignificant thing,

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.000
particularly for those kids
that managed to do it--

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.500
and exposed everybody
who even tried

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:33.730
to be selected to the process
of developing and proposing

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.820
scientific activities.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.200
I think that's great.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.930
We recently had a three-day--
it wasn't really a retreat,

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:46.730
but we had a three-day
discussion with ISS leadership

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:47.440
recently.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.606
And that was one of the
things that we talked about,

00:53:49.606 --> 00:53:51.060
was the outreach aspect.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.160
And making sure that people
understand everything

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.510
is really part of
all of our jobs.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.312
So that's one of the
reasons I'm here.

00:53:59.312 --> 00:54:01.020
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
a couple of times

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.640
that the resource
is limited, that it

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.799
would have an end of
life at some point.

00:54:05.799 --> 00:54:07.090
Could you tell me when that is?

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:10.260
And then, what is
NASA considering

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:16.410
for-- as it develops larger
and perhaps more complex

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.330
space stations?

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.950
GEORGE NELSON: Well,
so I was talking

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.850
to-- it's kind of a
complicated answer

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.540
as to what the Space Station
life is right now because you

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.136
have so many different
political entities that

00:54:29.136 --> 00:54:30.010
are involved with it.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:33.170
So 2016 was the original date.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.080
The United States
has approved 2020.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.680
Our partners are working
on approving 2020,

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.250
but there is general acceptance
within, for instance,

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.200
my colleagues within the
Space Station program

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.920
from other countries
that it's 2020.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.230
The current
administration has said

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.540
that they are good
with it being to 2024.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:57.370
There's a general
rule-- shocking

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.150
that they follow any
rules consistently--

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.024
but there's a general
rule within the beltway

00:55:01.024 --> 00:55:04.440
that you don't commit two
administrations beyond you

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.510
to anything.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:10.960
So it's not law, but 2024
is the general acceptance

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.400
within the United States
as to how long we're

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.177
going to have and use the ISS.

00:55:15.177 --> 00:55:16.760
And then, everybody
within the program

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.920
itself has been working to
certify all of the hardware

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.680
to make sure that
the vehicle itself

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.790
can last at least until 2028.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.790
So we think we have
a reasonable future

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:36.890
in being able to provide
a product to customers

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:37.730
that are out there.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:42.490
And it's important that people
understand that that horizon is

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:45.270
well down the road, because
a lot of these investments

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:48.590
take several years to first
fund and then build and then

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.630
fly and then re-fly,
if they need to.

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.396
So assuring people that we're
going to be there for a while,

00:55:54.396 --> 00:55:56.270
I think, is an important
thing to get across.

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:58.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah, saying
2016 would probably

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.915
kill most people's
consideration.

00:56:00.915 --> 00:56:02.290
GEORGE NELSON:
Yeah, we addressed

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.500
that pretty early
on after assembly

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.810
complete that in order
to do what we need to do,

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:10.360
it needed to be minimum 2020.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.330
We got concurrence
with that, and then

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.930
general concurrence on
we're looking at 2024.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.390
And then, the whole
time-- you don't

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.230
get to go beyond 2024 if that
is what your goal is, right?

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.270
So we're trying to make
sure that everything

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:28.450
is capable of sustaining
flight well beyond 2028.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.500
AUDIENCE: So the
next step for NASA

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.430
is not necessarily another
space station, but more along

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.299
the lines of a trip to Mars.

00:56:35.299 --> 00:56:36.340
Is that what I'm hearing?

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.340
GEORGE NELSON: I think
that is the general-- you

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.756
can get in trouble by saying
this is what we are or aren't

00:56:40.756 --> 00:56:43.380
doing these days, but
the general consensus

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.810
is that all of the prep
work that we're doing,

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.480
particularly in tech
and human research,

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.230
is to enable a trip to Mars.

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:55.200
Now, whether you do that by
making a pit stop at the moon,

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.510
or whether you do some asteroid
work first, or wherever,

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:02.360
it doesn't seem to be
offensive to anybody

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.890
to say that's an
eventual destination.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.900
And it happens to
be really hard,

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.080
so all of the tech
solutions that we have

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:13.190
are really bounded by
that extreme of trying

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:14.870
to go to Mars.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:17.890
AUDIENCE: Do you have an updated
take on Kessler syndrome?

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:23.470
And is there a way that
newer satellite companies

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:27.790
like Skybox and things like
that change that equation?

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:32.700
GEORGE NELSON: Well, so the
access of other companies

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.540
is there.

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.300
I don't know if you
heard that part.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:39.280
I'm not good to be
able to give you

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.270
an update on any of that stuff.

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:47.420
But the access of private
entities to ISS is established,

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.600
and it's a really
open road to get there

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.475
through CASIS, the Center
for Advancement of Space

00:57:53.475 --> 00:57:54.270
In Science.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:58.490
And those guys can
help anybody get there.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.880
The law is written that
half of the US assets

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.100
are designated a national lab.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.070
They didn't
specifically tell us how

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.930
we were supposed to
measure that percentage,

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:12.780
or whether it was
measured on a monthly

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.860
or a yearly or a
five-year basis.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.145
But we haven't really
approached 50% above mass

00:58:18.145 --> 00:58:20.670
yet on each launch, so
there's plenty of room

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:23.312
there for private companies
to try and do stuff.

00:58:23.312 --> 00:58:25.770
AUDIENCE: Just following up on
the question about lifetime,

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:29.670
what's the average proposal
to flight time for projects

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.520
that come into your office?

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.460
GEORGE NELSON: For the things
that come into our office,

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.280
there was-- when I said one
of the things about embracing

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.190
the commercial sector is we
had to let those guys get off

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:42.990
the ground, because
we didn't end up

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:48.770
starting with the-- it wasn't
Boeing and Lockheed that ended

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:52.720
up proposing to be the
commercial providers

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.320
for the commercial cargo.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.960
So SpaceX had to start
from the beginning.

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.210
Orbital have to build their
whole vehicle themselves

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.170
as well.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.620
So there was a significant
lag in our ability

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.927
to deliver hardware for a while
until they really got going.

00:59:06.927 --> 00:59:09.260
So for instance, the cameras
that I showed when we first

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.480
got in here-- we were
racing to get those built,

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.730
just in case another payload
wasn't ready for SpaceX 3,

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:20.590
and that was in 2011.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:25.140
And we didn't launch until
this year to get that going.

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:29.970
But now, I think we're
about to start cruising,

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:32.920
I think, with real
regular transport.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:38.950
So it's quite variable when
you say, how long does it take?

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:41.970
Most of them are not-- that's
a very simple payload--

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:43.667
four cameras and a box outside.

00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.500
Make sure that it doesn't
fall apart, right?

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.960
So that was very easy to build.

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.630
Most of them are not
waiting for a ride.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:55.160
But for instance, the legs
that went on Robonaut,

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.360
those waited for a while.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.570
And that particular
project needed

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:02.450
to figure out their
funding profile,

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:07.100
as they weren't
integrated at ISS.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.140
And so that goes-- that falls
into part of my responsibility

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.620
when we prioritize the
work that gets done,

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.904
not just the up-mass, but
what the crew spends time on.

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.820
And that's part of the
discussion, when I say,

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.650
no, this has to be
the top priority

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.530
because that
researcher is losing

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.380
funding at the end
of this quarter,

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.340
so that's why it's the priority.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.920
And so a loss of
science is a huge driver

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.479
in getting things done at ISS.

01:00:29.479 --> 01:00:31.770
It's one of the reasons that
the human research program

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:33.980
gets so much time
because if you go

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.840
through five months of
a crew member on orbit

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.427
and you need the sixth month
in order to complete the run,

01:00:40.427 --> 01:00:41.760
it's a complete loss of science.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.130
This guy's coming home.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:44.730
You can't do anything
else after that,

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.390
so that becomes a priority
in one of the discussions.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:51.610
But we can get stuff--
the standard template is

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:59.470
18 months-- 18 months from when
you get effectively manifested

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.920
for that increment for that
period of time and then fly.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.757
But you've got to be on dock--
it depends on the launch

01:01:04.757 --> 01:01:06.340
provider, but you've
got to be on dock

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.130
usually 90 days ahead of launch.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:12.520
AUDIENCE: So it seems like cost
is the primary limiting factor

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.714
on the lifespan of the ISS?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.380
GEORGE NELSON: I'm
not sure that's true.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:22.590
I mean, it has
to-- so whose cost?

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:27.630
So cost is a significant
factor in the investment

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.250
of the science that gets done.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.160
Way back when a space
station was conceived,

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.510
there were going to
be two pots of money,

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.210
one to build and
operate the vehicle,

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.670
and a second pot to
do all the research.

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:42.850
Well, long ago, that
second pot failed to exist.

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:47.080
And so we're in a situation of
build it and they will come,

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.930
and part of that is
getting the word out.

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:56.300
So there is a nominal
amount of NASA's budget

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.962
that is required in order
to continue flying the ISS.

01:01:59.962 --> 01:02:02.800
So that would be
required if it was

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.600
going to continue to
be a government asset.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.660
It's possible, when NASA
has met all of its needs,

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:13.840
that it gets turned over
to a corporate entity that

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.920
manages to continue to use it.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.730
Depending on when
that is, it might

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:23.190
be the hardware that's the
limiting factor on continuing

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.160
to use it.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.220
AUDIENCE: And are
the costs going down

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.800
as companies like SpaceX
reduce cost to launch?

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.500
GEORGE NELSON: Well, I mean, we
only have one contract so far

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.804
for commercial cargo.

01:02:38.804 --> 01:02:40.220
We were talking
earlier that we're

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.847
going to talk-- I
think there's a pending

01:02:42.847 --> 01:02:44.180
announcement on commercial crew.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.770
One of my bosses is
off doing the work

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.510
for the second iteration
of commercial cargo.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.440
So to say that
anything's coming down

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.170
would have to await I'd say the
next iteration of contracting

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:00.920
to say that it's coming down.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.400
But that's one of
the intents of using

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.340
the commercial
side of things, is

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:12.570
because they don't
require themselves

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:18.780
to adhere to the 40
years of bureaucracy

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.830
that we've set up for ourselves.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.315
AUDIENCE: Isn't that next
round of contracts today?

01:03:23.315 --> 01:03:24.440
GEORGE NELSON: It might be.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.940
I haven't seen
whether they're going

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.960
to announce the-- you're
talking commercial crew?

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:29.876 --> 01:03:31.620
GEORGE NELSON: OK.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.410
For crew?

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.430
So that's the crew side.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:38.700
There's another effort to do
the extension of the SpaceX

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:42.860
and Orbital aspect, the
commercial cargo side, that

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.390
is not limited to
those two to propose.

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.250
And so we'll wait and see
what the answers to that is.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:49.820
I think the RFI was
about to go out--

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.050
or the RFP was about
to go out soon.

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.570
Well, thanks a lot
for coming, guys.

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.320
[APPLAUSE]
