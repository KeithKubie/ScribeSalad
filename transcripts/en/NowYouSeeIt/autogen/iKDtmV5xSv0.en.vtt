00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.960
 What a person chooses to drink will reveal a lot about him. 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.200
 Martini, shake well, don't stir. 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.140
 If they order whiskey, it means they are cool. 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.960
 If they order a fine Chardonnay, 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.220
 They are likely to go to class... 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.760
 But there is a drink that appears in the movie and needs some explanation... 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 I see you drink 1% milk because you think you are fat? 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.040
 Maybe when you think of milk, the first thing that comes to mind is youth and innocence. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.720
 When a 16-year-old teenager uses his charm and wind vacation dress is a pilot, 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.780
 The drink he chooses will remind us that he is not yet adult. 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.280
 What do you want to drink after taking off? 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.480
 milk? 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.040
 In the "clockwork orange", the teenagers drink milk, 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.360
 The side reminds us that all this confusion is caused by the children. 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.340
 James Dean drinks milk in this way. 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.900
 This is a visual reminder of his conflict between maturity and adulthood. 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.199
 Of course, if you don't drink milk, it means you are very masculine. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.300
 How strong is I? 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.600
 How strong is I? 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200
 I have a bowl of nails for my breakfast today... 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.379
 Yes, then? 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.839
 ... no milk added. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.900
 Hey.. This road on the right. Sorry to keep you waiting. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.460
 If you want to have an in-depth interpretation 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.149
 It can be argued that in the "little home", Kevin spilled a bunch of milk 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.980
 Is a symbol of his lack of maternal love 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.629
 Or you can say 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.369
 John Hughes just wants to tell a visual joke 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.251
 Everyone will worry about the spilled milk 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.420
 However, this is just about the fur of milk. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 Many adults also drink milk, this is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620
 Where milk becomes more complicated 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.880
 Milk is a symbol of childishness, so see 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.060
 This killer is not too cold and powerful. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.260
 Leon feels very humorous when drinking milk in the movie. 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.000
 It fits nicely to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.720
 Movie comedy moment, but it also 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 Revealed his love for the girl when he will 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.439
 Matilda is protected under his wings. 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.150
 Drinking milk in this scene is a joke, but 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.590
 Many times drinking milk has 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469
 The opposite intention: this is creepy. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.009
 An adult man is very milk revealing what 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 The film producer seems to be 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.340
 Know this intuitive 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.990
 In Hitchcockâ€™s "suspicion" 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.970
 The audience suspected that the milk might have been poisoned. 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.860
 This is very weird 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 Let us think of innocent and pure milk, it may have poisoned 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.260
 This may be a poisoned drink. 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.659
 I don't think this will have almost the same effect 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.459
 If you change it to coffee or a cup 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 Shot of the whiskey. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.649
 Have some enjoyable scenes 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.180
 Make milk dangerous. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.159
 We saw again in the "shameless bastard": Colonel Hans 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 Drinking milk from LaPadite Farm 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 Has a creepy effect 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 But there is more content than this. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 I quote the words of the social theorist Roland Barthes. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.660
 He picks up the milk: its purity, the innocence of the child, is a symbol of strength, a force that is not tempting, impulsive, but calm, pure white, transparent, 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.480
 So when a bad guy is holding a glass of milk, 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.129
 This is creepy, but it also shows 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.780
 Their power, they show them by drinking milk 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 Conquering purity and innocence 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 And not a little bit 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.680
 When I saw "Crazy Max: The Road to Fury" 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320
 When people are only afraid in the theater 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.160
 Not in a violent scene 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.840
 But when this scene happens, 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.660
 Western culture is repulsive to breast milk, 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.640
 It is considered taboo for adults to drink breast milk. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.000
 ...... taste a little bit odor 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560
 This is because it is the left breast from Debby 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.780
 Collecting milk shots in the movie 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.069
 Further alienation 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.049
 The post-apocalyptic world and our world 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.060
 In summary, "Crazy Max: The Road to Fury" is a story 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.069
 Liquid movie. Women are because their breast milk is being used 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.780
 Men are used because of their blood 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.790
 People are being used 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.290
 Because the water supply is controlled 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.610
 Full control of these liquids shows 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 Immortal Joe's rule over the world 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 Milk is no exception 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.430
 In fact, his son drinks milk 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.079
 To keep their muscles stronger 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.910
 Further emphasized that the consumption of milk symbolizes 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.540
 power 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.620
 The great thing about using these liquids in movies is 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.910
 It makes 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.920
 Crazy Max introduces the plot and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.930
 Other characters are not only verbally moved 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.970
 When Max started his first selfless act 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.160
 Furiosa, he washes his own milk, 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.569
 Symbolizes the beginning of his transformation 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.639
 Transforming from a selfish person looking for survival 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.440
 a person who cares and takes care of others 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.120
 The turning point of fully trusting Furiosa is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.750
 Max lost his blood to her. 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.730
 Another symbol of liquid "Crazy Max: The Road to Fury" 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.889
 Is a typical example of milk enhancing visual storytelling 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.549
 Milk is a powerful storytelling tool. It can be displayed 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.460
 Someone is a child, but it can also be 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.090
 Show the power of the character 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.789
 Or provide relevant plot information. 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.030
 So next time you see one 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.720
 What do people drink, ask yourself: 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.260
 Is there milk? 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.660
 Thanks for watching.
