had to write out a script so that I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
had to write out a script so that I
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.970
had to write out a script so that I
could actually get the question right um

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
could actually get the question right um
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.520
could actually get the question right um
what if the Big Bang is nothing more

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
what if the Big Bang is nothing more
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290
what if the Big Bang is nothing more
than the eventual explosion of a black

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
than the eventual explosion of a black
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390
than the eventual explosion of a black
hole when its energy is not enough to

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
hole when its energy is not enough to
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.950
hole when its energy is not enough to
keep everything it has pulled in inside

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
keep everything it has pulled in inside
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.740
keep everything it has pulled in inside
in theory it is an exceptionally dense

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
in theory it is an exceptionally dense
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560
in theory it is an exceptionally dense
rotating ball of matter right so Jeremy

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
rotating ball of matter right so Jeremy
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720
rotating ball of matter right so Jeremy
it's a great question first let me point

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
it's a great question first let me point
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.210
it's a great question first let me point
out that nobody knows but secondly the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
out that nobody knows but secondly the
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.050
out that nobody knows but secondly the
people that work very hard on

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060
people that work very hard on
 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.830
people that work very hard on
understanding the beginning of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
understanding the beginning of
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440
understanding the beginning of
everything the Big Bang they have not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
everything the Big Bang they have not
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.970
everything the Big Bang they have not
come up with the idea that it was a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
come up with the idea that it was a
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.690
come up with the idea that it was a
single black hole just this week people

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
single black hole just this week people
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369
single black hole just this week people
discovered the star they're calling

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
discovered the star they're calling
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.510
discovered the star they're calling
nasty which created a disk a thousand

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
nasty which created a disk a thousand
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.959
nasty which created a disk a thousand
times the diameter of the solar system

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969
times the diameter of the solar system
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.580
times the diameter of the solar system
the scale of the thing is really hard to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
the scale of the thing is really hard to
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380
the scale of the thing is really hard to
get the reason I think that your idea

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
get the reason I think that your idea
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.119
get the reason I think that your idea
about being a single black hole is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
about being a single black hole is
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.209
about being a single black hole is
probably not right as the scale of it

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219
probably not right as the scale of it
 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.910
probably not right as the scale of it
there are at least 10 to the 85th atoms

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

across just just not not that big if I'm

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
across just just not not that big if I'm
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.969
across just just not not that big if I'm
not in close to that big when you start

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
not in close to that big when you start
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.700
not in close to that big when you start
talking about dozens of orders of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
talking about dozens of orders of
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.890
talking about dozens of orders of
magnitude

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900
magnitude
 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.490
magnitude
dozens of factors of 10 it's it's just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
dozens of factors of 10 it's it's just
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469
dozens of factors of 10 it's it's just
the Big Bang was a big deal I mean you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
the Big Bang was a big deal I mean you
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.789
the Big Bang was a big deal I mean you
and I and everything that we can observe

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
and I and everything that we can observe
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.870
and I and everything that we can observe
came from it as far as we can tell so

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880
came from it as far as we can tell so
 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.700
came from it as far as we can tell so
you may be right and maybe this star

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
you may be right and maybe this star
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800
you may be right and maybe this star
nasty will lead to a discovery that will

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
nasty will lead to a discovery that will
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890
nasty will lead to a discovery that will
inform your question but right now I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
inform your question but right now I
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.999
inform your question but right now I
think you're just you're not

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
think you're just you're not
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130
think you're just you're not
appreciating how big everything is or

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
appreciating how big everything is or
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.319
appreciating how big everything is or
how big everything must have been and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
how big everything must have been and
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.179
how big everything must have been and
then there's this question jeremy of the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
then there's this question jeremy of the
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.249
then there's this question jeremy of the
unknowable time there's a time according

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
unknowable time there's a time according
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.679
unknowable time there's a time according
to sort of first cut relativity there's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
to sort of first cut relativity there's
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.039
to sort of first cut relativity there's
a time we can't know because of the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
a time we can't know because of the
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.859
a time we can't know because of the
quantum because there's the energies

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
quantum because there's the energies
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.980
quantum because there's the energies
either here or it's not there and so

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
either here or it's not there and so
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.200
either here or it's not there and so
people just love to speculate about what

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
people just love to speculate about what
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.499
people just love to speculate about what
happened in that moment and maybe you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
happened in that moment and maybe you
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149
happened in that moment and maybe you
will be that a guy the guy who discovers

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
will be that a guy the guy who discovers
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.370
will be that a guy the guy who discovers
it maybe your question will give an

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
it maybe your question will give an
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.020
it maybe your question will give an
astrophysicists an idea and he or she

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
astrophysicists an idea and he or she
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360
astrophysicists an idea and he or she
will go wow I got it and we will all

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
will go wow I got it and we will all
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.380
will go wow I got it and we will all
stay tuned

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
stay tuned
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.770
stay tuned
- cool question Jeremy
