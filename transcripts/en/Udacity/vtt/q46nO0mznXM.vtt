00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
Thankfully, I was able to put together a Python

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.520
script to get the current diamond price data, similar to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.010
the original diamonds data set, from diamondse.info without too much

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.370
trouble. This data set is about ten times the size

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.520
of the 2008 diamonds data set, and features diamonds

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.120
from all over the world certified by an array of

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.870
authorities, besides just the General Logical Institute Of America, or

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.230
the GIA. You can read in this data set as

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.510
follows, but make sure you've installed the R curl and

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.210
bit tops libraries before you do. This might take a

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.580
while as a data set contains over about 500,000 cases.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.290
The code used to obtain the data is available at

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.480
this link. Let's fit the model again to the big

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.610
data set. We'll only use GIA certified diamonds in this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.910
log. I look only at diamonds under $10,000 because these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450
are the type of diamonds sold at most retailers, and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.910
hence, the kind we care most about. By trimming the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.000
most expensive diamonds from the data set, our model will

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.440
also be less likely to be thrown off by outliers,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.400
and the higher variants at the high-end of price and carat.
