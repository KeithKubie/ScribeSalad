00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.570
So, for this question, your goal is to guess

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.430
the expected time to execute the query. Lookup index10M where

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.510
the string is eight a's. Where index10m, 10m, is

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.360
the index created by make_big_index passing in 10 million at

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.630
this size. And I should warn you this is

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.116
a bit of a trick question. So, think careful about

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:22.790
what make_big_index does and what lookup does. And here

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.400
are the possible answers. So, it could be 0.0 seconds.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.200
It could be 0.1 seconds. It could be 1.0 seconds, or it could be 10 seconds.
