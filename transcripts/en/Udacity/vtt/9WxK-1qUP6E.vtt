What is software design? Software design is the process of

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.880
building a program while satisfying the program's functional requirements and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.140
not violating any of its non-functional constraints. This is going to turn out

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.560
to be a question of trade offs. How do you trade off between performance and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.570
resource consumption, for example? Software design is normally broken into two

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.280
different phases, architectural design and detail design. Architectural design

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.350
is the process of carving up the programs into components and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.010
assigning responsibilities for aspects of behavior to each component and talking

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.480
about how the components are going to interact with each other. We're going to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.560
spend a great deal of time in this course talking about architectural design.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.060
Detail design is the process of dealing with the individual components.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.410
Particularly, with respect to their data structures and their algorithms.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.310
Let's look for a minute at some of the aspects of detail design.
