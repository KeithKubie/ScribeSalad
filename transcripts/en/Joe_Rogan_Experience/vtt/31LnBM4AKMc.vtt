00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.670
Star of Shit is the,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.770
[inaudible] pro black in any,
no chose commerce.
Wait Fun on the road.

9
00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:01.300
Black and it ain't no joke.
Bitches.
How are we doing here Tom?

10
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:02.890
I tell folders.
Yeah,
it was good man.

11
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:07.090
Whatever happened to Paris following a path for no,
just went to Paris.
He's done.

12
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.850
We'll make progress.
Page scrolls a little.

13
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.940
They came with the master plan of God for no who's opposed to the dominant dog

14
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.270
skin food for phone as a loan for the brother.
Man,

15
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
I need to get a Paris tee shirt.
Where's the back of the county?

16
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.493
Maybe

17
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.630
just released a new album.
Looks like in 2009 Oh really though.

18
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.800
What a gift from Heaven Tempo One 16.7 keeps you locked in.

19
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.410
Somebody tell me as Paris on Twitter,
I'll,
I'll pile on.

20
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.880
Don't we find this man flag flagging go will be.

21
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:46.090
Perhaps the black with a rec Nigga.
What was,

22
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.040
what was once at much greater heights falsely?
When did Joey,

23
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.070
we'll put them on for with orange juice.

24
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.510
Jones are in.in the flux show right there.
Alright.

25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.080
John Harrison,
somebody out who blah.
How many songs had orange juice?

26
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:00.390
Jones have gone.
That's

27
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.530
<v 1>the one I didn't even have a whole slowly he would,</v>

28
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.300
he would just open up then in Paris would take that thing off it up.
Yeah.

29
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.550
You'd have to have a little video for the audience.

30
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.900
How about a round of applause for the soldiers?
You know

31
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.990
of the weights Dab.
I bet around the Boswell,

32
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.240
the sex and ladies in the house.

33
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.100
There's a lot of black dudes like to do that in Iraq.

34
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.350
A lot of people like to do it.
People like to do that.

35
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220
Give big rounds of applause.
Applause.
Where's all the potty?
People's drinking.

36
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.570
Who's got HIV?
Go Fuck Yourself.
Plus this motherfuck out.

37
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.110
Nice here the date please.
Thank you for being here.

38
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.640
Joe Rogan experienced flashlight as you fuckers know was sponsored by
fleshlight.

39
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:40.600
You don't need to fuck your hand.

40
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.040
Nobody can fuck a cup that has a heritage or whatever.
It's like,

41
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:46.030
it looks like a big gulp.

42
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.700
And I see the blue one and I finally watched pieces Avatar.

43
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.080
Now I knew what the blue one was four.

44
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.870
I didn't watch the whole lab with call yet.
But here it is.

45
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.880
That's a little asshole one.
You know what I'm saying?

46
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.480
I wonder if they're going to get away with this whole blue alien pussy thing.

47
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.860
People like,
I think they already did.

48
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 2>They got away with it.
How'd they get away with it?
Well,
it's just a blue alien.</v>

49
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.210
You guys are the ones that are making references to have a toy.

50
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.750
But didn't they have like images on their site that looks like that was from

51
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.650
<v 3>a,
a movie?
Uh,
porn parody.</v>

52
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.220
<v 2>Okay.
And then did they sell that porn parody with this?
No,
I don't.</v>

53
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.840
I think that was just,
they,
they were in,
in conjunction with it.
Like,
you know,

54
00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:25.590
they were,
I think there were so in it really,
I don't know,

55
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.910
maybe they were in conjunction,
but either way.
I mean it's certainly implied.
Oh,

56
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.590
I have no issue with it.

57
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.090
What do you think it should be accepted under the laws of parody?
You know,

58
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.390
if you can make a parody of something,

59
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.470
you should make a fake pussy or something too.

60
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.880
I had a double clip pussy as a goof parodies or,
yeah,

61
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.730
<v 3>weird to me.
I don't understand how it works.</v>

62
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:47.760
Like there is a bobble head recently that street that was Steve jobs bobblehead

63
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.600
and l only like 300 were made or something like that.

64
00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:54.230
And they put a stop to it because it was a likeness of somebody,
you know?

65
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:57.020
And that was apparently it wasn't,
it didn't look exactly like,

66
00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:58.550
I mean it was like a big head bobble head,

67
00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:03.080
but I guess that was considered too much of a parody or something.

68
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.610
Using your likeness.

69
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.840
<v 2>That's a weird,
weird line,
right?
You can goof on someone,</v>

70
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.600
but if you're selling things when you're goofing on them,
like how,
what happens?

71
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:16.030
Like if you do like what if you were like a Jim Brewer and Jim Breuer did that

72
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:19.000
Joe Pesci impression,
right?
Remember we used to do that impression all the time,

73
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.100
right?
And he started selling tee shirts,

74
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.710
let's said like Joe Pesci says go fuck yourself.

75
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.900
And it's him with that expression.
Yeah.

76
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.720
<v 3>Are parodies though.
And they're making money off of it,</v>

77
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.570
but yet you can't sell it.
Bobblehead that looks like Steve Jobs.

78
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.130
<v 2>Well that was Steve jobs cause he's fee fucking jobs.</v>

79
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:37.970
You got more money than God.
He shot him down.
Probably has more money than God.

80
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.320
Maybe they're just not.

81
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.880
Maybe they're seen Avatar as like a fake character that someone is constructed.

82
00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:46.110
So it's,
you're allowed to have a parody of that.
Right.

83
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.200
And not have a guy who's not an entertainment.

84
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.170
Absolutely figure cause he's just a person.

85
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.530
But then how did they do like George Bush shit and like,
I don't know,

86
00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.470
I think maybe it's public domain when you hit like a certain height,

87
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.220
like when you get to be like George Bush famous,
maybe you become public domain.

88
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:05.090
Maybe you could just sell Bush socks,
t shirts with his face on it.
I don't know.

89
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:05.990
How does that happen?

90
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.990
Do you think they do them and then they'd just get shut down like that?

91
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.690
Just the State Department comes after him to say stupid,

92
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.960
canceled George Bush tee shirts,
asshole.
Well,
close up shop.

93
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.760
The State Department won't say that to you.

94
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:19.880
What those motherfuckers would do is put an audit on your ass.

95
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:20.714
You know what I'm saying?

96
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.230
Did you hear about that fucking guy in I ran that went to jail for like,

97
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.790
I think it was six years because he made a movie about the corruption during the

98
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.880
elections.
It's fucking sad story man.

99
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.970
You know everybody complains about America now.

100
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.700
Fucked up America is all this wikileak Shit,
right?
Yeah.
It's fucked up.

101
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:40.440
But it's the best of the fucked up places.
You know,

102
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:44.750
you can make them freedom to make a movie about fucking bashing people here,

103
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:46.940
but in another countries that don't fly though.
Yeah,

104
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:50.000
they really doesn't fly then and lock this fucking guy out.

105
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.150
But that whole election,
Manny member,
all the riots that they were having,

106
00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:57.920
I don't know the exact particulars,
but it was very clear to corona corruption,

107
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.450
corruption levels in those places.
It's just so mind boggling.
Go vote.

108
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.510
But the box is already stuck with ballots.
You know what I'm saying?

109
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:08.300
It's like that one.
It's so fucking corrupt,
you know,

110
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:12.470
so it's like these people live in hell.
Anyway.
So this guy that got put in jail,

111
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.970
he knew that there was going to be consequent.

112
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.690
He just thought he was fucking cute.
You gotta be careful though.
Yeah.
Well yeah,

113
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.730
he thought he was cute and he was trying to make a change.

114
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.600
But I don't know if that's how changes gets made.
I mean,
I guess it is,
man.

115
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.720
I mean it's,
it has to be the overwhelming.
We'll have the people to,

116
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:31.130
to bend back a corrupt government and it takes an incredible amount of effort to

117
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:32.600
bend back a really corrupt government.

118
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:36.980
The key is to never let it get to corrupt because people like all the laws are

119
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.950
in place.
I mean,
what,

120
00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:41.360
what's really important about them is to keep shit from getting out of hand

121
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.840
because once she gets out of hand,
it can stay out of hand.

122
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.410
People get really used to anything and other people in Liberia,

123
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.520
it just like the people here,

124
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.780
they're just growing up in this fucking insane warzone chaos,

125
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.220
cannibal environment.

126
00:06:55.221 --> 00:07:00.221
With fucking war lords and guns in little kid's hands and they're just shooting

127
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.470
people and you know,
they get used to that though,
man.

128
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.680
You get used to that and it's very difficult to turn that into this.

129
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.640
The key is to never let this become that because if it does become that,

130
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.870
then that becomes the norm.

131
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.340
It would take hundreds of years to turn library around.
Yes.
Disease.

132
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.721
You're not going to go on there,

133
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:21.020
whatever gene and just we're going to stop [inaudible] certainly not going to go

134
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:24.920
in there with boxes or rice and fix everything and you have to fix these people

135
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:26.700
as human beings.
You have to the,

136
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:30.820
the influence of all these people who have experienced murder,
I mean that,
that,

137
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:34.100
that's just through,
it permeates through the entire culture.

138
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.210
All these people have experienced horrific murders in their lives.

139
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.250
When you have a whole culture like that and you have this guy,
um,

140
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.310
general butt naked,
you ever heard of that?

141
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.340
That guy's story sounds from Liberia general buck naked used to take off all his

142
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:54.000
clothes and fucking fight naked and go shoot naked.
And he would find a,

143
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.340
a,

144
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.100
an innocent child of the enemy and then they would kill it and eat parts of its

145
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:02.600
body and drink.
It's blood.
What an asshole.
No bullshit.
Okay.
And this guy,

146
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.680
you know,
this guy was just running through,
you know,
these,

147
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.850
these countries or these,

148
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.230
these territories having these fucking horrific wars and they all saw this shit

149
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:15.620
and everybody's seen like terrible,
terrible things happen in Liberia.

150
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.510
And if you try to take that guy who tried to take any of those people and try to

151
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.450
turn them around and make them like a normal,
everyday person,

152
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.300
it's virtually impossible.
The guy shoots people fucking naked.
You know,

153
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.870
he's got a 12 it's Becky's black,
he's running down the street,

154
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.470
shooting other fucking people in.
And you know,
you can't,
I mean,
terrifying story.

155
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.010
He grew up in this different environment.
These people cannibals,

156
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.990
those people fucking Adam and they're used to it,
man.
And the,

157
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:41.330
this guy's become like a crusade Christian.

158
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:43.970
It's really kind of crazy cause he's still out,
you know.
I mean,

159
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.983
even though everyone,
Amy,

160
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.090
he admits to all these crimes and all the shit that he's done,

161
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.910
he's still just like kind of walking around and everybody's like,
Whoa,
shoot.

162
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.330
We like lock this guy up.
He eight babies.
Right.
And he's,

163
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.380
there's video of him talking about eating babies,

164
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.800
<v 1>the cannibalism that's done,
they're like that.
That type of,</v>

165
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.890
is the capitalism done for some of,

166
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.760
it's the hunger and the other part of this to kill the spirit so you can't get

167
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.060
that motherfucker.
Yeah,
there's a lot of that.
The whole Patois of it to just,

168
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:10.480
there's a lot of that.
You just don't want to,

169
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:12.840
I'm going to kill Brian and he just fucking ear.

170
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.650
So he never did come back to getting the ever again.
That's part of it.
You know,

171
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.370
just going back,
he's an eel is motherfucker,
you know what I'm saying?

172
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:20.440
She shows a certain amount of,
yeah.

173
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.660
<v 2>Ferocity,
you know,
certain amount of ferocity.</v>

174
00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:26.230
You want to kill someone and eat and eat them.
That's,
yeah.
I mean it's just,

175
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.651
I mean,

176
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:30.610
what they're doing is they're participating in the most ferocious war zone in

177
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:34.500
the world.
And in this war zone in Africa,
man did some of the,

178
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:36.280
the fucking civil rights violations,

179
00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:39.070
some of the horrible things that happened there when you read about,

180
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:41.230
I think they called them the Hutus and the Tutsis.

181
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.190
They say this to these two warring tribes that have been at after each other

182
00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:45.850
forever.

183
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.500
They participate in machete attacks where they go into villages while everyone's

184
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:54.640
asleep and they hack them to death with machetes.
I mean,
dude,

185
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.800
there's some crazy apocalyptic shit going down an African man and it's been

186
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:04.180
going down in 2000 fucking mother.
The problem is it's already happened.

187
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:09.040
It's too late.
It's like it's,
the culture is so fucked up.
Everything so crazy.

188
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:12.130
It's like,
how do you stop it from ever getting to that spot?

189
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.780
That's what we've got to make sure and every little fucking creep of corruption,

190
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.340
every little grip that we lose every little time that something fucking gets

191
00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:26.020
away.
Every time did the corruption gets worse and worse.
We get closer to that.

192
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.690
That's,
that's the ultimate,
the ultimate end of the,
the,
the horrible,
you know,

193
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.400
attitudes and ideas of society is it eventually society degrades to some fucking

194
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:39.190
crazy,
mad max type situation.
You know?

195
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:43.330
And that's why that's such an appealing theme in movies because we know that,

196
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.800
you know,
everybody's just got to keep it together.

197
00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:48.670
So that just doesn't happen because this is a real possibility.
Women taste them.

198
00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:52.920
I dunno about Mad Max.
I seen that fucking movie with Denzel Washington of the,

199
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.720
I had button.
Oh Eli Bugatti,

200
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.700
<v 1>the worst fucking greasy shit.
I watch 15 minutes of that Denzel,</v>

201
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.640
you shot your low with man on fire.
Thank fucking God does that.
Whatever.

202
00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:06.280
I don't even like those movies.
It don't make no sense to me.

203
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.870
Road Warrior was good.
I liked,

204
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.470
I could see fight for gas and stabbing motherfuckers on the one on one that I

205
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:15.100
don't mind killing somebody on the four oh five that cuts you off in a fucking

206
00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:19.090
bad car and shit.
Get Brian to build me one of those helicopters and shit.

207
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.450
But that shit walking around and the baddest motherfucker with guns and knives

208
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.120
and they wouldn't do the,
it wasn't a blind too was I don't fucking need blind.

209
00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.380
He was horrible with the swords.

210
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.710
Get fucking blade to go in there and teach how to stab that mother fucker.

211
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.680
Blame is a bad ass mother fucker when he was in there with the source,

212
00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:38.350
by the way.
He's doing fine.
He's got you.
Was He in jail?

213
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.100
<v 2>Yeah,
he's,
he had a report.
I believe he's in jail where they have many.</v>

214
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:46.430
Anybody know where they have,
he got to pay your taxes,
ladies and gentlemen.

215
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.460
I don't give a fuck if you think it's a scam.
It seems like it is.
It seems like,

216
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:50.450
man,
this is the mom.

217
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:55.120
I'll get worked over what I have to pay 48% cause do all right.
Just throw in.

218
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:58.960
Everybody asked to throw in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's kind of corroborate.
Yeah.

219
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:01.120
We're not exactly sure where it all goes.
Yeah.

220
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.670
It's kind of crazy that you don't get to vote on where your money goes,

221
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.060
but throw the fucking money and you crazy assholes.

222
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.600
40% is what keeps this from turning into APP.
Yes.
Yes.

223
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.980
Always remember that.
That 48% and even then,
I mean people get hookers with it.

224
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:17.350
You know that Congress and they're getting their dick sucked them,
whatever.

225
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.720
But just put it behind you and pay your taxes because that sounds good.

226
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.920
Paper people don't concentrate on too is like as far as like government,

227
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.460
a big part of what government is providing jobs.

228
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.810
There's a lot of people that need jobs and if you're going to get that tax
money,

229
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.320
the best way to get that tax money is to make more government jobs,

230
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.500
make more an unnecessary jobs.
So you,
you give money to people now,

231
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.190
stuff about you better know about this Wesley Snipes.

232
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.820
Piss somebody off while he looks missed.

233
00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:47.740
Somebody can't not pay your taxes for like seven years.

234
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:50.920
When you're a huge movie star,
you can't.
That's terrible.

235
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.210
It's what happens after that.

236
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.970
The government doesn't want to put you in jail when you make those type of

237
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:59.650
Dukkha,
but they do.
If you've taken a stance,
his some crazy,

238
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.340
fuck them.
Sorry.
He wrote something on the letter,
he pulled the suck this Dick.

239
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.660
That's what they did.
Yes he did.
He did he go after big time.

240
00:13:08.661 --> 00:13:10.990
Do you know this happened or you just,
yes.
No,
this is a true story.

241
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.130
Suck my dick like something.
When he made,

242
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.180
he didn't think he had to pay to pull the load.

243
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.680
He may like in England or something.
Whoa.
It's something stupid.
I gotta pay it.

244
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.830
<v 1>Listen,
listen,
let me tell you,
I didn't pay taxes for a,</v>

245
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.990
after 91 I got divorced and I became a comic and that was my point was to become

246
00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:31.680
a fucking outlaw.
So I didn't want to pay taxes.
Now with sketch shit,

247
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.950
I didn't pay taxes from 91 the 2004 I walked in that building

248
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
<v 2>when you said that outlaw,
if we were on the ball,
we would have had so clinics,</v>

249
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.840
<v 1>movie sound playing in the back.
Oh No,
no,
no,
you don't.
When you,</v>

250
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.960
when I first read the Lenny Bruce Book and I liked that whole Patois,

251
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.790
to me it seemed like he disappeared.

252
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.150
He was a comic that disappeared and I liked that idea.
You just disappeared,

253
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.730
like used to say he's gone.
You don't know where he is.

254
00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:58.940
We can't get ahold of him and I always liked that.
So I stopped paying taxes.

255
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.330
I wouldn't make any money those years.
I think it was one year I made money.

256
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.360
One of them,
one went down there.
The government was very nice to me.

257
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:08.440
They gave me a payment plan.
They took the 10 years.
I didn't pay him,

258
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.230
said don't worry about it all.

259
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:12.290
You got to go back and seven years and not till today.

260
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:16.850
I pay him monthly juice every month.
How much you owe?
I owed a after everything,

261
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.440
I think I got them for 8,000

262
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.690
<v 2>I knew a lot of comics and had problems with taxes in Boston because in Boston</v>

263
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:23.800
they got paid in cash,

264
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.900
so a lot of guys for years they just lived high on the hog and it never did

265
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:32.320
anything about it and they just figured out out they'll come get you on the door

266
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.240
eventually.
I know so many comments.

267
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.050
They always knock on the door when you win the lottery and they were making good

268
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:42.200
money.
There was a time I wasn't at that level,
but the,
the,
the,
uh,
when,

269
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:45.160
when I was coming up like right as I was coming up,
when I was like,

270
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.660
just barely starting to get paid work,
the headliners in town could do it.

271
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:52.790
There's a next comedy stop.
They would do,
I swear to God,

272
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.260
they would do five shows at night,
man.

273
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.420
They would go from one room to the other room.

274
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.540
They had two rooms downstairs and one room upstairs and was shuffled people in

275
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.060
all night and the fucking shows would be packed.

276
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.850
And these guys were making crazy money and it was all cash.

277
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.120
They were all just raking in the cash and they just never put it aside.

278
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.190
They never fucking put those taxes aside.

279
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:12.590
They just spent what they had and they just,
you know,

280
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.290
just didn't do anything about it.
And then before,
you know what,
they were fucked,

281
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.030
you know,
they all hundred thousand dollars or something crazy.
Oh,

282
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.710
they send you a bill that said,
oh,
they said,

283
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.090
make your head go out in the fucking room.
You don't realize,
man,

284
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:27.260
are you make a reality you a hundred grand,
a hundred grand,
you know,

285
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.160
a few years in a row,
like a lot of these guys who are making you all,

286
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.730
lot of you a lot of money.
That's when you start working for yourself.

287
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.120
You really start noticing like what,
what taxes really are.
You're like,
wow,

288
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.130
what a giant chunk.
But if I would pay it willingly,

289
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.383
happily,

290
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.050
if I thought that we were all working in the right direction and then everybody

291
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:51.110
was trying to clean the world up and make people nicer and you know,

292
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.190
and stop all the Douche Dennis and you know,

293
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:56.180
and clean out all our fucked up laws and I'll pay it all,

294
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.430
fix the streets if you're doing the right thing with it,

295
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:03.110
I'd be more than happy to give up half my money.
I don't trust you fucking cunts.

296
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.281
That's the problem.

297
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:07.640
You can't trust him to people that want to be in positions of power should never

298
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:10.790
be in positions of power.
Anybody who wants to be the president,

299
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.310
why the fuck is wrong with you?

300
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:18.110
You want to run everything really 50,000 a year and you got kids,

301
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.380
you got kids.
Is that what the president makes to 15 years?
I mean,
I guess the,

302
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:27.200
I get the idea of on paper something,
it's five,
I think it's 500 maybe less.

303
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:29.510
I don't know.
Brock lesson,
they got half of the efficacy of the beat.

304
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.970
He got 200,000 he got,
well he got 200,000 on paper yet we'll do everything.

305
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:39.500
Sort of has like paper view deals and when it said 200,000 on paper,
yeah.

306
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:41.290
I don't know how they work.
The pay scales.

307
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.430
<v 1>Very tricky.
Right?
They do it.
And I gotta tell you some,</v>

308
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.220
well we came here today because you always say to me every fucking time you can

309
00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:49.920
be,
you always have a fucking story.

310
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.750
<v 2>No,
you get them from,
I don't know where you get these stores credible.</v>

311
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:55.300
I've known you my whole life and you keep coming up with new stories.

312
00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:55.810
We came in Lindt

313
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.520
<v 1>tonight and I seen your family in.
I was really nice to see him.</v>

314
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.760
I seen your wife and it was funny the first time I met your wife,

315
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.660
we met in Vegas at the Riviera and we were sitting there,
great time.

316
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.790
You know what's coming and some chick,

317
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.330
it kept talking to us and then she was really annoying and it turned out to be a

318
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.230
guy that had become a chick and was part of that theater group and next to the

319
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.680
dirty show where we're going to take their clothes off.
She showed us,

320
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.400
she showed us,
but back me on that.
She was beautiful.
She looked good.

321
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:26.480
She looked like cooking town and then they'd Suda because all she got fired

322
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:28.910
because they found that she was a man before that.

323
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:32.380
And then she tried to sue the Riviera or whoever it was and there was one point

324
00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:36.110
at night where I go,
you know I,
at that time I was really crazy.
I had no blow.

325
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:37.460
And I'm like,
come on,
show me your monkey.

326
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.110
And she showed me and Joe and her pussy and just had a whole board like they

327
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:46.940
took where her dick was cut it off and took a board drill and took that piece of

328
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:47.241
me that,

329
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:51.300
and then they took artificial turf and they put it around his whole and it had

330
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:54.020
no clip to it.
Like the Clinton,
you can see with stitch time.

331
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.730
And here's the funny thing,
like I thought about this,

332
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.790
I took it to my room afterwards to get high with it.
And you know what?

333
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.020
If I would've done coke and drink,

334
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:04.400
I would have had to suck my dick just out of general purpose for the story.

335
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.160
Cause she looked great guys.
She knew that Trans Youth,
he was good.

336
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:11.460
The best description for you say it looked like a bat with its mouth he had with

337
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:15.520
his mouth open.
It look like this fucking you should is this.

338
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.180
She went back to your hotel room now after we were all hanging out,

339
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.550
there was a bunch of comics hanging out.
All right.
Somebody said,

340
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:25.290
do you have weed or whatever?
And it was me,
the guy from [inaudible].
Hey,

341
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.230
what's that?
What's that kid's name and that he was with us that night.

342
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.560
He was big.
One is a snuggler he'd show.
No,
he did that.

343
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.600
He was the Riviera has a couple of different rooms and it was me and you and the

344
00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:39.360
dirty room.
And the big room was that kid that it was good friends with Harris.

345
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:44.110
Pete.
He lived in Montana and he did the rich niner.
Which shiner?

346
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.840
Shiner?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You're not talking about southern black children.
No,

347
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:53.520
no,
no.
Pub.
Which hall?
Rich Hall.
Yes.
And then I remember we were sitting there.

348
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.720
You laugh and we're both very funny guy and challenge.
Yeah.
Nobody had weed.

349
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:01.410
And I go unit,
the girl goes,
obviously she had weed.
You know,

350
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.930
she's currently currently smoking in the fucking hotel.

351
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.560
These mother fuckers can't do nothing to me.
You know,
I'm suing him and me,

352
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:11.370
her and rich hall went up to the room and I remember all of his smoking dope.

353
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.410
And I'm looking at this chicken shit.
If I had coke,

354
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.750
they said both of your destination.

355
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.520
<v 2>I watch this show and I don't remember what it was.</v>

356
00:19:18.521 --> 00:19:20.230
It was some sort of a documentary,

357
00:19:20.231 --> 00:19:25.150
but I remember being really high and then I stumbled upon it and the show was,

358
00:19:25.151 --> 00:19:27.790
it was all these drag queens,

359
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.270
like a beauty contest for drag queens and Vegas.

360
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.730
It was all transsexuals,
like a full transsexual beauty show.
I was like,
wow,

361
00:19:36.731 --> 00:19:41.620
this is the strangest,
it's fantasy ever.
These guys,

362
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:45.280
a lot of it.
It was like some weird fantasy thing like this guy had.

363
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.530
He was a fucking man bro.

364
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.250
It is big manly ass face and manly fucking shoulders.

365
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:56.430
He's taken hormone shots and he's waltzing around on this stage like a ballerina

366
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.670
and I'm like,
this is the craziest Shit I've ever seen in my life.

367
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.450
This guy wants to be a woman so much.
He chopped his cock off.

368
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.800
He's willing to go through hormonal replacements.
You know where they,

369
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.810
they make you actually grow tits.

370
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.080
<v 1>I said it's like really?
Like lot of people do that more than you would think.</v>

371
00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:17.500
That hormonal thing,
like there's tons of people that do that.

372
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.720
That'd be kind of a different sex.
Yeah.
I want to be a boy.

373
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.740
That's a report the other day on it.
Like how many people are doing that?
Yeah,

374
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.140
chick.
Oh,
she looks a little like Ralphie may just like Ralph in Maine.

375
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.480
She still looks just like Ralph.
It's hysterical.
I met her once,

376
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.350
I met her once in the Sonny and Cher show and she would,

377
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.980
although she was pleasant,
she had a very strange energy.
Sonny,

378
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.660
not Sonny and Cher show Donny and Marie.
Shiny Marines.
Did I say Sonny and Cher?

379
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.570
That's funny.
I was thinking about that because of her,
her uh,
yeah,

380
00:20:46.571 --> 00:20:48.010
I was on the share show where I was

381
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.870
<v 2>one,
but uh,
no.
Um,
Donny and Marie.
No,
no.
How I got those two confused.</v>

382
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.990
But uh,
she was on it and uh,
I was on,
it was me and Dave Foley and,

383
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.650
and I remember,
you know,
she,
her saying hi,

384
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.240
but there's been this weird thing like I did something,
you know,

385
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.540
you ever meet somebody and they look at you like you did something all the time.

386
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.600
You're like,
I didn't do anything.
What the fuck did I do?
Like a,

387
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.070
like a distance go down.
Yeah.
I mean this one w I mean,

388
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:17.980
I was not even a notorious person and I hadn't done anything.
I was just,

389
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.660
just an actor,
just fucking there to promote her sitcom.
That's it.

390
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.080
But there was this weirdness,
you know,
and it made me nothing.

391
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:30.220
It might be my own personal insecurities.
It could be,
but it could be that she's,

392
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.330
this bitch is crazy.
And when it goes from there to,
I don't think I'm a woman,

393
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:36.400
I'm a man and I need to,
oh,
okay,

394
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.660
well now I understand what that look was all about.
Hey,

395
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.310
let me ask you something crazy on us.
Go Online,
I don't know,
10 15 years ago,

396
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.880
they did a special on one of those 2020s about where people go for that.

397
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.630
For what surgery?
The sex change.

398
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.850
The biggest place is a place in Colorado and the doctor that doesn't,

399
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.630
southern Colorado,
you got to look this up.
I don't know the whole particularly,

400
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.500
but the guy who does it only does it on the weekends.
Oh Geez.

401
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.140
Because during the week he's like a farmer.
What?

402
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.620
And on the weekends he does the trend sexual,
my God,
I've seen you see this,

403
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.630
saw that particularly operations in like a fucking a motel room like an office.

404
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.020
Fucking crazy that you would let another guy cut your dick off and slit you all

405
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.760
in a hometown in Colorado.
I figured for that.

406
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:28.240
You either go like Israel or Hong Kong or with some smart people.

407
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:28.990
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.700
But you're going to go let a farmer fucking Dick off and Tuck it in and what is

409
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:36.580
this guy have like a good reputation.
You haven't seen this.

410
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:40.690
Maybe it's just a bad man blocker works.
I know he will fucking solid.

411
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.290
Oh my God.
He was booked solid.
You had to make,
but it's a process.

412
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:47.650
You have to go to psychology and pills.
It's not just,

413
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.970
I want to get my dick cut off.

414
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:52.570
I could do it in six months and share as you imagine the weirdness that you

415
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:55.960
would feel if a guy had remorse that you conked cut his cock off.
He's like,

416
00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:59.990
can you go back and fix it?
Like,
Whoa,
no,
we can't.
No,
we can't.

417
00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:04.530
We can't do those tools.
You can't be personally uracil wraps on.
It's a wrap.

418
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.470
So vulgar a check.
Now there's a lot of checks go through life as a chick.

419
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.390
Is Leather made out of animal skin?
Like is it animal skin?
Straight animal skin.

420
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.410
And you can live off eating skin for some time.
Right?
I don't know.

421
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.590
That's a good question.
I don't know if there's any nutrition in leather.
I mean,

422
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:23.620
I guess there probably be some really crude protein and fiber.

423
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:25.690
I mean like you could eat chicken skin and live on,

424
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.210
I think it's a difference in the way it's processed.

425
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.260
The points that when a lead becomes leather,
I don't know someone out there.

426
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:34.120
I'll answer this question.

427
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.190
I'm always thinking like if you know you're really poor,

428
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:38.780
you could probably eat shit.
Your shoes,
if they're leather shorts.

429
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.060
I think they did that in depression.
I think that was like a,
you know,

430
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.700
like a common story.
Yeah.
We thought that was just like same.

431
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.980
You're the fucking shoes,
rice and shit.

432
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:54.010
But they don't on what the fuck are you packing the depression,

433
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:58.920
man,
that must've been fucking crazy.
1920s they're all walking around,
you know,

434
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.440
shoes,
shoes and shit.

435
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.460
Was it the 20s it was that the depression was one was depression.
Great.

436
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:06.920
Thirties thirties and then you just gotta hunt through.

437
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:10.700
Cats eat possums and there's creative ways to cook a fucking rabbit.

438
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.330
You'll learn how to,
how to do it.
You know,

439
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.850
going to the c Charlie Chaplin tonight.
I'm bringing two boots.
Yeah,
big time.

440
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:21.851
1929 in the lasted until the late 1930s or early forties wow.

441
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.590
11 g shit was 11 years.
Oh my God.
That's a lot man.

442
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:31.970
Famous footwear where it had been banking to.
That's scary as fuck man.

443
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:35.170
When you hear shit like that.
A little pressure right now.

444
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.710
The title of it,
the Great Depression.
That shit's depressing,
man.

445
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.500
You're fucking bumming me out.
Yeah.

446
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.590
Why couldn't they could pick a better name for it?
Like the super happy time.

447
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.200
Economic challenge down period.
You know,
call it the economic down.

448
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.380
Everybody's broke,
but what happened?
A good time?
You know,

449
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.670
suppression is a fucking terrible word.
That's just gray film.
That's why I see,

450
00:24:54.671 --> 00:24:59.450
I see black and white movies with crying and blood and suicides.
Yeah.

451
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.450
Did you see that fucking guy tried to commit suicide in the Roman?

452
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.490
I think it was Roman parliament or stuff like that.

453
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.600
The Guy Fucking Swan dives in the middle of this.
Um,
he's in the middle of this,

454
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.650
uh,
well,
you know,

455
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.870
this assembly room and he gets on top of this balcony and fucking jumps and he

456
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:18.620
lives.
Wow.
Cause he only felt like 30 feet.
He falls in,

457
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:23.270
slams into these chairs and gets fucked up.
I mean,
he gets fucked up dude,

458
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.250
and he doesn't even try to catch himself,

459
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:26.900
is trying to commit suicide while he's doing it.

460
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:29.650
He just lived when I was a kid that got at the bar,
I hung out with,

461
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.290
he tried to kill himself.
His name was Johnny Reid.
He jumped off like a building,

462
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:36.660
a land and the construction dumpster in lived.
Oh my goodness.
Heads the,

463
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.190
he would fuck.
He was just,
he was just retired one day.
I showed them my Dick.

464
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.840
Well that was like 18.
I put it on the chair next to him.

465
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.420
I tapped him on the show and he goes,
wow.

466
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.570
And that was the end that I had never talked to me again.
Johnny read.

467
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.850
It was around the bathroom.
It was a Romanian parliament.
Sorry.
Sup Dog.

468
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.260
Brian.
Big Pimpin over the holidays looking at you get,

469
00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:59.360
you should see it slinging thing and get my shit.
It's really crazy.
The guy says,

470
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.210
we kit you killed our future and then fucking swan dives.

471
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.430
It's nowhere near high enough to kill him.

472
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.680
I don't know what the fuck he was thinking.
Just attention.
You can live.

473
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.700
Imagine trying to keep the code commits suicide and fucking up and you've got to

474
00:26:10.701 --> 00:26:12.800
be around your friends and you shouldn't do you want to see this guy?

475
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.020
I want to see that fucking Momo jumps off a building and lives.

476
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.530
It should be shot and fucking hunk.

477
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.010
They should arrest You for felony stupid when you do that shit.
That's hilarious.

478
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:26.120
How committing suicide is against the law.
Is it?
Sure an American too?
Of course.

479
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.140
What happens to you if you commit suicide?
New Fan helps somebody either.
I mean,

480
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.420
look at that Kevorkian.
You know,
people will want to die.
You can't help them,

481
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.820
can help them kill themselves even if they're dying.

482
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:36.680
And even if they're in horrible,
horrible pain,

483
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:39.110
you know a lot to help them kill themselves.
That's ridiculous.

484
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.440
There's a certain point in time when people are not going to come back.
You know,

485
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.110
there's a certain point in time when someone's Inter

486
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.740
<v 1>terrible,
terrible agony.
Help them,
you know,</v>

487
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:48.750
give him some shit so they don't have to fucking feel that.

488
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.430
Why is that so hard to do?
Why?
How can you lock someone up for that?
You know,

489
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.790
but then you find out about Kevorkian did,
he was really kind of a creepy fuck.

490
00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.040
He used to draw the like these horrible,

491
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.090
horrible artwork like about murderers and shit and really like something like

492
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.960
really morose about but of by the Joe Rogan,

494
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.860
Or watching a movie like call you up and say,

495
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.490
I don't want to live in the moment.
Come up my ass.
I'm going to kill myself.

496
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.050
You would say really?
Come on.
Uh Oh.

I give my best writing done late at night.
You know,
I just can,

507
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.810
I can think better when the world's asleep.
You know,

508
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.140
there's just something about,
I can go deeper into my head,
you know,

509
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.570
I go the opposite way.
I gotta go to sleep and got up early.
Do you?
Yeah.

510
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.770
I like to get up at three like Monday.

I got up at like three 30 wrote for a little while.

512
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.930
I think my craziest shit at night,

They got to go back to bed.

516
00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:26.370

Now after you leave to the mass,

Can I drive back to you?

523
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.090
Oh fuck yeah.

Ryan's,
I know you're a hundred percent sober.

524
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.600
You'll feel so relaxed.

525
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.980
When I go to acupuncture and I leave acupuncture on Tuesdays and Thursdays that

526
00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:59.400
not,
I don't plan nothing cause I don't mislead.
Like,
this is why I say it.
Guy.

527
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:03.390
I know how you love to get blasted.
You like to get high as fuck.

528
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.870
Just blackened by why you're there.
You're eating cookies and shit.

529
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:09.270
I've had conversations with you.
It's this.

530
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.580
This is a typical conversation with Joey like any,

531
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:15.240
any given 11:00 PM evening dog tall.

532
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.000
I just say this banana bread fucked up.

533
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.960
Fucked up.
I hide from my wife.

534
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.860
Oh you fuck clone your fucking door Joe Rogan.
Are you fucking funding given me?

535
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.350
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding?
No fucking blasted.

536
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.890
Sometimes you would love an isolation tank man because when you get that blasted

537
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.080
and then you climb in the tank,
you go on these journeys man.

538
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:42.160
It's like the most insane amusement park

539
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.800
<v 4>ride ever and you can go on these journeys in your own mind like your,
your go.</v>

540
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.920
You go on these fantastic adventures when you're super big special,

541
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:54.970
have you eat it?
Something about eating it and getting the tank.
Holy Shit.

542
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.830
I have hallucinations man.

543
00:29:56.831 --> 00:30:00.250
I see like a lot of like an animated things.

544
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.840
A lot of like weird cartoons play out a lot of like weird fucking,

545
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:08.710
I mean really,
but really repeated shit like it repeats itself.

546
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:12.880
The same sort of themes over and over again and a lot of it is like animated

547
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:13.571
characters.

548
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:18.160
It's almost like some crazy fucking Gonzo dimension that you can peer into when

549
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:22.210
you're super high.
When you're super,
super hot here.
What do we build?

550
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.880
Second type for southwest working for NASA.
You don't even know.

551
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.270
That's a good jacket.
Then Brian gave it to me for Christmas.
What'd you get?

552
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.380
I got to wear it out of respect for retro store in Studio City that just like an

553
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:39.160
old retro Phillip Clothing store plus what I want to say.

554
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.240
Silly things have so much more comfortable saying silly things like this.

555
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.870
You know?
I think we should do a whole podcast where we just have goggles on.

556
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.790
We would just talk,
talking crazy shit.

557
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.880
I must lost an eye the other day from my cat by the way.

558
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.450
A mother fucker hats were chasing each other.
I was laying on couch.

559
00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.730
Cat jumps down and claw hits me quarter of [inaudible] other corner of eye and

560
00:31:00.731 --> 00:31:05.320
right below hitting my eyelid and stuff like that.

561
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:05.880
And uh,

562
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.750
just like almost ripped like it was your cat's account watch your cat might jump

563
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:13.960
on you.
He was getting chased by the other cat and man,
you catch it.

564
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:16.070
Never think that you can jump on your face.
Right.

565
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.040
I think it was like a more of a fall jump.

566
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.200
You got to learn how to smack your cat in the hat,
dude.

567
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:22.960
It was so you got to make sure that your cat is treating you like a bitch.

568
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:26.830
Your cat is saying I can,
don't have to run on your shoulder and be considerate.

569
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.260
I'll run on your fucking head.
Yeah.

570
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.810
Cause my comfort is more important to me than you.
Yeah.
Your cat punk to you bro.

571
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.300
And that's bullshit.
That's crazy.
Out of nowhere.

572
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:37.420
I almost got you do you got to grab your cat by the back of the neck.

573
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.090
You got to grab your cat by the back of the neck and look at them in the eye and

574
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:44.500
say,
listen,
hooker,
the shinning and a fly.
Okay,
I'm the one who come to the food.

575
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.030
I'm the one who comes to the massages.

576
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.270
You don't call my fucking eyes out shit head and then put them down.

577
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:52.350
I'll never do it again.
Make sure you've got the goggles on when you say that.

578
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.550
Say fucking scratch you again.
You,

579
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.150
he's just paying me back from a Rodeo cat videos I've been doing with them.

580
00:31:58.151 --> 00:31:58.691
Have you seen that?

581
00:31:58.691 --> 00:32:01.720
And they have this thing where he sits on the back of the chair and I just start

582
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:02.870
shaking it and he,

583
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:06.940
he just like holds on as tight as he can and until he falls off.
But he loves it.

584
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:09.520
He just jumps back up and he's like,
do it again.
Do it again.

585
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.240
So it's like a game you guys.
Yeah,
it's like earthquake.
Yeah.

586
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.060
You have a little agreements with cats like games that you'll play with them.

587
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.670
Right?
I have one cat,
like I,

588
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.710
there's an agreement when I get her on her back and I shake her stomach,

589
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:23.710
then she's a lot of bite me and kick me and then we're playing.

590
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.800
They were playing like bite me and kicked me.
Yeah.
You know,

591
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.040
it's like we know we both know what we're doing,
you know?

592
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.730
She doesn't really bite me hard and she was really kicked me hard and we're just

593
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:34.240
like,
oh,
why are you a Yoda?
You know?
It's weird.
You know what I mean?

594
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:37.120
You get like little agreements with cats,
you know?
Like when,

595
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.950
when it's time to play and dogs too.
Yeah,
yeah.

596
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.870
<v 1>They know like,
you know,
like Rararara,
they know we're playing now,</v>

597
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.700
oh here we're going to do this thing that we always do.

598
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:50.210
Like they didn't even know a word of English.
They have no idea how to talk,

599
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.320
but yet they understand how fucking amazing or pets.
I love it.

600
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.470
How fucking amazing.
Right?
If you take care of him,
man,
they're great.

601
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:01.010
If you love them and take care of them,
love you pat.
And it's just amazing.

602
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:01.461
That's what,

603
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:05.160
that's the most and chief excitement I get at three in the morning because my

604
00:33:05.161 --> 00:33:07.790
Kurt,
my cats there so alerted three in the morning,

605
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.430
they're out and I get to feel their nocturnal.
Right.

606
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.720
I could see them fucking around and how they get,

607
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.250
and I get up and I'd like the pope but a fucking labeled with the animals.

608
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.100
I walk my wife to the train at seven I walk back,

609
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:23.480
I stopped by the two cats in the corner,
a biggie and the,
and uh,
Choco.

610
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.290
And then these two old ladies have a dog and I fucking walk around the block.

611
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.630
Do you really walk it down man?
Yeah,
cause I'd always loved,
Oh,
I fucked.

612
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.770
I love animals.
But every time I come over my house,

613
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:36.920
Joey's more excited to see my dogs than me.
Oh my God.
It's Ah,

614
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:38.750
it's something they give you.

615
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:40.730
And then once you have that understanding with them,

616
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:45.740
even the [inaudible] visit the dog,
I walk walks around with a muzzle thing.

617
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.400
Yeah.
And I just went up there one day,
fuck you and your muzzle bitch.

618
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:54.350
You don't intimidate me,
bite me.
Have a bit before and she's like,

619
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.950
you could see it.
She's like one of those shirts.
Shepard mixes.

620
00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.590
The once in a while ago,
the head with a hammer when their youngest son,

621
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:03.350
they'll come back.
Most shepherds,
those fucking Nazi dogs,

622
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.400
those dogs can be very big.
This dog,
she even says it,
the only even says to me,

623
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.160
she goes,
I can't understand what you have with her.
I'm a criminal.

624
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.420
I know these fucking dogs.
I'm an expert.
I'm fucking dog.

625
00:34:12.421 --> 00:34:15.710
And that was a burglar Jack.
You got to know dogs,
you know,
and uh,

626
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.430
I have no love them and stand your ground.
I have no fear of dogs.

627
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:22.300
I had a dog bite me in the face.
I had a dog,
Paul,
me,

628
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.600
I'd been bit all over my fucking body.
I have no fear of dogs.

629
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.260
I've been better

630
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.900
<v 3>feral dog.
I got bit by a dog.
Did you really?
Yeah.
This,
uh,</v>

631
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:36.280
I went over to this person's house that have two dogs that,
that kind of,
they,

632
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.330
they stay outside to guard the house.
You know,

633
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:40.790
like there's a fence going around the whole entire house.
But they're,
I mean,

634
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:43.220
they're there,
they're dogs that their family dog,

635
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:47.630
but they live outside for the majority of the time.
And this dog was barking.

636
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.140
Are they?
They're pretty big.
And about your size of your well,
no,
not,
not like,
uh,

637
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.990
I don't know.
70 pounds.
Yes.
Yeah.
Big Dog.
Big Dog.
And uh,

638
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.840
it was one of the things where I was supposed to go around the back and I was

639
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:04.430
trying to go through the front and the dogs are barking.
I'm like,
Hey.
I'm like,

640
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.710
Oh,
I guess I'm not going to go through the front.
And then my friend calls me,

641
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:08.480
he goes,
no,
no,
go around back.
I'm like,
oh,
okay.

642
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.080
So go around back and he meets me at the gate,
but right when he opens the gate,

643
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:17.081
the dog just lunges at me and bites me right in the nipple and it hurt and it

644
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:20.000
was sore.
And then there was like a little,
you know,
bruising over there,

645
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:24.470
but thick jacket.
Yeah,
I had like a,
like a sweat shirt on or something like that.

646
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.730
But it hurt.
I mean,
it didn't puncture your skin really,

647
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:32.040
but it was all bruised the next day.
Oh,
what the fuck is wrong with this dog?

648
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.690
I mean,
then after a second he,
I was like,
hey,
that's fucked up dog.

649
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.040
Because the owner was right and

650
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.010
<v 1>the owner and you were communicating right and that dog didn't realize that</v>

651
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:44.260
you're a friend.
That's an idiot.
Yeah.
Dogs retarded.
Yeah.
But then like,

652
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.620
like a few seconds after I was in there,
the dog realize,
oh,

653
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:50.070
it's friends and then was nice.
Get them like a normal dog.
No,

654
00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:52.860
I was slick at pitch.
You heard it like it fucking hurts.

655
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.900
It's not cool.
It came out of nowhere.
I always think like your face,
man.

656
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.870
I always think like,
oh dog lunges at you.
You're,
you're going to be like,
Oh,

657
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:04.120
you know,
block it or something like,
no,
I was just like,
what the fuck?
Oh,

658
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.910
opposites.
That's the other side of pets,
man.
They are animals.
You and your cat,

659
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.480
your cat want to do attack you man.
You would be,
fuck yeah.
You know,

660
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:14.350
I had a feral cat for awhile.
Couldn't,

661
00:36:14.351 --> 00:36:17.750
and when they're mad they get crazy and they get nut either terrifying and there

662
00:36:17.751 --> 00:36:18.780
are little tiny things.

663
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.130
Tell you guys some it out to all your viewers at home in three or four years as

664
00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:28.100
a burglar,
I burglarize houses with pit bulls.
Doberman Pinscher,

665
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.930
one drum is shepherd,
the German shepherd.
Rip My Hand Open Brian,

666
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:33.360

Look at the squad with a Bob.
Why?

667
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:35.430
I went right through the fucking thing and then ripped the up.
Jesus,

668
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.840
the worst animal,
Everett and any drug burglary,

669
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.200
burglary I ever had was assigned these cat really friend's house.

670
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.970
I wouldn't go into the house.

671
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:47.820
I was outside with a gun because I wouldn't let him come down.

672
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:50.840
He wanted to come down.
All I could hear was this cat goal.

673
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.990
When he was attacking the shit out of them,
attack him.
He comes to the back lane,

674
00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:59.430
drove the jewelry off and the cat was on his head pulling this light till this

675
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.950
day,
that guy still has like a claw in his head.

676
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.270
The just rover over the skin grew over burglarized in that Colombian drug
dealer.

677
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:09.510
She was a Colombian chick and she would always go into a room and way the coke.

678
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.080
We didn't know why I didn't go.
I didn't know why.
I kept saying,

679
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:15.870
why don't you pull the room,
bring it out here.
She would always go on the rule.

680
00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.090
That's the reason why she had a cat that she couldn't live out.
Whoa.

681
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.700
Girl was always locked and I never seen the cap,

682
00:37:21.701 --> 00:37:24.840
but when we've tried to break into a house,
my buddy seen the fucking cat,

683
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.860
so it was an attack.
Siamese cat attacks I skinny,
one of those skinny,

684
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:31.980
ugly motherfuckers.
That game was on his head.

685
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.110
At one point he was looking over the balcony and he's like,

686
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:37.860
I'm coming down the cat.
Will I throw the coke down?
At least drawn the coke down.

687
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.390
The jewelry watched by watch.

688
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:44.810
The cat was on his head pulling upward and I'll never forget that he had the cut

689
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:49.580
bite snack trying to pull it off his fucking head and the cat had all four claws

690
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.270
into his head.
It was classic.

691
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.590
I remember going to the pawn shop to sell the jewelry and he had blood all over

692
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:58.800
his face.
And it's hard to kill a cat.
It's hard.
It was fucking hard.

693
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.460
This was worst animal attack I've ever seen.

694
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.970
And you think about how strong cancer and they're so small,
you know,

695
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:09.120
it's so scary.
They're so small.
Imagine like a big cat.

696
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.950
Imagine a big imagine getting jacked by a mountain lion.
What the fuck,
man,

697
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.360
you can't get one of those.
You would shit your pants if a fucking mountain like,

698
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:19.500
and they're so strong too.

699
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:23.040
That's what everybody says about until if they're going to fucking monsters that

700
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:25.020
power that everything is just too much.

701
00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.050
What a bunch of crazy assholes to keep them as pets.
You know,
there's this,

702
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.970
it's not that hard to get licenses for shit like that.
Like in Nevada,

703
00:38:32.971 --> 00:38:35.970
Mike Tyson had a bunch of shit.
He had like a in

704
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.110
<v 2>a lion I think in a bunch of shit like that.</v>

705
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.360
There was some dude who got arrested in a,
you know,
oh you didn't get arrested.

706
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:46.890
He died.
Excuse me.
He was in,
um,
ah,
thank you.

707
00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:51.891
Is in Harlem and he had a tiger and a crocodile and like a bunch of shit in his

708
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:57.640
apartment.
Dude had an apartment with a tiger in it.

709
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.120
Wow.
He had a tiger in a cage in his fucking apartment.

710
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.840
<v 3>Do you know about that fucking designer?
About that bus?</v>

711
00:39:06.841 --> 00:39:09.900
Recently in La there that bus with all the cats,

712
00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:14.240
there was like 240 plus 240 cats and like this woman had like one of those in

713
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.120
one house.
Storage,
storage,
storage,
uh,

714
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.000
like you know where your rent storage and it was still with cat with 240

715
00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:22.080
[inaudible] and 50 cats.

716
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.860
Half of them were like dead and she had like some kind of like sickness where

717
00:39:25.861 --> 00:39:30.060
she had to take care of all these cats.
Oh my God.
It's crazy.

718
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:31.770
It was in California like two weeks ago.

719
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.700
<v 2>So yeah,
right down the corner here.
Fucking Pomona,
one of those places,</v>

720
00:39:35.701 --> 00:39:39.000
240 fucking cats.
That's fucked up.

721
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.850
Is it ever going to be possible to fix people of that?

722
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.080
Is it ever going to be w are we ever going to have a society where there's no

723
00:39:49.081 --> 00:39:53.400
people who have 250 fucking cat's dying and shit all over themselves at a

724
00:39:53.401 --> 00:39:56.830
storage container now,
because that's the test.
Is it possible watch waters,

725
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.310
watch fucking mortars,
right?
But whatever.

726
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:00.990
What's the difference between them and you?

727
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.760
The best was the best episode of hoarders.
There's,

728
00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:06.750
when they pull something up and go,
oh,
what's this?

729
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.800
And they pull up like a dead cat lady goes,
that's what happened to kitty.

730
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.920
I'm like,
wait a second on cat disappeared in your fucking house four years ago.

731
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.680
You didn't smell it.
You didn't see it.
It's just,
Oh,
I mean,
you got to watch.

732
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.880
I don't watch it every day,
but if I was switching channels and hoarders is on,

733
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.330
I fucking watch.
Human beings have a horrendous smell when they're dying.
Oh,

734
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.680
please.
Oh,
he lives in an apartment building and this lady died.

735
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.360
She just died in the house.
The Old Lady.
And uh,
she was a fucking mean cunt too,

736
00:40:36.361 --> 00:40:40.500
by the way.
This old lady and uh,
nobody was happy,
happier than me.

737
00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:44.100
She like when she died,
she was creepy,
creepy old lady.
Anyway,
she,
uh,

738
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.470
she died and we were walking by her house or apartment and it just stuck.

739
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.740
The smell is so successful that goes in your nose,
that stays,

740
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:57.030
that goes into your throat.
It makes you,
it's worse than any other animal.
Smell.

741
00:40:57.031 --> 00:41:01.410
Dead.
I've smelled a bunch of dead animals.
There's nothing like a human humans.

742
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.550
We've got a very particular reason.
God,
from a block away,

743
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.240
funk ass from a block away smelled a dead human listening to her.

744
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.090
When I was a kid,
I was about eight or nine.
I was about eight or nine.

745
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:15.210
I used to live in two oh five west,
88th street during the week with the Jews.

746
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:18.090
Nice white people,
right,
right.
They Amsterdam where you boy lives.

747
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.200
But then in the summers I would go to 148 sheets to my godmother's house and

748
00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:23.130
there was two dimensions.

749
00:41:23.131 --> 00:41:26.920
The kids on 88th street wear nice kids that played wiffle ball and organize.

750
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.430
You went up to another 40 Asian at first.
Those motherfuckers at these,

751
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.090
you want to see a dead body.
And we'd go out to the George Washington bridge,

752
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.010
take our bikes to

753
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.830
<v 1>go see a body that we weren't going to report.
Holy Shit,</v>

754
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.250
we didn't report nothing in those days.
That body was Dan for fucking weeks.

755
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:43.230
Oh my God.
I remember being eight or nine.
Then we'll come on,
let's go.

756
00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:46.940
And we write out by,
come on the bottle.
Here we go,
fucking kids.

757
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:47.481
And all the sudden they,

758
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:50.630
you go and they put boards on top of them from a block away.

759
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:53.820
You could hear the fly,
the fly,

760
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.450
you could hear it makes the flies go fucking nuts.

761
00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.660
And then in [inaudible] 94 I had a buddy,
God bless his soul,

762
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:05.000
work on a dump and Lyndhurst New Jersey and he made like 50 grand a year,

763
00:42:05.001 --> 00:42:06.500
but he'd been in a hundred grand a year.

764
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.240
Every month somebody put envelopes in this fucking day because they don't
really,

765
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.070
they don't really break up the recyclables,
right.

766
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.580
They just dump them all into one.
That's what the mob was doing.

767
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.430
He was working at a dumpster is part of a city job and I'm in my way.

768
00:42:20.431 --> 00:42:22.370
I borrowed his car,
wants to do comedy,
he goes,
Doug,

769
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:26.990
you want to see a foot like a dead body?
And it was under rubble,
like garbage.

770
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:31.310
Just going into fucking that Elizabeth,
all that Shit Jersey with the garbages.

771
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:36.530
So as you come off that exit,
it smells like ass.
You just get used to it.

772
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:39.770
He was used to,
yeah.
He,
you know,
walk up to me,
go,
come on.

773
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:42.890
You want to see fucking a dead body.
You go out for miles.

774
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:44.550
They'd be ratchet on right in front of you.

775
00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:47.900
And he'd be talking to him like it was nothing.
I see a rat,
I shit my pants.

776
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:51.020
I'm spots where you drives you in New Jersey where it smells so bad.

777
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.770
How the fuck this be legal?
What are they doing?

778
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.640
What the fuck are you doing?
Everything smells like shit.

779
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.670
There's one thing with cows that happens with cows.

780
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.940
Have you ever been by a cow farm?
Yeah.
Yeah.

781
00:43:04.941 --> 00:43:07.980
When dairy farms and you know when there's a lot of cows,
man,
my,

782
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.080
my family used to live in Pennsylvania and they lived in Barre,

783
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.590
like out in like kind of abandoned in there and let the row

784
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.600
who else had,
there's a one dude who had a whole bunch of them,
got patty,

785
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.480
Patty and described Patty.
Um,
so,
uh,
you drive,

786
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.500
I would drive to go visit them and they had a pass through this whole area where

787
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.140
there was cows and fucking a,

788
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:33.160
it smelled bad for like a half an hour drive

789
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.850
<v 4>for a full half an hour has smelled like Egor up in that shit.</v>

790
00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:39.130
You start getting used to it,
but isn't that okay?

791
00:43:39.131 --> 00:43:40.480
I get that you would get used to it,

792
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:43.900
but aren't you taking something into your body when you're smelling that mean

793
00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:46.210
it's not as simple as you're just smelling it,
right?

794
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.930
You're smelling that there's particles in the air and you're breathing that in

795
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:53.770
as well.
If it's that insanely offensive to your nostrils.

796
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.540
Isn't that some sort of a warning that your body's not supposed to have that

797
00:43:57.541 --> 00:44:01.300
inside of it or it's some kind of natures way of trying to get you to produce

798
00:44:01.301 --> 00:44:05.140
smelling ass and so now you want to fuck cows or something.
You know what I mean?

799
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.000
I could smell the ass.

800
00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:10.690
You know how you're trying to trick you and now like animals when they trying to

801
00:44:10.691 --> 00:44:13.000
breathe,
they smell each other's ass and stuff like that.

802
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:17.130
Like dog smell each other's ass and like animals smell each other's butts.
Right?

803
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.380
Maybe there's some kind of weird hidden try it.
Nevermind

804
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.150
<v 1>you will you be talking to like,
fuck dude,
I tried to listen to you on that.</v>

805
00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:28.120
I tried to go with you and then talking to from the sense of like that movie

806
00:44:28.121 --> 00:44:31.330
where they showed them every hand.
I'm seeing that these particles,

807
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.280
you're smelling this just the effect you're going in your body in the past.

808
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:39.060
It's not just,
I mean it's a fine shit mist in the air is what it is.

809
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.270
I grew up by the Meadowlands.
That's why people look at me.

810
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.470
You should smoke from a humidifier bitch.

811
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.490
I'm putting the metal and the fuck you benefit by lights better for your lungs.

812
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.940
Bits.
I swam in the Hudson.
Oh,
humidity.
I slept the hug.

813
00:44:49.941 --> 00:44:52.350
Did she really swim in the Hudson on the Hudson when I was a kid.

814
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:54.240
You go all in at once or twice and he'd jump in.

815
00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.620
See a CEO that you fucking come up with a with a,
with an IOL on top of you,

816
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.470
you know,
and a foot bad.
His ideas.
Oh,
it's hard.

817
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:04.410
This is 20 years ago when there was a place towards under the bridge,

818
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:06.800
like nobody goes fish in that,
right?
No,
no.

819
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:10.290
He's a hilarious that that's just accepted.

820
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.770
It's accepted that there's going to be a certain amount of pollution and they

821
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:15.180
were just,
listen,
fuck this river.

822
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.930
We're just going to dump our shit in this river.

823
00:45:16.931 --> 00:45:19.560
There's seven fucking billion people live in this one.

824
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:21.990
Tiny island fucked a river.
You can't fish in the river.

825
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.650
It's accepted that that's plywood.
Fucking go in there,

826
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:27.300
but I'll tell you what's crazy in those days,

827
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.640
Puerto Ricans are coming from the Bronx on the weekends.

828
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.620
It must be someone who fishes in it.
No,

829
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:34.770
there are definitely people listen to people will fish,

830
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.170
but the Puerto Ricans would come down with a Volkswagen and take 90 people out

831
00:45:38.171 --> 00:45:41.910
there in the Congo drama the couch.
Have you ever drove by a paper mill before?

832
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.130
That Shit's disgusting.
That is the worst smell.
There's a whole association.

833
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:50.700
The Hudson River Fisherman's association sounds hot.

834
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.210
Is that Hudson River Strike Bass.
New York harbor.
Where's that?

835
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.320
I would fucking swim.
Drink that water.
Nothing.

836
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.780
Even that plane that landed fucking,
that's all rusty now.

837
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.810
That plane that will sell,
he landed them mother fuckers.

838
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.480
They tried to take it on a wheel.
Fell out that she'll eat.

839
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:10.140
Rice can be a skin fishing in New York harbor.
Is that a,
is that right there?

840
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.780
They fished down by the light.

841
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.140
By the village down there like all of abide by by they do.

842
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.170
They do by Wall Street.

843
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:19.720
That'd be fucking sick fucks that which fish out there by a,

844
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.790
we're going to statue of Liberty.

845
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:22.383
<v 5>Wow.</v>

846
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.940
<v 1>Very strange.
I would need any other,</v>

847
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:30.810
I did see my friend Mike asked at least one time,
get an email out of the Hudson.

848
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.280
It open and eat his fucking heart.
Something crazy.

849
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.410
It was like those emails look like little snakes,

850
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.920
but he ate an eel fucking one time and heels head.
Oh yeah,

851
00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:45.360
they got some serious fucking problems here.
Oh please.
PCPS.

852
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.970
Chemicals.
Discovered the other day talking about all the different,

853
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:52.760
this is like way back.
Listen Bro,
let me explain something to you.

854
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.180
You've got a bridge.
You've got the bridge,
you've got the bridge.

855
00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:00.200
You got a New York City Harlem and you got New Jersey,
northern New Jersey.

856
00:47:00.201 --> 00:47:03.160
You got that bridge.
Every day a cop pulls the kid over,

857
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.790
the kid grows and drugs out the window.

858
00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.040
If that's happened every day for 30 years,
that one is fucked.

859
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.100
That water is disgusting there with George Washington was there and he shot

860
00:47:13.101 --> 00:47:15.560
cannon balls at the Indians across the fucking don't.

861
00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:19.190
Doesn't the sewers empty out into that to the sewers,
empty out into the oceans.

862
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:24.170
What happens there?
When I was a kid,
we,
there was a Charles River.

863
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.610
It's in Boston and there was a branch of it was by my house and uh,

864
00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.190
we used to go there hanging out and we were walking

865
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.230
<v 2>across this little area and a,</v>

866
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.740
I saw something bubbling up in the water and I looked at it and I was like,

867
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:39.220
what the fuck is that?
It's like some,
it's like a broking,
something like a pipe.

868
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:42.490
Cause there's like a flow of water that's coming up and I see all these things

869
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:46.420
floating in it.
And then I saw a condom and then I realize what it is.

870
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:50.380
I saw lumps of Shit.
I'm like,
oh my God.
Like this is shit water.

871
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.700
They just pouring directly into the river.
It's coming out in a big flow.

872
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.540
Like I don't know if it was a broken pipe or is just how they dump it off.

873
00:47:58.541 --> 00:47:59.250
That's what they,

874
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.430
<v 1>I don't trust water available.</v>

875
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.120
First of all is this trust that shit in the bottle.
The bottom where all four.

876
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.460
Listen Bro,
we're all fucking bullshit.
What's that?

877
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.100
What's your buddy's Panatella did the best show ever?
Water?
Yeah,
about disorder.

878
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.510
Where it comes from.
San Antonio from some fucking guys are,

879
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:17.760
the people say comes from Alaska,

880
00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:21.650
but the best was when they went to Beverly hills to a water bar and they were in

881
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:25.690
there.
They would take water from a hose and giving it to these fucking Bobos in

882
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:30.540
Beverly Hills.
Oh my God.
This water's water.
Water bars.

883
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.760
And these idiots are like,
oh my God,
this water.

884
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:35.850
I could feel that nuttiness France bitch.

885
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.380
It goes into my hoes and fucking la.
That's been nuttiness from France.
You know,

886
00:48:40.381 --> 00:48:44.280
my wife is a big water filtered $300 every month.

887
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.570
I tried to prove a point.
I got a glass of water I filled in.

888
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:51.320
I left the cabinet for two days.
It was fucking green due days.

889
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.800
<v 3>Oh,
did I tell you what happened to me?
I had a water cooler.
One of those,</v>

890
00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:57.740
you know,
like hot,
cold water coolers with,
they chug jugs,

891
00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.100
had it for like three years,
you know,
never thought anything of it,
you know,

892
00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:05.410
just replaced it.
Every time I emptied whatever notice the other day,
uh,

893
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.880
it was headed like this green tint to it.
I'd like.

894
00:49:07.881 --> 00:49:10.750
The Sun was shining through the window at the right point and I was like,
wow,

895
00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.020
that looks a little green,
you know?

896
00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:14.660
And I poured it in a glass and looked at him like,
no,
it looks fine.

897
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.660
Then I went somewhere on the road with you,

898
00:49:17.661 --> 00:49:21.090
came back and it looked a little bit greener and I'm like,
why that is green now?

899
00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:24.650
I said,
I took it out,
looked inside the tank,
everything looked clean and stuff.

900
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.670
As I started to freak out,
it started tasting and smelling a little weird.

901
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:32.700
Finally I called the company up and I'm like,
you know what's going on here too?

902
00:49:32.701 --> 00:49:35.390
It seems like it's getting a little green by looking site and everything is
fine.

903
00:49:35.391 --> 00:49:38.270
They're like,
oh,
you have to clean those out like every three months.

904
00:49:38.271 --> 00:49:40.630
You know that,
right?
And I'm like,
Whoa,
I've had this for three years.

905
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.400
Never cleaned it out.
Once.
They're like,
they're like,
yeah,
take it apart.

906
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.750
So I took it apart.
Just green mold underneath.
The thing just has been,

907
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:52.080
I've been drinking swamp water for the last,
you go $15 a month.

908
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.570
And so then they're like,
they're like,
no,

909
00:49:53.571 --> 00:49:55.640
you must wash it out with bleach and all this crap.

910
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.910
So I fucking washed it out with Billy.
Yeah,

911
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.990
they like put put bleach in there and stuff.

912
00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:02.720
Like what is this product again when it's like a water cooler,

913
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:06.260
you know how like you would get the jugs like arrowhead water and put it on the,

914
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.100
on the thing that one of those things you have to clean.
Yes.

915
00:50:10.101 --> 00:50:11.660
You're supposed to clean that.
I'd never knew this.

916
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.240
I you're supposed to clean that thing out like every three to six months is what

917
00:50:14.241 --> 00:50:17.210
they told me.
And I've had mine for three years.
Yeah.

918
00:50:17.211 --> 00:50:21.590
They said like a cup of like a little tab of bleach and mix it with water,

919
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:22.910
run it through a couple times.

920
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.550
It started running it through a couple of times and whatever happened,

921
00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:28.400
like the bleeds,
somehow it started eating away at some of the metal.

922
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 4>So then I put another jug on.
I thought it was all cleaned out,</v>

923
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.710
pour my glass of wine or I looked down this time there was like all these little

924
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:36.560
black dots in there and I'm like,
what are all these black guys found out?

925
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:38.180
Like the bleach had like descended,

926
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:42.200
disintegrated something or I don't know what the mold disintegrated something

927
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:46.160
and now I was drinking like metal through the fucking thing out.
Now I'm like,

928
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:48.410
fuck,
what do I do?
I don't know if I want to go back that way.

929
00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:52.160
Bottled water seems like the way to go,
you know,
drink it and throw it away.

930
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.250
<v 1>It's really interesting for my sleep apnea machine that has a reservoir,</v>

931
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.900
you put water into two humidifier so it keeps your throat,
uh,
moist at night.

932
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.890
Lord,
it's so weird.
I'm supposed to put distilled water in there,
right.

933
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.470
And I put the stone water in there all the time.
The is great.

934
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:10.280
I cleaned out once a week with bleach and the whole thing.
When I go on the road,

935
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:13.850
I don't use distilled water.
And it's very interesting.
I could tell you where,

936
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.850
who's got the dirtiest fucking waters after I'd come home from the road.

937
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.460
Really like Arizona is disgusting.

938
00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.840
Fucking that Tucson trip we took when we go for the UFC.
Um,

939
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.820
just last month we went down there for something not to a Arizona state.
Yeah,

940
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.150
we did the Wednesday night that uh,
no,
Austin,
Austin,
Austin,

941
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.050
the fucking filter was disgusting when I got back.

942
00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.150
So not Arizona or I was tossed to the Texas Gray Shit.

943
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.360
Really when I went to Arizona.
That's why one time I went to Arizona,

944
00:51:41.361 --> 00:51:43.430
this year when I came back,
it was a three night trip.

945
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.090
The fucking machine was gray from the water.

946
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:51.410
So I could tell the local water and even if I buy bottled water comes back
clean.

947
00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:53.810
But sometimes it just the local water from the bathroom,

948
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.410
I could tell you just from that machine who's got the good water and the dirty

949
00:51:57.411 --> 00:52:00.510
water.
Arizona's house it recently.
Um,
there was some,

950
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:05.511
some study that was published that showed 31 different cities have elevated

951
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:07.010
levels of,
of,

952
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.700
of certain chemicals that they believe might be carcinogens in the water.

953
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.250
31 cities.
Yeah,
elevated levels.

954
00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:16.250
Some of them like 200 times the level that they think would be appropriate.

955
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:18.770
And they all have prescription drugs in them.
Yup.
Yeah.

956
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.680
All prescription drugs in them.
People will flush their shit down the toilet.

957
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.543
Right.
Okay.

958
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.460
<v 4>So our,
our dicks are going to get harder.
Are All going to have,</v>

959
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:30.200
we're going to get a pregnant
thinking about that man.
What?

960
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.740
I mean they're not levels though that the are they levels that you can,

961
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.880
I don't know.
But what if,

962
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.200
because like one of the wet weight psychoactive levels of drugs that are,

963
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.980
if ever been found in really,
right,
isn't it?
Why not?

964
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.840
I think it's like parts per million.
I think it's to the point that like,

965
00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:47.990
like birth control starts getting into the water to where everyone who drinks

966
00:52:47.991 --> 00:52:50.090
water cannot get pregnant anymore.
Well,

967
00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.240
Tony's get point to stop flushing their birth control pills.

968
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.890
Could you imagine if you're such a whore,

969
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.290
you have so much birth control pills that when you flush them,

970
00:52:57.291 --> 00:53:01.310
nobody can get pregnant.
That's what a whore you are.
You fucking pig.

971
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.750
How much is lay off the deck?

972
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:06.560
That's going to take a billion pills and keep stuffing Cox in your clam.

973
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:09.770
Because what they're saying is like the prescription drug gets in the water and

974
00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:12.960
it can't get out of the water.
They can't take it out of the water anymore.
Candy?

975
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.190
No.
So,
so the,
the more,
the longer we live,

976
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:20.030
the more that chemical is going to be put into the water,
to the water,

977
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:22.550
to the water side.
I don't know about that.
I think they must,

978
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:26.940
it must break down over time or does it get worse?
Oh No,
I would imagine.

979
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:29.360
I mean if,
if something,
you know,

980
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:31.410
it's going to be getting filtered somehow or another.

981
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.240
I mean the population of Earth has doubled since what the 1950s and so our water

982
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:39.750
might be being fucked.
It might be getting fucking like,

983
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:42.870
we don't even realize that our water at one point we're not going to be able to

984
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.630
drink it because if we drink it and you're allergic to penicillin,

985
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:48.300
you're going to break out in hives and everything's made out of water.

986
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.080
What it will,
that's fucking scary.

987
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:54.890
Scary thing that we started would take a shower and you come and you smell like

988
00:53:54.891 --> 00:53:57.770
somebody else that's fucking dirty water that's recycled.
Fuck

989
00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:02.260
<v 2>can,
uh,
when,
when you're eating pasta,
you know,
and you,
you boil water,</v>

990
00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:05.260
you know that that water is still that flunky water from the fucking sick,

991
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.050
you know.
So even if you tried to drink bottled water all the time,

992
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.520
we really making spaghetti with bottled.
I do too.

993
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:15.770
I really is that the move is the move,
right?
You won't,

994
00:54:15.771 --> 00:54:19.090
they say the boil water anyway.
If you blow water,

995
00:54:19.091 --> 00:54:22.360
it comes back pretty clean and pretty clean.
But not everything.

996
00:54:22.361 --> 00:54:27.040
You don't kill everything.
You don't tell a lot of the chemicals.
Fucking water.

997
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:27.830
Fucking yeah.

998
00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.640
<v 4>Water Man.
There needs to work.
They need to find,</v>

999
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.420
they need to find a substitute for water.

1000
00:54:32.421 --> 00:54:35.660
But anything that would be a substitute for water would be made from water.
Joey,

1001
00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:36.980
do you know anything about the Juggalos?

1002
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.480
<v 2>What's the Juggalos do you know anything about insane clown posse?
Nothing.</v>

1003
00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.740
Nothing.
This is a crazy meal going to learn.
Yeah,
to crazy movement.

1004
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:50.690
There's fucking millions of these guys following the insane clown posse all

1005
00:54:50.691 --> 00:54:52.850
around the country wearing makeup and shit.

1006
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:58.150
And they're all like this motley crew of unfortunate tattoos and she's fucking

1007
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.580
strange dental structure and you know,
they're,
they're,
they're a trip man.
It's,

1008
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.260
it's a,
a giant fucking movement.

1009
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:08.570
Now what did you bump into these people and then bumping into him?

1010
00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:09.950
I'm just like seeing it online.

1011
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.500
It's one of those things that like kind of snuck up out of nowhere.

1012
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.710
So what do I have to do to become a juggler?

1013
00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.770
I'm going to go [inaudible] you gotta be,

1014
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.060
you gotta be into the insane clown posse now that's a rap band.
Yeah.

1015
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.670
That's the one that Dante people make fun of them.
Honestly,

1016
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:28.880
Dante had a fight with one of those guys.
I don't know what they from Hollywood.

1017
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.980
Dante,
which Dante.
Dante.
Dante.
Really?

1018
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.750
We know to the comic to fuck him.
I'm talking about Black Dante.
Dante.

1019
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.750
He got in a fight with in insane clown guy.
Let me telling you to,

1020
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.030
I don't remember this.
Tell me his story.
I don't know the store.

1021
00:55:41.031 --> 00:55:45.440
I don't know what a dog now they hang out in Hollywood.
These people,
correct?

1022
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.680
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know much about them.
This is,

1023
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:53.250
this happened five years ago with Dante and Dante got in a fight with on of
them.

1024
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:56.000
Dante is a big boy.
Yeah.
You got to see him down.

1025
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:59.120
That's not a good move to get [inaudible].
He's getting ready for football,

1026
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:01.550
so he's been running.
I seen him football.

1027
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.140
There's any 40 he played semipro football.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Yeah.

1028
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.960
When did you start playing again?
Five years ago.
Really?
All Dizzy.

1029
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.860
I think he's about 31 it's football.
It's all 31 is bullet.

1030
00:56:12.861 --> 00:56:14.360
Who is bullet wound is healed.

1031
00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.390
That's one of the funniest things you could ever say.
He's ready to play.

1032
00:56:20.391 --> 00:56:24.030
His bullet wound is healed.
He got shot in the leg of a drug.
It

1033
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:28.160
<v 4>is c two o this coconut water and stuff.
Love Shit.
They sent me home [inaudible].</v>

1034
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.420
I been drinking.
That shift for two,
three years I was playing for was awesome.

1035
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.000
This is the best one I've ever found.
I liked the Zico.
Zico is good town.

1036
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.611
Did they?

1037
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:40.270
I've been buying those in like the cartons now at the grocery stores now carry

1038
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.280
him like almost like in milk carton type things.

1039
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.520
And then it's like you made three 99 by,
it's pretty good.

1040
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:47.680
But I still like c two o better.
I just wish,

1041
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:52.060
you know I like this cause I like it's a big can 17 ounces and what you then do

1042
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:55.840
is take it out of the can and put it over rice.
Yeah.
That's the Patois dot.

1043
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.850
[inaudible] it is none other than put it over ice and you'll see what it's like.

1044
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.240
Coke one ice cubes.
This guy fucking cyanide and I'm co one coq one is okay,

1045
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.250
but with ice cubes you take your fucking drinking coffee.

1046
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.620
So you drink bottled water,
ice cubes to you do that sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1047
00:57:09.621 --> 00:57:14.170
I like that.
That's been making Daiquiri's with it.
With the coconut water,

1048
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.520
that gets fucked up.
My Dad has a happy hour every day.
He sits in the backyard.

1049
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:22.250
They both retired my uh,
and so,
so he just gets hammered every day.

1050
00:57:22.251 --> 00:57:25.130
Every day at five six o'clock they'll sit back and have a couple of during that

1051
00:57:25.131 --> 00:57:28.580
hammered,
but like,
like two or three days.
Yeah.
It gets lit everyday.
Wow.

1052
00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.720
You have taken,
Huh?
Does he take care of himself?
Oh yeah.

1053
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:33.760
He works out every day because that's what I thought.

1054
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:36.880
It was funny like your dad did.
Dad's a very smart guy,
right?
Yeah.
Very sorry.

1055
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.430
They is some sort of inventor character yet.
Engineer,

1056
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.460
inventor trying to break perpetual motion in his basement type kind of guy kicks

1057
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:47.230
down a window.
If he wants to build a greenhouse and they go back,

1058
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:48.061
I'm going to build a greenhouse.

1059
00:57:48.061 --> 00:57:50.890
It just smashes a window out and builds a greenhouse with a hot tub in it.

1060
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.360
Like your car breaks down,
you'll take the car engine out,
throw it on the ground.

1061
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.570
He's,
it's crazy how if the internet was around when,

1062
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.610
when he was growing up,

1063
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.640
he would be at mad programmer or he'd be a huge computer nerd,

1064
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.850
which is crazy cause he would have lost all those skills,
you know,

1065
00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:09.790
like building cars and tearing down walls because he would have been addicted.

1066
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:12.420
You could tell he would have been addicted to the Internet.
Wow.

1067
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.460
Do you ever try to get them into it now?
Yeah,

1068
00:58:15.461 --> 00:58:19.510
but I mean he has the same computer I,
I got,
I'm like seven years ago.

1069
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.080
Do you ever ask him like how come he's done into it?
Uh,
I think he is into it,

1070
00:58:23.081 --> 00:58:24.280
but I think he just,

1071
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:28.930
I mean it's weird like people having a laptop is completely different.
You know,

1072
00:58:28.931 --> 00:58:31.090
like if you had a computer in a computer room,

1073
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.720
you'll probably not use it as much as if you had a laptop on the couch,

1074
00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:38.800
laptop in bed.
I think the laptop is that the crack for people.

1075
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:42.370
Once they get a laptop,
your dad probably doesn't know where to begin.

1076
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.290
He probably doesn't know.
I mean,

1077
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:48.040
but that's why it's so curious to me that your dad is so intelligent and so

1078
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:51.430
curious that why wouldn't he be like all over the net?

1079
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:55.660
Why would it be online every day?
Like reading new things?
He does documentary.

1080
00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:56.960
I think it does to a point.
You just,

1081
00:58:56.961 --> 00:58:59.960
it doesn't take it to the advantage because he's hooked on this shit dog.

1082
00:58:59.961 --> 00:59:01.980
There's other things to fucking life to.
No,
I understand.

1083
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.470
Just because you're smart don't mean you got to sit on this fucking thing all

1084
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:04.970
day either.

1085
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:08.530
You know know what I'm saying is once in a while you move on with the guys like

1086
00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.440
whole life.
Oh No,
I understand.
The whole fucking life.

1087
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:14.530
The guy's a super curious guy.
That's all I'm saying.
But,

1088
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.250
but when you're a guy like Brian and his dad is a lot like Brian,

1089
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:22.250
like you would say like,
man,
like you don't know you're missing a lot of people.

1090
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.471
<v 1>They did.</v>

1091
00:59:22.471 --> 00:59:27.471
It's never [inaudible] 60 [inaudible] 60 means these.

1092
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.840
That means he's getting one foot in the grave worn or banana peel.

1093
00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:32.600
By the time he starts learning about it's like me wiling to take acid.

1094
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:35.430
Why didn't take ecstasy?
Because I was already hooked on coke.

1095
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.780
I got enough problems for coke.
I'm gonna open up a fucking thing.
Access you now,

1096
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.430
same thing with his dad.
He's smart enough.

1097
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:41.840
You don't need to fucking look at computers.

1098
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.670
He wants to sit in the back of the drink.
Coconut water factories.

1099
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.060
He is equated a man looking at computers as to why you would or something

1100
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.500
fucking years old.
You'd think he's got time.
You don't want to be like,

1101
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:54.410
if he wants to get his dick slept.
You know what I'm saying?
Before he dies.

1102
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:56.760
That's why he's drinking daiquiris and having a good time on the bath night.

1103
00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.960
Do you want him out there with a fucking thing like this fucking mobile playing

1104
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:03.860
on a thing,
taking pictures of the cat.
That guy's got,
I think die.

1105
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.990
I understand that.
I think that reading things on the Internet,

1106
01:00:06.991 --> 01:00:09.170
it makes life more interesting.
Oh,
I read shit every day,

1107
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.790
but I'm not going to live on there and fucking,

1108
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:13.940
you know you got to do other shit.
Yeah,
for sure.

1109
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:16.520
You have to go live your life and I mean fuck that shit.

1110
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.760
Being on it all the time.
It's not the look but being on it or not at all.

1111
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:21.060
It's not the move either.
No,

1112
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.740
but you can't believe everything you fucking read on there anyway because a
fuck.

1113
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:26.720
I'm going to sit there and watch the documentaries,
everything.

1114
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:28.070
Get the fuck Outta here.
I'm living life.

1115
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.000
I'm doing my own motherfucking documentary,
I believe.
Like what's his name?

1116
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.240
What's his name?
The guy that he,
the turners husband like turn.

1117
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:38.360
We're making a home movies.
You're writing a home books.
Fuck these bitches.

1118
01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:39.194
You know what I'm saying?

1119
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.750
He gotta be there on the all day about to send me and fucking who gives a fuck.

1120
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:48.140
It's random for four days out there.
The one on ones backed up the pieces.

1121
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.530
Give a fuck about some fucking now Joey,

1122
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:54.500
when are you going to eventually die off of my space?

1123
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:56.450
Because I've noticed you still do your blogs.

1124
01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.800
I couldn't let blackening never gone off.
Here's the deal.
If my space goes away,

1125
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.710
it goes away and then burned out there.
That'll take away all your blogs.

1126
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.990
I got him up.
I got on on wordpress.
They'll leave.
Think you're dealing with it.

1127
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.620
Some fucking novice.
What's with the questions?
You ready for the school?

1128
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.940
Fucking paper.
It's Christmas going.
Fucking Brian.

1129
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.910
Why do you care if he's unmarried?
Cause I'll tell you why.

1130
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:19.490
I don't want to go on to different things.
I thought you guys.
Why?

1131
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:23.180
Because my Twitter people are a little fucking crazy and that like you

1132
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:26.390
motherfuckers.
That's why I put the blog on Twitter after I do it on my space.

1133
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.710
My Facebook people,

1134
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.010
I've got family people on there and I got people that have kids on there and

1135
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:33.140
they look at a lot of shits.
I gotta be careful that saying that,

1136
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:35.990
which is perfect.
That's what my space,

1137
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:39.470
I'm proven a fucking point that we got to stop being sheep people.

1138
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.100
You got to stop jumping on the next big fucking thing.
You know?
By the time,

1139
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.650
by the end of the year,
we'll have 10 fucking g's on an iPhone.

1140
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.290
You've got all of them.
You got to relax.
You got to control yourself,

1141
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.720
and this is what I'm going to stick to for a while.
I'm just going to say,

1142
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.771
I'm just gonna say,

1143
01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:55.280
I thought I didn't know you had it like two cops because my space,
in my opinion,

1144
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:58.150
one day it's going to go well,
please.
It's garbage

1145
01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.140
can go where it's pretty bad and they're,
they're,

1146
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.350
they're the main people back off.

1147
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:09.410
They changed drowning in Los Right now.
Money.

1148
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.380
Isn't that incredible that they used to be so huge,

1149
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:13.910
just a short period of time ago.

1150
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:17.810
That is the most fickle thing I think I've ever asked law society now a days.

1151
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.680
I know we're on something for six months and we move on.
That's not good.

1152
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:21.660
Liberal fucking told you.

1153
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.960
<v 3>What's Facebook starting to go down a bad path though lately or that'd be</v>

1154
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:29.700
noticed that I've been getting like spam from fucking comics and Bob Levy or

1155
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:33.210
whatever his name is called leaving land.
I think I've blocked the guy,

1156
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.530
have unfriended the guy,

1157
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.390
but somehow I'm still getting fucking two messages a day about leaving land USA

1158
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:42.360
and I'm like,
all right,
this is impossible.
I believe he's my friend.

1159
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:43.950
I go into your settings and I,
fuck.
Yeah,

1160
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:48.000
you probably do add leave every time samples

1161
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.190
<v 1>Bob on hill.
No,
they did got rid of Bob.
We'll put them back in.</v>

1162
01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.140
That was the beginning stages of my space.

1163
01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:56.710
If every fucking week ago with a new fad or a new fucking thing,

1164
01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.460
we've got to put the foot down Joey each.

1165
01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.190
I'm just proud of you that you're online.

1166
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.050
I remember when you weren't even online.

1167
01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.060
I remember when you wouldn't make texts messages.

1168
01:03:04.061 --> 01:03:05.370
I remember I still don't do texting.

1169
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.330
I didn't want to have a phone would cut them out again.

1170
01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.020
The pages find pages fine or need a fucking phone.
No fucking phone.

1171
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.780
I want people calling me and telling me Shit.
So you stop text messaging.
Yeah,

1172
01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:16.930
I cut it out.
What happened?

1173
01:03:16.931 --> 01:03:21.280
Because people too much to much text messaged me if there's a dollar bill number

1174
01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:24.300
at the end of it.
Yeah.
Don't text message to me.
Some stupid shit.

1175
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.340
I'm waiting for a little like just call me.
Don't text messaged me some shit.

1176
01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:30.700
That makes me think you just need a hug.
Yeah,
I don't need that shit.
My man.

1177
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:34.480
You know somebody sends you a message.
It's like on Facebook.
I love Facebook.

1178
01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:36.290
I love Twitter,
but somebody sends you money.

1179
01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.780
They want to have a conversation on that.

1180
01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:40.720
All that conversation on Facebook type of what?
You got to talk to me.

1181
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.780
I'll tell you,
we'll move on with your life.
Then they write you back.

1182
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.290
Thank you for what the fuck.
Let it go.
Move on to the next fucking mobile.

1183
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.960
You know what I'm saying?
How long do you want to city?
I can't do that.

1184
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:52.930
I can't do that at all.
I don't my,
you don't type that well either.
Right.

1185
01:03:52.931 --> 01:03:55.270
So it takes you a well black type,
you know,
I type,
I,

1186
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.320
I'm better than I was before I took type it two years of typing in high school,

1187
01:03:59.321 --> 01:04:02.350
but that was 20 years ago on 30 million fucking joints.
You know,

1188
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.450
Mavis beacon teaches typing.
I used a computer program.
That's how I learned that.

1189
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.720
It's fun.
They make it like a game,
you know?
That's how I learned it.

1190
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.690
I'm not that good though.
I'm decent.
I know.
You're really good.
I've seen you.

1191
01:04:13.691 --> 01:04:16.750
You're very,
you're very good.
I just,
you know,
uh,

1192
01:04:16.751 --> 01:04:19.510
I'm having a good time with the computer.
I write a lot on the computer,

1193
01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.890
but no more text messaging now.
Too much used it.
Right.
Those thought,
listen,

1194
01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:26.740
I just don't like people that they're using this business.

1195
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.110
That's why I didn't like,
I didn't let you know.

1196
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.800
If you want me to do your fucking,
she'll call me.
Hey,

1197
01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:37.801
are you available Tuesday the eighth on his business?

1198
01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:42.000
I don't want no mix ups.
You know what I'm saying?
Right.
I understand this.

1199
01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:43.930
I understand that.
Yeah,
I agree.
Just call me.

1200
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.480
Call me something a couple of weeks ago that I didn't understand.
You told me,

1201
01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:50.230
you told me you go,
you don't understand Joe.

1202
01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:52.270
When you get busier the computer bitch,

1203
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.340
when you were doing news radio there was no computer.

1204
01:04:54.341 --> 01:04:58.990
You will get Sussman was calling you direct direct call me bitch won't text me.

1205
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.990
You can definitely get more things by no because call me,

1206
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.540
<v 3>I'm sick of calling me.
I'm almost,</v>

1207
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:07.660
if I could take that as an option out I will probably do it.

1208
01:05:07.661 --> 01:05:10.480
So there's certain things though that you have to get done with the
conversation.

1209
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.323
Yeah,

1210
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.430
but still the majority caulk conversations I get in conversations on a message

1211
01:05:16.781 --> 01:05:17.980
board.
I go fuck what

1212
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.430
<v 2>kind of can of worms and I open up here cause this is going to take a long time</v>

1213
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.470
to really truly explain.
It's going to,
it's all very,
very evolved subject.

1214
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:28.660
And that's too wild.
I can't,
I don't have the time,
man.
I not only,

1215
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:31.840
it's not even a time thing.
I don't have the effort.
I'm too,

1216
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:33.520
I'm too focused and too many different areas.

1217
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:35.710
Like I try to like on message boards especially,

1218
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.730
I try to put in as much time as I can and talk about stuff and you know,

1219
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:43.870
and go back and forth with things.
But fuck man,
I got so much other shit to do.

1220
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:46.060
It's like,
it's really like,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1221
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:50.170
it's counter productive to me to like get into any like really deep discussion.

1222
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.410
Those things become a huge pain.
But also when I'm doing something,

1223
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:56.200
I'm in a mindset,
you know,
and the phone rings and they're,
you know,

1224
01:05:56.201 --> 01:05:57.390
I'm just like,
fuck this.
I can't,

1225
01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.010
you can't answer this cause it's gonna ruin my thought process.

1226
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.710
That's why I like texting because when I'm done with something I just go with
it.

1227
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.500
Okay.
Yes.
No blue,
purple vagina.
Right.

1228
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.090
Well that's when you want like trivial subjects on a message board and you want

1229
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:13.690
to go,
they just cured,
uh,
aids with stem cells hole in.

1230
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:16.870
You want to look at that and just type Holy Shit.
We can fuck with condoms,

1231
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.060
would no condoms now,
you know,
I mean it's like,
you know what I'm saying?

1232
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:22.630
Like you don't,
you don't get in some gigantic debate about something,
you know,

1233
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:24.400
just something fascinating and interesting.

1234
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.630
But those are the ones that when you get drawn into a man,
those go on for it.

1235
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.670
These can go on for days and days because it's such an ineffective way to

1236
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:31.720
communicate.
You know,

1237
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.350
you write something out and then I write a response and I wait for you.

1238
01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:38.290
It's like fucking God damn,
that's time consuming.

1239
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:43.090
You like Twitter cause the hundred and 40 fucking words.
And I'll tell you what,

1240
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:47.320
if I see six,
seven in a row that someone sends me and they just,
they're just,
oh,

1241
01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:51.580
you're crazy.
Click blocked.
You can't,
you can't take up my whole thing.

1242
01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:53.980
Just trying to communicate with me about every fucking thing you can think.

1243
01:06:53.981 --> 01:06:55.990
I hate it.
Yeah,
it gives becomes annoying.

1244
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.150
But the beautiful thing is that you could stop,
that.

1245
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:02.170
You can stop people from just clogging it up.
I just banned people.
I'm like,

1246
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.470
if they start like just acting a fool,
then I just,

1247
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.340
but there's plenty of cool people on a too.

1248
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.630
People are always sending me cool Twitter links and they're always sending me

1249
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:14.980
interesting stories and interesting,
you know,
interesting videos.

1250
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:18.890
I get great views,
interesting music.
That shit.
Cool musics in cash.

1251
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.840
<v 1>Great Link last night somebody sent me I hadn't seen in 15 fucking years.</v>

1252
01:07:22.841 --> 01:07:26.410
So what was it,
the Bruce Lee,
uh,
the Bruce Lee,
uh,

1253
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.480
Chuck Norris fight from the [inaudible] from the coliseum.
Seem trivial to you,

1254
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:36.610
but if you haven't seen it in 15,
20 years,
you're like,
wow,
that's fucking great.

1255
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.050
That's a great classic man.

1256
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:40.780
He starts boxing them and the cats are running around and if you know anything

1257
01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:45.070
about the Roman Coliseum,
they got a movie that's walking around that,
sorry.

1258
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:47.230
That's what they filmed that at the coliseum.
I don't know,

1259
01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:51.060
because the first scene is a set and they turn the camera around.

1260
01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:54.900
It looks like the Colosseum,
they're there or they did some footage there,

1261
01:07:54.901 --> 01:07:57.210
but it's so weird.
Like if you don't anything about the Colosseum,
ma'am.

1262
01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:57.701
Like I said,

1263
01:07:57.701 --> 01:08:02.140
they have 20 million fucking cats walking around that it's just infested with

1264
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:04.040
generations and generations.
We've

1265
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:08.050
<v 2>been there,
man.
I want to go though to Rome.
You really want to go?
Yeah,
I want to,</v>

1266
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.810
I want to go to Rome and I want to go to Athens.
So I want to see a,

1267
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:14.380
I want to see the Parthenon,
the Acropolis.
I want to see all that crazy shit.

1268
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.960
You know?

1269
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.790
That was an amazing time and it's amazing that they were so advanced as far as

1270
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:21.620
like the incredible buildings that we're creating.

1271
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.200
But then nobody even bothered fixing them.
Nobody even bothered keeping them up.

1272
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:31.100
Like society had crumbled so far that they became rubble.
You know,

1273
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:35.000
some of the most incredible structures like the people that built them,
you know,

1274
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:35.511
you've got to go.

1275
01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:40.460
What happens when the people that made this incredible quality of building,

1276
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.190
what happens when they just die off?

1277
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.570
What happens when no one can do that shit anymore?
What happens when,
you know,

1278
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:49.580
you go through a few generations and no one knows how to fix the ceiling anymore

1279
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:50.320
because no one's like,

1280
01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.570
or a carpenter to the level that these people were back then.

1281
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.900
Then they just start rotting out,
you know,
and then it becomes nothing.

1282
01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.980
It's pretty fucking nuts when you think of like look at their,

1283
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.880
the houses that are around,
if you look at,

1284
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:04.640
look at the surrounding area of Rome or of Athens,

1285
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.070
they're all normal modern houses now,
you know,

1286
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.690
but yet here's these insane stone structures that have stood the test of time

1287
01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:16.290
and you never hear from a thousand years ago and this amazing architecture and

1288
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.710
incredible,
you know,

1289
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:22.430
precise craftsmanship all just a thousand years ago.
You know,

1290
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:26.960
it's pretty amazing stuff.
Genius and it all fell apart.
All fell apart.

1291
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.640
You know,
it's crazy bro.

1292
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.270
Going back to that thing about cannibalism because the foot,
none of them,

1293
01:09:32.271 --> 01:09:33.920
cause I was thinking that last night or the night before,

1294
01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:38.530
there was a show on a APL about the history of the cats are some,
yeah,

1295
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.230
they were talking about Egypt and all that with the tombstones.

1296
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.810
And what was going on.
People were dying.
Right.
And what they were doing is,

1297
01:09:44.811 --> 01:09:46.880
let's say somebody died,
there was their favorite cat.

1298
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.120
They want the cat to go on the journey with Whoa Shit.
Go.

1299
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:53.120
Cause they would take them in to get them a modified.
Yeah.

1300
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.310
But before they'd love a Phi,

1301
01:09:54.311 --> 01:09:57.560
they break their neck to make sure that they would never leave.

1302
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.280
Do you follow him?
Say Anthea.
So once you went to the s the life,

1303
01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:04.610
the soul would go to that life with you.
But if you broke the cow,

1304
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:07.670
all the cats next that were modified,
all the cats that would love a five,

1305
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:10.740
the next were broken.
How do you know that's just not how they both,

1306
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.760
I guess what they were talking about on the show last night.

1307
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:17.270
Well that's what they were doing.
If somebody had a favorite cat,
they died.

1308
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.320
The cat live.
Okay,
we kill the cat.

1309
01:10:19.321 --> 01:10:21.700
So you can take the journey with them and they would,
uh,

1310
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:25.370
wrap him up and shit like that.
Egyptians were like really into cat.
Yeah.

1311
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:26.960
Really at the cats too much.

1312
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.800
But it makes it lifts your eyebrows about what the fuck were they really

1313
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:34.550
thinking about?
There was such a smart civilization and so kinky and shit,

1314
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.530
but they knew something like if your cat died in those times and you had before

1315
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:42.290
you bury GCAT,
you're gonna to take them to some guy in the neighborhood.

1316
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.960
That guy thought you abused at cat.
They kill you.
What?
Oh,

1317
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:48.110
fucking they had the records of all the cats in the neighborhood.

1318
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:52.490
It's a crazy that they worshiped cats,
you know,

1319
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:56.930
t to tuck common,
uh,
King Tut and um,
uh,

1320
01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.590
his father ochin Naughton,
they were both like a deformed.

1321
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.110
They both had like extra long heads.

1322
01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.230
They both had like these weird physical,

1323
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.460
like some sort of a deformation of their head.

1324
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:13.420
They had like extra long heads when they found a,

1325
01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:16.170
his dad and all the depictions of them look like that too.

1326
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:20.220
I think his name is [inaudible] and uh,
in,
in two comma,

1327
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.450
if you look at all the images of them,

1328
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:25.500
they all have like these weird kind of long heads.
It's really a trip,
man.

1329
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.840
I wonder if like there's a few instances of people,
you know,
back in those days,

1330
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:33.360
I mean,
if you look at like what Egypt was able to accomplish,

1331
01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.470
I wonder if there were like some super fucking rain man,
mother fuckers,

1332
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.290
just a few super rain man,

1333
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.240
motherfuckers that just defied all the current,
you know,
current,

1334
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.620
uh,
like,
uh,
Iq level,
Iq levels,
intelligence levels,
just,

1335
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:53.490
just a few fucking freaks,
a few weird freaks.
You know,

1336
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:56.940
like every now and then as a dude who's born in Lexington Lexington's deals,

1337
01:11:56.941 --> 01:12:00.690
Dick,
you know,
dude's got like a 14 inch deck that's not normal,

1338
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.230
but it's so far above normal.
It's like what happens there?

1339
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:08.910
You could get a can of brain be born like that.
Can you get a 14 inch Dick Brain?

1340
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.880
You know,
cause if you can,
could you imagine?
Yeah.

1341
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:13.680
But was he just really good at like,
wow,

1342
01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:16.500
I could build shoes better than this person.
You know,

1343
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.260
they were just smarter for that time period.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1344
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:22.590
I don't know.
I mean,
I don't know what aquanaut and accomplished or what to Tuck.

1345
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:24.720
Cut Ting to Todd common.

1346
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:28.800
He died when he was really young and know those people.
Yeah,

1347
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:34.440
some of them did.
How old?
35 40 he was,
oh,

1348
01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.700
I think it was Moses.

1349
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.540
One of one of them lived so long that by the time he died,

1350
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.430
every one that was alive had been born during his title reign and there were so

1351
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:49.120
they were concerned that when he died that the world would end there.

1352
01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.690
They had not,
they had not known life without this guy.

1353
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:56.130
I forget which one that was not really like big up on my Pharos.

1354
01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.070
It's too much to think about,
man.
I've,

1355
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.360
I've watched these a Egyptian documentaries like a magical Egypt's fascinating

1356
01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:06.030
shit,
but it's like six fucking hours,

1357
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:10.650
at least six hours of DVDs and it's like you're trying to pay attention and keep

1358
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:15.390
track and you're like,
whoa.
Like if you really wanted to like lose your mind,

1359
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.070
get,
get into Egypt,

1360
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:22.050
get into studying ancient Egypt because it's so complicated and so surreal that

1361
01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:24.030
you like,
look at these people.
They drew these,

1362
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240
their language consistent of nutty stick figures and they were all about stars.

1363
01:13:29.311 --> 01:13:31.470
And transcending this life.
And,

1364
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.380
and yet they made the most insane structures ever known to men.

1365
01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:38.640
Like they were like a super psychedelic culture with pump Payette.

1366
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.480
I don't know India,
right?
Yeah.
That's bumped.
Layton,

1367
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.040
Bombay Pompei Pompa.
Nosen Pompei let's find out.

1368
01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.830
No,
because I seen that the pink Floyd,
the concept,

1369
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:54.600
and they put it on DVD like these days in Italy.

1370
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.810
Pompei it's in Italy,
pom pom.
Pei Pei.

1371
01:13:59.280 --> 01:13:59.940
It's in a,

1372
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.720
it's a province of Naples playing Floyd live on Pompei fucking tremendous.

1373
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:06.000
They said the equipment out there,
that dog side of the moon.

1374
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.060
I'm wondering what it's like going back to the old country and hanging out with

1375
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:09.781
those Italians.

1376
01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:14.781
I bet they're fucking free bread sticks to the other of gun [inaudible] I bet

1377
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:20.560
they're freaks.
I heard the best foods in Spain.
Really?
The food is off the chain.

1378
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:24.280
Yeah.
Yeah,
I heard from places like that.
Right?

1379
01:14:24.281 --> 01:14:28.860
Like the passion places like Spain and France and Italy,
like these that were,

1380
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.180
they're considered like real passionate,
you know,
like a passionate,

1381
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.380
passionately European countries such as we just go over and have a good time.

1382
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:38.740
But German is my God.
We went to actually,
and it was just,

1383
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.060
I love it when you do that,
but it's interesting,

1384
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.810
like German is not considered passionate.
They're not,

1385
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:48.220
they're considered cold and calculated and their food kind of sucks.
I mean,
yeah.

1386
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:51.110
Then the wiener stencils and shit like that and there's lots of branches.

1387
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:55.630
It's okay,
but it doesn't compare to like Italian food,
like Italian cuisine,

1388
01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:58.940
like the depth of Italian cuisine,
like German food is like,
it's,
you know,

1389
01:14:58.941 --> 01:14:59.441
it's okay.

1390
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:03.870
It's amazing that it's very cut and dry ethnic food data that states will

1391
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:08.470
fucking delicious Italian food every night than any other.
It's all comfort food.

1392
01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:10.810
I mean,
think of what Italian food is.
It's all pastas.

1393
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:14.830
Lasagna is in meat sauce and it's all just comfort.
Can Delicious.
Yeah.

1394
01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:18.600
It's the best spaghetti and meatballs that this is something about the,
the,

1395
01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:20.890
the whole culture then that comes out of,
you know,

1396
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.220
it says a lot about how the people that live in,
like it's,
it's healthy,

1397
01:15:24.221 --> 01:15:28.350
but you know the fuck it's not,
it's not made for health.
It's made for taste.

1398
01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.010
<v 1>My lights.</v>

1399
01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:31.780
One of the nights I would love to be home because to mylight those fucking

1400
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:35.320
guineas,
they'd do it right.
My friends in Jersey,
they do it right though.

1401
01:15:35.321 --> 01:15:38.410
They do it the night of the seven Mars,
the seven fish,

1402
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.810
seven fucking fish.
You've got to seven and it starts with those skinny little,

1403
01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:48.070
little,
uh,
what's the smelts and bonus.
Then they go to the clams,

1404
01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:51.460
then they go to the muscles.
Then they go to the fucking our shrimp.

1405
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.490
Then they go and look at their clan and they put the crowd.
I miss.

1406
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:57.590
I Miss Sausage and peppers,
peppers,

1407
01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:01.530
sub fry wanted for breakfast.
I get old down here.
Cavarretta.
Yeah,

1408
01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.830
it with tomato sauce.
They have a boss.
That's how they do it out here,

1409
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.090
you know it's good.
It's great.
It's delicious.
I'm happy just to have,

1410
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:13.480
this morning I was like the fried kind to right from yoga.

1411
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.250
Me and my wife went my sausage and peppers,

1412
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:18.580
beginner yoga at eight 30 how many points is that a million others?

1413
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:19.690
That sausage and peppers.

1414
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:24.691
I think I gave it like 14 I had the small so I had done a lot of points.

1415
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:30.340
A sick one sausage one slash 92 but weight watchers changed the point system and

1416
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:35.350
fat people are fucking it arms me.

1417
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:38.320
I just stuck to the old points cause that's all I liked the new points.

1418
01:16:38.321 --> 01:16:39.610
I'll see if I can understand them.

1419
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:42.860
I don't fucking understand what pretty much the new point systems now you can

1420
01:16:42.861 --> 01:16:46.550
eat as much vegetables and fruits which I did.
I did.

1421
01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.070
I never counted my points on fruit anyway but they doubled up on the pasta and

1422
01:16:51.071 --> 01:16:52.380
shit.
What a mixed sense.

1423
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.810
Like there was some like there was too many like like like you should not be

1424
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:59.020
allowed to eat like two point a cheese.
It's all day.

1425
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:02.260
You know like you should not be able to do that.
There was things like that like,

1426
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:04.570
like it just hadn't been updated in so long.

1427
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.640
Guys you gotta explain if you're talking about this,

1428
01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:08.050
you gotta explain what the fuck the saw means.

1429
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:11.420
Watch his watchers is a point based system.
It's usually,

1430
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:15.170
it used to be based mostly on calories,
diet,
Terry Fat,

1431
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:19.760
our fiber and fat grams and until five book at least the point.
Right?
Right.

1432
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:24.310
You add up all the elements,
all the vegetables you want,
all the,
yeah.

1433
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.520
I never counted them.

1434
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:28.040
My points with vegetables or fruit because I knew it was a scam.

1435
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:29.990
It's all water scan and I was right.

1436
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:33.190
They just with the new system is way more accurate system.

1437
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.420
Recent findings that goes,

1438
01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:38.720
we'll fucking and milk one of those little cheese that come with the inlet thing

1439
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:39.140
like uh,

1440
01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:44.140
like a triangle or a blue Muga Moodle blue fucking pu one point.

1441
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.840
Those cheeses.
Yeah.
We're fear crackers.
That's three points.

1442
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:50.630
I'm full on one of the fucking pants that delicious.

1443
01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:53.420
You come home at night from doing a gate.
I don't have to eat a big meal no more.

1444
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:57.220
I eat an apple on a piece of cheated points.
You get a day in just 30 days.

1445
01:17:57.221 --> 01:17:58.920
Diner is based on your whatnot.

1446
01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.050
It's based on your weight and height though my points aren't as high is 50 those

1447
01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:07.250
little chose cheese to fuck up my holder.
The cod new booze or something blue,

1448
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:10.850
but they got blue cheese and switched the two for $6 a fucking routes.

1449
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:14.300
I get to kill a week.
I you want a day in between meals.
Delicious.

1450
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.530
There's so many little things,
but to every calorie is a for every,

1451
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:21.200
for every 60 calories.
It's a point.
Okay.

1452
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.120
So like when I go to the gym and work on the bike,

1453
01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:25.730
let's say I burned 600 calories on the bike at six points.

1454
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.710
So now you can eat all the fruit and vegetables you want.
Right?

1455
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.620
The new system is could,
but I always did,

1456
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.890
which is how it should be a big shot because cause in the past it used to be

1457
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:38.030
like,
fuck,
I'm so hungry.
I only have four points left.

1458
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.780
I'm just going to eat two of these,
uh,
you know,
two points,

1459
01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:44.120
snicker bars or something like that.
Like it should have been like,
oh no,

1460
01:18:44.121 --> 01:18:46.640
I'm gonna just get you a bunch of vegetables and fruit and not have to worry

1461
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:49.130
about that.
I'm hungry.
You know,
you should be allowed to do that.

1462
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.590
That's how it should have been.
Anyways.
Every week I go,

1463
01:18:51.591 --> 01:18:55.880
I go to the farmer's market is I get strawberries or blueberries and
raspberries.

1464
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:56.931
I've got a cantaloupe,

1465
01:18:56.931 --> 01:19:00.140
I gotta find out by chop up my putting containers and you eat.

1466
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:01.370
If you're more than 300 pounds,

1467
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:04.430
you got to eat more than we got to eat fruit seven times a day to lose weight

1468
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:07.400
seven times a day.
You gotta eat fruit to lose fucking weight.

1469
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:11.000
Really now the sugar from fruit,
it's not bad for you.

1470
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.370
Not like the sugar that you put.
Well,
let me tell you something.

1471
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.870
Is it because it's attached to fiber?
Custom Natural Shit.
It's,

1472
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:22.900
I mean like is not bad for you eating a shitload of shit.
Yeah.

1473
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:24.320
Brilliant.
Six cans of coke.

1474
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:29.380
It's probably worse to have a diet coke than a regular Brian as always scared

1475
01:19:29.381 --> 01:19:32.870
the shit out of me because Brian knows always fucking putting down those

1476
01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:37.040
packages when I have coffee.
Like I'm always scared all equal and all that shit.

1477
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:41.470
Yeah.
And so now I read,
I read,

1478
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:47.990
I read last week that fucking sugar isn't really that bad feeling 10 days ago.

1479
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:51.500
That said is the amount that you have in a day that's bad for you.

1480
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.150
It's not that that day.
You know,

1481
01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:57.380
if you have 16 cups of coffee with 16 tablespoons,
oh sugar,

1482
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:58.820
it's gonna fucking kill you.
You know?

1483
01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:02.450
You know what sucks is how popular rainbows are lately.

1484
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.800
There was a double rainbow yesterday in Burbank and that was at staples and all

1485
01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.100
the,
and everyone ran

1486
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.960
<v 4>outside to take photos of it and I'm sitting here going,</v>

1487
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:12.030
I just need to check out.
I'm late.
I need to,
I need to.

1488
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.960
There was nobody in the store and they're all going double rainbow will come out

1489
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:18.120
as either people coming up.
Hey man,

1490
01:20:18.121 --> 01:20:21.540
it's just like you just can appreciate nature,
man.
It's like,

1491
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:26.280
maybe you need to fucking relax,
man.
Well,
all this bull shit that you see here,

1492
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.350
this is men made.
All right.
The real beauty is in nature.
It doesn't matter man,

1493
01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:35.250
whether or not you fucking get checked out in time,
right here is the Spooner.

1494
01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.630
Therefore,
oh,
now I'm looking at a Stevia.
I was just sad it.
Yeah,

1495
01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.530
but it's like before that video props to Dan Quinn,
before that video,

1496
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:46.210
there was no like freaking out on rainbows.
I thought it was like,

1497
01:20:46.211 --> 01:20:47.160
oh look a rainbow there.

1498
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:50.280
Now it's like people running outside to take photos of it for their Twitter just

1499
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:51.690
to get goddamn sheep.
Brian,

1500
01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.330
it's like we were talking about earlier with about Liberia.

1501
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.600
People get used to things being a certain way and then that's the way they are

1502
01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.750
to where they are now.
When you see a rainbow,
you freak out and uh,

1503
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.770
if you live in Portland,
Oregon,
you seen a rainbow every day.
Your life like,
yeah,

1504
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:06.800
no,
the one,
whatever.
It's fucking constantly raining.

1505
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.410
You see a rainbow or we pay your fucking life.
I'm going to run outside.

1506
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:14.430
It was weird though with that rainbow yesterday I was the closest I ever thought

1507
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:18.840
I got to the actual end of a rainbow.
Like I don't think it's Paul Leprechaun.
No,

1508
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.240
I don't think it's possible to,
can you get to an end of a random,

1509
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:23.880
I don't think it is.
It's like an optical illusion,
right?
Of course.
But there was,

1510
01:21:23.881 --> 01:21:25.830
this was the first time where I actually was like,
dude,

1511
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.430
it looks like it's right there.
The end of it.
And it was like a trader Joe's.

1512
01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:34.470
It moves as you move oil oil,
like in a desert type thing or you know,

1513
01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:38.160
we'll waste human waste is,
I mean maybe perhaps,

1514
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:43.290
but it was so weird because like it looked like literally like on the other side

1515
01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:44.670
of this building is the end of the rainbow.

1516
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:47.850
I've never seen it that close before it was fucked up.
Hmm.

1517
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.260
Maybe here ever chased a rainbow baby.
Everyone just doesn't know Brian.

1518
01:21:52.261 --> 01:21:55.410
And maybe there is some rainbows that are different than other rainbows and when

1519
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.530
you get to the end of them,
you find gold.
So I heard,

1520
01:21:58.531 --> 01:21:59.910
and you have to fight a Leprechaun.

1521
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:03.270
I heard somebody got a higher primate tattoo that posted on the forum.

1522
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:08.190
Some dude on a,
on my Facebook page,
he's got a higher primate,
a tattoo,

1523
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.120
by the way,
those t shirts,
I it or they're coming out with new designs,
right.

1524
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.180
Or something's coming up.
We got to watch a new show coming up.
I,

1525
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.970
that was one of my favorite tee shirts,
like the one that I have.

1526
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:20.960
I love that t shirt.
It's like fits perfect and everything.

1527
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.330
This is really not that terrible.
It's just the eyeballs are a little off,

1528
01:22:24.331 --> 01:22:27.960
but he can fix that easy.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
It's um,

1529
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.900
it's a good good that they're really cool man.
The guys who designed them,

1530
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:33.000
they're bad ass.
Yeah,
we've got some new shit coming out.

1531
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:35.910
We've got one coming out with Shiva gonna work on that one.

1532
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.450
Powerful Higher Primary Sheba.
I'm branching out son.

1533
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.640
I sold over a dozen of them shirts.

1534
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:46.750
I'm a goddamn entrepreneurial maneuvers.

1535
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.010
Some dude sent me this email.
Hey Man,
um,
uh,

1536
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:55.070
I want you to consider stop saying Cock sucker cause you stopped saying faggot.

1537
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:58.350
Now I'd like you to consider to stop saying cock sucker,

1538
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:00.810
but all I could think of was you.
I'm like,

1539
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.170
how am I going to do my Joey Diaz impression if I can't say Cock sucker?

1540
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.160
I'm going home.

1541
01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:09.790
<v 2>What the fuck?
Cock sucker.
I don't understand.
Look,</v>

1542
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.480
there's nothing wrong with sucking a cock and it's not,
it's not even a,

1543
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:17.590
a bad thing.
You know,
I mean if you want to suck cock,
you should suck a cock.

1544
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:21.070
It's like if you,
if someone called you a pussy eater,
it's really the same thing.

1545
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:24.770
Would I feel bad?
You calling me a pussy eater?
Shut up.
It's done.

1546
01:23:24.771 --> 01:23:27.940
Ball Cock sucker like that.
Call it more as the expression.
It's an exactly.

1547
01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:30.670
It doesn't immediately expression of love.
When I call you a cock sucker,

1548
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:34.480
if I don't call you,
then you should really think about what your fucking stand.

1549
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.580
Joey Diaz will call me anytime of the night and go what's going on?
Cock sucker.

1550
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.930
If I wore khaki liquor,
sometimes it's a cock liquor.

1551
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.910
Sometimes it's cotton like cause sometimes we're going to calm.
You got to sweet.

1552
01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.660
I don't take none of that shit.
It's nothing wrong.
It's nothing wrong with it.

1553
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.860
I know that sometimes it annoys people but it's only been a derogatory statement

1554
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:56.490
but it's still like I am.
If you're talking about in the show,

1555
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:59.410
you're talking about an act to talking about sucking a cock and it's not even a

1556
01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:03.870
bad person or nothing.
We can't keep making.
That's not the solution.

1557
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:07.450
The solution is not say less things.
The solution is be nicer,

1558
01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.990
is that the solution is not stopped saying cock sucker.
That's silly.
You're,

1559
01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:14.860
you're missing the whole fucking point.
You should be able to sell,
say anything.

1560
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:17.620
The only reason why you don't say anything because a bunch of people or a bunch

1561
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:18.700
of fucking sensitive constantly.

1562
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:21.880
You can't just keep explaining yourself over and over and over and over and over

1563
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:25.570
again.
We live in a very politically correct society.
Half of us,

1564
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:29.950
the other half a wild fucks like me.
And you know what?
This Day's I listened to,

1565
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:34.540
I listened to a cat podcast and the guy has his white as a Republican and as

1566
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:38.200
tight as he could be.
Blind joy.
You don't curse at all.
And I enjoy him.

1567
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:42.900
Well I don't,
you don't care to things interested in what you're saying.

1568
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:44.530
Yeah.
I don't like cock sucker.

1569
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:46.810
Go hang out with fucking Gaffigan or something like that.

1570
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:49.000
I don't give a fuck where you go hang out.
Here's the deal.

1571
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.640
We all know there's a bunch of different words and we can,
yeah,

1572
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:53.500
they just want use whatever words you want.

1573
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.670
What I want to know is who are you as a human and if you,
you know,

1574
01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:01.780
if you're judging someone by the words they're using and not judging them by who

1575
01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:03.550
they are,
you know,
come on man,

1576
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:07.480
like really you care if a guy swears you care if the guy you know talks about

1577
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:11.440
certain subjects that you know might be a bit controversial when you get people

1578
01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:13.630
that are like super sensitive about shit like that and it's just like,

1579
01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.000
come on man,
what's the point in even talking?

1580
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:20.620
I have never left the place even though I've had a bad experience with it and I

1581
01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:21.370
don't think it's time.

1582
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:24.130
I don't think no places worth going home and writing a letter.

1583
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:27.060
I went to a restaurant last week that was fucking horrible.

1584
01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:31.950
Why that we know whose fault it was.
Mine that I didn't go to the usual want.

1585
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:33.280
I think shit like Yelp.

1586
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:36.730
If you've had some bad situations and you know you can go to like Yelp and you

1587
01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:39.510
look and there's like a one star,
how many times did you go to college?

1588
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.950
Don't you walk to the back to get your check and they gave you a,

1589
01:25:41.951 --> 01:25:43.600
handed you a letter and you're like,
what's this?

1590
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.870
And there's a letter of fan row that you would sell to somebody.
You could,

1591
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:51.160
you said the word con cock sucker.
If you're going to go home and write a letter,

1592
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:54.250
because I said something,
honest to God,
I don't think you have a fucking life.

1593
01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:58.270
I have bad experiences and a lot of times I went to home buffet bird back two

1594
01:25:58.271 --> 01:26:02.800
weeks to go,
well,
this is that again.
I was starving.

1595
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.390
I was starving.
Applebee's

1596
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.970
<v 1>was passed.
I went shopping in that more there and I go,
how bad?</v>

1597
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:09.640
His hometown buffet.
Oh,

1598
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:13.730
Helen worsening or you get a salad and you can't get a fucking salad somewhere,

1599
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.730
right Brian,
when I tell you the salad dressings,

1600
01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:19.700
the salad was brown and why wouldn't you be able to,
why he,

1601
01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:21.950
shouldn't he be able to talk about this on a Yelp ad?

1602
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:27.950
[inaudible] fucking going there.
I'm an adult.
I'm a fucking adult.

1603
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:31.250
I know better.
I say to people,
here's why.
When people come up to me,

1604
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:34.790
especially people who live in California,
especially you two fucking mobiles.

1605
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:36.860
We didn't come up to me as somebody.
You went to see a movie.

1606
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:42.580
I want to stab yours because you see behind the curtain [inaudible] just want to

1607
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:45.170
go to the movies and then you just watch that movie the other day.

1608
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:47.540
That was awful.
What was the one we were just talking

1609
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:52.590
<v 4>at the beginning of the podcast you watched a Riley or though what?</v>

1610
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.310
The movie he said he was watching at the beginning of the podcast.

1611
01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.170
You watched a movie the other day and it was awful.

1612
01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:01.890
<v 1>I don't remember this.
I didn't say that,
but I didn't watch the whole movie.</v>

1613
01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.990
That title.
The island of Doctor Moreau.
Oh No,

1614
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:11.090
no book of Eli.
I took you off in 15 minutes.

1615
01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.810
I didn't get my stuff.
No,

1616
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:19.070
I would never take somebody else's opinion.
Listen,
if you went to see that,

1617
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.970
if you went to see that fucking movie with Angelina Jolie and that other fucking

1618
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.940
Momo who I love Donnie Brasco,
you're a fucking idiot.

1619
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:27.950
And you left there and said,
that wasn't what I thought it was.

1620
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:32.120
You should be shot on that thrown under the jail and then fucked in the ass by a

1621
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:36.470
bunch of runaway fucking slaves because you're a fucking idiot.
Donnie BRASCO.

1622
01:27:36.471 --> 01:27:40.950
Hey,
go see where they have slaves,
where they have slaves anywhere.

1623
01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.640
This lays around,
they really Houston,
they got those little Chinese women,

1624
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:46.870
they bring in these things and they got to pay money to get their uncle out of

1625
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.190
fucking whatever.

1626
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.270
If a gradation status and some shit you're gonna see now fucking CSM,

1627
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.300
the drifters repeat girls in Houston.
You have,
what's that called?
The,

1628
01:27:56.630 --> 01:28:00.770
uh,
human trafficking.
Human trafficking is very big in Houston.

1629
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:02.280
Very big in a couple of them.

1630
01:28:02.281 --> 01:28:05.960
So you think they should get fucked by human traffickers?
If they,
what if,

1631
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:09.650
what movie they do,
they like any movie that you go see,
you will,
like,

1632
01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:13.070
I read a Twitter the other day.
I went to see tron.
It was horrible.

1633
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:17.810
What would make you go see that fucking movie?
I saw tron.
It was Terry liked it.

1634
01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:19.910
He liked it.
I think it was that bad.
It was kind of interesting.

1635
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:24.140
Why would you go see that movie for the Three d three d?

1636
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.490
The whole concept to me was fast.

1637
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:30.050
<v 4>If you got really baked Joey and you saw a three d movie might be awesome.</v>

1638
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:33.100
It'd be like,
because I don't let stuff from me.
It might be for you.

1639
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:35.230
You like pay for the wall.
The only thing that was really,
wow,

1640
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.270
<v 1>I didn't like pink Floyd.
The Wall.
The movie.
I like pink Floyd.</v>

1641
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:39.104
The Wall alive too.

1642
01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:42.560
<v 4>Yeah.
Wear Three d glasses.
Did you see Troy and Brian?
No,
I,</v>

1643
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:46.620
I'm waiting for the madness to die down a little bit for to see half of those

1644
01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:50.990
shit movies and people realize that three Ds,
the Shit I to see her at.
Woah.

1645
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.690
What the fuck is fun,
man?
Listen Dude.

1646
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:56.840
It's just like watching the God damn comic book to me.
I liked comic books.

1647
01:28:56.841 --> 01:28:57.770
I liked him when I was a kid.

1648
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.130
I love your comic book movie and that's what our trauma was a comic book movie

1649
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:05.370
<v 1>comic books of telling you you like comic books.
Fuck yeah.
I used to,</v>

1650
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.490
I used to be into the fantastic four.
I had a place,
Bobby something.

1651
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:11.820
He used to collect things and we used to go up there by comic books from the
rob,

1652
01:29:11.821 --> 01:29:14.640
the good ones and take them to the city and Xcel.
Well Bobby,

1653
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:17.910
they call off one of these things.
I like things that aren't realistic.

1654
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:19.290
I think they're fun.
You know,

1655
01:29:19.291 --> 01:29:23.020
I don't mind her to the suspension of disbelief or comic book movie doesn't me.

1656
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.590
I love to be taken away for two hours,

1657
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.350
but tron don't take me away the whole time.
I'm thinking,

1658
01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.090
why the fuck that I come to this shit?

1659
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:34.110
Because if the weed store buying a bag of dope or something,
he kept me occupied.

1660
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:38.100
It wasn't,
we said,
go see half of you more than listen bro.

1661
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.080
That hangover that you people think is fucking great.

1662
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:43.110
I watched it and it was Robert Stevens is an admin.

1663
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.500
It was no pleasant movie.
It was fun as it was.
No,
it was no fight,
wasn't it bro,

1664
01:29:47.501 --> 01:29:49.710
please.
Because there's nothing to put up next to it.

1665
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:53.100
That's why there's nothing going on.
There was an auto,
I enjoyed it.

1666
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.550
It was the old cable.
It nothing was night.

1667
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.570
There was just not a groundbreaking subject.

1668
01:29:57.571 --> 01:30:00.990
A bunch of guys get fucked up and what did we do last night?
I mean it's not,

1669
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:04.200
but I thought it was well executed.
Were Shitty fucking society.

1670
01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:06.510
That's weak and that's why these movies go over now.

1671
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:09.990
They wouldn't go over 20 years ago when you hide,
had a higher quality of movies,

1672
01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:12.510
Bro.
These movies wouldn't fucking go on with that new one.

1673
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:17.160
That Fokker three looks like.
Aw.
Oh,
the third Fokker movie.

1674
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.250
That is a second form diarrhea right there.

1675
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:22.440
One of my idols that got me into this whole thing was when I seen dia hunter,

1676
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.900
well that scene fucking taxi driver and I seen De,

1677
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.390
they put that gun to his head and do all that shit.

1678
01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:29.610
I knew I was going to end up here,
but de Niro,

1679
01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:33.040
you got to stop it and stop Saturday night live to top it suck at Saturday
night.

1680
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.510
I'll fucking hard anymore.
And the choices you're making,

1681
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:40.890
you might as well do one Janya and shoot yourself with movies.
Tales of Jonathan.

1682
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.230
Just shoot your hands and Janya peep into what?
What's a shot?

1683
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:47.200
Fake Narnia to quilting.
Quilting.

1684
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:49.980
I don't want to really did he wrote I love you to death but let it go.

1685
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:54.720
He said it was going to character from
that.

1686
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:58.230
What was that?
Narnia movie chronicles and Janya.

1687
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:01.390
Whatever the fuck they got Narnia yanking out will revise.

1688
01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:05.250
Do when they tell me what it is Brian.
Yeah.
Shit.

1689
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:09.590
Chronicles of Narnia.
No,
but he wasn't in there.
No,
he was the other one.
He was,

1690
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.740
he was only Michelle Pfeiffer.
Insists in the phone.
Fucking some shit.

1691
01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:16.440
I would watch that if you fucking held a gun to my head.

1692
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:21.630
Just cause I got better things to do with my fucking time.
So,
um,

1693
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.560
why would you watch that?
I'm done with him and I'm also done with,
um,

1694
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:29.250
you know what's weird,
and this is off subject completely off subject,

1695
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:32.460
but I want to know what that movie was.
Chronicles of young Ya.

1696
01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.010
Let me tell you something.
First One star dust if you've heard.
That's it.

1697
01:31:36.011 --> 01:31:40.650
That's it.
I'll read this.
Lee Bad with Michelle.
Oh my God.

1698
01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:46.480
The movie theater that came up that came out a Friday at 1130 and it got

1699
01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:50.670
released.
This looks like some shit that was made,
but he got like,

1700
01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:55.580
so Saudi Arabian trillionaire like royal family member.
Listen,

1701
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:56.670
this is what we're going to have.

1702
01:31:56.671 --> 01:31:59.530
We're going to have ancient time [inaudible] coming in.

1703
01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.720
What about the radicals of God?
Yeah.
Not at all.

1704
01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:04.000
Chronic [inaudible] made like this is something different,
man.

1705
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:07.480
This is the star dust stewards in it.
Read the cast.

1706
01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:10.930
Did they wrote Michelle Pfeiffer.
Oh,
I don't know.
Let's see.

1707
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.500
And they tried to get pachino for Scarface,
Rudy and on Ganja for that.

1708
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:17.920
Whatever that shows those two on this by somebody else in that movie too.

1709
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:22.330
It so gross star dust.
That Green Horn,

1710
01:32:22.331 --> 01:32:27.100
it looks fucking bad too.
Ah,
that looks,
aw.
Carl's junior commercial.

1711
01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.330
Ah,

1712
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.790
Bruce Lee is in his grave making a comeback after he seen that fucking piece of

1713
01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:37.750
shit.
That's a piece of shit.
The kid didn't even know what the fuck it's about,

1714
01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:39.670
so let's just,
why the fuck are we doing?

1715
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:43.140
What do you mean the kid didn't know that fucking Monster Green fucking Horn

1716
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:46.540
Oregon.
That was nothing.
And they got some fucking Filipino to pay Bruce Lee.

1717
01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:49.630
I've got nothing against Filipino and my people,
you know what I'm saying?

1718
01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:51.520
But the guy was fucking Chinese.
You know what I'm saying?

1719
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:56.300
<v 3>Have you guys seen that musical,
that tray and Matt are doing in New York City?</v>

1720
01:32:56.301 --> 01:33:01.160

It's a musical about Mormons.
It's called like,

1721
01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:05.060
oh no,
dude.
One of,
one of my favorite things about Trey and Matt,

1722
01:33:05.061 --> 01:33:07.820
the guys that did South Park is that their musicals,
like they,
you know,

1723
01:33:07.821 --> 01:33:11.660
South Park was physical and he's had mechanical,
the movie musical and stuff.

1724
01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:16.100
This is a whole play based on Mormons and it's a musical.
Fucking

1725
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:21.410
<v 1>no star does got 7.9 stars.
Yeah,

Yeah,

1726

They got Ian,
Robert De Niro,
Michelle Pfeiffer,

1729
01:33:36.441 --> 01:33:40.940
Charlie Cox,
Kate McGowan.
Respectable people in this.

1730
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:43.780
I wonder who they got first that the connected everybody else too.

1731
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:47.120
Probably Deniro.
We have Robert De Niro.
This was a good movie.

1732
01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.830
What about the spider man playing with beautiful.
That's a fuck

1733

<v 3>about that.

1734
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.450

Ah,

What's his name?
He said something.

1735
01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:03.340
Did you hear about the Spiderman guy?
There's a play on a Spiderman play.

Oh yeah.
This,</v>

1737
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.200
this stunt man fell four times and they got bottle and the other fucking mobile.

1738
01:34:11.201 --> 01:34:14.440
The storm,
you know whole.
You guys will get to Julie Taymor.

1739
01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:16.060
We're going to pull this off.
First of all,

1740
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:20.680
it's a billion a week to keep the doors open.
Yeah.

1741
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:24.670
So what do you kind of,
let me kick it through on 60 minutes,
three weeks ago,

1742
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:25.853
publicized it.

1743
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:31.180
$1 million for production a week for a play in New York City.
What is this?

1744
01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:35.950
This is Spiderman.
The play.
What the fuck are they doing?
Just because Bono,
God,

1745
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.150
you mean Bono and the stall and rewrote it.
Wait a minute,
I bought,

1746
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:44.470
I know like the guy from u two he wrote this play.

1747
01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:49.120
We live in a Coen brothers movie.
We fucking do man.

1748
01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:50.050
Listen to what you said.

1749
01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.920
There is a fucking play and involves Spiderman and that's on Broadway and it

1750
01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:57.150
cost $1 million a week.
The bottom of the yeah.

1751
01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:01.410
Bottle and the storm wrote the music for it and they've had four shutdowns.

1752
01:35:01.411 --> 01:35:05.180
Hooray for poor people fall down because she wants to do like a thing where it's

1753
01:35:05.181 --> 01:35:09.410
a plague.
So do they do flips and shit,
brings people flying across lights,

1754
01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:14.450
but it's gonna cost or do so on a Tuesday night to go see this and this economy,

1755
01:35:14.451 --> 01:35:17.990
a million dollar production now at the five people fall in and all of the

1756
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:20.240
setbacks,
they're still like,
it's going to go on

1757
01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:25.570
<v 4>creative lost Damon Lindelof or whatever his name said with great power comes.</v>

1758
01:35:25.571 --> 01:35:28.000
Great response.
Wow,
Pam,
crash stinging.
You know,

1759
01:35:28.001 --> 01:35:30.790
he said that and I guess the stuntmen that did that,

1760
01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.550
it's like in serious condition may never walk again or something like that.

1761
01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:37.810
So we got a shitload of heat and so he wrote,
he retweeted the,
uh,
last night.

1762
01:35:37.811 --> 01:35:40.570
I had no idea to start.
It was so injured,
seriously injured,

1763
01:35:40.571 --> 01:35:44.890
bad tastes aren't as regards and hopefully a speedy recovery.
But he got,
oh fuck.

1764
01:35:44.891 --> 01:35:47.380
Like people were pissed at him for that tweet.

1765
01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:51.280
It's funny how tweets nowadays you can just say at twit and it could change your

1766
01:35:51.281 --> 01:35:55.330
whole career.
Who was,
who was really,
yeah,
you could say so douchey.

1767
01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:59.500
This is like watching CNN show Biz report.
They're like,
listen,

1768
01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.800
come back with everybody's talking about who's talking about it.
What?

1769
01:36:02.801 --> 01:36:06.930
Fuck at Bob off talking about the stats better.
The guy that he twitted okay.

1770
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:10.830
<v 1>Talking about this.
Who told them?
Who gives a fuck?
I give a fuck.</v>

1771
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.130
They were talking about why are we mind that talking about on TMZ,

1772
01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.260
people fucking stuck in some,

1773
01:36:17.261 --> 01:36:20.320
all of the ric cave at talking about it cause they got nothing better to do in a

1774
01:36:20.321 --> 01:36:22.990
jail cell.
People with lives don't give a fuck.

1775
01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.040
People with bills and mortgages don't give a fuck.
That's the book.

1776
01:36:27.041 --> 01:36:30.700
The book of Mormon that's there.
Uh,
the new musical.
Yeah.

For Real,</v>

1779
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.050
nobody has entertained me more than the South Park guys over over the course of

1780
01:36:42.051 --> 01:36:44.570
their,
their careers.
No one,
no one even comes close.

1781
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.630
Those guys have been putting out for over a decade.
Strong.
Yeah.

1782
01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.000
It was like when I first heard about them,

1783
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:51.680
I worked first watched the Brian Boitano.

1784
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:55.610
What would Brian Boitano do that was like,
shit that was like,

1785
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.920
it seems like that was like 98 or something like that.
Yeah.
That was so long ago.

1786
01:36:59.921 --> 01:37:02.540
It's a long ass time ago.
It seems like when I saw it,

1787
01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:04.040
it was somewhere around then.
Yeah.

1788
01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.310
What would Brambleton it might even been before 98 man,

1789
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:12.300
cause I think I was living in Encino.
Are you playing what?

Oh yeah,

You were in your like guy.
You have no idea what he fought in the body guy.

Okay.

1795
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:33.530
I'd be very happy.
Yeah.
Well you know what happened,

1796
01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.990

1807
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:36.950
they said that last Christmas Eve will last.
No,

1808
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.740
Gabriel did last Christmas Day.
He did four shows.

1809
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:44.040
The last show he took everybody and he had about two oh five in the morning.

1810
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:46.620
Gene Simmons included.
You had the whole play.

1811
01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:49.290
Took them all out to eat every live show.
Everybody.

1812
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:53.670
He took the whole crown out to eat three,
four of that fucking Holy Shit.

1813
01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:55.770
Have where?
Where the fuck did they fit?

1814
01:38:55.771 --> 01:38:59.910
Everybody is up in daddy's somewhere and they fit everybody in.

You're gene Simmons.

1818
01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.240

1821
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:20.160
You Watch it.
No,
I don't watch.

1822
01:39:20.161 --> 01:39:24.060

1823
01:39:24.061 --> 01:39:28.290
recommendation and my God,
is it good?
Yeah.
It's the best.

1824
01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.960
Don't get into that show.
This isn't even a good one.
Oh,
it's plenty.

1825
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:33.780
This isn't even a good season.
Yeah.

1826
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.910
Hear about any of the [inaudible] Andy Dick was on.
Yeah.
Oh,
you list a good.

1827
01:39:38.911 --> 01:39:42.240
So this is a bad lived with any tech for five years.
It's not lived with him,

1828
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:45.280
but we're good enough.
I don't need to see that show.
I hope Andy's,

1829
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.120
we were just talking about a hundred grand for 21 days.

1830
01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:50.960
They're they to heal you to let me tell you something,
man.
This,

1831
01:39:50.961 --> 01:39:52.800
this episode's getting me man or this,

1832
01:39:52.801 --> 01:39:56.880
this season's get me if this isn't a good one.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1833
01:39:56.881 --> 01:40:00.810
You got to say is Eric Roberts is fucking fine.
Okay.

1834
01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.200
Eric Roberts is surrounded by these maniacs and nuts and all.

1835
01:40:04.201 --> 01:40:06.060
He's hooked on his weed.
Yeah.
Okay.

1836
01:40:06.150 --> 01:40:09.760
So every day people are going through dts there,
shake lifeguards.

1837
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.360
Try and fucking fix.
He's like,
I gotta get Outta here.
I gotta get Outta here.

1838
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:14.330
I gotta get Outta here.
I gotta get Outta here.
Meanwhile,

1839
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:16.830
Eric Roberts has got his reading glasses on.

1840
01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:20.150
Is Drinking a cup of coffee looking through the paper like a gentlemen.

1841
01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:23.970
There is nothing wrong with that guy,
Eric Roberts.
If you're out there,

1842
01:40:23.971 --> 01:40:27.690
if you're listening,
listen to me,
man.
You don't need to stop smoking weed.

1843
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:31.290
You just need better people to smoke weed with.
That's what your problem is.

1844
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.060
You're freaking out.
You're by yourself.
Okay.
What about that Billy?

1845
01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:37.560
The kid or the kid?
That poor kid.
Man,

1846
01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:39.690
that poor kid is in a terrible situation.
We,

1847
01:40:39.691 --> 01:40:43.250
he's raised by some fucking cut bag that didn't pay attention to them and it's

1848
01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:47.330
the dad was never knows.
I like last season.
It's sucks,
man.
It sucks.
But you know,

1849
01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.640
that's how you raise a shitty kid.
I'll be digging for a mess,
man.

1850
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:54.430
You could tell suck.
Oh,
I bet she's going to tell me.

1851
01:40:54.431 --> 01:40:58.540
She's gonna say she looks like she's flushes water dirty.
What about the model?

1852
01:40:58.630 --> 01:40:58.990
You know,
she,

1853
01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:02.550
her eyebrows were freaking me the fuck out them eyebrows were not where they're

1854
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.980
supposed to be.
John.
It was driving me nuts.
Well,
they're not drawn on man.

1855
01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:10.210
They're just pulled up way up.
She's not that old man.

1856
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.160
She's a young girl and she's pretty enough.

1857
01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:14.920
Like she doesn't have to keep fucking with herself.
It's like girls,

1858
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.800
they get to a certain point where tronic continually tweak things.

1859
01:41:17.801 --> 01:41:22.450
Like you got to realize that any guy who would give a fuck about those minute

1860
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.730
differences that you're trying to sort out in your face,

1861
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:28.900
that guy's a douche bag or shoes.
Yeah,
they would come by just fucking let it go.

1862
01:41:28.901 --> 01:41:31.870
So you're going to get a line in your forehead.
We're all going to die.

1863
01:41:31.871 --> 01:41:35.140
You're going to be fun.
But that fucking line grown you,
your about the line.

1864
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:39.100
The kid dropped last week.
This may appear line of wall

1865
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.810
<v 1>time on a reality show.
What?</v>

1866
01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.530
It was an argument that in a kid actor from the hills goes,

1867
01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:46.340
<v 2>I've been in a rehab.
I'd never seen anything like that.</v>

1868
01:41:46.341 --> 01:41:48.560
I've never seen anything like this.
Eight rehabs.

1869
01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:52.790
And you're still trying fucking move kid.
He's like 25 rehabs.

1870
01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:57.270
Eight we had,
you haven't figured out.
Fuck it.
I'm balls on prop out old oldest,

1871
01:41:57.271 --> 01:41:58.230
that dude and he's been to eight

1872
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.060
<v 1>rehabs,
three rehabs.</v>

1873
01:42:00.061 --> 01:42:04.350
I went to one because they made me go in a halfway house because I came back

1874
01:42:04.351 --> 01:42:08.670
half away.
Cocaine as it goes through your skin when you wait on the scale.
Oh,

1875
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.250
so I came back hot.
So I said to you,

1876
01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.720
we put you back in jail for six months or you have to go to a rehab and I found

1877
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:17.400
as a rehab in boulder that all you had to do was go from two to six and you'd be

1878
01:42:17.401 --> 01:42:21.080
healed in four weeks.
Ah,
boulder ate it right up and leave.

1879
01:42:21.081 --> 01:42:23.490
You're going to go to and they want to like a grand and that's it.

1880
01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:25.590
And had to go from two to six and I would go down,

1881
01:42:25.591 --> 01:42:28.470
I got a little chick that was there.
Her name was Patrice twining from Michigan.

1882
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:31.890
She was sucking my Dick every afternoon during the break,

1883
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:35.670
like from two to four and then for Florida for 20 we can have a cigarette break

1884
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.180
and she'd suck my Dick.
I do align with her at the fucking thing.

1885
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.430
<v 2>I appreciate that.</v>

1886
01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.790
I appreciate Rehab for some people and I think we both know people that just

1887
01:42:43.791 --> 01:42:45.440
cannot do things.
They just,

1888
01:42:45.441 --> 01:42:49.100
whatever the fuck it is where they do a bump or they smoke a joint or they do a

1889
01:42:49.101 --> 01:42:53.380
shot,
they are going to go off on a goddamn blackout adventure of death.
And

1890
01:42:53.850 --> 01:42:54.750
<v 1>here's the real problem.</v>

1891
01:42:54.751 --> 01:42:57.990
And you know this because you have an addictive personality to games and pool,

1892
01:42:57.991 --> 01:42:58.890
and we've discussed this

1893
01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:04.500
<v 2>say gays or games.
It's really weird and Brian knows as we've all discussed this,</v>

1894
01:43:04.501 --> 01:43:05.670
but he was going to

1895
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:12.120
go to 50 fucking rehabs and unless you're ready to quit,
you ain't going to quit.

1896
01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:15.220
Yeah,
it doesn't.
You know,
here's the,
here's the bail issue,
here's right,

1897
01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.770
here's the real issue.

1898
01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:21.570
They're not using all of the best methods that are available.

1899
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:22.800
It's very simple.

1900
01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.920
If you look throughout human history as the number one most effective way to get

1901
01:43:28.321 --> 01:43:30.660
over in addiction,
it's Ibogaine.

1902
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.800
I bill gained the super psychedelic drug that's illegal in America.

1903
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:39.030
People have taken that stuff and it's got some insane rate of,
of healing.

1904
01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:43.080
People from addictions like ruin the 90% and you're talking about when you're

1905
01:43:43.081 --> 01:43:45.570
talking about 90% of people that are addicted like God,

1906
01:43:45.571 --> 01:43:47.820
and a lot of them have to go back to the same environment.

1907
01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:52.400
A lot of people are impulsive,
but it's such an insanely introspective

1908
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:56.930
<v 1>experience.
You see all of your wiring and where things are going wrong.</v>

1909
01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:01.430
Why were the wrong connections?
We don't allow any eyeopening shit.

1910
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:04.550
You know why?
Because it makes no money.
Because if we did that,

1911
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:07.550
there'd be no rehab.
You know we're going to wait.
Well,
no,
it's not even that.

1912
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:10.280
It's like you can't,
and here's the funny thing about weight watchers.

1913
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.110
It's a corporation for you to lose weight,

1914
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:15.020
but they don't want you to lose weight Guy Guy.

1915
01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:17.180
It's not that they don't want to heal you.

1916
01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.370
They haven't thought about it this far in advance.

1917
01:44:19.371 --> 01:44:23.090
It's that there's no money in the cure.
I began whatever it is,
it's,
it grows.

1918
01:44:23.091 --> 01:44:24.260
It's the same thing like marijuana.

1919
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:27.980
It's 4,000 for the treatment to get the on the doctor in your room with the

1920
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:29.920
blood pressure to check your blood pressure,

1921
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:33.890
the street days of sweating and psychedelic logical trips and we'll whole thing.

1922
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:38.000
We can open up rehabs where people go into that page 8,000 and get,

1923
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:39.320
he'll never have to go back,

1924
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:43.700
but the rehabs that around the open now they get money from repeat business.

1925
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:46.850
They want you to get healthy,
but they don't really want you to get healthy.

1926
01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:50.160
The FDA really pat,
I really believe it.

1927
01:44:50.161 --> 01:44:53.780
I think I really evolved and treatment or trying to help people.

1928
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:58.010
I really do that.
Try to help people.
They really are trying to help Brian out,

1929
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.510
but the fucking odds,
the recidivism rate,

1930
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:04.070
I don't think they know about Ibogaine.

1931
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:08.900
I think there's a very small percentage of the people that are involved in any

1932
01:45:08.901 --> 01:45:12.480
addictive behavior counseling.
Like,
you know,
like if you look at like,

1933
01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:13.520
like doctor drew,

1934
01:45:13.521 --> 01:45:18.521
like he doesn't even don't even consider a psychedelic drug trip to cure you of

1935
01:45:18.771 --> 01:45:21.800
addictions.
He would never consider it if you,
but hold on a second.

1936
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.090
If you look at it on paper,

1937
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:25.430
if you'll get the people that have actually experienced these things,

1938
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:29.480
like it looks like there's something there and it looks like it was not just

1939
01:45:29.481 --> 01:45:31.940
like with actual studies they've done on everything.

1940
01:45:31.941 --> 01:45:35.030
I read about it as very popular thing.
I read about it positive.

1941
01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.880
If I come to you right now and say,
Joe Rogan,
guess what?

1942
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:40.860
You're not going to have to ever go on the road and do comedy no more.

1943
01:45:40.861 --> 01:45:43.780
We're going to build this stage right here and you're going to do comedy on
this,

1944
01:45:43.781 --> 01:45:47.090
a new system and we're going to do comedy at the computer and people don't even

1945
01:45:47.130 --> 01:45:49.760
eat to leave the house anymore to leave the house.

1946
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:53.390
Or you don't get to watch county,
right?
Watch comedy from the House alive.
Well,

1947
01:45:53.391 --> 01:45:55.640
this is sort of an extension of that is going to take,
well,
oh,

1948
01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:56.930
now you're not seeing where I'm going with that.

1949
01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.490
That's going to take a piece of money out of your pocket.
It is.
If I started,

1950
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.940
if I avoided comedy clubs and just started doing thing on the computer and

1951
01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:07.160
people could see if the free and you couldn't tour that.

1952
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:09.980
That's what I'm trying to say to you.
If they'd bring this Ibogaine in,

1953
01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:12.680
you're only going to come to my rehab one time and get healed.

1954
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.920
The percentage rates are going to be lower,
so you take the money out on my part.

1955
01:46:15.921 --> 01:46:20.180
I don't want to hit right.
I don't think that's the case.
I really don't.

1956
01:46:20.181 --> 01:46:23.270
I don't think that these rehab centers don't want to heal people and they want

1957
01:46:23.271 --> 01:46:26.030
to keep people.
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that.

1958
01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:29.360
I don't think you know of reality and reality.
They know about it.

1959
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.470
The FDA will not approve it.
Yes.
With 10 until the FDA approves it.

1960
01:46:33.471 --> 01:46:37.220
They won't do it 10 years away,
2015 years away from the FDA approved it,

1961
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:42.490
but it's because they found in his seventies like Carl Sagan talked openly about

1962
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:46.820
how easily marijuana would be legal within a decade.
They were like,

1963
01:46:46.821 --> 01:46:47.631
it was just inevitable.

1964
01:46:47.631 --> 01:46:49.980
It's not going to be legal for another two or three years is

1965
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.170
<v 4>will not get marijuana.
Yeah.
Well No,
I don't.</v>

1966
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:54.810
I don't even believe that anymore after this stupid law.

1967
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.010
If he can't pass in California,
come on man.
This is the,
if you don't,

1968
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.490
this is the law.
The apex of the information age was,

1969
01:47:02.491 --> 01:47:07.370
it was like sloppy was completely,
completely thrown together.
Sloppy.

1970
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.200
Oh,
it's like their way through ignorance.

1971
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.960
There was like a bunch of things like that law would have pass it so it was

1972
01:47:12.961 --> 01:47:15.660
legal to smoke weed at work,
you know,

1973
01:47:15.661 --> 01:47:19.170
as an example and stuff like it was just thrown together really bad.
Yeah.

1974
01:47:19.210 --> 01:47:21.960
That's what,
that's what a lot of people who are against it.

1975
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.860
We have to look this up.

1976
01:47:22.861 --> 01:47:25.890
You can't say this unless we know for sure that that's one of the things I know,

1977
01:47:25.891 --> 01:47:29.410
but we have to be careful.
[inaudible] have to be care.

1978
01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.640
Society to hit say promises in 19 position 19 there was things like that thrown

1979
01:47:35.341 --> 01:47:38.130
in there,
like multiple things just like that that were thrown in there,

1980
01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:41.070
that were just sloppy and even people that wanted that,

1981
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:43.140
the legalize marijuana,

1982
01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:45.930
they didn't like it because it was just fucking thrown together bad.

1983
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:49.560
But if anything it showed that it was,
you know,
the next time it's on,

1984
01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.200
if they have some more time to write it better and stuff like that,

1985
01:47:52.201 --> 01:47:56.280
it probably will pass.
I think it was that the growers were saying don't vote.

1986
01:47:56.410 --> 01:48:01.220
Yeah,
well go into pot shop.
You're going to have hot shots.

1987
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:04.470
People would say not to vote for her because then they would go under.

1988
01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:07.260
That would be the problem said.
First of all,
no one would have,

1989
01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:09.390
you wouldn't have to go to these places to buy your pod.

1990
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.270
We wouldn't have to be licensed.
Not necessarily because these are medical place.

1991
01:48:13.710 --> 01:48:18.630
11 totally different reason for selling.
You can't mix the medical places with,

1992
01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.840
you know,
with places that are just for profit.
Only the,

1993
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:24.940
I'm sure you would have to have different laws that it'd be,
but wow.

1994
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:28.080
Pot-Smoking at work.
Glue Group claims his true.

1995
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:31.410
That's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard.
By the way saying this,

1996
01:48:31.411 --> 01:48:34.530
this law was stupid.
I mean it was,
it was sloppy and stupid.

1997
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:37.800
That's why I didn't pass.
It wasn't a good written law.
Somebody was,

1998
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.220
somebody was stone when they wrote that law.
They didn't think it out.
You know,

1999
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:45.750
the California Chamber of Commerce claimed in legal analysis released Thursday.

2000
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:50.751
Their proposition 19 would lead to more workplace accidents by forcing employers

2001
01:48:50.851 --> 01:48:55.680
to let workers smoke pot on the job.
See these fucking greedy stoners.

2002
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:59.100
You greedy.
It's a retarded.
Oh my God,
that's amazing.

2003
01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.450
I thought that that had to be wrong.
I was like,
I bet he's got it.
Like,
Oh,

2004
01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:08.330
if it's a job that you don't operate,
I love you man.
God,
come on faith,

2005
01:49:08.410 --> 01:49:12.060
dude.
I do have faith,
but occasionally we both know you sick.

2006
01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:16.760
You say some crazy shit.
It's occasionally,
don't,

2007
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:20.520
you know,
never to go.
All this stuff.
I say there's,
there's some truth to it.

2008
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:24.040
I'm like Alex Jones to dog toto.

2009
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:27.780
I saw Alex go into co raising the other day.
I saw some fucking thing.

2010
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:31.170
We were talking about deep population.
So it's happened and it's all going on.

2011
01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.220
Just one of just go grab the guy and go get him a drink.
Come on.

2012
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.590
Did you ever see him dressed up as the joker?
No.

2013
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.440
Youtube that Alex Jones a joker.

2014
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:43.530
He's dressed as the joker with like the blood on as much to talk about Alex,

2015
01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:45.150
because the video is coming out this week.
Right?

2016
01:49:45.151 --> 01:49:48.190
We're going to have it done this week.
I love Alex Jones.
Like people

2017
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:51.220
<v 2>think,
oh,
Joe Rogan is logos.
Jones thinks I was chosen.
Idiot.</v>

2018
01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.690
That I love that guy.
He's fun.
He's my friend Izzy,
right?
I don't know.

2019
01:49:55.691 --> 01:49:59.110
It's all right.
Oh look,
I got more important things to think about.

2020
01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.380
I'm worried about the universe.
Okay,
ladies.
Gentlemen.
I'm worried about aliens,

2021
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:07.570
which I worked for NASA.
Fuck,
okay.
I'm worried about really,

2022
01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:08.980
really interesting things to me.

2023
01:50:08.981 --> 01:50:12.520
Whether or not Alex Jones is right about everything.
That's interesting as well.

2024
01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:15.560
I mean this,
the study of the human race to the fall of room,

2025
01:50:15.561 --> 01:50:16.930
seeing all this crazy shit go on,

2026
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:20.680
seeing how much of it is just nonsense and crazy talk like they're going to put

2027
01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:24.460
chips in your cornflakes and it's gonna,
you know,
come on.
How much is that real?

2028
01:50:24.490 --> 01:50:27.100
I don't know.
But I do know he's right about a lot of things.

2029
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:30.850
There's a lot of shit going on,
man.
We're seeing,

2030
01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.940
we're seeing much more exposure of all the corruption in all levels of

2031
01:50:35.951 --> 01:50:37.060
government.
You know,

2032
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.090
much more exposure than anybody that ever had access to before and the

2033
01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:43.630
government doesn't give a fuck that we know.
Yeah,
they don't give a fuck.

2034
01:50:43.631 --> 01:50:46.080
They cannot do anything about doing.
No,
we can't.
You know,

2035
01:50:46.081 --> 01:50:49.600
think about Alex Jones is that he's great and he exposes us to a lot of things

2036
01:50:49.601 --> 01:50:52.060
and some of it is useful.
Some of it isn't.
At the end of the week,

2037
01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:53.620
there's nothing we could do about it.

2038
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.830
There's not much we could do it by them because nobody's going to even fucking

2039
01:50:56.831 --> 01:50:59.860
get together.
The sign not going to put none together.
Here's reality,

2040
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:02.140
here's reality and this is where it's going to get sound really strange.

2041
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.790
This is what we can do about it.
There's not no,

2042
01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:06.010
there's nothing we can do about it.

2043
01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:09.190
[inaudible] as far as going out and I mean look,

2044
01:51:09.191 --> 01:51:10.480
Obama thought he was going to change things,

2045
01:51:10.481 --> 01:51:13.750
so I have many gotten the office guy wins the fucking Nobel prize then sends

2046
01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.860
30,000 more troops to Afghanistan if he really thought that he was going to be

2047
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:20.170
able to do anything differently.
Once you get in an office,
once you get in there,

2048
01:51:20.171 --> 01:51:23.590
you kind of understand you're dealing with a machine that is just fucking beyond

2049
01:51:23.591 --> 01:51:26.950
your comprehension,
so intertwined with corruption,

2050
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:30.790
but this is what you can do well you can do is what we're doing well you can do

2051
01:51:30.791 --> 01:51:32.080
is with anybody out there who's doing,

2052
01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:37.081
who's showing a more positive example and giving you a more fun and happy way to

2053
01:51:37.691 --> 01:51:38.470
live your life.

2054
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:42.820
You inspire people to potentially live along those same lines and that's what

2055
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:45.370
you can do and that's what you could do with art and that's what you could do

2056
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:48.640
with writing and that's what you could do with any form of expression.

2057
01:51:48.850 --> 01:51:51.550
And that's what you can do if you express yourself and let people know that

2058
01:51:51.551 --> 01:51:53.890
that's how you're living and this is the fun way to do it,
man.

2059
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.200
You don't have to be a con.
You don't have to be a Douche bag.

2060
01:51:56.201 --> 01:51:57.940
You don't have to be out there raping the world,

2061
01:51:57.941 --> 01:52:00.460
like that's not the right way to go about it.
It's not fun.

2062
01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.150
You just need a lot of people to recognize that vision and see it and realize,

2063
01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:06.400
hey,
we are only here for a short amount of time.

2064
01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:09.550
If you go around saying it's all about me living like life,

2065
01:52:09.551 --> 01:52:11.920
like a fucking Douche bag,
when it's all over,

2066
01:52:12.190 --> 01:52:14.320
you're going to have just a wreck of a life.

2067
01:52:14.321 --> 01:52:15.730
You're not going to be enjoying yourself.

2068
01:52:15.731 --> 01:52:17.620
You're not going to be having a good time through this fucking thing.

2069
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.660
If we can all recognize that we really could put this place in a different

2070
01:52:22.661 --> 01:52:23.260
frequency,

2071
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.260
we really could make human beings respond and behave on a better level than

2072
01:52:28.601 --> 01:52:29.434
we're doing now.

2073
01:52:30.150 --> 01:52:33.650
The only way that we're going to do it is to electrify the young.
You've got to,

2074
01:52:33.651 --> 01:52:37.120
you got to get in their head.
You've got to inspire these people.

2075
01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:39.790
There's people out there that are hearing some of the shit that you're saying

2076
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:43.360
this the shit that Brian's saying,
some shit that Duncan says on this podcast,

2077
01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:46.910
you're hearing all this shit and it's,
it's ringing in their mind.

2078
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:48.530
They're hearing Eddie stories.

2079
01:52:48.531 --> 01:52:51.710
You know when he starts talking about Jujitsu and breaking down life and in

2080
01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:52.890
breaking down his own,
you know,

2081
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:55.250
his own ability to figure out things and you know,

2082
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:57.470
people hear about shit like that,
man.

2083
01:52:57.471 --> 01:53:00.080
It gets you thinking and you start questioning like,

2084
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:02.930
how have I been managing my life?
If I've been doing the same thing,

2085
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:07.100
I will now be inspired to manage my life in a similar fashion and live in a

2086
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:07.730
happy,

2087
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:11.300
positive way and don't get stuck in some fucking trap and don't think that this

2088
01:53:11.301 --> 01:53:14.750
thing is it permanent because it's not permanent.
If you go around live in like,

2089
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:15.860
you know,
you could just keep,

2090
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:18.800
keep up with this shit bag life and eventually some day you're going to get a

2091
01:53:18.801 --> 01:53:19.550
nap.

2092
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:21.800
You know you're going to get a a point in your life where you can settle down

2093
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:24.920
and relax with that points on fucking happen in man,
that's not gonna happen.

2094
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:28.130
Shit begets shit and it's just gonna get worse because your health is going to

2095
01:53:28.131 --> 01:53:33.080
fail on you.
Keep it together.
Bitches very cheerful.
The re no,

2096
01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:36.620
it is a cheerful message because the reality is the only way to do it is to

2097
01:53:36.621 --> 01:53:41.360
really,
if you really want to change the world,
you have to inspire young people.

2098
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.360
That's how you change the world.
The world isn't.

2099
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.960
People that don't have mortgages.

2100
01:53:44.961 --> 01:53:47.510
The world is in people that can still create new things.

2101
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:49.790
The world is in people that can still take chances because they don't have to

2102
01:53:49.791 --> 01:53:53.930
worry about coming home to take care of their kids.
The world is in chances,
man.

2103
01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:57.420
You could still inspire chances.
You can still inspire thinking.

2104
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.360
It's still inspire positive energy.

2105
01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:03.830
Mad Flavor is all up in this bitch,
right?

2106
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.290
The fuck you talking about?
Fuck,

2107
01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:08.950
I'm talking about an orange fucking suit on with goggles.
You.

2108
01:54:08.970 --> 01:54:12.490
You know what I'm talking about?
So my eyes,
you're fixing the world.
Joe Dixon,

2109
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:15.860
a one guy at a time.
One tree at a time.
I got to compete with Paris Hilton.

2110
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:18.680
You follow me?
Who?
I ain't doing shit for fucking nobody.

2111
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:22.220
I'm not looking to save the world.
I'm just looking to get a few fucking labs,

2112
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.840
smoke a few joints,
get healthy,

2113
01:54:23.841 --> 01:54:27.140
love my wife and my cats and be able to have a good time when I'm hanging out

2114
01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:30.170
with you.
Mother fuckers and part of doing that is inspiring other people.

2115
01:54:30.171 --> 01:54:31.910
Part of doing that is making other people laugh.

2116
01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:34.890
When you're doing that and you're inspiring people and making other people how

2117
01:54:34.891 --> 01:54:37.670
you are literally creating a better environment,
you're,
you're,

2118
01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:40.430
you're forcing people to be happier.
Not forcing them,

2119
01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:43.220
but you're helping people to be happier and you're moving them along in a good

2120
01:54:43.221 --> 01:54:45.020
direction.
That's the future.

2121
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:46.820
That's the only way that we're really going to have a future.

2122
01:54:46.821 --> 01:54:50.770
We gotta work together.
Brian,
it's your move.
Uh,

2123
01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:54.800
do you that comic books now Brian's just gonna Masturbate watery sperm on is,

2124
01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:58.230
I'm going to Disneyland for Christmas belly.
I'm kind of nervous.

2125
01:54:58.231 --> 01:54:59.300
I've never been to Disney land.

2126
01:54:59.301 --> 01:55:02.270
Last time I was at Disney road was like 11 years old or something like that.

2127
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.440
It's really fun when there's no one there.
Why would you want to go on a day?

2128
01:55:06.441 --> 01:55:08.020
What's going to be moms?

2129
01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.040
<v 7>It's Disneyland.
Mamako Christmas I thought.
Yeah,</v>

2130
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:12.810
<v 2>and what did the</v>

2131
01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.810
<v 7>bad,
really bad</v>

2132
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:18.210
<v 2>stay the fuck.
Let's see.
If you want to go,</v>

2133
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:20.580
what you're supposed to do is go while the kids are in school.

2134
01:55:21.150 --> 01:55:23.020
You don't need to go on a special day son.

2135
01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.330
[inaudible] that hasn't really even Jesus's birthday.
Okay.

2136
01:55:27.331 --> 01:55:30.720
Jesus is born in June or some shit.
Right?
This is fake.

2137
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.780
You get in the hotel room to now this is going to drive up and sunny,

2138
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:37.830
say five minutes.
Pagans man,
it was their holiday.

2139
01:55:37.831 --> 01:55:40.440
It was the winter solstice man in like,
you know,

2140
01:55:40.441 --> 01:55:43.420
in order to get the Pagans to be Christians,
they combine holidays.

2141
01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:48.090
That's certainly don't go dude,
go on like a Tuesday day.
Yeah.

2142
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:51.420
Do you want to get there early?
For some reason I thought it wouldn't be crowded.

2143
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:53.190
Oh,
you're crazy.
Crazy is always crowded.

2144
01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:55.350
I heard two weeks ago is crowded on Saturday.

2145
01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:58.020
He said it was the most grounded he's ever seen in this fucking line.

2146
01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:02.370
You don't appreciate Disneyland until you have little kids.
Right?
Oh my God.

2147
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.930
When I take my little daughter to Disneyland,

2148
01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.750
I have never had this much fun in my grown life that I can remember just taking

2149
01:56:08.751 --> 01:56:12.870
her around and just like getting on the tea cup rides and Deborah going to do

2150
01:56:12.871 --> 01:56:13.890
this ride.

2151
01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.750
Do Dutch like so excited at every turn,

2152
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:22.560
like giant joyful smiles and you see these kids running around you go,

2153
01:56:22.561 --> 01:56:27.540
now I get it.
Yeah,
but I always thought of it as like,
it's a pain in the ass.

2154
01:56:27.541 --> 01:56:31.410
My parents are yelling at me,
don't go any way I can get out of here.
You know?

2155
01:56:31.411 --> 01:56:35.190
It's like I came here by myself when I was 10 and 11 and shit.
Really?

2156
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.113
I used to come out of here.

2157
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:41.090
My uncle would drop me off at Disneyland so low the fucking day out there and

2158
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.360
fly back to New York a week later.
Wow.
Dot Yourself,
Huh?
God.

2159
01:56:45.361 --> 01:56:49.800
You meet friends there and fuck friends.
I was living in New Jersey.

2160
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:54.150
I'm from New Jersey.
I'm going to fucking Disney land mugging kids in those days.

2161
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:57.170
Yeah,
my snap dropped me off one time.
He's done candy canes out.

2162
01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:00.200
Then the next day he couldn't go,
so he just dropped me off.

2163
01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:03.360
I don't want to deal with like 100 bucks and I get to blow in the tea cups

2164
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:12.060
and was not a small room for me.
You never seen anybody have fun?

2165
01:57:12.061 --> 01:57:14.880
You don't experience joy like joy through a little two year old,

2166
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:18.600
that's your two year old and she's running around a park having a good time.

2167
01:57:18.601 --> 01:57:22.110
I'd ride like I totally understand that all now man.
I used to like,
look,

2168
01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:22.741
I swear to God,

2169
01:57:22.741 --> 01:57:25.160
I used to like look at people that had kids and look at the things that they

2170
01:57:25.161 --> 01:57:27.390
were doing with kids and I would say,
yeah,
you know,

2171
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:30.930
hey look at this guy loves his kid and this wife loves her kid but now here they

2172
01:57:30.931 --> 01:57:32.130
are hanging out at Disneyland.

2173
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.800
They don't want to be in fucking Disneyland like they want,
they want to be home.

2174
01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:37.110
I did.
I never really understood that.

2175
01:57:37.111 --> 01:57:39.990
When your children are having fun and they're laughing,

2176
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.560
you like laugh with them,
you have fun with them.

2177
01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:47.310
I never kind of got that until I had kids.
You know what I mean?

2178
01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:50.880
So it's like I always said,
well you're happy for them.
Sure.
Like you know,

2179
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:53.250
they'll look at the kid's happy.
Oh I'm happy to.
That's great.

2180
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.210
But it's not that man,
it's your happy to,
you're with them.

2181
01:57:57.211 --> 01:58:01.320
You're like one of them.
Like when they get excited and jump around and laugh.

2182
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:06.300
You get like this charge through your body.
It's like the furnace of,
of,

2183
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:08.370
of whatever the fuck that's in you,
your soul,

2184
01:58:08.371 --> 01:58:13.290
your spirit is like the door opens to the furnace and like winds of pure oxygen

2185
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:15.120
blow on it.
That's what it feels like.
It's like,
oh,

2186
01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:17.010
like everything fires up and it's like,

2187
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:20.940
you just like have this insane feeling of love and happiness.

2188
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:24.690
Watching these little kids have a good time laughing and joking around and

2189
01:58:24.691 --> 01:58:27.780
cackling and just having so much fun.
And you know,

2190
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:30.150
putting on a little princess dress.
I am a princess.

2191
01:58:30.151 --> 01:58:31.410
I always thought that would be annoying.

2192
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:35.160
But you don't realize it's not even a little annoying.
It's awesome.
Yeah.

2193
01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:37.380
You know,
it's a crazy thing,
man.

2194
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:40.380
I always say that having children is just like having mushrooms.

2195
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.950
If you haven't done it,

2196
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.030
<v 4>shut the fuck up because you really don't know.
You really don't know.</v>

2197
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.720
Having children is a strange trip,
man.

2198
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.280
So strange.

2199
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:57.070
Plus every ever been around children and watch pink Floyd the wall anyway.

2200
01:58:58.510 --> 01:59:01.990
By the way.
Have you been to [inaudible] Jewish terrorist.com what is that?

2201
01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:04.210
It's a awesome web [inaudible] dot org I'm sorry,

2202
01:59:04.410 --> 01:59:07.630
I filthy Jew as terrorist.org is a great website.
One of my favorite websites,

2203
01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:10.360
and I just noticed that Ra Hsa fears on the front page of it.

2204
01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:14.740
He's a terrorist and then there's some sort of comedy.
No.
Is that racist?

2205
01:59:14.741 --> 01:59:17.950
Jew Ari Shaffir posing as a racist KKK.

2206
01:59:17.951 --> 01:59:21.220
Klansmen the Jews are the most vile racist creatures on the face of the earth.

2207
01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:24.250
Look at this joke going around the hood somewhere deep in the black neighborhood

2208
01:59:24.251 --> 01:59:25.001
in the inner city.

2209
01:59:25.001 --> 01:59:28.840
Ghetto deep in the United States of America that you attempted to pose like a

2210
01:59:28.841 --> 01:59:33.220
clan member while making races and Dr. Morgan Marks.
Rogatory yeah,

2211
01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:37.370

But anyways,

2212
01:59:37.410 --> 01:59:40.780
belted you.
terrorists.org why don't we,
maybe we shouldn't want to promote that.

2213
01:59:40.810 --> 01:59:42.400
No,
I wouldn't promote it.
This is awful.

2214
01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:47.080
Oh fuck you doing man now always going to get all this hate mail.
I'm sorry.

2215
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.650
My mom is the one that told me about this website.

2216
01:59:50.651 --> 01:59:53.920

All right?
Actually you have to tell them about it.

2217
01:59:53.921 --> 01:59:57.550

You Fuck?
Oh,
how come you didn't tell him about it yet?

2218
01:59:57.551 --> 02:00:00.100
You decided to broadcast that shit all throughout the world that a bunch of

2219
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:05.050
people who hate hate him.
Sorry,
Ari haters and you're giving them all this props.

2220
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:07.180
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you have any self control,

2221
02:00:07.181 --> 02:00:10.510
please do not go to that website.
Do not support these terrible people.

2222
02:00:11.230 --> 02:00:14.590
They need Jewish,
uh,
flashlights like a difference.

2223
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:19.120
And plus I use a different kind of vagina that the Jew has teeth.

2224
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:21.940
And how's Keith?
Stinky.

2226
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:31.330

One stunk.
And um,

2227
02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:34.420
did this,
this is one have a reason for stinking that you could discern.

2228
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:39.640
I don't know.
She was just a Vegan.
Just always was like a dirty hippie at heart.

2229
02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:44.970
Now what it's think like did smell like a,
but just smelled like cheese poured.

2230
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.750
Showering,
poor showering.
Okay.
No more comments.

2231
02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:53.620
More comments from Mr Reichel.
How rude.
I'll tell you what,
man,

2232
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:56.290
I've done some kissing and tell you back in my day.

2233
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:59.830
But what are you talking about?
Nice.
This was like 10 years ago.
I stopped.

2234
02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:02.980
This was 10 years ago.
I'll go when you realize it hurts their feelings.

2235
02:01:03.010 --> 02:01:07.030
This is a 10 years ago.
There's girl things to talk about.
Definitely.

2236
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:09.810
I don't even know who this was in Ohio too is a different kind of smell that

2237
02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.200
they come from.
I know it's the cow milk or the milk.
The grass out there.

2238
02:01:14.201 --> 02:01:15.550
They're more,
they're more hardy.

2239
02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:21.250
They get more cow antibiotics and their diet.
Yeah.
The Fuck Joe D is,
look at him.

2240
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:26.350
He's looking at me.
He's like,
you have this poor kid.
He's lost.
He's lost man.
Boy,

2241
02:01:26.351 --> 02:01:30.410
he's got his little Zack.
A man was Zack Calvin atmosphere.

2242
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.780
Well,
they say that when,
um,
there's,
uh,

2243
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:39.100
I think I got this right when there's not as many men around,

2244
02:01:39.650 --> 02:01:40.070
um,

2245
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.300
<v 2>men should start shaving their head,
their,</v>

2246
02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:44.540
their face and start like getting more feminine.

2247
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:49.760
But when there's a more men around,
men started growing facial hair.
Really?
Yeah.

2248
02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:52.460
So almost like to let all the men know that they have testosterone,

2249
02:01:52.461 --> 02:01:55.190
they grow the facial hair to let them know and when there's an abundance of

2250
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:58.310
women and uh,
not that many men that men get all fucking girly,

2251
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:02.690
they start shaving,
wearing Cologne and shit.
You Wear Cologne Joe Death.

2252
02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:04.560
I like fuck Outta here.
Right,
right.

2253
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:07.960
<v 4>That's what I'm talking about.
Give me some of that man that wears Cologne.</v>

2254
02:02:07.961 --> 02:02:10.160
I don't trust.
I don't trust in me that hide and some,

2255
02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.290
especially if you wear some rappers colonial fuck a year as a tip.

2256
02:02:14.291 --> 02:02:18.790
Most girls that I've met,
I've met love Cologne.
They're the ones that buy it.

2257
02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:22.530
Here's a tip.
So give me on you broken bitches.
Yeah,

2258
02:02:22.531 --> 02:02:25.580
but I'm not trying to hit on you.
I don't care if you don't like the smell that,

2259
02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:30.060
that I spray on me.
But I spray one the spray and that girl smelled it nailed.

2260
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:33.310
Those girls are broken or broken.
It's like shoes.

2261
02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.080
Like I don't give a fuck about shoes,

2262
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.640
but if I buy a certain kind of shoe that I certainly,

2263
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:41.620
you know what girls liked it?
They like what smells like the inside of a cage.

2264
02:02:41.710 --> 02:02:45.520
That's what they like.
They like would older Musk.
Yeah.

2265
02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:49.360
That's just been running through a forest trying to catch them and fuck them.

2266
02:02:49.390 --> 02:02:51.480
That's when he said that that's the smell they liked.
You know,

2267
02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:56.440
glade like the kitchen,
glade shit.
They have this new kind that smells Musky.

2268
02:02:56.441 --> 02:02:59.620
It's most like a Persian nightclub.
And so now,
uh,

2269
02:02:59.650 --> 02:03:03.110
the other day my friend sprayed it in my house and now my,

2270
02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.900
it doesn't smell like Lysol.

2271
02:03:04.930 --> 02:03:09.220
It smells like Persian nightclub and it's made by the glade company.

2272
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:13.870
It's like axe body spray,
Lysol.
It's,
oh,
that's awful.

2273
02:03:13.871 --> 02:03:17.890
Here is like some bachelors scent.
Yeah,
that's a really,
yeah.
It's like,

2274
02:03:17.891 --> 02:03:21.160
it's like a Cologne for,
what's it called?
What do they call it?
It's called

2275
02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.360
kitchen sensations or something stupid like,
Oh,
you just spit off.

2276
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.510
It's like a poor Noman.
Yeah,
it just sensation.
Sounds like porno.
It's good.

2277
02:03:31.511 --> 02:03:32.344
It's fucking portal.

2278
02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.850
Could you imagine if that was some fucking CIA shit?

2279
02:03:36.850 --> 02:03:40.960
If they came out with some stuff that made people fuck like mad dogs and it was

2280
02:03:40.961 --> 02:03:42.940
one of those plugins they started wall,

2281
02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:45.430
like they just wanted to do some population studies.

2282
02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:47.710
So if they can just up the population in neighborhood,

2283
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:51.520
so they start selling in a very controlled market like Cleveland or some shit.

2284
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:55.280
They start selling these little glade air fresheners.
Wicked cheap.
Yes.

2285
02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.870
Start giving them away.
You know,
Oh,
you buy a fucking a Futon,

2286
02:03:58.871 --> 02:04:01.930
you get a free glade,
you know,
hard on air freshener.

2287
02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:06.610
Start sticking these things in the wall and people will just start going crazy.

2288
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.870
Just fucking the shit out of each other.
The koolaid hard on,
listen man.

2289
02:04:10.871 --> 02:04:12.580
They could have something like that that affects your behavior.

2290
02:04:12.970 --> 02:04:15.760
You know when they were,
when the Iraq war first star jumped off,

2291
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:19.090
they were seriously considered trying to figure out how to make a gay bomb.

2292
02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:23.320
They were trying to figure out a way to drop something on these guys that would

2293
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:27.220
be like some sort of ecstasy concoction that would just make them super horny

2294
02:04:27.221 --> 02:04:28.870
and loving each other and started hugging any,

2295
02:04:28.871 --> 02:04:31.660
we'd kill morale and they would just,
their army would just fall apart.

2296
02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:37.410
That's how devious the scientists we have working for us are all got to blow

2297
02:04:37.411 --> 02:04:38.100
this pop.
