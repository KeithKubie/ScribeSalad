GAURAV CHAUDHARY: Hi, my name is
Gaurav Chaudhary, better known

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.270
as Technical Guruji
to the internet.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.350
[SPEAKING HINDI] I come
from India, living in Dubai.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.650
I've been making YouTube
videos since October 2015.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.580
I make two videos every day,
making videos in the flight,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.970
on the beach, in the
mountains, on the streets,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.530
every day without fail.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.635
I just decided to use
this power of YouTube

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.800
to share some of
my tech knowledge

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.890
to the masses in
India in a way that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.270
is very easy to understand.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.350
So I just started creating
tech videos in Hindi.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.445
Talking with Google I/O, it
is always a huge excitement.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.660
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.830
I mean, this is the day when we
expect some new, crazy things

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.640
to happen.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.910
Getting updates on
all the new projects

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.170
directly from the Google
team-- and of course,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.580
all the development around
Android-- always charges me up.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.710
This year at I/O 2018, I plan
to experience it all in person.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.240
Thank you.
