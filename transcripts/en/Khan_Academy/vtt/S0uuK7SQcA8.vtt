00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.560
Welcome to the presentation
on dividing decimals.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.620
Let's get started
with a problem.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:23.925
If I were to say how many times
does 0.28 go into 23.828?

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.320
So you're going to see that
these dividing decimal problems

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.480
are actually just like the
level 4 division problems.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.730
You just have to figure out
where to put the decimal.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.060
So what you do is you always
want to take this decimal and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.180
move it over as many spaces
as necessary to turn this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.380
number into a whole number.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.670
So in this case, we have to
move it one space, two spaces

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.680
over to put the decimal here.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.230
Well, if I did that with
this number I have to do it

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.350
with this number as well.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.595
So I moved it over two spaces
to the right, so I have

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:54.370
to move this decimal two
spaces to the right-- 1, 2.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.950
Decimal goes here, and I
put the decimal right

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.450
above, right there.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.570
Now I can treat this
28 as a whole number.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.460
And if I want to, let me see if
I could-- well, I want to erase

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.210
the old decimal because if you
were doing it with a pen you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.540
would kind of have the
same problem I have.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.450
So now we do it just like a
level 4 division problem.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.950
So we say, how many times
does 28 go into 2?

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.260
Well, no times.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.100
2 is smaller than 28.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.780
How many times does
28 go into 23?

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.600
Once again, still, it goes
into it zero times because

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.820
23 is smaller than 28.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.110
How Many.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.570
Times does 28 go into 238?

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.680
So let's think about that.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.320
28 is almost 30.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.170
238 is almost 240.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.940
So 30 goes into 240 eight
times Because 3 goes

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.630
into 24 eight times.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.480
So I'm going to guess that 28
goes into 238 eight times.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.690
And it literally it a guess.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.380
You have to try out some
numbers sometimes.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.250
8 times 8 is 64.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.200
 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.620
8 times 2 is 16.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.260
Plus 2 is 22.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.470
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.590
Subtract.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.390
I get 14.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.410
I guessed right because the
remainder when I divide 28 into

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.030
238 and I say it goes into
it eight times is 14,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.480
which is less than 28.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.740
So 8 was the largest number of
times that the 28 could go into

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.120
238 without being larger.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.600
So now I bring down this 2.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.170
Once again, you recognize this
is just purely a level 2

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.110
division problem-- a level
4 division problem.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.180
So now I say, how many
times does 28 go into 142?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.980
Well, once again, I'm
going to approximate.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.360
28, it's almost 30.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.900
Let's see, 30 times 4 is 120.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.400
So yeah, I'll take a guess
and I'll say let's say it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.490
goes into it four times.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.770
I could be wrong, but let's
see if it works out.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.980
Let me get rid of this old 6.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.710
4 times 8 is 32.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.960
And 4 times 2 is 8.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.440
Plus 3 is 11.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.790
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.480
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.830
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.410
Huh.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.600
Interesting.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.640
So it turns out that my
remainder here is larger than

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.410
28, so I actually could have
divided 28 into 142

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.860
one more time.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.450
So let me go back
and change that.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.130
See, it's not a
mechanical thing.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.330
And if you feel unsure
sometimes, you just have to try

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.780
numbers and see if they work.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.360
And otherwise, you raise or
lower the number accordingly.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.410
So let me erase that 4.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.480
 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.640
I'm going to try
not to mess up.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.130
Erase all this stuff down here.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.790
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.420
I probably should have tried it
out on the side first before

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.230
doing all this and I wouldn't
have had to go back

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.270
and erase it.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.510
And then let me get back
to what I was doing.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.800
So when I went into it four
times the remainder was too

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.710
large, so let me try five now.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.350
 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.590
5 times 8 is 40.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.890
5 times 2 is 10.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.910
Plus 4 is 14.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.890
 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.530
142 minus 140 is 2.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.950
Good.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.900
2 is less than 28.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.200
This 5 is correct.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.910
Now I just bring down the 8.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.500
28 goes into 28
exactly one time.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.154
1 times 28 is 28.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.320
Remainder of 0.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.340
Done.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.610
So 28 goes into
2,382.8 85.1 times.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:03.550
Or you could say, 0.28 goes
into 23.828 85.1 times.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.300
That's the answer
we had gotten.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.540
And that makes sense.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.740
It's always good to do a
reality check because if I took

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.070
85.1 and I multiplied it by
0.28, it makes sense that

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.110
I'd get a number around 23.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.770
0.28 is almost 1/3.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.060
So 23 is almost 1/3 of 85.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.820
So at least it makes
sense in rough numbers.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.600
When you're doing decimals, if
I had gotten 800 here instead

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.530
of 85, I'd be like, oh,
well, 0.28 times 800?

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.820
I don't know if that equals 23.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.270
So it's always good to just do
a reality check and get a sense

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.710
for at least the magnitude of
what your answer should be.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.660
Let's do another problem.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.740
 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:58.130
Let's do 3.3 goes into 43.23.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.490
That's a 3.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.340
So first thing we want to
do is move the decimal.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.230
We just have to move it one
space here, so we move it

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.870
once space here as well.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.300
Put the decimal right up here.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.200
And now it's just a level
4 division problem.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.480
33 goes into 4 zero times.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.880
33 goes into 43 one time.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.830
That's easy.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.680
1 times 33 is 33.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.540
Do the subtraction.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.400
43 minus 33 is 10.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.830
Bring down this 2.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.180
33 goes into 102?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.300
You could eyeball that one
and say, about three times

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.740
because 3 times 33 is 99.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.520
 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.240
3 times 33 is 99.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.570
102 minus 99?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.380
Well, that's easy.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.760
That's 3.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.440
We just bring down this 3.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.500
33 goes into 33 one time.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.720
1 times 33 is 33.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.360
 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.330
0.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:06.010
So 3.3 goes into
43.23 13.1 times.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.470
Or, if you move the decimal
over, and when you move the

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.230
decimal over to the right one
spot, all you're doing is

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.940
you're multiplying both the
divisor and the dividend by 10.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.030
Which is fine as long as you
multiply both of them by 10.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:27.830
It's also like saying 33
goes into 432.3 13.1 times.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.830
Let's do one more problem.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.390
I think I have time.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.290
YouTube puts a limit
on this stuff.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:44.310
so let's say 2.5 goes into
0.3350 how many times?

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.860
Well once again, let's move the
decimal point over one here.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.780
So we move the decimal
point over one here.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.660
Put the decimal here.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.140
So how many times
does 25 go into 3?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.580
Well 0.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.790
So you could put a 0 here
just for fun if you want.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.470
How many times does
25 go into 33?

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.990
Well, it goes into it one time.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.950
1 times 25 is 25.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.120
33 minus 25 is 8.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.490
Bring down the five.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.730
25 goes into 85?

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.440
Well, we know 25 times 3 is 75.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.920
So it'll go into
it three times.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.080
3 times 25.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.000
We know that's 75.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.040
85 minus 75 is 10.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.890
Bring down the 0.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.220
Up here we had brought
down the 5 before.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.300
And 25 goes into
100 four times.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:42.920
So our answer is 2.5 goes
into 0.3350 0.134 times.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.680
So as you see, the only
difference step between what

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.360
we're doing when we're dividing
decimals and when we're doing

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.510
level 4 division is we just
have to make sure we get the

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.070
decimal in the right place.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.620
You shift the decimal here
enough so that this becomes a

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.450
whole number and you just have
to shift the decimal here

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.910
the same number of times.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.600
And once you do that it
just becomes a level

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.950
4 division problem.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.080
And the whole trick with level
4 division is always be willing

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.330
to try numbers, and if
the numbers don't work,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.240
adjust them accordingly.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.450
Don't feel that there should be
a way that you can just always

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.380
power through these problems.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.320
You have to do a little bit of
trial and error and maybe use

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.070
your eraser or do some work
on side every now and then.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.140
But anyway, I think you're
ready to do some dividing

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.960
decimals problems.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.010
I hope you have some fun.
