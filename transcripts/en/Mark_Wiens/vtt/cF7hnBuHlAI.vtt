00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.190
(lively salsa music)

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.260
- This is the definition of a meat sauna.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.540
This is an ultimate fiesta in here.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.310
It's just a party in the
middle of the morning,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.220
a meat party.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.550
All the action, the energy in here.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.570
The meat love is out of control.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.653
(lively salsa music)

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.340
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.520
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.080
I am in Oaxaca City and Oaxaca is known

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.830
for having some of the best,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.520
one of the ultimate food
cultures in all of Mexico,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.720
so I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.590
We're gonna walk around today,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.010
we're gonna go visit some local markets.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.370
We're gonna eat some amazing Oaxacan food,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.680
we're gonna visit some attractions.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.610
We have one full day in Oaxaca City.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.690
We're gonna make the most of it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.850
and I'm gonna share it all with you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.734
in this video right now.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:54.401
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:19.310
A cup of hot chocolate, mixes
it up twirling that stick.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.560
Oh man, this is a frothy, bubbly cup

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.030
of fresh hot chocolate, Oaxacan-style.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.203
Oh, wow.

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:34.999
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.662
We decided to try a Tamal de Mole,

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:52.690
and it's steamed in a corn husk.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.160
There's the masa and then you
can see the Mole underneath.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.250
Okay, let's try this.

00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:00.700
Oh, oh it's so hot!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.310
I love how that's just stuffed,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.820
it's just packed, it's
just oozing with Mole.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.290
And you can taste the
dried chilies in there.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.600
You can taste a little
bit of a chocolatey flavor

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.510
and then it's all wrapped
up within that corn meal.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.560
I need a sip of hot chocolate after that.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.810
Oh, we are off to an amazing start.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.970
That was just my first bite

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.760
and my first beverage
of the day in Oaxaca,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.420
and it was fantastic.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.860
Oh, and that's making me excited.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.157
We need the bunny hat.

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:35.800
(people chattering)

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Oh that hits the spot in the morning.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.845
That's wonderful.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:40.239
- Mark, Micah wants this hat.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.072
- Micah.

00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:43.264
(upbeat music)

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:44.097
It's 8:00 a.m. right now

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.050
and we're starting off this morning

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.870
at Mercado Abastos, which is the biggest,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.900
it's the largest market in Oaxaca City.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360
It's absolutely gigantic.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.270
You can find everything
here from fresh vegetables

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.210
and seafood, oh, lots and
lots of seafood, to fruit.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.320
Anything, (speaking foreign language).

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.440
Also, we're gonna also find
a lot of pre-cooked food here

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.190
that we're gonna eat for breakfast.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.420
If you need a new pair of underwear,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.360
if you need a pet, if you
need fruits and vegetables,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.720
this is the market to come to.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.168
Oh, we're coming to the
food section right now.

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:21.835
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:31.190
(lively salsa music)

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.610
Some of the stalls are still opening

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.730
because I think they open
around eight or nine,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.880
this whole entire market,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.320
but this stall back here
is just absolutely packed.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.260
It's called Comedor Lupita.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.030
I'm not even totally
sure what they serve yet,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.230
but there are a lot of people here.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.660
You know it's gonna be delicious,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.402
so we're gonna stop here
to eat whatever they serve.

00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:51.540
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.710
Shrimp soup or fish soup?

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.809
Shrimp soup or fish soup?

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.809
(people chattering)

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.936
They put a ball of masa in the,

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.529
what is that called, a flattener,

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.900
and then they flatten it into a tortilla

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.013
and then the tortillas go

00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:13.846
onto the comal,

00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:16.230
which is a hot stone, and
then they just bubble up.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.900
So we got fresh tortillas here,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.870
we got the Caldo de
Pescado, which is with fish,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.460
a fish soup, and then Caldo de Camaron,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.640
which is the shrimp soup.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.020
For the Caldo de Pescado,
it comes with a whole fish,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.110
just overflowing over the bowl.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.300
I'm just gonna taste that broth first,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.962
before I add some seasoning.

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:36.511
(people chattering)

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.180
Mm, it's a little bit tomato-y.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.990
You can taste some herb in there.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.340
And you do taste the
full effect of the fish,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.430
that's a little bit fishy.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.609
I'm gonna squeeze in some lime.

00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:48.190
(people chattering)

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.750
And they also have some onion
and peppers and cilantro,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.030
which is all communal, which
you can add to your soup.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.810
I'm gonna add a bunch of onions
and peppers and cilantro.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.900
Oh yeah, this is gonna be amazing.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.490
And then also some cilantro.

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:04.050
(dishes clattering)

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.240
Okay, and then for this bite,
I gotta go into the fish.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.780
Oh yeah, I'm not sure
what type of fish this is,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.470
but it's a whole fish in here.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.170
Look at all that meat on the side.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.610
Oh wow, that's hot.

00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:18.676
(people chattering)

00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:25.030
Mm, oh the fish is awesome!

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.890
Mm, it's really like silky in texture.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.890
Actually the broth tastes
a little bit seafood-y,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.590
but the fish is very
like pure, very clean,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.930
not fishy tasting at all.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570
I can't wait to try one
of these fresh tortillas,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.450
and I think the easiest thing
to do, is to just roll it up

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.449
and you kinda eat it
like bread on the side.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.427
(people chattering)

00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:50.427
Mm, mm-hmm, the tortilla's a
little bit on the drier side.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.120
You can taste the fresh corn.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.040
Actually it only tastes like pure corn,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.140
maybe just with water in it.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.530
It's good, it doesn't taste
like oily whatsoever at all.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.850
Okay, one more addition to the soup

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.720
that I didn't know they even
had on the table is this salsa.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.710
I gotta add some.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.060
(dishes clattering)

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.685
(people chattering)

00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:11.957
- [Man] This is what made
you want to come, right?

00:06:11.957 --> 00:06:13.130
- Yeah, this market?

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.740
No, I had no clue where to come here.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.288
We were just gonna walk around
and see whatever looks busy.

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:21.760
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.830
Oh, oh that salsa is nice.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.840
A little bit sour, and
green chilies, which are,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.170
I think they're roasted.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.728
You can taste a smoky flavor to them.

00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:32.870
Mm, this is a very soothing,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.810
very warming dish to eat in the morning.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.650
I'm loving it.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.480
Next I'm moving over for the
Camaron, which is the shrimp.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.310
Squeeze in a little more lime.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.670
Okay, take a look at this.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.750
This is the same soup base,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.850
but full of big shrimp with
the head on, full shrimp.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.780
So, I'll actually just take
this guy with my fingers,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.719
pluck off that head.

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.802
(lively salsa music)

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.340
Yeah, that's a good fresh shrimp,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.040
then we follow with some of the soup.

00:07:07.418 --> 00:07:09.900
Mm, yeah, this is a wonderful dish.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.570
Taste that with a tortilla.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.823
Both of the soups are excellent,

00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:19.630
just depending if you want,
and they taste the same,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.480
it just depends if you want
shrimp or if you want fish.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.960
I like them both.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.090
Probably I like the fish better,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.190
it's a little more meaty.

00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:30.462
Mm, mm, (speaking foreign language).

00:07:30.462 --> 00:07:32.528
- [Woman] Ha, ha, ha.

00:07:32.528 --> 00:07:33.400
Ha, ha, ha.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.670
- One more thing that I
had to try is their coffee,

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.910
because of how they serve it.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.810
They serve it with a spoon,
they serve it in a clay cup.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.090
You can smell the coffee in there

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.060
and then you can also really
smell chocolate in there.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.238
It's okay to pick this up, right?

00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:48.527
(lively salsa music)

00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:49.881
- [Woman] Oh.

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:50.714
- Ah!

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.470
It's very light.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.560
It's not like a strong coffee,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.750
it's a very, very light coffee,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.890
almost like you're just drinking water,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.800
hot water with a little
bit of coffee flavor

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.000
and then a little bit
of a chocolate flavor,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.790
but I mean, you can't think
of it like an espresso,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.920
or like a strong coffee.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.070
And what's also cool is that
you can see your reflection

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.380
in this bowl of coffee.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.060
If you look down you could
use it like a mirror.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.610
Can you see my face down there?

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.040
This is a massive clay cup of coffee.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.980
I'm gonna be peeing like
crazy in about an hour.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.330
This was a great place.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.420
They're really friendly,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.880
very popular local place for breakfast,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.240
and yeah, that just hit the spot.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.740
It's, you know, it's like
very warm and soothing,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.010
it's comforting.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.474
That's what you need in the morning.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.474
(people chattering)

00:08:40.744 --> 00:08:43.827
(lively salsa music)

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:46.820
Okay, and I am loving the produce here.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.500
There are so many different
types of chilies, lots of fruit.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.800
The passion fruit is gorgeous.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.540
There are mangoes.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.470
There are berries.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.930
There's a lot of
interesting and unique herbs

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.740
and vegetables here, and especially things

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.380
that look like they're kind
of wild-foraged vegetables.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.767
Yeah, this is a great market.

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:07.089
(people chattering)

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:09.672
(upbeat music)

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.170
One of the things that
I notice just walking

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.003
around the market,

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:19.740
especially the vegetable
and fruit section,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.940
is that they have a lot
of both tropical fruits

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.590
and vegetables, as well
as more like dried,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.690
arid-climate fruits and vegetables.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.838
So it's a huge mix of such a diversity

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:35.020
of fruits and vegetables,
and that's why, I mean,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.213
that's part of what makes
Oaxacan cuisine so diverse.

00:09:38.213 --> 00:09:40.796
(upbeat music)

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.590
This is my kind of a market.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.580
There's an entire lane that's just garlic.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.800
There's so much garlic.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.670
There's just an abundance
of everything actually

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.131
in this market.

00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:55.798
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.740
We're just completely
lost within this network,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.900
within this labyrinth of a market,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.120
but we could see the smoke
pouring out of this stall,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.930
and we knew it was a
place we needed to stop

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.687
for our next thing to eat.

00:10:11.687 --> 00:10:14.687
(people chattering)

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.850
(tortillas sizzling)

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.420
She works so fast but you can
tell she loves what she does.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.390
I can't wait.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.390
I can't wait to try it.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.160
And those salsas just look insane,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.570
in huge mortars, stone mortars.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.635
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:50.721
(people chattering)

00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:55.539
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.870
In order to make our
Memelas, what she does is,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.670
she first pounds the
masa, she pounds the masa,

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.490
then it grills over the hot metal plate,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.660
which is sitting over charcoal.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.780
And we got the one with meat,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.280
so she takes a really thin strip of meat,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.780
she puts it into a little grill.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.610
She sticks it underneath the hot plate,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.270
which is where the coals are burning.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.340
So that roasts until it looks
like charred, fully charred

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.180
then she adds on something called asiento,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.700
which is, she explained
to us, is sort of like,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.400
I think it's a lard, a pork lard.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.490
Spreads that on, then she
adds some of the salsa

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.490
from this giant salsa
stone bowl, stone mortar.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.010
And then after that, she
sprinkles on some queso,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.010
which is cheese and then finally we got

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.090
that piece of meat all on top.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.900
It's so hot, it's so fresh.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.870
Okay Carlos, you ready?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:00.703
- [Carlos] Ready, let's do it.

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:01.830
- Yeah, these are so juicy,

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.153
they're just dripping with salsa.

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:06.736
(upbeat music)

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.233
Oh.

00:12:12.144 --> 00:12:13.977
Mm, oh that is insane.

00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:17.356
Carlos.

00:12:17.356 --> 00:12:18.189
- Mm-hmm.

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:19.022
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:19.022 --> 00:12:21.513
- Mm, good.

00:12:21.513 --> 00:12:22.750
- It's so good.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.390
You can really taste that salsa in there,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.750
which is like very smoky,
a little bit spicy.

00:12:28.732 --> 00:12:32.399
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:42.310
That's just outstanding.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.380
Definitely my favorite part

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.200
of that entire Memela is that salsa.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.434
The complexity of flavor in
that salsa will blow your mind.

00:12:50.434 --> 00:12:53.130
(people chattering)

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.260
Whoa, I'm so happy right now.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.830
Wow, that was absolutely phenomenal.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.460
So flavorful, I absolutely loved it,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.160
and she's so friendly, she's
so nice, she's so caring.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.800
Oh man, what a wonderful lady.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.610
I have no idea how I can
explain where this stall is.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.380
It's somewhere within
the thick of the market.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.400
You just gotta walk around

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.810
but you will find little gems
like that without a doubt.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.100
What a market.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.480
This is a place you have to visit

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.800
when you're in Oaxaca City.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.710
This is the type of market I
could literally just hang out

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.460
for the entire day, just
explore, walk around,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.860
see new things, and eat!

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.020
But we have a lot more to do today,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.610
so we gotta move on and we're gonna head

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.140
to the center of the city now.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.360
(car horns honking)

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.670
The weather is actually perfect today,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.270
and it's actually not that far

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.103
to El Zocalo,

00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:46.290
which is the (speaking foreign language),

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:48.520
so we're just walking over there,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.130
and we're about to reach the old town.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.521
(tapping)

00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:54.985
(people chattering)

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:57.643
(speaking foreign language)

00:13:57.643 --> 00:13:59.810
(tapping)

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.220
We cannot make it very far in Oaxaca

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.160
without finding more food.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.580
The food here is so good!

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.380
So she has this giant pot

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.380
of slow-bubbling pork and
pig parts, which is Carnitas

00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:16.938
and then they're just
braising in their juices.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.310
Right as we were walking past,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.720
she pulled out the bubbling heart,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.910
and Carlos and I decided that we needed

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.660
to have a quick taco
before we continue on.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.690
We cannot make it far!

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.620
She chopped up the heart then
she added it into the tortilla

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.260
and then she added some
guacamole, some cilantro,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.160
and maybe a little bit of salsa.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.210
Or maybe that's some green salsa as well.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.250
(people chattering)

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.973
Oh man.

00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:48.830
Mm, oh that's delicious.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.850
Heart is so tender.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.250
It's not even iron-y at all,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.410
and then that guacamole in there.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.860
There's a little bit of salsa

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.400
and the cilantro comes in nicely.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:03.072
Oh man!

00:15:04.096 --> 00:15:08.470
That heart is so tender,
it's not even like,

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.600
you know heart can sometimes
be a little crumbly and dry?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.507
That is so moist.

00:15:14.507 --> 00:15:17.270
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.744
Wow, that was superb.

00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.701
It's so (chuckling),

00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:25.570
that was one of those
impulse food purchases

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.620
that there was just absolutely
no way we were gonna pass by

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.520
on the sidewalk without tasting that.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.410
We had to.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.810
Okay, we're on our way to El Zocalo now.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.790
Oh, there's just so much food.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.070
Okay, we can't stop,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.500
we can't stop, we gotta keep on moving.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.817
But I want to so, I wanna stop so badly.

00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:41.650
(laughing)

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.091
There's so much good food, it's endless.

00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:46.674
(upbeat music)

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.260
(people yelling)

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.970
We're almost to the
center but we came into a,

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.480
it's a huge protest.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.470
Many of them are doctors and nurses.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.630
I think protesting some
kind of a health issue,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.890
but we're gonna just
kinda walk along with them

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.150
to the center there

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.560
and then visit the main
plaza of Oaxaca City.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.349
(people yelling)

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.370
It looks like the entire
city of Oaxaca has gathered

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.240
in the center there and it's
so busy that we don't even,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.590
I think we're gonna avoid it right now.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.040
Maybe we'll have a chance
to come back later today,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.500
but instead we're gonna go eat some more

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.060
at another market which is a
very, very well-known market,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.870
especially for their grilled meat.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.730
This is the place I was looking forward,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.504
have been looking forward
to coming for years!

00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:46.087
(upbeat music)

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.520
Welcome to Mercado 20 de Noviembre,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.340
which is also known as the
Grilled Meat Alley of Oaxaca.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.780
There's so much meat here!

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.400
You choose your meat, they
grill it for you fresh.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.150
Oh, this is the place for
meat lovers, that's for sure.

00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:08.804
(lively salsa music)

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:12.340
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.907
(lively salsa videos)

00:17:15.907 --> 00:17:19.574
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:27.929
(lively salsa music)

00:17:32.563 --> 00:17:36.230
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:42.824
- Enchilada.

00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:43.930
- [Mark] Enchilada, ah.

00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:48.126
(lively salsa music)

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.330
There's about 40 or 50
or maybe more stalls,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.490
all with an assortment of different meat

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.070
and I think they all pretty
much have the same things.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.770
There's beefsteak, there's pork steak,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.050
there's longanisa, the sausages,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.990
there are some other things.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.400
Finally, you just gotta
choose one of the stalls.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.730
We went with a very friendly lady.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.190
She offered us the whole mixed plate,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.470
so we got the mixed plate.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.840
What they do is they weigh
it all out, and I loved,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.920
my favorite part of the entire process was

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.270
how she takes the meat and she
just kinda lightly tosses it

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.540
onto the grill, chucks it onto the grill.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.260
It lands perfectly onto the grill,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.980
then they grill everything
up in a cloud of smoke

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.390
over just flaming hot charcoal.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.150
This entire alley is a meat paradise.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.240
This is the definition of a meat sauna.

00:18:47.204 --> 00:18:50.140
(people chattering)

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.070
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.092
Yes, yes, (speaking foreign language).

00:18:56.092 --> 00:18:58.759
(meat sizzling)

00:19:02.863 --> 00:19:05.863
(people chattering)

00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:09.600
(speaking foreign language)

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.570
We're taking our tray
of meat down the alley.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.150
Oh man, it's just filled with
meat smoke all over the place.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.360
And we're going to the
vegetable section I think.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.607
It's a little confusing and
hectic in here and I love it!

00:19:22.607 --> 00:19:23.520
(people chattering)

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.140
We got a table at the
back of the market now,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.240
and they serve you just the entire tray.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.190
It's an entire basket of
meat with the tortillas.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.820
Oh, we got some salsas to go with it

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.480
and we got some red paper to eat off.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.840
The meat aromas within
this hall will just,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.830
your mouth will
immediately start to water.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.080
Okay, I'm gonna try a
piece of that beef first.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.810
(lively salsa music)

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.643
Oh wow.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.430
Oh that's insane.

00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:54.960
Oh, it's salty.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.880
It's tender but you feel
the texture of the meat,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.890
the stringiness of that meat.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.400
You can taste how it's been grilled

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.410
over such a hot charcoal fire.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.480
It has such a smokiness to it.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.500
And with that saltiness,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.490
that produces such an
incredible meat tsunami.

00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:15.782
(lively salsa music)

00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:18.748
Wow.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.380
That's absolutely stunning.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.050
I love those roasted
vegetables to go with the meat.

00:20:26.951 --> 00:20:30.315
(people chattering)

00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:34.010
Oh, I love the roasted peppers, too.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.470
This is an ultimate fiesta in here.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.080
It's just a party in the
middle of the morning,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.020
a meat party.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.310
All the action, the energy in here.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.130
The meat love is out of control.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.370
Okay, next up this is a marinated pork

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.462
that she said it's in a chili marinade.

00:20:50.462 --> 00:20:53.545
(lively salsa music)

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.990
I love that marinade.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.750
It's a little bit on the
dry-ish, like roasted side.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.000
You can taste the dried chilies in there.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.516
You can taste it's already
sour, maybe from lime juice.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:10.599
(lively salsa music)

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.820
Next up, I'm gonna try the longanisa,

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.590
which is the sausage that she grilled.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.470
When she was grilling that,

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.060
you could just see the flames shooting up

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.150
because of all that juicy
fattiness coming out

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.900
as it was grilling.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.930
Okay, I'm gonna put the longanisa

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.320
into a little piece of tortilla,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.400
add some of that salsa, it's
like a Pico de Gallo salsa

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.941
with tomatoes and chilies and onions.

00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:46.941
(people chattering)

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.426
Wow.

00:21:49.426 --> 00:21:54.339
Mm-hmm, it's just meat
after meat of deliciousness.

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:57.422
(lively salsa music)

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.590
That sausage is so smoky.

00:22:13.741 --> 00:22:16.741
(people chattering)

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.770
Those onions are so sweet.

00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:23.751
- [Carlos] That's like a bar.

00:22:23.751 --> 00:22:24.584
(laughing)

00:22:24.584 --> 00:22:25.881
Mark, there's one more left on there.

00:22:25.881 --> 00:22:27.123
(laughing)

00:22:27.123 --> 00:22:30.790
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.560
- Oh wow, oh that's delicious.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.440
That's so smoky.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.980
It's a little bit chewy,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.840
but that releases so much juicy flavor.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.725
Yeah, I love intestines,
intestines are awesome.

00:22:44.725 --> 00:22:47.725
(people chattering)

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.420
We are now walking out into,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.800
oh, the market sort of
opens up once you get out

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.820
of Meat Alley, and they
have a lot more food.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.830
Oh, this place is amazing!

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.780
There's still so much amazing
food to eat at the market,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.190
but we're getting kind of full,
so we're gonna take a break.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.023
We're gonna walk around,

00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:12.200
we're gonna go back to the main plaza

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.080
and to a couple of churches
and then after that,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.260
hopefully we'll eat some more.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.230
We've only been walking
around for half the day so far

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.920
and already this Mexican
food tour of Oaxaca,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.710
the city has been outstanding.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.930
I love this city, people are friendly,

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.160
the food is incredible, the culture.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.400
It's such a food-based culture.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.281
(upbeat music)

00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:36.269
(Micah blows raspberry)

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:37.102
- [Woman] Micah (chuckling).

00:23:37.102 --> 00:23:39.410
- We walked back over to El Zocalo

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.920
which is the main public
square plaza of Oaxaca City

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.800
and today, yeah, it's still
bustling from the protest,

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.580
but things have quieted down a little bit.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.500
People are wandering off

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.150
but even if there's not a protest here,

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.920
it's still a bustling
public space in Oaxaca.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.421
It's just an overall very pleasant area.

00:24:00.421 --> 00:24:03.700
(upbeat music)

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.910
We're walking up the walking
street towards the mountains.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.160
You can see all the
mountains in the background

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.838
and we are walking towards Santo Domingo.

00:24:11.838 --> 00:24:14.421
(upbeat music)

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.522
This entire Plaza Santo Domingo,

00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:33.460
it's an incredibly
beautiful part of Oaxaca.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.040
You can come here just to relax,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.770
sit on the walls of the plaza.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.816
The church, the architecture is gorgeous.

00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:46.270
It's calm, they have the
whole Oaxaca sign here.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.960
You can take your photos.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.900
But it's a beautiful place.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.290
This is a great place to spend some time,

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.410
when you are full after
eating a lot of food,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.360
and take a little break
before your next meal,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.430
when you're in Oaxaca.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.550
We're walking out of old town

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.160
and we're on our way to go eat at,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.550
it's a restaurant that serves
a very famous Oaxacan dish.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.984
Okay, you'll see what it is.

00:25:06.984 --> 00:25:08.810
(car motor humming)

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.286
This is the spot and I
think they just opened.

00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:14.953
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.070
Oh yeah, it's really quiet right now,

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.160
but I think it will really
get packed in tonight,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.690
but we're gonna have other plans tonight,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.591
so we're here as soon as they
open, which I'm okay with.

00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:27.174
(upbeat music)

00:25:41.877 --> 00:25:45.290
Tlayudas are one of the
ultimate snack foods in Oaxaca.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.870
Put on a thin layer of
beans, and then after that,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.720
she adds on some cabbage and then,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.260
the famous Oaxacan cheese,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.330
which is like a mozzarella string cheese,

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.020
and she really strips it into thin strips

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.140
but puts a lot of cheese on the inside.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.110
Then it goes over the hot
coals and so it grills.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.610
But you can smell like that very fast,

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.360
kinda almost burning aroma to it,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.390
but they keep flipping it
so that it doesn't burn,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.640
but that cheese starts to
melt and all mingle together.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.820
And then you can order it

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.370
with your variety of different meats,

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.610
which then they also grill
over the really hot fire.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.010
And then they put it
all together on a plate.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.147
So we got some fresh
tlayudas to try right now.

00:26:24.147 --> 00:26:26.730
(upbeat music)

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.760
I think they're all the same on the inside

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.470
but then they just come with
different meats on the top.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.900
This one is the marinated pork.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.890
But yeah, you can see
these are pretty huge

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:36.723
and they're folded up.

00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:38.280
It comes with some garnishes.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.600
There are some salsas and some
onions on the side as well.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.470
That's pretty heavy!

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.840
You can really smell the burnt,
like roasted flavor of this

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.150
'cause they keep it on such a hot fire

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.430
but they just keep flipping it.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.060
We gotta take a look inside.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.745
Oh yeah.

00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:52.523
Look at all of that.

00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:53.800
Oh, there's so much cheese!

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.084
That's like a giant mouth
opening full of cheese.

00:26:57.084 --> 00:26:59.667
(upbeat music)

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.020
That cheese is so elastic-y, and then,

00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:15.420
it does have an amazing like
roasted, fire aroma to it.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.510
You can taste the
crunchy cabbage in there.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.790
The beans sort of give
it some creamy richness,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.680
and then, yeah, that's just delicious.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.810
Okay, and let me add on some of the salsas

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.180
and a squeeze of lime, and
also you gotta have some

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.010
of those onions on here, with some,

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.050
they kinda look like pickled onions.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.250
Okay, let me pick this
whole thing up again.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.214
- [Man] Getting heavy.

00:27:43.214 --> 00:27:44.464
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.780
- Mm, oh, mm-hmm.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.860
Oh, that really enhances it.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.180
The guacamole, the squeeze of lime

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.670
to make it sour, the onions.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.260
I think that's the touch it needed for me,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.680
because it was lacking that
like sour, acidic touch to it.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.560
Some of this garnish.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.860
I don't know what this is.

00:28:06.095 --> 00:28:09.030
Mm, slightly onion-y but without the,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.760
like a grassy-tasting onion.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.870
I think this is the same meat

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.770
that we just ate an entire platter of.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.140
Oh, yes it is.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.170
We got three different types,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.230
but really they're all exactly the same.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.600
The only thing that's different
is the topping of meat.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.930
So it kinda doesn't really
matter which version you get.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.200
I like how the cheese,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.090
I mean, the cheese is not too salty.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.040
They use a lot of cheese,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.030
so you think it's gonna be
really rich and really salty,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.970
but actually the cheese is kinda light.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:39.410
Not too salty, it has a nice
rubbery elasticity to it.

00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:44.150
(people chattering)

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.810
From here, we're gonna jump in a taxi.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:47.920
It's a little ride away.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.170
We're gonna go to a
place called Monte Alban.

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:55.085
(upbeat music)

00:29:18.983 --> 00:29:22.350
(child vocalizing)

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.250
There it is.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.270
This site, Monte Alban, is
on the 20 pesos Mexican note.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.550
It's at the top of the mountain.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.440
It overlooks the valley and
you can see all of Oaxaca.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.180
It was a pretty nice drive to get here.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.220
And I was just reading

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.220
that it is the largest, pre-Hispanic city

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.760
in the Oaxaca region.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.810
Something else that's very
fascinating about this site is

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.910
that it's the first urban, planned city.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.090
So actually where they took time

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.430
to plan the entire city out
and the different buildings.

00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:52.438
I don't know, everything is planned.

00:29:52.438 --> 00:29:55.650
This is the first urban
planned city in the Americas.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.730
So it says this is the main plaza,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.740
and it dates back to around 500 to 800 AD,

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.000
and it's a 40-meter wide stairway.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.089
Okay, I'm climbing up.

00:30:11.089 --> 00:30:13.853
(footsteps clicking)

00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:14.686
Whoo!

00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.264
(upbeat music)

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.950
It's 5:00 p.m., that's when they close.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.140
I wasn't really sure what
to expect when we came here,

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.630
but it was well worth a visit.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.230
And what I like is that you're able

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.740
to climb up some of the ruins,

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.460
get the view of the whole city.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.837
That was great!

00:30:36.837 --> 00:30:38.860
(people chattering)

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.730
We're on our way back to Centro now.

00:30:41.582 --> 00:30:45.000
(lively music playing)

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.220
You just gotta love the
quality of those speakers.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.230
That music.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.800
We made it back to El
Zocalo, which is the center,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.941
and it's perfect.

00:30:53.941 --> 00:30:55.230
It's in the evening,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.100
this is the time when
people are out and about,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.260
when they're hanging out,
when they're walking around.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.590
And we came here actually last
night just to walk around.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.080
I wasn't filming but we
stumbled into this stall

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.600
where they're making Elotes.

00:31:07.444 --> 00:31:09.610
And Elotes, it's corn
with lots of toppings.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.540
It's one of the most
common street food snacks

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.020
and you'll find it all over.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.980
Like, in the evening,
it's all over the place.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.270
You'll find it everywhere, but this guy,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:23.270
he has the longest line of any Elotes cart

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.940
in the entire city.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.810
And then we asked some
of the people standing

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.790
in line last night why,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.974
and they said it's because of his style.

00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:33.557
(upbeat music)

00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:47.680
(speaking foreign language)

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.820
All the best things.

00:31:49.962 --> 00:31:51.610
(speaking foreign language)

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.602
Had a lot of things.

00:31:53.602 --> 00:31:55.738
(upbeat music)

00:31:55.738 --> 00:31:56.571
(speaking foreign language)

00:31:56.571 --> 00:31:57.730
I would make a guess to say

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.170
that he probably has the most
skill in the entire world

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.040
at seasoning a cob of corn.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.510
He just flies!

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.970
Is Micah allowed to taste it?

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:08.830
- [Woman] No.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.050
- Sorry, Micah, you can't taste this

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.550
'cause there's lots of
different chili sauces on it

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.350
and a lot of mayonnaise so
I think Micah will just have

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.730
to watch this one.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.450
But it looks beautiful.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.810
It's just covered in so many things,

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.630
this has to be the
fanciest corn on the cob

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.543
I've ever had in my life.

00:32:24.543 --> 00:32:27.543
(people chattering)

00:32:30.603 --> 00:32:31.436
Mm!

00:32:33.064 --> 00:32:34.070
Oh, it's young corn,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.190
so it's really soft and tender and juicy.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.380
Full of mayonnaise.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.810
There's so much mayonnaise on it.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.830
Then you got the cheese which
is really finely shredded.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.070
You've got all those different chilies,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.370
which are kinda salty.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.530
The lime juice on there
comes in really nicely,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.247
and then, you know, just
those mix of chilies.

00:32:50.247 --> 00:32:52.830
(upbeat music)

00:32:56.828 --> 00:32:58.870
That's so good.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.410
And you'll see, like, so
many people walking around,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.320
eating this at this time.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.550
Another thing that I
just love about him is

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.550
how, you know, he sells
something that's so common,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.970
that's so typical, yet he
does it with such style.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.170
He takes such pride in what he does,

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.640
and I fully respect that,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.300
and I'm fully willing to wait in line

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.230
'cause he takes such
pride in what he does.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.800
(upbeat music)

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.890
I think I got a little
mayonnaise on my nose.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.030
It's been a very long day,
but there's one more thing

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:34.500
that we have to eat to make
this day complete in Oaxaca.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.400
We are back at Mercado 20 de Noviembre

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.040
for one last plate of food.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.360
On the opposite side of the
market from the meat hall,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.670
you'll find, it's kind
of a big food court area

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.370
where you'll find all sorts
of local Oaxacan food.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.870
This is a great environment

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.940
and actually a lot of the
stalls are starting to close

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.280
because they're mostly, I think,

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.090
they're most popular at lunch.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.700
But you can come here to
get your plates of Mole,

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.860
Oaxacan-style,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.860
and we're gonna try a couple
different ones right now.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.693
Starting off with is Mole negro.

00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:04.700
Oh (speaking foreign language).

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.410
And this is one of the
ultimate dishes of Oaxaca.

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.360
It's, yeah it's probably one,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.330
I mean, it's a dish you
absolutely cannot miss.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.260
They're famous for Mole here

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.590
and it's an exquisite blend of spices.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.430
I know there's nuts in the sauce.

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:23.320
I think with the Mole negro
there's also some chocolate.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.420
That aroma is insane, you
can smell those red chilies.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.870
Such a dark, rich, like
chocolatey-looking sauce.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.479
(people chattering)

00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:34.790
Mm!

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.100
It has a little bit of a sweetness to it.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.100
So then you can taste the
rich, smoky, like blackened,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.490
slight bitter-y flavor to it.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.270
You can taste all those chilies in there.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.580
The nuttiness of it.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.120
It's such a complexity of flavor.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.703
(upbeat music)

00:34:54.512 --> 00:34:56.650
Mm-hmm, a great way to end the day.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.570
Carlos and I are splitting the
Mole negro and the Mole rojo,

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:03.150
so this is the red Mole version,

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.190
which I don't think it includes chocolate,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.210
or some of the other spices.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.090
It's a totally, actually
totally different blend

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.960
of spices and mixture.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.871
Mix that with some of the rice.

00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:14.639
(upbeat music)

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:15.472
Mm!

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.380
Mm, that's like totally different.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.960
It's more on the saltier,
without being sweet at all.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.343
I really like it.

00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:28.770
It's almost like a curry sauce.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.690
We've come to the end of the day.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.240
I'm running on my last steam

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.790
but I have a little bit more energy now

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.593
after that Mole, that final plate.

00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:37.520
Oh, that was delicious.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.790
I like both versions
actually, were fantastic.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.230
We only had one full day in Oaxaca City,

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.030
so we wanted to make the most of it.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.010
I think it was an amazing success.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.730
I'm very, very happy and
that was some amazing food.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.520
And I'll leave all the
information of what we did

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.570

the description box below

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.740
