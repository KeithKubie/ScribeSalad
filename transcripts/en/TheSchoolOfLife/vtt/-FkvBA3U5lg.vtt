00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.400
A 
discussion of how to be a good teacher sounds

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.580
a little narrow – and probably not very
relevant to most of us. Few of us want to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.530
be a school teacher, instructing children
in some narrow academic subject or other,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.130
which is what we overwhelmingly associate
with the word ‘teacher’, the person in

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.600
a rather frayed jacket in front of the class,
the type who bored us rigid for long stretches

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.710
of our early years. However, teaching is far
from being something that we only need to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.030
learn if we’re contemplating a career in
education. Considered properly, teaching – by

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.960
which we mean, the vital business of getting
an important idea from one mind into another

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.680
– is one of the most crucial life skills
that any of us ever requires.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.120
It's vital in any relationship, office or family we'll ever belong to.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.920
Every one of us, whatever our
occupation, needs to become a good teacher,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.230
for our lives constantly require us to deliver
crucial information with grace and effectiveness

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.400
into the deep minds of others.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.400
We can admit, quite candidly that most of us have probably started off by being quite
bad teachers. This is nothing to be ashamed

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.650
of, like most things, teaching can, and must
be learnt. What, then, are some of the prerequisites

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.210
of the good teacher? Here is a start to the
list: 1. The good teacher never blames another

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.530
person for not already knowing. It seems paradoxical
– once it is pointed out. But the truth

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.570
is we often get very annoyed by the fact that
another person doesn’t know something yet

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.410
– even though we have never actually told
them what it might be. Certain ideas can seem

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.420
so important to us, we simply can’t imagine
that others don’t already know them. We

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.530
suspect they may be deliberately upsetting
us by pretending not to have a clue. This

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.950
attitude makes it unlikely that what we actually
have to teach will make its way successfully

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.829
into the unfortunate other person’s head.
Good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.459
is not a defect of the individual we’re
instructing: it’s the consequence of never

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.170
having been properly taught. So the fault,
rightly, really only ever belongs with the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.700
people who haven’t done enough to get the
needed ideas into others’ heads: in other

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.299
words, with you. 2. Good teachers don’t
get angry The more we need other people to

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.189
know something, the less we may be able to
secure the calm frame of mind which is indispensable

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.299
if we are to have a chance of conveying it
to them effectively. The possibility that

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.939
they won’t quickly understand something
that matters immensely to us can drive us

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.660
into an agitated fury, which is the very worst
state in which to conduct any lesson. By the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.959
time we’ve started to insult our so-called
pupil, to call them a blockhead or a fool,

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.940
the lesson is quite plainly over. No one has
ever learnt anything under conditions of humiliation.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.269
Paradoxically, the best sort of teachers can

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.249
bear the possibility that what they have to
teach will not be understood. It is this slightly

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:33.879
detached, slightly pessimistic approach that
stands the best chance of generating the relaxed

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:42.129
frame of mind essential to successful pedagogy.
3. Good teachers can admit they don’t know

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.219
lots of things It’s pretty humiliating to
be in the learning position. Someone else

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:54.069
has information you don’t. That can be so
irritating, the person learning may shut their

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.430
ears and hate the alleged superiority of the
one in the teaching role. That’s why another

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.189
fundamental skill of the good teacher is to
admit that they are, in most areas of life,

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.930
pretty ignorant and stupid. This might seem
to undermine their authority. Far from it;

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.640
it creates an atmosphere of goodwill and modesty
which puts the pupil at ease. They might not

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.590
know this particular thing that’s being
taught but they are, overall, not inferior

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.690
to the teacher – and so they can dare to
face up to their ignorance in a given area

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.310
and submit to the discipline of having it
nicely corrected. 4. Good teachers pick their

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.560
moments As bad teachers, we tend automatically
to try to teach a lesson at the moment the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.030
problem arises, rather than selecting a time
when it is most likely to be attended to properly.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.310
Crises aren’t the best times for a lesson.
We might have to wait a long time, three days

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.630
after an argument for example, in order to
pick just the opportune occasion to deal with

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.890
its underlying dynamics. When our partner
is stacking the dishwasher and humming a song

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.770
might be wisest moment cheerfully and innocently
to refer back to something that truly maddened

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.910
us a little while back, but over which we
were – at the time – sagely silent.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.620
As we’re beginning to see, the more desperate
we feel inside, the less likely we are to

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.990
get through to others effectively. It is deeply
unfortunate that we typically end up addressing

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.460
the most delicate and complex teaching tasks
just when we feel most irritated and distressed.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.820
We suffer from a panicked feeling that if
we don’t jump on this right now, an issue

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.220
is going to go on and on unchecked forever.
Precisely not. We should be more confident

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.680
that not jumping on an issue is what is in
fact going to allow us to fix it properly

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.470
a little way down the line. 5. Good Teachers
are also Good Students. Good teachers know

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.590
that everyone has a lot to learn and everyone
has something important to impart to others.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.800
We should never get incensed if someone is
trying to teach us something and snap back,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.660
‘I wanted you to like me just as I am’.
Only a perfect being would be committed to

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.800
staying just as they are. For all the rest
of us, good learning and teaching are the

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.280
only ways we’ll ever be able to progress
and grow and that’s why we should welcome them as

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.880
the gifts they truly are.
