course books generally take longer than
buildings to make and they're almost

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
buildings to make and they're almost
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.730
buildings to make and they're almost
always heavier and this is no exception

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740
always heavier and this is no exception

report on on what this kind of work is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
report on on what this kind of work is
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440
report on on what this kind of work is
about and why this kind of work is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
about and why this kind of work is
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300
about and why this kind of work is
operating the way it might go and in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
operating the way it might go and in
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980
operating the way it might go and in
particular maybe to think about the kind

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
particular maybe to think about the kind
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710
particular maybe to think about the kind
of feedback loops that might emerge out

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
of feedback loops that might emerge out
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.200
of feedback loops that might emerge out
of this kind of work and the ways in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
of this kind of work and the ways in
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.280
of this kind of work and the ways in
which perhaps new species of architect

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
which perhaps new species of architect
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.069
which perhaps new species of architect
or others other kinds of species might

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
or others other kinds of species might
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.600
or others other kinds of species might
emerge as it were in the shadow of this

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
emerge as it were in the shadow of this
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.350
emerge as it were in the shadow of this
kind of work so firstly Todd will

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
kind of work so firstly Todd will
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.649
kind of work so firstly Todd will
explain the the thinking behind this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
explain the the thinking behind this
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560
explain the the thinking behind this
document and how it works and remco

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
document and how it works and remco
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719
document and how it works and remco
house will also explain it from his

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
house will also explain it from his
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.219
house will also explain it from his
perspective then we'll spend about half

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
perspective then we'll spend about half
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.690
perspective then we'll spend about half
an hour discussing it which would be

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
an hour discussing it which would be
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.190
an hour discussing it which would be
largely between ourselves and then there

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
largely between ourselves and then there
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649
largely between ourselves and then there
will be an appallingly short period in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
will be an appallingly short period in
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.899
will be an appallingly short period in
which we will simulate democracy and you

which we will simulate democracy and you
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.029
which we will simulate democracy and you
will ask questions which will be

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
will ask questions which will be
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850
will ask questions which will be
answered scathingly

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

and but also with a certain degree of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
and but also with a certain degree of
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.470
and but also with a certain degree of
tenderness because we understand that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
tenderness because we understand that
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.470
tenderness because we understand that
this is going to be always too short and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
this is going to be always too short and
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.120
this is going to be always too short and
we would take your frustration at the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
we would take your frustration at the
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.570
we would take your frustration at the

think that the almond acres is
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.120
think that the almond acres is
shockingly good document and the reason

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
shockingly good document and the reason
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.790
shockingly good document and the reason
I think it's shockingly good is that it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800
I think it's shockingly good is that it
 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.949
I think it's shockingly good is that it
very very quickly defeats a whole series

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
very very quickly defeats a whole series
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.630
very very quickly defeats a whole series
of standard assumptions you might have

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
of standard assumptions you might have
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520
of standard assumptions you might have
about what constitutes research in this

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
about what constitutes research in this
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.730
about what constitutes research in this
field so it's incredibly it's a great

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
field so it's incredibly it's a great
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.360

document which is not produced in the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
document which is not produced in the
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.620
document which is not produced in the
way you might imagine and I think its

effects and not necessarily what the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
effects and not necessarily what the
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.710
effects and not necessarily what the
people who did contribute to it might

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
people who did contribute to it might
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.850
people who did contribute to it might
imagine either so let's begin the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
imagine either so let's begin the
 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.840
imagine either so let's begin the
discussion with time

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850

of course Columbia University and we

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630
of course Columbia University and we
 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.960
of course Columbia University and we
were interested in kind of pursuing

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970
were interested in kind of pursuing
 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.880

further development of our ongoing
 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.560
further development of our ongoing
research of the region in 2007 and we

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570
research of the region in 2007 and we
 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.390
research of the region in 2007 and we
were thinking of doing something like an

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
were thinking of doing something like an
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.330

almanac I mean we discovered actually

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
almanac I mean we discovered actually
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.640
almanac I mean we discovered actually
that the word almanac presumably comes

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650
that the word almanac presumably comes
 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.910
that the word almanac presumably comes
from the Arabic world arabic word

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
from the Arabic world arabic word
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.520
from the Arabic world arabic word
almanac meaning climate i could also

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530
almanac meaning climate i could also
 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.710
almanac meaning climate i could also
mean atmosphere or the feeling of a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720
mean atmosphere or the feeling of a
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.920
mean atmosphere or the feeling of a
place and so we quickly found let's say

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930
place and so we quickly found let's say
 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.030
place and so we quickly found let's say
the name of our project Almanac to Gulf

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040
the name of our project Almanac to Gulf
 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.550
the name of our project Almanac to Gulf
continued is the name of the book it was

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560
continued is the name of the book it was
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.170
continued is the name of the book it was
published this past May and it's a

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180
published this past May and it's a
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.150
published this past May and it's a
follow-up to as I said the book we did

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
follow-up to as I said the book we did
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.060
follow-up to as I said the book we did
in 2007 and if 2007's book was a look at

by effects of preservation is that it

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:31.030
by effects of preservation is that it
 

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.600
by effects of preservation is that it
kind of radically changes the nature of

what you wanted to preserve this is a
 

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.970
what you wanted to preserve this is a
used space in Damascus and this is a

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:38.980
used space in Damascus and this is a
 

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.510
used space in Damascus and this is a
preserved space in Damascus and and of

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520
preserved space in Damascus and and of

architects the moment we touch it or

architects the moment we touch it or
think about it or even look at it it has

think about it or even look at it it has
 

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.260
think about it or even look at it it has
a tendency to turn into this condition

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:55.270
a tendency to turn into this condition
 

00:49:55.270 --> 00:50:01.880
a tendency to turn into this condition
so our are we are looking for ways of

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:01.890
so our are we are looking for ways of
 

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.700
so our are we are looking for ways of
out of that dilemma and and we think we

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:05.710
out of that dilemma and and we think we
 

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.280
out of that dilemma and and we think we
have found perhaps one of these places

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:08.290
have found perhaps one of these places
 

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.070
have found perhaps one of these places
we're kind of at and do something

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:11.080
we're kind of at and do something
 

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.620
we're kind of at and do something
exceptional another kind of icon another

exceptional another kind of icon another
 

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.070
exceptional another kind of icon another
kind of regional building we found an

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:17.080
kind of regional building we found an
 

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.870
kind of regional building we found an
abandoned structure that is there from

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880
abandoned structure that is there from
 

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.180
abandoned structure that is there from
dating from the 80s in the center of the

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:24.190
dating from the 80s in the center of the
 

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.420
dating from the 80s in the center of the
city kind of really and in itself quite

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:27.430
city kind of really and in itself quite
 

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.570
city kind of really and in itself quite
beautiful that nobody knows what to do

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:30.580
beautiful that nobody knows what to do
 

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.690
beautiful that nobody knows what to do
with so we've basically asked but we

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:33.700
with so we've basically asked but we
 

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.590
with so we've basically asked but we
could take over this room and and maybe

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:37.600
could take over this room and and maybe
 

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.160
could take over this room and and maybe
and simply make our statement by

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:40.170
and simply make our statement by
 

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.559
and simply make our statement by
slightly converting it and

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:43.569
slightly converting it and
 

00:50:43.569 --> 00:50:45.839
slightly converting it and
making better contribution to the city

00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:45.849
making better contribution to the city
 

00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:48.920
making better contribution to the city
so this is kind of simply a breakneck

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:48.930
so this is kind of simply a breakneck
 

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:53.359
so this is kind of simply a breakneck
place to journey to kind of simply

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:53.369
place to journey to kind of simply
 

00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:56.670
place to journey to kind of simply
explain in which political context we

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680
explain in which political context we
 

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.099
explain in which political context we
think this is an important engagement

00:50:59.099 --> 00:50:59.109
think this is an important engagement
 

00:50:59.109 --> 00:51:03.660
think this is an important engagement
and also to show how architectural II

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:03.670
and also to show how architectural II
 

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.779
and also to show how architectural II
the effects of that engagement are one

00:51:06.779 --> 00:51:06.789
the effects of that engagement are one
 

00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:10.140
the effects of that engagement are one
of a constant extension of our

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:10.150
of a constant extension of our
 

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.930
of a constant extension of our
repertoire and simply by confronting is

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:12.940
repertoire and simply by confronting is
 

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.049
repertoire and simply by confronting is
with situations that we could never

00:51:16.049 --> 00:51:16.059
with situations that we could never
 

00:51:16.059 --> 00:51:37.559
with situations that we could never
imagine before thank you

00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:37.569
 
 

00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:42.099
 
so in a way just a few minutes to try to

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:42.109
so in a way just a few minutes to try to
 

00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:43.689
so in a way just a few minutes to try to
in a way figure out the relationship

00:51:43.689 --> 00:51:43.699
in a way figure out the relationship
 

00:51:43.699 --> 00:51:49.389
in a way figure out the relationship
between the two presentations and I mean

00:51:49.389 --> 00:51:49.399
between the two presentations and I mean
 

00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:53.529
between the two presentations and I mean
this is this is volume number 23 and I

00:51:53.529 --> 00:51:53.539
this is this is volume number 23 and I
 

00:51:53.539 --> 00:51:57.819
this is this is volume number 23 and I
think I'm neck one was volume 12 so in a

00:51:57.819 --> 00:51:57.829
think I'm neck one was volume 12 so in a
 

00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:59.559
think I'm neck one was volume 12 so in a
way you can now measure the volume

00:51:59.559 --> 00:51:59.569
way you can now measure the volume
 

00:51:59.569 --> 00:52:02.709
way you can now measure the volume

project by the almanacs the almanacs
like the weather they arrive in a

00:52:05.169 --> 00:52:05.179
like the weather they arrive in a
 

00:52:05.179 --> 00:52:06.909
like the weather they arrive in a
certain frequency and this one is very

00:52:06.909 --> 00:52:06.919
certain frequency and this one is very
 

00:52:06.919 --> 00:52:08.589
certain frequency and this one is very
different from the first one so it seems

00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599
different from the first one so it seems
 

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:10.989
different from the first one so it seems
to be this within the almanac project

00:52:10.989 --> 00:52:10.999
to be this within the almanac project
 

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:13.809
to be this within the almanac project
there is a kind of self self reflection

00:52:13.809 --> 00:52:13.819
there is a kind of self self reflection
 

00:52:13.819 --> 00:52:15.939
there is a kind of self self reflection
and and the thing is as evolved so I

00:52:15.939 --> 00:52:15.949
and and the thing is as evolved so I
 

00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:19.149
and and the thing is as evolved so I
suppose in volume member whatever it

00:52:19.149 --> 00:52:19.159
suppose in volume member whatever it
 

00:52:19.159 --> 00:52:21.609
suppose in volume member whatever it
would be the almanac three would change

00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:21.619
would be the almanac three would change
 

00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:24.159
would be the almanac three would change
again but still not clear to me the

00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:24.169
again but still not clear to me the
 

00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:27.489
again but still not clear to me the
exactly the relationship between this

00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:27.499
exactly the relationship between this
 

00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:30.249
exactly the relationship between this
document let's say and and let's say the

00:52:30.249 --> 00:52:30.259
document let's say and and let's say the
 

00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:33.189
document let's say and and let's say the
the work of this of the studio on the

00:52:33.189 --> 00:52:33.199
the work of this of the studio on the
 

00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:39.179
the work of this of the studio on the
one hand volume belongs to the to the

00:52:39.179 --> 00:52:39.189
one hand volume belongs to the to the
 

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:44.169
one hand volume belongs to the to the
mo-om a kind of confusion and on the

00:52:44.169 --> 00:52:44.179
mo-om a kind of confusion and on the
 

00:52:44.179 --> 00:52:48.090
mo-om a kind of confusion and on the
other hand it's a separate project in

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:48.100
other hand it's a separate project in
 

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.310
other hand it's a separate project in
you know almost volume was constructed

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:50.320
you know almost volume was constructed
 

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.690
you know almost volume was constructed
to make it possible for there to be

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:51.700
to make it possible for there to be
 

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.150
to make it possible for there to be
separate projects so somehow it drifts

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160
separate projects so somehow it drifts
 

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.370
separate projects so somehow it drifts
away from you guys and then it's also

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:56.380
away from you guys and then it's also
 

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.710
away from you guys and then it's also
somehow reappears like Todd reappears in

00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720
somehow reappears like Todd reappears in
 

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.600
somehow reappears like Todd reappears in
the desert towards the end of your

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:00.610
the desert towards the end of your
 

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.090
the desert towards the end of your
presentation so I'm trying to figure out

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:03.100
presentation so I'm trying to figure out
 

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:07.950
presentation so I'm trying to figure out
that the geometry of this another way to

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960
that the geometry of this another way to
 

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.960
that the geometry of this another way to
ask the same question would be in in a

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:09.970
ask the same question would be in in a
 

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.490
ask the same question would be in in a
certain way what you are saying Todd is

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:11.500
certain way what you are saying Todd is
 

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.440
certain way what you are saying Todd is
that is that you guys didn't write this

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:13.450
that is that you guys didn't write this
 

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:16.980
that is that you guys didn't write this
that you edited this and your

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:16.990
that you edited this and your
 

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:20.730
that you edited this and your
intelligence involved locating the

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:20.740
intelligence involved locating the
 

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.160
intelligence involved locating the
people who could tell the story so this

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:23.170
people who could tell the story so this
 

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:26.130
people who could tell the story so this
is actually much more story written from

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.140
is actually much more story written from
 

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.040
is actually much more story written from
the Middle East and then about the

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:29.050
the Middle East and then about the
 

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.350
the Middle East and then about the
Middle East it's sort of like a story as

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:31.360
Middle East it's sort of like a story as
 

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.810
Middle East it's sort of like a story as
told by those already changed by the

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:33.820
told by those already changed by the
 

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.670
told by those already changed by the
Middle East which makes sense of the

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680
Middle East which makes sense of the
 

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.380
Middle East which makes sense of the
fact that it's even sponsored by UPC and

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:40.390
fact that it's even sponsored by UPC and
 

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.820
fact that it's even sponsored by UPC and
so on so I guess I'm just trying to

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:41.830
so on so I guess I'm just trying to
 

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:43.620
so on so I guess I'm just trying to
figure all this out and the reason i

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:43.630
figure all this out and the reason i
 

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.090
figure all this out and the reason i
think it's worth asking these kind of

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:45.100
think it's worth asking these kind of
 

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.620
think it's worth asking these kind of
boring questions is that the whole word

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:46.630
boring questions is that the whole word
 

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:50.190
boring questions is that the whole word
research has been super devalued in our

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200
research has been super devalued in our
 

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.720
research has been super devalued in our
field because it's used every two

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:51.730
field because it's used every two
 

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.890
field because it's used every two
minutes and so on the one hand this

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900
minutes and so on the one hand this
 

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.600
minutes and so on the one hand this
constant refrain of research there's

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:57.610
constant refrain of research there's
 

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.070
constant refrain of research there's
probably not an architect on the planet

00:53:59.070 --> 00:53:59.080
probably not an architect on the planet
 

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.170
probably not an architect on the planet
that doesn't say that what they're doing

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:01.180
that doesn't say that what they're doing
 

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.750
that doesn't say that what they're doing
is research and on the one hand it's

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760
is research and on the one hand it's
 

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.280
is research and on the one hand it's
sort of honorable like it's the chanting

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:07.290
sort of honorable like it's the chanting
 

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.080
sort of honorable like it's the chanting
the claim as old as Vitruvius that the

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.090
the claim as old as Vitruvius that the
 

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.330
the claim as old as Vitruvius that the
architect is an intellectual on the

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:12.340
architect is an intellectual on the
 

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.970
architect is an intellectual on the
other hand if you chant that often what

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:14.980
other hand if you chant that often what
 

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.830
other hand if you chant that often what
seems to be a confident claim is

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:16.840
seems to be a confident claim is
 

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.670
seems to be a confident claim is
actually a little bit more nervous claim

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680
actually a little bit more nervous claim
 

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.800
actually a little bit more nervous claim
and actually the almost the word

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:22.810
and actually the almost the word
 

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:26.250
and actually the almost the word
research it starts to in a way pass

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:26.260
research it starts to in a way pass
 

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.380
research it starts to in a way pass
through the areas of the greatest doubt

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.390
through the areas of the greatest doubt
 

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.140
through the areas of the greatest doubt
in our field so in a way exactly when

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:31.150
in our field so in a way exactly when
 

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.700

architects confidently assert to

readers and so on that they're doing
 

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.260
readers and so on that they're doing
research and that somehow then lens

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:37.270
research and that somehow then lens
 

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:40.370
research and that somehow then lens
their objects a certain special magic

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380
their objects a certain special magic
 

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.140
their objects a certain special magic
their research has almost walked over

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.150
their research has almost walked over
 

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.130
their research has almost walked over
happily but blindly some of the biggest

architects so if I could make this a

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:50.380
architects so if I could make this a
 

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:55.059
architects so if I could make this a
simple question

00:54:55.059 --> 00:54:55.069
 
 

00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:58.010
 
it seems to me that Ram that as you go

00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.020
it seems to me that Ram that as you go
 

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.400
it seems to me that Ram that as you go
further and further into the desert

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:00.410
further and further into the desert
 

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:05.599
further and further into the desert
literally the work is less and less

00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:05.609
literally the work is less and less
 

00:55:05.609 --> 00:55:07.970
literally the work is less and less
predictable I mean less and less let's

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980
predictable I mean less and less let's
 

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.230
predictable I mean less and less let's
say predictable if what you're expecting

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240
say predictable if what you're expecting
 

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.829
say predictable if what you're expecting
is the work of an architect so its its

00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839
is the work of an architect so its its
 

00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:15.200
is the work of an architect so its its
its preservation then it becomes

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:15.210
its preservation then it becomes
 

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.210
its preservation then it becomes
preservation of an architect I mean it's

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:17.220
preservation of an architect I mean it's
 

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.329
preservation of an architect I mean it's
all these other things so somehow i sigh

00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:19.339
all these other things so somehow i sigh
 

00:55:19.339 --> 00:55:22.870
all these other things so somehow i sigh
I think there has to be actually a

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880
I think there has to be actually a
 

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.540
I think there has to be actually a
feedback loop stronger than you suggest

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:26.550
feedback loop stronger than you suggest
 

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:30.500
feedback loop stronger than you suggest
between this document that you let other

between this document that you let other
 

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:32.990
between this document that you let other
people right and the work that you

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000
people right and the work that you
 

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.460
people right and the work that you
yourself are most actively doing the

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:37.470
yourself are most actively doing the
 

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.010
yourself are most actively doing the
work that you would keep as close to you

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020
work that you would keep as close to you
 

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.859
work that you would keep as close to you
as possible which is further and further

00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:42.869
as possible which is further and further
 

00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:44.540
as possible which is further and further
away from what architects thought that

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:44.550
away from what architects thought that
 

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.620
away from what architects thought that
they were supposed to be doing well I

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:48.630
they were supposed to be doing well I
 

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.609
they were supposed to be doing well I
would like to say that of course my

00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619
would like to say that of course my
 

00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:58.370
would like to say that of course my
entire life I've pursued two things with

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380
entire life I've pursued two things with
 

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:04.190
entire life I've pursued two things with
almost equal passion one is well

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200
almost equal passion one is well
 

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.859
almost equal passion one is well
producing books and the second one is to

00:56:06.859 --> 00:56:06.869
producing books and the second one is to
 

00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:10.890
producing books and the second one is to
produce architecture and

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:10.900
produce architecture and
 

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.559
produce architecture and
I really would prefer to think of this

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:13.569
I really would prefer to think of this
 

00:56:13.569 --> 00:56:16.079
I really would prefer to think of this
as a book rather than research because

00:56:16.079 --> 00:56:16.089
as a book rather than research because
 

00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:18.799
as a book rather than research because
it's kind of really i think that the

but this seems to me the standard way to
be uninteresting about your work is to

it's it when I hear you say when you

yes yeah with work what do you want me

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:44.790
yes yeah with work what do you want me
 

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.720
yes yeah with work what do you want me
to say I mean

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:46.730

now what can I say it's a bit cruel we

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:52.970
now what can I say it's a bit cruel we

now what can I say it's a bit cruel we
all agree that the term research is

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:55.070
all agree that the term research is
 

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:58.380
all agree that the term research is
abused by the architects profession and

01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:58.390
abused by the architects profession and
 

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:01.840
abused by the architects profession and
and we we both probably have a certain

responsibility in doing that yes and
 

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.020
responsibility in doing that yes and
it's a bit cheap for for either of us

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.030
it's a bit cheap for for either of us

it's a bit cheap for for either of us

pleasures of listening to you and
 

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.890
pleasures of listening to you and
reading you is that you quite often

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:41.900
reading you is that you quite often
 

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:47.170
reading you is that you quite often

away from architecture for which it was

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:31.950
away from architecture for which it was
 

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:36.259
away from architecture for which it was
severely punished by its readers and

representing an architecture office and
so basically we made a construction that

01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:10.849
so basically we made a construction that
 

01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:15.559

office in your institution could support

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420
office in your institution could support
 

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.740
office in your institution could support
that effort and therefore I think it

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:21.750
that effort and therefore I think it
 

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:25.879
that effort and therefore I think it
still has that degree of autonomy and

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:25.889
still has that degree of autonomy and
 

01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:29.059
still has that degree of autonomy and
independence of of us will be supported

latest work you there is a feedback loop
 

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.999
latest work you there is a feedback loop
yeah because the feedback so we go to

01:09:36.999 --> 01:09:37.009
yeah because the feedback so we go to
 

01:09:37.009 --> 01:09:39.220
yeah because the feedback so we go to
the audience this is five minutes of

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:39.230
the audience this is five minutes of
 

01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:41.709
the audience this is five minutes of

little curious whether you see a

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140
little curious whether you see a
 

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.460
little curious whether you see a
correlation between these cities and

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:15.470
correlation between these cities and
 

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:18.350
correlation between these cities and
sort of the gradual decline or depletion

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360
sort of the gradual decline or depletion
 

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.950
sort of the gradual decline or depletion
of oil which is a lot of sort of like

the major export on all of these cities
 

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.910
the major export on all of these cities
and what that ultimately means for these

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920
and what that ultimately means for these
 

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.880
and what that ultimately means for these
countries and what happens what would

countries and what happens what would

explore some ideas of sustainability I
think those are all at risk at this

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520

and the oil fields and so there's a need

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:41.070
and the oil fields and so there's a need
 

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.970
and the oil fields and so there's a need
to diversify on this way and we do get a
