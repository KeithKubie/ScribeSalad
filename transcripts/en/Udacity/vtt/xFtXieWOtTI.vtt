&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi. Chris and I wanted to say congratulations on finishing the first third of

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:09.278
Visualizing Algebra. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You've learned a lot about equations, inequalities,

00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:13.775
fractions and even systems of equations. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Next we're going to be looking at

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:18.747
rational expressions, factoring, radicals and exponents. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get ready for some

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.145
excellent units. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good luck.
