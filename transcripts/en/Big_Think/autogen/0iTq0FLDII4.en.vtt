that and you can come back to creativity

metaphors and the neocortex is a
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220

metaphor machine that's what it's good

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
metaphor machine that's what it's good
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.729

at that's why humans are creative but we

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
at that's why humans are creative but we
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.730
at that's why humans are creative but we
have this very large hierarchy where we

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
have this very large hierarchy where we
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.870
have this very large hierarchy where we
have more and more abstract and complex

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880

below it and the difference between

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
below it and the difference between
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700
below it and the difference between
humans and say other primates is that we

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
humans and say other primates is that we
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950
humans and say other primates is that we
have more of the neocortex we have this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
have more of the neocortex we have this
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810
have more of the neocortex we have this
big forehead then we could fit in the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
big forehead then we could fit in the
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.340
big forehead then we could fit in the
frontal cortex and therefore have a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
frontal cortex and therefore have a
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.850
frontal cortex and therefore have a
higher number of hierarchies of levels

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
higher number of hierarchies of levels
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859
higher number of hierarchies of levels
of the hierarchy and that was the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
of the hierarchy and that was the
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230
of the hierarchy and that was the
enabling factor that that permitted the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
enabling factor that that permitted the
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899
enabling factor that that permitted the
evolution of language and technology and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
