00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.909
In this video you’ll see 5 different party
pleasers done with dry ice.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.599
#5. Take a flaming candle, and place it down
into a container like a bowl or a glass. Carefully

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.390
pour some crushed dry-ice, down around the
base of the candle. And within just a few

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.440
seconds, you'll notice the flame goes out,
and the gas turns completely invisible. Now

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.740
challenge one of your friends to try and re-light
the candle inside the glass. They won't be

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.119
able to do it and they'll have no idea why.
Even after multiple attempts, the flame goes

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.739
out every time.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.730
#4. For this trick, find a block of dry-ice,
and break it into pieces the size of small

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.410
rocks. Carefully place one or two of the pieces
inside of a balloon, and tie it off. You'll

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.829
notice the balloon begins to inflate all by
itself. Now try doing this with a bunch of

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.370
other balloons and throw them all into a basket.
Over the course of about 25 minutes, the balloons

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.239
will keep growing, until you've got a basket
overflowing.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.420
#3. Start this prank by opening up a Ziploc
bag and adding a few chunks of dry ice, followed

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.329
by a little bit of warm water. Now seal the
bag so it's completely air-tight, and find

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.279
a place to hide it. After a minute or two,
the bag will be completely pressurized and

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.909
ready to explode. Who could you scare with
this?

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.209
#2. For this party trick, take a large metal
spoon and press it down into a block of dry-ice.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:30.189
It lets out an awful squeal, and people will
beg you to stop. You can make a quarter scream

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.049
the same way. Just lay it flat on the ice,
and press down into it. For a bonus trick

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.599
try sticking the quarter in sideways, it’ll
start shaking uncontrollably.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:48.349
#1. For this last trick, add some crushed
dry ice into a large clear bowl. At this point,

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.869
try blowing the biggest bubble you can, and
drop it right into the center. Instead of

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.340
popping on the bottom, it levitates around
in mid-air, and will make your friends wonder,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.289
"what kind of sorcery is this?"

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.130
Well now you know a few tricks, and pranks
with dry ice, that are super cool, and easy

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.560
to do. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
