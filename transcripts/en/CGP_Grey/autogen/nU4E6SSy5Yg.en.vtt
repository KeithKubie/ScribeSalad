00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.250
 Hello internet, 

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 I want to talk about Canada, which this week has extended my 'reason-to-like-her' list with a fact 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.680
 by abolishing the one cent coin. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.889
 Because I have previously made a video called "Death to Pennies," this will come as no surprise 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.339
 that this promotion has earned a big 'go Canada' from me. 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.050
 Let's take a moment to cheer on Canadas economic rationalism, see how 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.509
 removing a coin works in practice, and having her sister remember that she might 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.119
 does the same. 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.259
 Canadas plan is pretty simple: The Royal Canadian Mint will be her in a few months 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.679
 to switch the device taste from on to off. That is it. 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.779
 Nothing will change in the world. One cent coins will still be legal 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.200
 means of payment in Canada so a pot with hundreds of coins that you don't feel like counting 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.410
 worth as much as it is today. 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 And in stores it will still be the person who pays exactly with change. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 But after they have counted their valuable money the store will take them 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.110
 send back to the Royal Canadian Mint to be melted down. Provisioning one cent coins 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.710
 will fall slowly over time in a pleasant half-life curve. 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.390
 But, after the one cent coins fall away, the prizes fall with one cent intervals 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.300
 not gone 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.210
 Your coffee and TimBits will still cost the same, and when you arrive at the checkout 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 the total amount including tax will still consist of one cent. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.900
 If you pint, the exact amount of money will be debited from your account. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.110
 The only difference is that when you pay in cash, not with pin, * and * you don't have one cent of coins 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 with which you waste other people's time, the prices will be rounded to the nearest one 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.220
 five cents. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.280
 And yes, with rounding you win and sometimes you lose - and this is it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.140
 salient point - one or two cents really doesn't matter. 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 That is why Canada can safely throw the one cent coin overboard. 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
 Inevitably, however, this is the point in the discussion when pro-cent people say 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.159
 throwing the coin away causes prices to rise and savings to fall. 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.630
 But the proof of this claim does not exist because many countries have already done so 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.729
 with no ill effect. 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.100
 Sure, money collectors and ineffectiveness fans will be sad about the loss of the coin, but 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.549
 it is a victory for Canada because making money is not free. The making of a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.260
 such a coin is around 1.6 cents 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.979
 So every year when Canda visits The Mint she spends $ 29 million to $ 18 million on one cent 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.210
 buy coins - $ 11 million is thrown away every year. 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.299
 Logically, removing one cent of coins will not have a direct effect on the balance but it is 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.979
 the easiest and most rational way to get started 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.880
 Congratulations Canada! May others follow your path. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.440
 PS 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.149
 If you want to know why specifically the US should get rid of one cent coins 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.879
 You can watch my video of the subject or listen to fellow John Penny 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.799
 those arm-waving becomes angry at not only one cent coin, but also at five cent coins, which are even worse. 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.639
 A new video will also be uploaded in the following week, or the one after, but if you want to help 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.840
 to make it go faster, go to my website to help check facts for coming 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.529
 projects. 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.159
 Thanks for looking.
