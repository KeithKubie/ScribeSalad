"NO BAD GUYS."

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:45.112

THERE'S NO BAD GUYS.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.782

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.538

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.373

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.803
AND AT THE END,
I ASKED MS. CASTANITA

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.104
FOR AN EVALUATION.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.973
ALL RIGHT, SO I KNOW
THAT WAS A MOCK INTERVIEW.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.608
