00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:16.601
(Cello music)

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:07.892
(Music ends)

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:11.751
On the flight here,

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:14.793
I was reminded about my mom.

00:01:15.437 --> 00:01:18.069
I'm a self-taught cellist,
I've never had a lesson.

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:21.669
I studied double bass, but I just
picked up the cello and started playing

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:22.883
because I love doing it.

00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:24.693
But my mom was an inspiration to me.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.781
I did not realize she was an inspiration,

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:30.934
because she got her music degree
through a mail-order course,

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.426
the US School of Music.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.021
While raising two kids,

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:37.966
she received a lesson a week in the mail,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.141
and practiced.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:42.727
And at the end of a couple of years,
she put on a recital.

00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.774
And I'll be 50 this month,
and it took me that long to realize

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.719
that she was that big of an inspiration.

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:51.687
I'm just going to keep --
yeah, thanks, mom.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.248
(Applause)

00:01:58.532 --> 00:02:01.192
She's also one of the most
extraordinary people I know,

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:03.485
beyond being a wonderful musician.

00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:07.222
I want to play a little bit for mom
and your moms as well, actually.

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:10.720
(Cello music)

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.142
(Music ends)

00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:27.196
You know, when you normally
hear a cello, you think of this.

00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:29.745
(Plays Bach Cello Suite No.1)

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.971
We're not going to do that today.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:35.079
(Laughter and applause)

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.304
(Drums)

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:43.684
(Cello)

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.639
Hey!

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:50.476
(Looped samples of onstage sounds)

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.257
(Cello music and looped samples)

00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.911
(Music ends)

00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:04.766
(Applause and cheers)
