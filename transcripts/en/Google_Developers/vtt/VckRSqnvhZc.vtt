00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.880
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: I'm J. R. Henley; I'm the product
developer for Weather Decision Technologies

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:19.259
in Norman, Oklahoma. And we are a Google Maps
API user. Right now we have weather maps using

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:27.550
the Google Flash Maps API. And we have that
embedded in about 250 or 300 newspaper and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.309
television websites.
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: Scott Gansen, I'm a senior software

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.430
engineer for Weather Decision Technologies.
I kind of do the nuts and bolts behind the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750
scene programming that feed these guys data
for the maps.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:52.469
&gt;&gt; And so it's not your decision to [indistinct]
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: We've been using the JavaScript

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.059
API for quire a while, almost since the--since
it was released. And I really wanted the ability

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.210
to do the animations that we can do in Flash.
And so, we actually had started down the road

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.420
of making our weather products available in
a Flash application. And Google happened to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.340
be the first public release of Flash API.
And so, it really worked out well for us that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.450
we had already--we are familiar with the Google
product and so we ported everything and had

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:40.250
been really happy with it. [pause]
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: Initially I think during the beta

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.200
stages it was a little doggy but I think now
it's really performing very nicely I would

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.850
say. And from requests all the way through
just regular process or usage and things like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.060
that on a compliance computer. And so, it's
been a great asset.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.939
&gt;&gt; [indistinct]
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: Not that I remember a version.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.329
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Yeah, it just seems to continually
get better. You know, they'll add enhancements

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.540
and improvements. And at the same time we're
learning how to do things better with the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.319
Flash code. And so, it's been a growing process
I think for both Google and our company as

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.300
well.
&gt;&gt; And so, enter the feature, and so, what

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.900
additional features that Google added to this?
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Right now we have some problems

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.769
with--we load a lot of custom-tile data. And
we would like the ability to determine whether

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.680
or not a tile has loaded successfully or maybe
a progress of a tile loading. We'd like to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.480
have something like that built into the API
for both our tiles and for Google Map tiles.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.640
Sometimes with the API the Google Map tiles
themselves have a problem coming through or

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.540
something.
&gt;&gt; And where do you get your data?

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.280
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Oh, we actually, oh, all right,
Scott, you go ahead with that one, that's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.590
you.
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: yeah, a lot of it like you said

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.170
is like custom tile layers. It's a lot of
what we do or a very dynamic data set such

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.750
as radar data over the entire United States.
It changes every five minutes. And so, we,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.470
yeah, we created odds. It's been a very interesting
process. I think we've had three different

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.390
iterations on how we actually create the data
and serve it into Google and things. And it's

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:47.530
fun though, it's challenging, that's for sure.
&gt;&gt; And so, what was the biggest challenge

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.170
that you've encountered?
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: I'll let you go from there.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.890
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: All right, yeah. Initially the
Google info windows weren't able to--you weren't

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.879
able to do custom info windows with the Flash
API. And our clients wanted to have control

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.220
over the look and feel of what the info windows
look like. And so, we ended up not using the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.170
Google info windows but we made map markers
that when you would click on them they would

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.199
get big and look like an info window but they
were really just big map markers at that point.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:33.320
&gt;&gt; And [indistinct] what do you see is the
future in map making?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.680
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: There are a couple of things there.
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: I se there--I see a lot of mapping

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.120
in the mobile space. You're already seeing
that with Android, you know, with all these

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.370
Smart Phones. I think there will be a lot
more GPS integration. There will be a lot

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.050
more--and a lot more live data being fed in
maps. And that is actually the project that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.410
I'm working on. It's called the iMap Tracker
and what I'm doing with this is taking live

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.050
video feeds from storm chasers in the field
and plotting their location on a Google map.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.889
And you can click on a marker for their vehicle
and it opens a window that will show live

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.120
video from their vehicle which is kind interesting.
We've actually seen tornadoes happening in

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.490
the Real Time on the Google map which is kind
of fun and exciting.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.910
&gt;&gt; Do you work on that with other agencies?
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Our offices are right next door

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.320
to the National Weather Center. And so, we're
close by. And we have partnered with some,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.520
what do you call it, data something?
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: It's more on the data side then

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.810
I'd say the mapping side and the end use of
side.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.500
&gt;&gt; And what's your favorite landing site besides,
you know, Google?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.550
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: Maps.google.com, I guess.
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: You know, I didn't have any answer

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.500
for that question.
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: But I knew it.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:21.919
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: We always go to our own sites.
&gt;&gt; And with the interesting [indistinct] do

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.585
you want to share [indistinct] maps API?
&gt;&gt; GANSEN: The maps API itself? Oh, they have

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:29.060
a tile manager and you had to do...
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Yes, for us--initially, there wasnâ€™t

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:37.400
a custom-tile layer overlay class available
in the Flash API. And so, for us to get animated

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:47.300
radar as--which we're creating in tiles, we
had to basically create a new map layer that

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:57.620
have the Google tiles underneath our pseudo-animated
radar tiles. And getting that all to work

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.690
and be really smooth was a pretty big challenge
but we ended up making it through. And about

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.050
the time we made it through that then Google
released the class to let do that directly

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.910
and so.
&gt;&gt; And so now it all worked out.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.539
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: And so, it worked out, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, okay, thanks a lot for your time.

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.370
&gt;&gt; HENLEY: Thank you very much.
