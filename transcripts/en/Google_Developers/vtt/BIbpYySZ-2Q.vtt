TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.170
and this is your data about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.510
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.860
Behind AlphaGo Is
Google DeepMind.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.390
Their mission is to solve
intelligence and use it to make

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.100
the world a better place.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.090
And they've decided to
start using TensorFlow

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.900
for all their future research.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.830
They believe it will
enable them to execute

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.850
their ambitious research
goals at much larger scale

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.860
and an even faster pace.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.660

the discussion, click the link.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.260
The latest version
of Android Studio

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.450
now supports Android and
developer preview along

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.470
with improvements
to Instant Run that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.530
let you update incremental
changes to your app

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.720
code significantly faster.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.900
Follow the link for
details and the update.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.220
Starting with Android
N, there is a new mode

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.010
called Direct Boot, which is
when the device is powered on,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.140
but the user hasn't
yet unlocked it.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.180
It's ideal for apps that
schedule alarms, provide

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.820
important and
timely notifications

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.310
such as messaging apps,
or provide services

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.490
to other apps or the system,
such as accessibility services.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.379
If your app is similar
to one of those,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.870
check out the post on how
to support Direct Boot.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.700
According to a study by Juniper
Research, barely 1% of apps

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.510
are now paid for at
the point of download.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.890
With this demand for
free apps on the rise,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.765
you're left with an
important question.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:21.390
What's the best way
to publish your app

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.840
for free while sustainably
funding your business?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.250
Well, here's the no nonsense
guide to in-app ads.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.940
In it you'll learn foundational
advertising concepts,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.710
how pay per click works, a
basic explanation of ad networks

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.430
and how they can help you
monetize your app, and more.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.450
In addition to the credential
management API mentioned

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.910
last week, Chrome 51 beta
also reduces the overhead

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.350
of offscreen rendering.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.370
For more details
on these updates,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.350
as well as all the new features
and changes in this release,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.430
check out the post.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.330
It's time to say
goodbye to OAuth 1.0.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.190
Goodbye.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.040
So long.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.170
We are moving away from
the OAuth 1.0 protocol

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.600
in order to focus our
support on the current OAuth

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.960
standard, OAuth 2.0, which
increases security and reduces

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.240
complexity for developers.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.590
This final phase of the shutdown
will see two legged OAuth 1.0

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.540
go away on October 20, 2016.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.550
For more information and
tips on moving to OAuth 2.0,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.860
take a look at the post.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.000
In fact, take a look
at all the posts.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.580
They're super.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.960

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.076

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:35.200
And I'll see you next week.
