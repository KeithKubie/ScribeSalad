00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.999
Yes sir - neat t-shirt.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.999
Pretty cool. Are you alone or do you have some friends?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They will come up when the demo was done.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.999
Excellent. That will be one minute 43 seconds,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.999
but we'll let you do it anyway.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay. David Weinberger from the Harvard innovation Lab.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And another with which I have a potential conflict of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
interest because they are great friends. Over to you guys.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.999
Thank you. It's a thrill for our entire team to be here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.999
I'll say this is an historic occasion, the launch of the DPLA

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.999
It's really amazing to be here,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to be in the presence of these other sprinters is my head and heart are exploding with desire to interoperate.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.999
It's thrilling.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.999
So shelflife collaborative is proposing to projects, integrated one is Library cloud which shows the heavy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
lifting, and ShelfLife, which is the  far more gregarious application that runs on top of it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.999
Libra cloud -- it manages metadata from collections,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.999
and makes it through open APIs and open data.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.999
The aim of Library Cloud is to take everything  that libraries no

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.999
and make it all available to the entire web ecosystem.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.999
Including other sites

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.999
and services like Wikipedia that can take it up, but also to developers and innovators who built perhaps,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.999
recommendation engines or a library analytics or other portals like ShelfLife or who knows what.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999
That's the whole point.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.999
So Library Cloud currently has about 15 million items in it, which means metadata about items,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.999
we don't collect content itself, including situation data,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.999
non-iced from partner libraries which included free

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.999
public libraries and to University libraries.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.999
We also have been gathering metadata about Web objects.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.999
We think of Libra cloud as metadata -- Library Cloud  it takes metadata,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.999
as value to it puts out into the world applications, to get up, feedback in and every turn,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.999
that metadata gets more value,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.999
amplified in Italian which means that the impact

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.999
and value of the DPLA  is also amplified.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.999
So let's take a look at shelflife.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.999
This by the way is a screen cast that we did in our hotel

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.999
over WiFi last night. But it's real stuff, you can come see it in our booth were of course go to our

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.999
Sprint project online

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.999
and spend as much time as you want poking at it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Our ideas that we do get -- get to this site either by coming to DPLA.org

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
or maybe go to your local library site which it has a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.999
embedded DPLA which it. Also to many of its services.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So it's -- widget.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.999
Or other apps that we can perhaps interoperate with.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.999
We did -- this is a page, when you click on something you're interested in,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.999
in this case we got here because shelflife recommended Pluto files,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.999
because it knows about what we've been doing and Library Cloud has a great deal of information about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.999
the general ecology of interest.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.999
So the first thing to notice about  Library Cloud is that it is -- ShelfLife is that it is a place.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.999
We think it should be a place because we firmly believe

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.999
that the  DPLA is going to be a major Web destination.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.999
But it's also a place because ShelfLife is just not a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.999
place you go to look up something you know you want or to find something that you  didn't know you want,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.999
which is wonderful when that happens.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.999
It's also a place to spend some time, explore, browse, navigate, to contribute, to enhance, to learn,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.999
and to share with other people,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.999
because it's a social all the way through.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.999
So this means it has to be accessible to everyone.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.999
In fact, the DPLA has to be accessible to everyone, so we use the single most common understandable simple

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.999
user interface around, which are shelves.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.999
If you prefer the now standard OPAC cover browser,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.999
we can do that too, when we have covers.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.999
So if the object that you're looking at is a book,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.999
the width of the book indicates its page count.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.999
Actually, it's -- represent its length.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.999
But if it's online, then ShelfLife is a fully click

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.999
and play application. So you click  in this case,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.999
we're going out to the open Library,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.999
in fact using their embedded browser, so thank you,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.999
open Library for everything you do. You are amazing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.999
If it's media, a video, same deal. You click on it, click and play, and you can watch it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.999
He same for audio and the same for webpages.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We have 50,000 Wikipedia pages about books for sample that you can click on.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.999
So that's a lot of context, right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.999
These shells are in fact special. Special in three ways.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.999
The first way is this is our attempt to integrate the five collections that we have,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.999
all in one infinite bookshelf. Now,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.999
you can facet these back to their original collections

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.999
because browsing by collection is a useful thing to do but with ShelfLife you can also facet them  so you see

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.999
only the content of your local library.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.999
This is a pretty interesting way of combining the interest of the DPLA and local libraries.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.999
Second way this is special  is at the depth of the color blue indicates community relevance

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.999
or we call shelve rank,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.999
we can't live based on user interactions plus using that

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.999
and I Mize circulation data that we're getting from our contributors.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.999
The third way this is special, the shelf, is that all items occur,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.999
all works of culture occur in the context,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.999
in fact they occur in multiple contexts is, even the brain is contextual.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.999
That's what we do. So we allow you to put it on say,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.999
the Pluto files, see it in multiple contexts.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.999
One of the context is that is carefully prepared by special librarians, categorized,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.999
click on the categories were any of them

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.999
and see this work with all the other items by

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.999
professional librarians but we also want to provide that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
-- combine that with some of libraries with the wisdom of

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.999
users as well so you can see it in the context of what

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.999
other users intend or how they recommended works, bring them out of the long tail.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.999
You can also create -- users can create collections, and our collections are very simple,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.999
it's that easy to do, select some objects.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.999
You make a collection, added to an existing one

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.999
or create a new one. Very simple, straightforward,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
powerful and useful. If you notice down here, it says Chicago story nights.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.999
That is in fact an extraMUROS collection, created by them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.999
When you click on it, it will take you to extraMUROS,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.999
launch it, and you can use their beautiful browser.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.999
So we provide a lot of contact with ShelfLife, that's what it's about.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.999
The contact  works is not just other works.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.999
The context is people as well. So shelflife is social, although it does all the way through.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.999
Social, social, social. You can rate it,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.999
you can draw things with stars, you can like it, you can follow it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.999
The following established as a longer-term relationship with the object,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.999
so that you get notified when for example there are new

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.999
reviews or the author has published new work

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.999
or discussion you are in has been added to.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.999
Or maybe Neil Degrasse Tyson is going to show up at your

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.999
local library and do a book check.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.999
-- Book chat . This is how we have emphasized the social, we think that's hugely important.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.999
One more way though that these balloons on the right

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.999
indicate that there's been some social activity around the object.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.999
We drop you in immediately in place where you can

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.999
comment, read, start up a new topic.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.999
We've been thinking is a possibility that perhaps

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.999
comments from libraries ought to be highlighted,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.999
because we want to make sure that we gather as much of

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.999
what libraries know and as much as users, crowds, communities know as well. Make it all available.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.999
So there's much, much more.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.999
This is a little taste.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.999
We encourage you to come to our booth

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.999
or go online to see the whole thing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.999
We hope that it gives you a sense of where we're going with this. This shelflife and library cloud a real,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.999
they work, they scale,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.999
but this is just the beginning of figuring out what this vision is.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.999
That's figure -- figuring out that vision is something we have to do together. We would love to together.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.999
With Sprint partners, with everybody here.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.999
But the real opportunity we think for the DPLA  is not simply to connect people to works. That's revolutionary,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.999
that's amazing. That will change the world.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.999
But culture doesn't consist of people interaction with works.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.999
The real opportunity for DPLA is connect people to people through works,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.999
 because that's how you create culture, that's how it is created. That's how it grows, that's how it's enhance,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that's how it enters our lives,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.999
that's how culture comes to matter to us. And we think that is fully within the mission

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the hope that we heard today of the digital put --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.999
Thank you.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.999
Where's our team? Come on up.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Our team is joining us.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
As we come down, a question appear? -- A question up here quick

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.999
Great. My name is Laura Parsons, and my question is,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.999
obviously you're going to measure -- gather a lot of user data on this.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.999
I'm wondering what your plans would be for that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.999
Which aspect of the plans? What were going to do with it? Privacy issues?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.999
Yes, both of those things.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.999
There are plenty of things -- we have all seen those

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.999
examples sites on the web's that do amazing things with

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.999
knowing what users are doing. Opt in, opt in,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.999
let me say that again, ought in. -- opt in.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.999
Amazon does amazing things as well.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There's lots of readers sites,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.999
I'll be asleep Amazon is not an opt in -- obviously

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.999
Amazon is not an opt in example.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.999
We think of opting in, default to protecting user privacy,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.999
any of these circulars

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.999
and data that would take into Library Cloud for example

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.999
is entirely anonymous, no identifiers .

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.999
Date sample is only a day,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.999
the IDs are entirely grander last.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.999
-- Granule her eyes peers -- granularized.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.999
Good question.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.999
Other questions?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.999
Comments?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.999
Suggestions? [Laughter]

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.999
Because Library thing knows -- which we love

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.999
and who is one of our partners, first of all,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.999
buying is an interesting proposition but leaving that

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.999
aside, Library thing which we love, many of us are users,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.999
knows a huge amount about what users know,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.999
what their preferences are, what they're saying, in fact,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.999
we're getting -- we have social metadata from them

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.999
already, so for example, a library cloud,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.999
we know how many people -- how many times a work is

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.999
mentioned in the Library Cloud discussion. Not who, how many times.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.999
Library Cloud for all of its wonderfulness, doesn't know libraries. It knows what readers know,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.999
it's fabulous at that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.999
But we want to make sure that none of the wisdom

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.999
or the metadata of libraries is left behind.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.999
That's great. Sack?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Great work. It's incredible, it's amazing. Very well done. Thank you.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.999
[Laughter] I'm working on Sunday similar

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.999
and I have one suggestion for you,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.999
which is  consider integrating social rank it with

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.999
everything. And we have a recommendation with stars

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.999
and things like that, but for comments

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.999
and -- I like your idea of giving special emphasis to librarians comments,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.999
and you could do something where you allow readers to

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.999
rank up the best comment so that you are only exposed to the highest quality things.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
One of the problems with Internet is it's so chaotic and almost too Democratic.

This is a problem that's been addressed by lots of sort of thinking.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.999
The key things are member is bigger Remer -- this is an

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.999
open system, and especially with Liber -- Library Cloud,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.999
if you want for sample, a different recognition engine,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.999
you don't wake -- you don't like the way you have

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.999
