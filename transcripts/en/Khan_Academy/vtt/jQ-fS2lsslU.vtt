00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's do some problems with
plotting points and graphical

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.110
representations of functions.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.070
So I didn't write the problem
here, but what they ask us to

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.590
do here is figure out
the coordinates of

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.800
each of these points.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.200
So let's just do that.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.350
So first we have this
point a right there.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.240
So I'll just write a is
at the coordinate.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.090
So we write the x-coordinate
first. So its x-coordinate is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.780
how far to the left or the right
it is of the origin.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.830
And it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to
the left, or it is negative 6

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.230
of the origin, or it's at the
coordinate negative 6.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.420
So negative 6, that's
right there.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.950
And then its y-coordinate, which
is how high it is, that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.330
is right there.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.850
That's 4.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.790
Negative 6, 4.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.060
Let's do b right there.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.890
b is at the coordinate-- let's
see, its x-coordinate, and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.580
just drop down there, is 7.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.950
And its y-coordinate, how
high it is, is 6.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.730
All right.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.980
Let's do c.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.410
The x-coordinate, and you can
read that, it's negative 8.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.110
It's 8 to the left
of the origin.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.550
Negative 8.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.000
And its y-coordinate, it's
2 below the origin.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.120
So its y-coordinate right
there is negative 2.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.200
This is, I think,
not too painful.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.590
Part d, or coordinate
d, or point d.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.880
Point d, its y-coordinate,
it's at 4.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
And then its-- I'm sorry, its
x-coordinate is at 4, and then

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.860
its y-coordinate, how far down
it is, or in this vertical

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.730
axis, it is-- this looks
like negative 7.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.025
And then, finally,
we are on e.

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.720
I'm picking out a nice
color for e.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.420
e right there.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.460
Its x-coordinate is 5.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.340
It's right on the x-axis
at x is equal to 5.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.350
And its y-coordinate-- well,
it isn't above or below the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.960
origin or the x-axis, so
its y-coordinate is 0.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.930
You could draw a line and
go straight there to 0.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.120
So there we go.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940
We figured out all of
those coordinates.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.220
Now this problem 5 here-- let me
scroll over a little bit--

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.150
they say determine whether each
relation is a function.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.990
So here the trick is to realize
that a relation is not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.040
a function if they define two
values for a given x.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.660
Let me give an example here.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.680
So if I wrote that f of x is
equal to 5 if x is equal to 1,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.820
or it's equal to 6 if
x is equal to 1.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.070
This makes no sense.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.710
Why doesn't it make any sense?

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.810
Because if I put a 1 in there,
I don't know what

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.510
I'm going to produce?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.000
Am I going to produce a 5?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.460
Am I going to produce a 6?

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.230
This is a badly structured
function.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.720
This is not a function.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.360
So if there's any situation for
the same input value, they

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.880
define two different output
values, we're not going to

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.030
have a function.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.860
So let's see if they
do that here.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.120
So in this first part, part a,
they say, if you could imagine

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.160
if x is 1 then y is 7.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.010
If x is 2, y is 7 as well.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.130
That is OK.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.500
You could have two x values
getting the same y value.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.020
For example, that'd be like
saying f of x is equal to 7 if

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.740
x is equal to 1 or 2.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
This is completely fine.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.020
For two different x values you
can get the same output value,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.160
but you can't have two different
x values giving the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.120
same-- sorry-- you can't have
the same x value producing two

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.060
different outputs.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.870
Because then you don't know,
hey, if you went f of 1, you

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.100
don't know what f of 1 is.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
f of 1, is it a 5, is it 6?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.900
You don't know.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.780
Here you know what f
of 1 is, it's 7.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.440
Here you know what f
of 2 is, it's 7.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.050
So, so far so good.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.850
So when you have 2,
you have a 7.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.570
When your input is
3, you get an 8.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.810
When your input is
4, you get an 8.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.840
So, for example, our function
definition, so it's 8 if x is

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.550
equal to 3 or 4.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.960
And then 5.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.770
And then our function is equal
to 9 if x is equal to 5.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010
So part a, this is our function
definition, right

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.250
here, for part a, which is a
completely legitimate function

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.680
definition.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.080
You give me any value 1, 2, 3,
4, or 5, which would be the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.740
domain in this situation, and I
will tell you what the value

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.000
of that function is at
any of those points.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.230
And the range would
be 7, 8, or 9.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.660
So part a is definitely
a function.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.110
Now part b.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.940
Let's see, if x is 1, y is 1.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.140
But then they say, if x
is 1, y is negative 1.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.560
Well, that makes no sense.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.760
They're doing this right here.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.202
They're trying to make a
function, where they say this

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:16.790
function is going to be equal
to 1 if x is equal to 1, but

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.180
then it's going to be equal to
negative 1 if x is equal to 1.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.370
So if I were to take f of
1, I don't know what

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.840
it's going to be.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.700
Is it 1 or negative 1?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.910
I don't know, do I take this
1 or do I take that 1?

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.870
So this is not a function.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.850
So part b is not a function.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.270
That relation is
not a function.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.060
All right.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.450
Let's do a couple more.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.520
Problem 6.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.185
Write the function rule
for each graph.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:48.450
So we have this little
v looking thing.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.910
So we could write it
a couple of ways.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.425
Let's call it f of x.

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:55.120
And you could call it g of x, or
h of x, but if you haven't

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.440
used your f yet, people
tend to use f of x.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.940
So this is x.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.980
So let's see, it looks like
it's one line when x is

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.320
greater than the 0, and
another line when x

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.320
is less than 0.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.960
So it's one thing when x is,
let's say, greater than or

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.990
equal to 0.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.470
And another thing when
x is less than 0.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.490
And I'm going to merge
the two in a second.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.520
So what does the line
look like here?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.280
When x is 0, y is 0.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.860
When x is 2, y is 1.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.690
When x is 4, y is 2.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.370
It looks like no matter
what x is, y is going

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.630
to be 1/2 of that.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.630
When x is 6, y is 3.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.440
So it's equal to 1/2x, when
x is greater than 0.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.070
And then when x is less
than 0, when x is

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.930
negative 2, y is 1.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.620
When x is negative 4, y is 2.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.750
So here it looks like it's
the negative 1/2 of it.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.600
Negative 1/2 times negative
4 is positive 2.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.790
So it's negative 1/2 times
x, when x is less than 0.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.870
So this is a completely
legitimate answer.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.660
But if we wanted to make it a
little bit simpler, or clean

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.670
it up a little bit, we could
write this function definition

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.640
as f of x being equal to--
instead of dividing it between

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.340
greater than or less than 0,
let's just take the absolute

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.890
value of x and then multiply
that times 1/2.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.920
Because here, that obviously
works for positive values,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.430
because the absolute value
of x will be equal to x.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.402
But then for negative values,
the absolute value of x is

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.170
equal to negative x.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.150
So you take negative 2 here.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.910
Negative 2, take the absolute
value, you get 2

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.570
times 1/2 is 1.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.890
So either of these would
be legitimate function

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.630
definitions.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.870
Problem 10.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.270
Use the vertical line test-- let
me switch colors for this

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.500
one-- use the vertical line test
to determine whether each

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.570
relation is a function.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.530
Now, the vertical line test is
just a visual way of doing

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.980
exactly what we did in this
problem over here.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.370
Something is only a function
if for a given x value, you

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.670
only have one y value.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.670
So for example, when they say a
vertical line, that means at

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.970
any point I should be able to
draw a vertical line on this

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.240
function and only intersect
it once.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.420
Because a vertical line says
when x is equal to 3, there's

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.400
only one value that I can
get on our function.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.810
That's what I'm doing with
a vertical line.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.510
When x is equal to 0, there's
only one point on the function

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.290
that is mapped from
x is equal to 0.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.150
So this one right here
is a function.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.950
Any vertical line you draw
will only intersect the

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.559
function once.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.039
This one, very clearly, you
draw any vertical line.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.970
You draw any vertical line
here and you're going to

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.700
intersect the graph twice.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.110
So this is saying, this vertical
line that I just

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.590
drew, this is essentially saying
f of 2 could be this

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.400
point over here.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.060
This looks like, I don't know,
maybe it's equal to, it could

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.810
be equal to 1.9 or it
could be-- what is

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.790
this?-- negative 1.9.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.620
This is not a proper function
definition.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.010
I don't know whether f of 2 is
this value or that value.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.300
I don't know whether f of 0 is
that value or that value.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.510
And you could keep going across
the whole number line.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.950
You don't know whether f of 5
is this value or this value.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.870
So this is not a function.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.990
This relation is
not a function.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.620
And it's the same logic as we
did before, but we're saying

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.290
the vertical line.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.350
You could draw a vertical line
and you can intersect the

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.110
relation or the graph twice,
so it's not a function.
