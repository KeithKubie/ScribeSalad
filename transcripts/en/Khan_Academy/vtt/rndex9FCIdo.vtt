00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.580
If a and b are
vectors in space given

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.230
by a is i minus 2j over
the square root of 5

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.320
and b is 2i plus j plus 3k
over the square root of 14,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.460
then the value of-- so we have
2a plus b dotted with-- that's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.960
a dot product there-- a
cross b cross a minus 2b is.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.260
And if you-- and I actually
tried this out a little bit

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.100
before this video.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.140
If you actually just
tried to first take

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.080
the cross product of a
and b, which you can do,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.259
and then try to take the
cross product of that

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.360
with a minus 2b, it's going
to be unbelievably hairy,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.632
unbelievably
computationally intensive.

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:40.840
And you're probably going
to make a careless mistake,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.350
especially when you take the
cross product with a minus 2b.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.039
It's a really, really,
really, really hairy problem.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.080
And in general, taking
cross products tend to be,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.020
but even more so when the
actual vectors look like this.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.540
So the trick of this
problem is to try

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.420
to do it without actually
having to take cross products.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660
And to do that, we're
going to use a little trick

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.800
called the triple
product expansion

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.130
or Lagrange's formula.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.880
And I actually just uploaded
a video proving the triple

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.220
product expansion for those
of y'all who don't like--

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.630
and I'm one of those.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.591
I'm one of the y'all that
doesn't like just random

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:16.090
formulas.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.600
I like to see
where it came from.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.920
But the triple product
expansion, it really

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120
allows us to rewrite a--
let me write it over here.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.440
It allows us to write
a cross b cross c.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.650
It allows us to write that.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.160
And I'm just speaking in general
terms of a, b, and c here,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.250
not these particular
a's and b's.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.694
It allows you to rewrite
that as the first vector.

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:40.110
And when I talk about the first
vector and the first cross

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.450
product, I'm talking
about the cross product

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.510
you would have to take first.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.923
In this case, it would
be this one, where

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:45.380
it's the cross
product on the right,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.280
I guess I should call it.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.450
Because there's
other ways that you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.010
could take the cross product
first where it's on the left.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.210
So you take this,
the first vector

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.595
here, so it'll be b
scaled by a dot c--

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:00.920
let me scroll to the
left a little bit--

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.700
minus the second vector
in that second cross

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.560
product minus c times a dot b.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160
So when you have this kind of
triple product right over here,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.350
you're taking the cross
product of three vectors,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.387
you can simplify it.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.470
And it is a simplification
because the dot product

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.669
is a much simpler operation to
compute than the cross product.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.460
So let's see how we
can apply it over here.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.410
It looks like we have a triple
product-looking thing here.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.290
We have the cross product of two
vectors crossed with a third.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.260
So it's a slightly different
thing than this over here.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.440
But what we can do is
we can swap it around

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.590
so it's the same order.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.190
So this over here in green,
this is the exact same thing.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.934
If I just swap the order of
these two cross products,

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:47.850
it'll be the negative.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.010
So this will be negative
a-- that's ugly parentheses.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:03.050
a minus 2b, so I'm putting
it first, cross a cross b.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.056
So all I did is I
rewrote this green part.

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:06.930
When you swap the order
of the cross product,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.035
you put a negative out front.

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:12.160
And actually, let me just
distribute this negative.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.321
So this is the same thing.

00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:14.820
If I multiply a
negative times this,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.520
it just swaps these two terms.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.627
So it's 2b minus
a cross a cross b.

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:26.460
Now, the reason why I
like this form is it's

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.670
exactly the form
that I have up here.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.520
It's exactly this form.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.010
And so I can use Lagrange's
formula or the triple product

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.320
expansion.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.787
And so I'm just going to focus
on the green part right now.

00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:40.870
We can worry about this
thing out front that we're

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.578
going to take the dot
product with later.

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:45.870
Let's see if we can
simplify this green part.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.080
So this will be equal to
just using the triple product

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.210
expansion.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.590
We're looking at our
second cross product.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.580
This is our second
cross product over here.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.740
So it's analogous to
that right over here.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.340
You take the first vector in
your second cross product.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.080
So that's the vector a.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.500
And I multiply that
times the dot product

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.420
of this vector and that vector.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:17.325
So it's going to be 2b
minus a dotted with b,

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:19.589
dotted with vector b.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.730
And then from that,
I'm just going

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.385
to subtract the second vector.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.320
Let me do that in another color.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.356
I'm going to subtract b.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.800
So this is the same b over here.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.220
Maybe I should color code it.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.070
This a is that a there.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.300
And then this b is this b here.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.160
So b times the dot
product of-- so it's

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.020
going to be other
than magenta again--

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.610
the dot product of this guy,
2b minus a dotted with a.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.850
So the dot product of
the other two vectors.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.080
Now let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.360
So what we have in
parentheses here,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.965
so this over here in
green, the dot product,

00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:11.950
that's just the distributive
property applied.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.790
So this is going to be
2b dotted with b again.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.160
Or you might already know
that if I take a vector

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.110
and I take the dot
product with itself,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.940
that's the same thing
as its magnitude.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.620
That's the same thing
as the magnitude

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.710
of the vector squared.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.890
So let's just write that down.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.690
So 2b dot b is going to
be-- actually, let me just

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.210
write it as 2b dot b.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.420
And then we have minus a dot b.

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:46.805
So I just distributed.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.690
I didn't actually
use that notation.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.110
And all of that's going
to be times the vector a.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.280
And then we have
minus-- let me pick

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.190
another color-- minus
all of this stuff.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.250
So we have 2b dot a.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.040
So let me write it this way.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.790
I'm going to just leave
the minus b out front.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.280
So let me write a minus, and
then I'll put the b over here.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.384
And so you have 2b
dot a-- that color.

00:06:19.384 --> 00:06:20.800
b dot a is the
same thing as a dot

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.720
b, so I'll just write 2a dot
b, and then minus a dot a.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.950
So remember, we're just working
on this green part right here.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.845
But since we already
have all of these dot

00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:37.540
products of a with
themselves and a dot b

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.130
and b with themselves,
maybe let's just

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.590
see what happens if we
actually try to evaluate these,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.690
and maybe this will simplify
some of our algebra.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.360
But you wouldn't have to.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.485
You could just keep going
with the a's and the b's.

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.910
But maybe these evaluate to
relatively straightforward

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.660
numbers since we actually
know what our a's and b's are.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.380
So let's try that out.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.790
So what is a dot a
going to be equal to?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.180
Well, you're just
really squaring

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.370
each of the components
of a and adding them up.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.840
So the first component,
the i component,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.940
is 1 over the square root of 5.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.360
So 1 over the square root of
5 squared is going to be 1/5.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.290
And then negative 2 over
the square root of 5 squared

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.750
is going to be plus 4/5.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.820
So our intuition was correct.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.610
When you take the dot
product of a and a,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.060
it's a very simple number.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.670
It is 1.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.700
Let's do the same thing with b.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.430
If I take b dot
b, what do I get?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.870
So 2 over the square root
of 14 squared is 4/14.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.110
And then 1 over the square root
of 14 squared is plus 1/14.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.990
And then 3 over the
square root of 14 squared

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.280
is 9/14, plus 9/14.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.130
And this, once
again, adds up to 1.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.710
This, once again, adds up to 1.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.400
So it looks like things
are simplifying a good bit.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.190
So let's just try a dot b.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.160
So that's going to be 1 over
the square root of 5 times 2

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.270
over the square root of 14.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.190
So it's going to be 2 over
the square root of 70.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.070
I just multiplied the x terms.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.280
And then we're going
to have negative 2

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.730
over the square root of 5 times
1 over the square root of 14.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.910
So that's negative 2 over
the square root of 70.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.890
And then plus 0.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.539
This has no k
component, so it's going

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.320
to be 0 times this, whatever
the k component is here,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.320
but that's still going to be 0.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.909
So this just evaluates all to 0.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.810
So that simplifies
things a good bit.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:50.540
This green expression right
here simplifies to-- this

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.920
is 2 times 1, which is
just 2, minus 0, right?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.680
a dot b we just
figured out is 0.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.880
So this is just 2
times a minus-- now

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.972
what is this going
to be equal to?

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:11.490
a dot b we just figured
out. a dot b is 0.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.950
And then a dot a we
figured out is 1.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.240
So it's minus negative, so
this becomes a positive b, so

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.550
plus b.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:26.950
So all of this mess over
here simplified to 2a

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.490
plus b, which is the
exact same thing we

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.140
have over here-- 2a plus b.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.162
So let's actually-- that
we're dotting it with.

00:09:34.162 --> 00:09:35.370
So let me write it over here.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.900
So this whole thing
is this over here.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.130
And then we have to take the dot
product with 2a plus b again.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:48.410
So we're going to take the dot
product with 2a plus b again.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.520
It doesn't matter. a dot b
is the same thing as b dot a.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.980
And they're the same number,
so it matters even less.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.580
And here, the
distributive property

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.142
applies to the
vector dot product.

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:00.350
Let me make sure we remember.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.555
This is a dot product
that we're taking.

00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:06.470
This is a dot-- let me
put it in a darker color.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.590
This is a dot product.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.150
So this whole thing
was 2a plus b.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.000
I'm dotting it with
another 2a plus b.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.650
And now this, you just use the
distributive property here.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.705
So you have 2a dot 2a.

00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:23.380
That's going to be
4 times a dot a.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.220
And then 2a dotted
with b is going

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.730
to be plus 2 times a dot b.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:41.775
And then b dot 2a is going to
be plus 2 b dot a or a dot b.

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.670
I want to just switch
colors actually.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.975
b-- I'll do it in the
same color as the b.

00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:52.280
So b dot this is
going to be 2 a dot b.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.789
And then b dot b,
so plus b dot b.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:10:59.330
So what is this
going to evaluate to?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.940
a dot a is 1, so
it's going to be 4.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.700
a dot b is 0.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.600
And a dot b is 0.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.170
And then this is 1.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.390
So we have 4 plus 1.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.850
4 plus 1 is equal to 5.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.330
So this whole mess, if
you're able to remember

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.100
the triple product
expansion and kind of see

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.080
the simplification
over here, it's

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.830
actually a fairly
straightforward problem.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.910
This whole mess over here is 5.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.180
It evaluates to 5.
