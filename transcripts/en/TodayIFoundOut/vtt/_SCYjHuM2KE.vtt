00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.550
Pitched as the “ultimate sport”, chess
boxing is – depending on who you ask – either

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.480
a seamless blend of the cerebral and the physical
or a joke that got kinda out of hand…

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.649
Formally invented in the early 2000s, chess
boxing is the brainchild of a Dutch artist

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.260
Iepe Rubingh who has since recognised the
appeal of chess boxing as a spectator sport

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.719
and worked towards legitimising it as an athletic
pursuit.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
First though, for anyone unfamiliar with the
sport, chess boxing is described simply by

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.220
one of the governing bodies of the sport as
“11 alternating 3 minute rounds of chess

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.220
and boxing”.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.060
As per the rules, a traditional chess boxing
bout begins with a round of chess (specifically

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.110
speed chess where turn times are limited)
which is then immediately followed by a 3

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.320
minute round of boxing.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.640
Chess boxers are given only limited time to
compose themselves between rounds, during

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.060
which time the chess board is moved either
from or into the centre of the ring.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.270
Victory in chess boxing can be achieved via
either a checkmate, one’s opponent exceeding

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.590
the time limit on their chess clock, or knockout
and if a bout happens to go the full 11 rounds,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.969
it will be scored like a traditional boxing
match.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.310
This said, points can be deducted from a player
for doing things like stalling for time during

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.150
the chess rounds which could cost them the
win if the fight does go to a judge’s decision.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.240
In addition, victory can be achieved by stoppage,
technical knockout, or the disqualification

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
of an opponent.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.070
As you might expect, chess boxers must wear
boxing gloves during the boxing portions of

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.719
a chess boxing bout, one or both of which
can be removed for comfort’s sake during

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.250
chess rounds to make moving pieces easier.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.690
Further, to maintain the purity of the one-on-one
nature of chess boxing bouts, during chess

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.930
rounds chess boxers are required to wear headphones
to prevent people, including audience members,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.360
from giving them advice.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.420
No doubt with screaming fans and overly enthusiastic
commentators not far away, tuning all that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070
out via the headphones also probably helps
the chess boxers focus.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.670
Of course, for safety’s sake, the headphones
are removed for the boxing portions of a chess

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.730
boxing bout, meaning a chess boxer could theoretically
get advice on what move to make next while

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.730
boxing.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.140
Then again, someone able to parse technical
chess jargon over the roar of a crowd while

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.610
simultaneously being punched in the face is
probably someone who possesses a mind keen

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.160
enough to succeed at chess without advice,
so we guess that’s fine.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.850
Speaking of mental toughness, this in fact
is touted by many a chess boxer as one of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.049
the most difficult aspects of the sports-
having to switch between amping your body

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.250
up for a physical fight, and then as quickly
as possible calming down to direct a cool,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.360
collected mind at the fight on the board.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.380
Or as it states on the official Chess Boxing
Global website,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.109
Chess Boxing is a rare blend of contrasting
skills.

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.120
The athlete combines a powerful body with
a sharp mind, and rises above mindless muscle.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.510
In the ring, the fighter is fueled by testosterone,
adrenaline and skill.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.880
Three minutes later, he changes battlegrounds.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.130
The contender has only seconds to restrain
his fighting instinct and move into the silent

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.630
logic of his mind.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.691
Chessboxers need smartness for solving problems;
They must anticipate their opponent’s moves

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.160
in the ring, as well as on the board.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.530
It is the only sport in which the heart, mind
and body perform in total harmony.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.130
This is the ultimate battle.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.620
With that out of the way, you may now be wondering
where in the hell such a bizarre idea came

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.620
from?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.019
The answer to which is rather fittingly- a
comic book.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.449
You see, according to Rubingh chess boxing’s
genesis can be directly traced to a French

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:11.110
comic released in 1992 called Froid Équateur
(literally – “Cold Equator”) which is

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.009
set in the post apocalyptic future hellscape
of 2034.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.130
In the comic, chess boxing features heavyweight
boxers beating the living crap out of each

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.009
other on a giant chessboard.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.101
In an interview with The Guardian Rubingh
notes that he was intrigued by the idea of

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.790
chess boxing after stumbling across Froid
Équateur in his father’s comic collection

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.160
as a teenager and was keen to make some version
of it into an actual sport.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.780
A performance artist and natural comedian
at heart, Rubingh is known in the art world

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.900
for his numerous, often humorous, performance
art pieces.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.220
In fact, one such instance actually saw him
acquire the moniker “The Joker”, which

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.930
he’s still known by to this day.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.150
This was a result of a time he blocked off
an intersection in downtown Tokyo with police

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.150
tape.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.740
Naturally, the stunt earned Rubingh a ten
day jail sentence, which is what he was originally

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.740
going for.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.040
The joke in all this was he spent the duration
of his time in jail dressed in a traditional

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.050
jester’s outfit, hence the subsequent nickname.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.710
Chess boxing has similar origins and was likewise
intended to begin life as a performance art

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.030
piece, with the artist hoping the absurdity
of the whole thing would do what all art intends

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.410
to do and make people think.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.410
To quote Rubingh himself,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.400
We tend to divide everything into different
worlds, but in my opinion worlds are much

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.260
more connected than people see them at first.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.270
Chess boxing breaks through this habit.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.370
So many people say to me: ‘Chess and boxing,
they just don’t fit together,’ and some

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.910
chess players hate the idea, but they forget
that former world boxing champion Lennox Lewis

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.870
and current champion Vitali Klitschko both
play chess.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.400
Boxing is about the control of aggression,
and chess boxing is 200% about the control

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400
of aggression.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.780
All this said, to Rubingh’s surprise, chess
boxing turned out to be a hit, with the first

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.470
official chess boxing bout in a Berlin art
gallery, pitting Rubingh against a friend

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.120
called Jean Louis Veenstra, proving to be
bizarre enough a concept that it actually

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.320
packed the gallery to capacity.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.260
Spurred by the unexpected success of the joke,
Rubingh decided to try and turn his creation

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.389
into a legitimate sport, holding the first
official Chess Boxing World Championship later

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.800
that same year in Amsterdam, drawing a crowd
of over a thousand people.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.950
Officially endorsed by both the Dutch Chess
Federation and Dutch Boxing Association, Rubingh

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.380
once again put on the gloves and fought Veenstra
for the championship.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.680
Styling himself as Iepe the Joker for the
bout, Veenstra (or Luis the Lawyer as he’s

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.390
known in the ring) fought a vicious battle
on both the canvas and chessboard with Rubingh

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.610
eventually emerging victorious- meaning that
not only is Rubingh the inventor of chess

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.770
boxing, he’s its first champion.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.910
Of his victory in the match, Rubingh notes,
“I had a pretty terrible position on the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.260
board so in the last round I tried to knock
him out.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.350
He only just managed to stay on his feet.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.710
The bell went and he put his hands up in the
air but he couldn’t find his corner.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.930
He was really dizzy but we still had to play
the final round of chess.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.889
There was a clear win for him, but he just
couldn’t figure out the right moves.”

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.930
Rubingh has since abandoned art almost entirely
to focus on promoting chess boxing as a legitimate

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.370
sporting pursuit, founding the World Chess
Boxing Organisation.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.750
As a nod to the sport’s origins, Rubingh
made sure to found this organisation in Berlin

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.460
and saw to it that the first honorary chairman
of the WCBO was Froid Équateur creator Enki

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.460
Bilal.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.380
Thanks to these efforts, chess boxing is now
a legitimate sporting endeavour that while

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.020
having admittedly niche appeal at present,
has a thriving and rapidly growing pool of

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.169
chess boxing talent that now tallies over
2,000 athletes across the world, with India

00:07:28.169 --> 00:08:44.139
seeing the largest group with over 600 people
competing in the sport.
