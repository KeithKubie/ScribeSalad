00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:14.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Minutes before
the daily 8:00 A.M. broadcast

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:16.686
at Nuuanu Elementary,
the crew is at ease.

00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:20.596
The kindergarten weatherman
is warming up, and fifth-

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.496
and sixth-graders stand
ready at the controls.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.306
&gt;&gt;Man: Make a jaw.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the next room, their
teacher, who doubles as a magician,

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:34.376
wrestles with The Tasmanian Devil.

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.816
&gt;&gt;If you're doing, let's say,
geometry and then you want

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.456
to show angles, you can
say, "Here's an acute angle.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:43.066
Here's an obtuse angle.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.306
Here's a right angle."

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.986
Things with shapes, you
can make circles, squares.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:54.056
Lots of geometry involved.

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:58.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Suddenly, a
crisis grips the control room.

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.226
&gt;&gt;No, go back, Oh!

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The opening
tape isn't cued properly,

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:07.016
and the anchors are caught
off-guard, but Chun is unconcerned.

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:08.556
&gt;&gt;They're panicking.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.916
Well, let them panic.

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:13.766
&gt;&gt;Chun: Our emphasis
is on problem-solving,

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.036
because that's the real
world, and they have to know,

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:20.616
if something goes wrong,
how to problem-solve.

00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:23.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After a quick
fix, the show rolls on.

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:26.866
&gt;&gt;Get your computers ready to type
in the address for today's question.

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:29.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a daily team
effort that over the course

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.066
of the year involves all of
the school's 400 students.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:37.256
&gt;&gt;Girl: I didn't know there are so
many ways to show respect to others.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:38.186
&gt;&gt;Boy: Me too.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:42.626
&gt;&gt;Chun: We have all different
grade levels participating,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:47.106
from kindergarten, they're doing the
weather reports, first- and second-

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:51.416
and third-graders are doing book
reviews, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-,

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.436
they're doing different
kinds of projects.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.596
So we get everybody involved.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:59.236
&gt;&gt;Boy: Good morning Nuuanu.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:04.476
My name is Matthew and I'm
a kindergartner from B2

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:08.396
and today's weather is windy.

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:11.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While most schools are
reticent to put expensive technology

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.176
in the hands of elementary children,

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:16.266
Chun believes it's all part
of the learning process.

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:18.736
&gt;&gt;Chun: So you can add
narration, your audio, to that.

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:22.696
&gt;&gt;Chun: You need to trust
the kids with the technology.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.576
In the past, they said, "Well,

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.086
just let the good students
play with the computers."

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:29.656
Well, what about the majority
of the students, you know?

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:34.436
If you only let the good students
touch the technology, then the rest,

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:35.776
they won't learn anything.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:40.596
So we have to give every
child from K through 6

00:02:40.686 --> 00:02:44.256
in our school an opportunity
to work with the technology,

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:47.126
to use it as a tool to
support their learning.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:49.126
&gt;&gt;I'm writing a script for broadcast.

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:50.456
&gt;&gt;For tomorrow?

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:57.726
&gt;&gt;Oh, no. In four weeks, but
then I'm getting a head start.

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:01.906
&gt;&gt;Woman: Okay, so, boys and
girls, right now what we're going

00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:04.206
to do is we're going to
log on to the Internet.

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:07.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Introducing students to
technology begins in the first grade.

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:12.216
Erin Okita's class raised money
to adopt an endangered sea turtle

00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:14.366
through a Caribbean
conservation group.

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:16.546
They can track the turtle on the Web.

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:21.416
&gt;&gt;Erin: So, boys and girls,
where is Miss Junie to right now?

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:22.896
&gt;&gt;Costa Rica.

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:23.656
&gt;&gt;Erin: Costa Rica, Good.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.896
&gt;&gt;Erin: A lot of them, they
haven't been on the Internet before,

00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:31.196
and so I thought it was
a great way to introduce

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.556
that kind of technology to them.

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:38.236
What I wanted them to do is actually
start early having experience using

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:40.286
the resources that they
have available to them.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.046
&gt;&gt;Is it the same land area?

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.276
Is it the same shape?

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:45.846
&gt;&gt;Erin: Well, the main concept
of this lesson, I guess,

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:49.706
was to connect themselves
with the rest of the world,

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:53.296
and so I wanted them to feel
that they're a part of something,

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:56.886
you know, other than just
something here in Hawaii.

00:03:57.096 --> 00:03:59.336
&gt;&gt;Where is it that you are
going to place it inside

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:02.266
of your HyperStudio card stack?

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:05.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In a fourth-grade
project, students use technology

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:07.166
to connect with their ancestors.

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.696
&gt;&gt;Okay, and great-great grandma;
who is great-great grandma?

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:11.886
&gt;&gt;Pearl Onaka.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:14.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each student
created a multimedia version

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:18.336
of their family history based on
material gathered from their elders.

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:21.716
&gt;&gt;I was about 35 years
old at this time.

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:23.146
I worked in a hospital.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.566
No, no, pharmacist.

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:27.346
&gt;&gt;Oh, okay, what did you do for fun?

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:31.686
&gt;&gt;Fun, Oh, I played
baseball, played baseball.

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:32.616
&gt;&gt;Oh, okay.

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:36.036
&gt;&gt;Marjorie: Even though,
say, a student might not have

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:40.376
as descriptive a paragraph
on paper, they were able

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:43.986
to express themselves differently
because of the technology.

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:50.046
&gt;&gt;Is mom going to be able to
provide more pictures like this?

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:54.446
&gt;&gt;I have one with their grave.

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:59.066
&gt;&gt;Marjorie: They also have to create
pictures that are representative

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.966
or symbolic of their family.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.886
It's a different way of
expressing themselves.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.106
It gives more of them
a chance to shine.

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:08.666
&gt;&gt;Eleanor: One of the goals that
we've had at Nuuanu School is

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.616
for every child to be
an independent learner.

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.716
The teachers know that learning is
the responsibility of the child,

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:19.206
where they are to be their mentors
or to guide them, but otherwise,

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:21.346
we want them to be the
doers and the learners.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:23.106
&gt;&gt;Child: Oh, wait,
for 2 minutes, yeah?

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:25.176
&gt;&gt;Yeah. Okay, I've got my timer on.

00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:29.686
&gt;&gt;Eleanor: Because we are a small
school and we know all the children,

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:32.536
you are able to identify the
children, you know their needs,

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:35.066
you know their talents, you know
what they're capable of doing,

00:05:35.346 --> 00:05:39.556
you know how to motivate them,
you know their learning styles,

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:42.946
and I think that's what
education is all about.

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:47.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Nuuanu, students
learn by doing hands-on projects

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:50.736
like sampling the water quality of
a stream that runs past their school

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:53.096
and empties into Honolulu Harbor.

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:54.976
&gt;&gt;That means the water
is dirty or clean?

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:59.296
&gt;&gt;Woman: Oh, very clean, it
doesn't have any of that phosphate.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a science project

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:04.656
that also provides a
valuable community service

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.416
to the Hawaii Department of Health.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:11.146
&gt;&gt;Watson: A lot of the data they did
collect on Nuuanu Stream is important

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:13.596
to us because normally
Nuuanu Stream is not one

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.746
of the streams that we study.

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:18.226
&gt;&gt;Child: How many more minutes?

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:18.916
&gt;&gt;40 seconds.

00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:21.276
&gt;&gt;Watson: Once they get into
the field and see us doing this

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:26.256
in a regular work situation,
they have a real feel of knowing

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:28.486
that this is not just
lessons, this is real life.

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:33.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Near the harbor, students
made a temporary specimen pond

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:36.266
and collected seaweed that was
then taken back to the school

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:38.226
and pressed between book pages.

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:43.146
The entire day was documented on
video and later edited and posted

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:45.716
on the school's website
so other students

00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:48.666
and the Nuuanu community could
experience it on the Web.

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:51.526
&gt;&gt;Boy: That is some dirty water.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school site provides
a remarkable record of the learning

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:57.446
that goes on here, and
from the first day of class

00:06:57.446 --> 00:07:00.666
to the culminating May Day
celebration of Hawaiian culture,

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:04.696
it's clear that everyone in the
community, from kindergartners

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.536
to grandparents, gets involved.

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:09.136
&gt;&gt;Eleanor: What works at
Nuuanu School is the fact

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:11.316
that we really think family.

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:13.166
We really support each other.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:18.186
It's phenomenal how much the school
can do with parents supporting you,

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:19.976
and they support us 100 percent.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:23.896
