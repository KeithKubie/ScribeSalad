1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,270
Okay, so we just glimpse
this at the end last time.

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:10,830
This is a crystal structure of a
complicated molecule that was performed by

3
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:15,831
these same Swiss folks that we've talked
about and notice how very precise it

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,470
is.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,470
The bond distances between atoms are
reported to plus or minus 2000th of an

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:26,850
angst from the bonds or are
like one and a half ox drums.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,560
So it's like a part in a thousand is the
precision to which the positions of the

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,140
atoms is known.
Okay.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,150
But that those positions are average
positions because the atoms are constantly

10
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:42,590
in motion vibrating. In fact, the V,

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,540
the typical vibration amplitude,
which depends on,

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,000
I've been a mom and Adam that's
off on the end of something,

13
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,001
is more floppy than one that's held in
by a lot of bonds in various directions

14
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,600
in a cage sort of thing.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,730
But typically they're vibrating
by about 0.05 OnX drums,

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,880
which is 25 times as big as the precision
to which the position to the average

17
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:07,950
is known.
Okay.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,340
So no molecule looks
like that at an instant.

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:15,000
The atoms are all displaced a little
bit. Now, how big is that here?

20
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,260
If you look at that yellow thing, when
it shrinks down, that's how big it is.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,860
And that's how big the vibration is.
It's very small.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,980
But these are very precise
measurements right? Now.

23
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,080
Why did they do so precise measurements?

24
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,710
Did they really care to know
bond distances to that accuracy?

25
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,460
Maybe for some purposes they did,
but that wasn't the main reason.

26
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,140
They did the work very carefully.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,180
They did it carefully in order to get
really precise positions for the average

28
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,900
Adam,

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,550
so they could subtract spherical Adams
and see the difference accurately.

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,721
Okay?

31
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,660
Because if you have the wrong position
for the Adam that you're subtracting,

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,050
you get nonsense.
Okay?

33
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:00,051
And what this is going to reveal is some
pathologies of bonding from the point

34
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:05,100
of view of Louis Concept
of shared electrons. Okay?

35
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,560
So here's a picture of this molecule.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,570
And remember we had the Rubo few,
Sarah in which we looked at last time,

37
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,580
had the great virtue that it was planer,

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,520
so you can cut a slice that
went through all the Adams.

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,830
This molecule's definitely
not playing her.

40
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,220
So you have to cut various
slices to see different things.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,020
So first we'll cut a slice that
goes through those 10 atoms. Okay.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,890
And here is the difference.
Electron density.

43
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,750
What does the difference density show

44
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,770
somebody's? Yeah, Alex.

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,290
It's the total electron
density minus the atoms.

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,940
That is how the electron density shifted
when the molecule was formed from the

47
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,470
atoms.
Okay?

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,620
And here we see just exactly what we
expected to see that the electrons shifted

49
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,260
in between the carbon atoms as the
benzene ring on the other pairs of carbon

50
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,340
atoms as well. It also shows the
ch bonds because in this case,

51
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,560
the hydrogen atoms were subtracted.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,450
We showed one last time where the
hydrogen atoms weren't subtracted. Okay,

53
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,400
so this is,
there's nothing special here.

54
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,670
Everything looks the
way you expect it to be,

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,890
although it's really beautiful as you
would expect for these guys who do such

56
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:21,724
great work.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,400
Now we'll do a different slice. This
is the sort of the plane of the screen,

58
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:31,580
which divides the molecule
symmetrically down the middle,

59
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,000
cuts through some bonds,
cuts through some atoms and so on.

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,850
So here's the difference density
map that appears on that slice.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Now the colored Adams in the right are
the positions of the atoms through which

62
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:50,150
the, the um, the plain slices,

63
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,320
but the atoms or subtract that out. So
what you see is the bonding in that plane.

64
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,610
So you'll see those bonds because both
ends of the bond are in the plains of the

65
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:04,370
bonds are in the plane and you
see just what you expect to see.

66
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:08,570
But there are other things you
see as well. You see the ch bonds,

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,950
although they don't have nearly as much
electron density is the CC bonds did,

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,240
right?
You also see that lump,

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,680
which is the unshared pair on nitrogen,
right?

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,310
But you see these two things,
which are bonds,

71
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,290
but there are cross sections of bonds
because this particular plane cuts through

72
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,720
the middle of those bonds.
Everybody see that?

73
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,870
Okay, so that's again, that's
nothing surprising, but here
is something surprising.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
There's another bond through
which that play and cuts,

75
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:47,700
which is the one on the right through
that, through those three membered rings.

76
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,770
Right? And what do you
notice about that bond?

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,860
Isn't there? There isn't any
electron density for that bond.

78
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,220
So it's a missing bond.
This is what we're,

79
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,840
we'll refer to as pathological bonding,
right?

80
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,240
It's not what Lewis would have expected.

81
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,360
Maybe we don't have Louis to talk to.

82
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:15,270
So we don't know what even thought
about this particular molecule.

83
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,290
So here's a third plane to slice,

84
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:24,270
which goes through those three atoms
and here's the picture of it. And again,

85
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,700
that bond is missing that we saw before.
We're looking at,

86
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,170
previously we looked at
a cross section here,

87
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,970
we're looking at a plane that contains
the bond. And again, there's no there,

88
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,930
there.
Okay.

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,680
But there's something else that's
funny about this slice. You see what?

90
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,253
Yeah.

91
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,500
What's funny about the bonds that you do?
See

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,980
Corey speak up so I can
hear it. They're not,

93
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,620
what do you mean they're collected?
Connected separately.

94
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,710
I somebody say it in different words.
I think you got the idea,

95
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:15,960
but I'm not sure everybody
understood. John, do you have an idea?

96
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,183
Uh,

97
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,970
two, three, four. One, two,
three, four, five. That's true.
It is a little more dense.

98
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,330
That kind of thing could
be experimental error.

99
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,670
Because even though this
was done so precisely,

100
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,720
you're subtracting two
numbers that are very large,

101
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,200
so that any error you make
in the experimental one,

102
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,530
or in position in things for the
theoretical position to the Adams,

103
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,480
any error you make will
really be amplified in a map
like this. But it's true.

104
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,990
You, you noticed. But there's something I
think more interesting about those that,

105
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,411
yeah,

106
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:57,411
John Maybe,

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,930
yeah, they sort of overlap
one another, but of course,

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,100
if they're sort of close to another,
that doesn't surprise you too much. Uh,

109
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,610
because you know, as you go
out and out and out, all the,

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
you'll get rings that do meet
if you go far enough down. Yeah.

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,250
Crisp density on the bonds does it,

112
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,150
the center of density on the bonds
doesn't intersect the lines in it.

113
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,040
In the Adams,

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,390
the bonds are not centered on the
line that connects the nuclei.

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,930
These bonds are bent.

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,580
Okay. So again, pathological bonding,

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,900
and in three weeks you'll understand
this from first principles,

118
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,460
but you gotta be patient.

119
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,090
Yeah.

120
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,391
Okay.

121
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:57,391
So Louis Pairs and octets provide a pretty
good book keeping device for keeping

122
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:58,900
track of valence.

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,000
But they're hopelessly crude when it
comes to describing the actual electron

124
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,640
distribution,
which you can see experimentally here,

125
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,820
there is electron sharing.
There's a distortion of the APP,

126
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,760
of the spheres of,
of electron density that are the atoms,

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,470
but it's only about 5% as big as Lewis
would have predicted had he predicted

128
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:23,680
that two electrons would be right between,
okay.

129
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,490
And there are unshared
pairs as Louis predicted,

130
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,280
and again there are less than,

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,790
but in this case they're even less than
5% of what Lewis would have predicted,

132
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,240
but you can see them.
Now this raises the question,

133
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,510
is there a better bond
theory than Lewis Theory?

134
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,980
Maybe even one that's quantitative that
would give you numbers for these things

135
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:49,180
rather than just say their pairs
here. There. Okay. And the answer,

136
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,620
thank goodness is yes,

137
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,850
there is a great theory for this
and what it is is chemical quantum.

138
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,050
Now you can study quantum
mechanics in this department.

139
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,880
You can study quantum
mechanics and physics.

140
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,950
You could probably study at other places,
right?

141
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,850
And different people use
the same quantum mechanics,

142
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,670
but apply it to different problems,
right?

143
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,440
So what we're going to discuss in this
course is quantum mechanics as applied to

144
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,940
bonding.
Okay.

145
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,430
So it will be somewhat
different in its flavor of fact,

146
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,870
a lot different in its flavor from what
you do in physics or even what you do in

147
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:28,890
physical chemistry because
we're more interested.

148
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,950
We're not so interested in getting
numbers or solving mathematical problems.

149
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,580
We're interested in getting insight to
what's really involved in forming bonds.

150
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,660
We want it to be rigorous,
but we don't need it to be numerical.

151
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,420
Okay. So it'll be much more
pictorial than numerical. Okay.

152
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,940
So it came with the Schrodinger's
wave equation that was,

153
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,310
that was discovered in our invented,

154
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:57,150
perhaps we should say in 90 I dunno
whether it's hard to know whether to say

155
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,980
discovered or invented,

156
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:03,981
I think invented is probably better
in 1926 and here is shredding or the

157
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,290
previous year that sort of 97
pound weakling on the beach. Right?

158
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,460
He's this guy back here
with the glasses on. Okay.

159
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,090
He was actually a well known physicist,

160
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,360
but he hadn't done anything
really earth shaking at all.

161
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,370
He was at the University of Zurich

162
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,920
and Felix Bloch,
who was a student then the previous two,

163
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,930
two years before he had
come as an undergraduate to
the University of Zurich to

164
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:38,130
study engineering. And after a year and
a half, he decided he would do physics,

165
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:43,020
which was completely impractical and not
to the taste of his parents. But anyhow,

166
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,490
as an undergraduate he went to
these Colloquia, the that the, uh,

167
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,370
physics department had and
he wrote 50 years later,

168
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,990
so this was 1976.

169
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,560
So it's the 50th anniversary
of the discovery of,

170
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,450
or invention of quantum mechanics. So he
said at the end of a co of a colloquium,

171
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,080
I heard Dubai, there's a picture
of Dubai. Say something like,

172
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,850
Schrodinger you're not working right
now on very important problems anyway.

173
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,840
Why don't you tell us something
about that thesis of debris oily.

174
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,120
So in one of the next colloque we assured
that your gave a beautifully clear

175
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,510
account of how to Broil.
He associated a wave with a particle.

176
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,350
When he had finished Dubai,

177
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,930
casually remarked that he thought this
way of talking was rather childish.

178
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,120
He had learned that to deal properly with
waves, one had to have a wave equation.

179
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,410
It sounded rather trivial and did
not seem to make a great impression,

180
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:42,411
but Schrodinger evidently thought a bit
more about the idea afterwards and just

181
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,670
a few weeks later he gave
another talk in the colloquium,

182
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,140
which he started by saying,

183
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,700
my colleague Dubai suggested that
one should have a wave equation.

184
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,770
Well, I have found, and we write it now,

185
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,700
each side equals east side. He actually
wrote it in different terms, but,

186
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,040
but that's the Schrodinger equation.

187
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,190
The reason when we ride is
a little different from his
is he included time as a

188
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,510
variable in his,

189
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,740
whereas we're not interested in for
this purpose in changes in time.

190
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,770
We want to see how molecules are
when they're just sitting there.

191
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,110
We'll talk about time later.

192
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,700
So within a what,
seven years,

193
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,200
here's shredding or looking
a good deal sharper. Right.

194
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,670
And where is he standing?
He's standing at the,

195
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,500
at the tram stop in Stockholm where he's
going to pick up his Nobel prize for

196
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:42,910
this. Right. And he's standing
with Dubai with a Dereck,

197
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,970
with whom he shared the Nobel prize and
with Heisenberg who got the Nobel prize

198
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:52,480
the previous year, but hadn't collected
it yet, so he came at the same time.

199
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay, sure. The Schrodinger
equation is HCI equals east side,

200
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,210
H and e you've seen, but side may
be due to you. It's a Greek letter.

201
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,620
We can call it PSI or PSI.
Some people call it c,

202
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,020
right? I'll, I'll probably call it
side. Okay. And it's a wave function.

203
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,590
But what in the world is a wave function?
Okay.

204
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,900
So this,

205
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,520
this is a stumbling block for people that
come into the field and it's not just

206
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,050
a stumbling block for you.

207
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,130
It was a stumbling block for the
greatest minds there were at the time.

208
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,571
So for example,

209
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:39,571
this is five years later in Leipzig
and it's the research group of Verner

210
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,230
Heisenberg. You're sitting there
in the front, the guy that,

211
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,400
this was about the time he was being
nominated or selected for the Nobel Prize,

212
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,330
right?

213
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,330
So He's there with his research group
and right behind him is seated Felix

214
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,773
Bloch,

215
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,670
who himself got the Nobel prize
for discovering Nmr in 1952.

216
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,660
So he's quite a young guy here
and he's with these other, uh,

217
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,860
there's a guy who became famous at Oxford
and another one who became the head of

218
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:09,670
the physics department at
Mit Block was at Stanford.

219
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,600
So these guys know
they're pretty hot stuff.

220
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,790
So they're looking right into the camera,

221
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,320
right to record themselves for posterity
as part of this distinguished group,

222
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,290
except for block.
What's he thinking about?

223
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,940
What in the world is PSI right
now? In fact, in that saved me,

224
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,950
or it was in January that Schrodinger
announced the wave equation and sy and

225
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,710
that summer that these smart guys who,
uh,

226
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,760
who were hanging around Zurich at
that time, theoretical physicists,

227
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,060
the young guys went out on an excursion
on the lake of Zurich and they,

228
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:53,360
uh,

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,650
they made up dog roll rhymes for fun
about different things that were going on.

230
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,780
And the one that, that, uh, was
made up by block, an aerial vehicle

231
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,230
who we'll talk about next semester,
was about sy Garmin,

232
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:14,231
just rational urban Sean met Ziner of
Ellen Fonsi on nor vison Mcmahon Garren

233
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,320
avoid [inaudible] for stones all,

234
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,270
which means Aaron,
with his PSI can do calculations.

235
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,590
Quite a few.

236
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,200
We only wish that we could glean
an inkling of what cy could mean,

237
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,890
right? Yup. You can do
calculations with it,

238
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,520
but what is it was the question.
Okay.

239
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,700
And it wasn't just these
young guys who were confused,

240
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,780
even shrugger was never comfortable
with what side really means.

241
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,760
Now, if we're lucky, this'll play this
time. So this is a lecture by Schrodinger.

242
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,000
What is matter from 1952

243
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,070
I am on

244
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,290
[inaudible] [inaudible]

245
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,450
[inaudible] [inaudible]

246
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,150
[inaudible] [inaudible]

247
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,380
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible],

248
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,690
right?
So what is six years later?

249
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,900
Schrodinger still didn't
really know what PSI was. Okay.

250
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,240
So don't be depressed when it seems
a little curious what cy might be,

251
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,410
right? First we'll like shredding
or unlike these other guys.

252
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,860
First we'll learn how
to find sy and use it,

253
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,100
and then later we'll learn what it means.

254
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,680
So Cy is a function, a wave
function. What do you want to know

255
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,180
from what I've shown here?
What is a function?

256
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,663
Relationship

257
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,020
like sign as a function.
What does that mean?

258
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,580
Yeah. Yeah. I can't hear very well.

259
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,700
[inaudible]

260
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,890
yeah, it's, it's like a little machine.

261
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,720
You put a number in or maybe several
numbers and the number comes out,

262
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,210
right? That's what the function does
that you put in 90 degrees in size.

263
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,960
So sign says one.
Okay.

264
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,200
So what do you want to
know about the PSI first?

265
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,503
Yes.

266
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,110
What's the function of what?

267
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,700
What are the things you have to put
in in order to get a number out?

268
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,390
Okay, so it's different
from the name the, this,

269
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,280
the way functions have names,
that's not what they're a function of,

270
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,170
right? You can have sign
sine squared, coast side,

271
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,950
those are different functions, but they
can be functions of the same thing.

272
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:21,020
An angle, right? So we're
interested in what's that?

273
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,800
A function of not what the function is,
but what's that a function of.

274
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320
So you can have different size,

275
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,380
they have names for and quantum
numbers give them their names.

276
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:37,140
For example,
you can have an l and M,

277
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:40,620
you've seen those before and
LM to name wave functions.

278
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,500
Those are just their names.
That's not what they're a function of.

279
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,690
Or you can have one s or three d,
x, y or sigma or Pi or Pi Star.

280
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,830
Those are all names of functions,
right? But they're not what?

281
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,970
It's a function of

282
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,800
what is a function of is the position
of a particle or a set of particles.

283
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,520
It's a function of position and
it's also a function of time.

284
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,950
And sometimes have spin part at some
particles have spin and it could be a

285
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:14,970
function of that too.

286
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,060
But you'll be happy to know that
for purposes of this course,

287
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,170
we're not so interested in time and spin.
So for our purposes,

288
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,180
it's just a function of position.

289
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,710
So if you have in particles,

290
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,280
how many positions do you have to
specify to know where they all are?

291
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,990
How many numbers do you need? You
need x, Y, Z for every particle,

292
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,640
right?
So you need three in arguments for Sai.

293
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,540
So Sai is a function that when you
tell it where all these positions are,

294
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,900
it gives you a number.
Now, curiously enough,

295
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,740
the number can be positive. It
can be zero, it could be negative,

296
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,980
it can even be complex,
right?

297
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,130
Although we won't talk about
cases where it's complex.

298
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,030
The physicist will tell you
about those or physical chemists.

299
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,610
Okay. And sometimes it can be as
many as four n plus one arguments.

300
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,350
How could it be for n plus one?

301
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,290
Cause if each particle also had
a spin than it would be x, Y,

302
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,120
Z and spin that it'd be four. And if
time is also included, it's plus one.

303
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,580
Okay. So how are we going to go
through this first? We'll try.

304
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:34,230
This is unfamiliar territory, I
bet to every one of you. Okay.

305
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,090
So first we're going to talk about
just one part nickel and one dimension.

306
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,210
So the function is fairly simple,
okay?

307
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,920
And then we'll go on to three dimensions,
but still one particle,

308
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:51,900
the in an atom. So a one electron
atom, but now three dimensions.

309
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,110
So it's more complicated.

310
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,000
Then we'll go on to atoms
that have several electrons.

311
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,290
So you have now more than three
variables because you have at least two

312
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:02,951
electrons.

313
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:06,400
That would be six variables that you
have to put into the function to get a

314
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,234
number out.

315
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,850
Then we'll go into molecules that is
more than one atom and what bonding is.

316
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,530
And then finally we get to the
payoff for organic chemistry,

317
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,430
which is talking about what makes a group
of functional group and what does it

318
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:25,270
mean to be functional, what makes it
reactive? That's where we're heading.

319
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,720
But first we have to understand
what quantum mechanics is.

320
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,600
So here's the Schrodinger equation,
h cycles east side,

321
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,490
and we're talking about the time
independent Schrodinger equation.

322
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:40,600
So time is not a variable.
Uh,

323
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,440
and that means it's what we're
talking about is stationary states.

324
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,320
It's that we don't mean that
the atoms aren't moving,

325
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,870
but just that they're in a cloud.

326
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:53,110
And we were going to find that
how has the cloud distributed?

327
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,220
If a molecule reacts, the electrons
shift to their clouds and so on.

328
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:01,300
The it changes.
We're not interested in reaction.

329
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:05,200
Now we're just interested in
understanding the cloud at sitting there,

330
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,070
not changing in time. Okay. Now,

331
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,510
the right part of the equation
is e times PSI, right?

332
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,570
And he will turn out to be
the energy of the system.

333
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,580
Maybe you won't be surprised that that,
so that's quite simple. What's the left?

334
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,170
It looks like h times psi.
If that were true,

335
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:30,610
what could you do to simplify things?
Knock outside.

336
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,730
But h time HCI is not h times Psi h is
sort of a recipe for doing something with

337
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:44,110
Sy. We'll see that right away. So
you can't just cancel out the PSI,

338
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,050
unfortunately. Okay, so
HCI equals Esi. Oops,

339
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,370
sorry. What did I do? There
we go. Now we can divide.

340
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,450
You can divide the right by cy.
And since it was eat time side,

341
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,720
the side goes away.
But what you divide on the left,

342
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:05,530
you don't cancel the size because
the top doesn't mean multiplication.

343
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,520
No, I already told you the right side
of this equation is the total energy.

344
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,020
So when you see a sister,
what does the total energy consist of?

345
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,340
Potential energy and kinetic energy.

346
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,150
So somehow this part on the left h over
sy must be kinetic energy plus potential

347
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:31,960
energy.

348
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,960
That recipe h must somehow tell you
how to work with PSI in order to get

349
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,670
something which divided by sy Gibbs,

350
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,740
kinetic energy plus potential energy.
So there are two parts of it.

351
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,970
There's the part that's potential energy
of the recipe and there's part that's

352
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,730
kinetic energy.
Now

353
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,620
the potential energy part is in
fact easy because it's given to you,

354
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,230
right? What's, what's the,
what's Sigh? A function of

355
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,320
position of the particles.

356
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,790
Now if you know of the charges of the
particles and their positions and no cool

357
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:15,530
ohms law, then you know the potential
energy if cool ohms law is right.

358
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,450
Is everybody with me on that? If you
know there's a unit positive charge here,

359
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:22,730
a unit negative charge here,
another unit, positive charge here,

360
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:25,220
and a unit negative charge here,
something like that you,

361
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,870
it's might be complicated,

362
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,140
you might have to write an excel
program or something to do it,

363
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:34,880
but you could calculate the distances
and the charges and so on and what the

364
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,080
energy is due to that.

365
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,400
So that part is really given to you
once you know what system you're dealing

366
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,240
with, the recipe for finding,
finding the potential energy.

367
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,690
So that part of HCI oversight
is no problem at all.

368
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,640
But hold your breath on kinetic energy.
Sam,

369
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,790
let me just throw a face.
There was like an adjusted,

370
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,920
yeah, that was wrong. That
was three years earlier.

371
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:07,480
Remember 1923 Thompson proposed that,
but it was,

372
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,430
it was wrong.
This is what was right.

373
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,470
How did what just,

374
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,890
yeah, they, they prove this right.

375
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,570
And the cool ohms law held because it
agreed with a whole lot of spectroscopic

376
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:24,570
evidence that had been
collected about atomic spectrum.

377
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,920
And then everything else has tried with
it works too. So we believe it now.

378
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,660
So how do you handle kinetic
energy? Well, that's an old one.

379
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:37,200
You did that already in high school,
right? Forget kinetic energy. Here it is.

380
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,760
It's some constant which will
get you the units, right?

381
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:46,761
Depending on what energy units you want
times the sum over all the particles of

382
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,970
the kinetic energy of each particle.
So you know,

383
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,340
if you know the kinetic energy
of this particle, Kinetic Energy,

384
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,360
this particle is part of this particle.
You add them all up,

385
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,110
you get the total kinetic energy,
no problem there right now.

386
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:01,380
What is the kinetic energy that
you're summing up over each particle?

387
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,220
It's one half MV squared, if any.
Has everybody seen that before?

388
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,000
Okay?
Okay,

389
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:13,650
so that's the sum of classical kinetic
energy over all the particles of interest

390
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:18,210
in the problem and the constant is just
some number you put in to get the right

391
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:23,211
units for your energy depending on whether
you use feet per second or meters per

392
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,400
year or whatever for the velocity.
Okay?

393
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,160
But it turned out that all of this,

394
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,330
although this was fine for
our great grandparents,

395
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,740
it's not right when you start
dealing with tiny things. All right,

396
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,310
here's what kinetic energy really is.

397
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,560
It's a constant, this is the thing
that gets it in the right units.

398
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,160
H squared over eight Pi squared
times a sum over all the particles.

399
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,780
It's looking promising right

400
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,240
of one over the mass,
not the mass MV squared,

401
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,490
but one over the mass of each particle.

402
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,700
And here's where we get it.

403
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,930
Times second derivatives
of a wave function.

404
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,703
That's weird.

405
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,380
I mean at least it has tools
in it like v squared, right?

406
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,520
That's something. And in fact it's not
completely coincidental that it has to,

407
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:33,951
is in it.

408
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:38,840
There was an analogy that
was being followed that
allowed them to formulate this

409
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,780
and you divide it by the numbers Psi.

410
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,550
So that's a pretty complicated thing.

411
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,220
So if we want to get our heads around
it, we better simplify it. And Oh,

412
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:53,690
also there's a minus sign.

413
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,810
It's minus the constant is
negative that you use. Okay?

414
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,930
Now let's simplify it by
using just one particle.

415
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,710
So we don't have to some over a bunch
of particles and we'll use just one

416
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:11,030
dimension x, forget y and Z. Okay,

417
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,970
so now we see something
similar set simpler.

418
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,390
So it's a negative constant times one
over the mass of the particle times the

419
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,620
second derivative of the function,

420
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,950
the wave function divided by sy.

421
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,270
That's kinetic energy. Really
not what happened. V squared.

422
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,520
Okay. Or here it is written
just a little differently.

423
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:37,700
So there's a constant seat over the mass,
right?

424
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,690
And then we have the important
part is the second derivative.

425
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,350
Does everybody know that the second
derivative is a curvature of a function,

426
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,860
right?

427
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,450
What's the first derivative slope and the
second derivative is how curved it is.

428
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,070
It could be curving down.
That's negative curvature or curving up.

429
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,770
That's positive curvature,
so it can be positive.

430
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,430
It can be zero if the line is straight.
Okay,

431
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,540
so note that the kinetic energy
involves the Sheaf of sy,

432
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,250
how curved it is,
not just what the value of cy is,

433
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,750
although it involves that too.

434
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,290
Yeah,

435
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,470
maybe it's not too early to point
out something interesting about this.

436
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,910
That's so I suppose that's
the kinetic energy, right?

437
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,560
What would happen if you
multiplied sy by two?

438
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,780
Obviously you'd denominator,
we get twice as large.

439
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,030
If you made side twice as large,

440
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,970
what would happen to the
curvature if what happens to the,

441
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,490
suppose you have a function and you make
it twice as big and look at the slope

442
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:48,250
at a particular point.
How does a slope change?

443
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,520
If you've stretched the paper on which
you drew it it the slope will double,

444
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,310
right? If you double the
scale, how about the curvature?

445
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,770
The second derivative
is to go up by four times.

446
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,450
No, it doesn't go up by four
times. It goes up by twice.

447
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,260
So what happened? Well, what would
happen to the kinetic energy there?

448
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,090
If we doubled the size of sy every place,

449
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,270
it would stay the same. The kinetic energy
doesn't depend on how you scale PSI.

450
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,890
It only depends on its shape,
how curved it is.

451
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,120
Everybody see the idea
curvature divided by the value.

452
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,070
Okay?
Now solving a quantum problem.

453
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,130
So if you're in a course you have and
you're studying quantum mechanics,

454
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,430
you've got problems to solve
now.

455
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,140
So you're, what are you, you a
problem means you're given something.

456
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:54,730
You have to find something. You're
given a set of particles, right?

457
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:55,930
Like a certain nuclei,

458
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,880
nuclei have given mass and charge and
elect a certain number of electrons.

459
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,010
That's what you're given.
Okay?

460
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,330
The masses of the particles
and the potential law.

461
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,200
When you're given the charge
and you know cool ohms law,

462
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,070
then you know how to calculate
the potential energy.
Remember, that's part of it.

463
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,120
Okay? But that part, so
that part's easy. Okay.

464
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,480
Now what do you need to find if
you have a problem to solve? Oh,

465
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,650
for example, you can have one
particle in one dimension,

466
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,360
so it could be one atomic mass unit is
the way that the particle and Hooke's law

467
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:35,290
could be the potential, right?
It doesn't have to be realistic.

468
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,000
Could be Hooke's law could be a
particle held by a spring, right?

469
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,520
To find his cy.

470
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,880
You want to find the
shape of this function,

471
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,940
which is a function of what
positions of the particles,

472
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,470
and if you're higher the further
on than we are time as well.

473
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,910
Maybe spin even,

474
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,510
but that function has to be such that
HCI oversight is the total energy and the

475
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:10,270
total energy is the same no
matter where the particle is,

476
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,830
right? Because the potential energy
in the kinetic energy cancel out.

477
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:18,370
It's like a ball rolling back and forth.
The total energy is constant,

478
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,910
but it goes back and forth between
potential and kinetic energy, right?

479
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,150
Same thing here.
No matter where the particles are,

480
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,620
you have to get the same energy.

481
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,800
So Cy has to be such that
when you calculate the
kinetic energy for it changes

482
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:36,550
in that kinetic energy in
different positions. Exactly.

483
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:40,340
Compensate for the changes
in potential energy.

484
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,730
When you've got that,
then you've got a correct side.

485
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,393
Maybe

486
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,400
it's also important that cy,
Romaine finite,

487
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,780
that it not go to infinity,
and if you're a real mathematician,

488
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:59,590
it has to be single valued. You can't
have two values for the same positions.

489
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,240
It has to be continuous.

490
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:05,500
You can't get a sudden break
inside and size square.

491
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:09,310
It has to be integratable,
right? You have to find out how.

492
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,990
You have to be able to tell how much
area is undersized squared and you'll see

493
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,920
why shortly.

494
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,020
But basically what you need is to find
a size such that the changes in kinetic

495
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:22,990
energy compensate changes
in potential energy.

496
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,960
Now, what's coming, this
is rehearsal we did before.

497
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,750
So first there'll be one
particle in one dimension,

498
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,270
then it'll be one electron atoms.
So one particle in three dimensions.

499
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,830
Then it will be many electrons
and the idea of what orbitals are,

500
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,840
and then there'll be molecules of
bonds and finally functional groups and

501
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:49,270
reactivity.
Okay.

502
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,590
But you will be happy to hear
that by a week from Friday.

503
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:56,120
We'll only get through one electron atoms.

504
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,090
So don't worry about the
rest of the stuff now,

505
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,660
but do read the parts on the webpage that
have to do with what's going to be on

506
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:08,860
the exam. Okay? So normally
you're given a problem,

507
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:13,420
the mass and the charges.
That is the potential energy
as a function of position.

508
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,300
And you need to find sigh.

509
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,500
But at first we're going
to try it a different way.

510
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,950
We're going to play jeopardy and we're
gonna start with the answer and find out

511
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,310
what the question was.
Okay?

512
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,590
So suppose that sy is the sine of x.

513
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,870
This is one particle in one dimension.

514
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:42,370
The position of the particle and
the function is of Cy is sign.

515
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,850
If you know cy, what can you figure
out? We'd just been talking about it.

516
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,890
What can you use AI to find
kinetic energy? How do you find it?

517
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,830
So we can get the kinetic energy,

518
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:04,130
which is minus a constant over the
mass times the curvature aside to valid

519
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,750
divided by cy at any given position.
Right?

520
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,980
And once we know how the kinetic
energy varies with position,

521
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,810
then we know how the potential energy
varies with position because it's just the

522
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:20,380
opposite in order that the
sum be constant, right?

523
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,160
So once we know the kinetic energy, then
we know what the potential energy was,

524
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:28,210
which was what the problem
was at the beginning. Okay,

525
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,160
so suppose our answer is sine of x.
Uh,

526
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,210
what is the curvature of sine of x?
The second derivative?

527
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,300
It's minus the sine of X.
Okay.

528
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,100
So what is the Connecticut or g

529
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,880
c over m? Does it depend on
where you are on the value of x?

530
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,070
No, it's always see over him. So
what was the potential energy?

531
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,100
How did the potential
energy very with position,

532
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,150
the potential energy
doesn't vary with position.

533
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,290
So sine of x is a solution for what?

534
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,110
A particle,

535
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,930
it's not being influenced by anything
else. So it's energy, it's potential.

536
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:20,020
Energy doesn't change with a position.
It's a particle and free space.

537
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,373
Okay,

538
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,190
so it's independent that
potential energy independent of x,

539
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,900
constant potential energy.
It's a particle and free space.

540
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,030
Now suppose we take a
different one sign of aix.

541
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,690
How does sign of aix look
different from sine of x?

542
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,270
Suppose it sine of two x Zillow here,
here's sine of x.

543
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,750
How does sine of two x look

544
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,263
great,

545
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,940
right?
It's a shorter wavelength.

546
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,690
Okay. Now, uh,

547
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,370
so we need to figure out, so it's a
shortened way of if a is greater than one.

548
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,920
Okay. Now, what's the curvature,

549
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,093
Russell?

550
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,140
It's a squared times sine of x of Aix,
right?

551
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,100
The a comes out that constant
each time you take a derivative.

552
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,700
So now what does the potential,
the kinetic energy look like?

553
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,070
It's a squared times the same thing.
Okay?

554
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,410
So again, it's a, the potential
energy is constant, right?

555
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,520
Does it change with position?
But what is different?

556
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,270
It has higher kinetic energy
if it's a shorter wavelength.

557
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,990
And notice that the kinetic energy is
proportional to one over the wavelength

558
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:58,990
squared, right? A squared,

559
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,020
a shortens the wave,
right?

560
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:06,670
It's proportional days square one
over the wavelength squared. Okay?

561
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,980
Now let's take another function
exponential. So e to the x,

562
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:14,680
okay,

563
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,300
what's the second derivative
of e to the x? Arden?

564
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,830
Me either the x,
what's the 18th derivative of e to the x?

565
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,210
Okay, good. So it's either the
x. So what's this situation?

566
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,850
What's the kinetic energy
minus c over em?

567
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,070
Negative kinetic energy.
Your great grandparents didn't get that.

568
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,430
You can have kinetic energy
that's less than zero.

569
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,470
What does that mean?

570
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,920
It means the total energy is
lower than the potential energy.

571
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,530
Pause a minute just to let that sink in.

572
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,310
The total energy is lower

573
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,010
than the potential energy.
The differences. Negative.

574
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,730
Okay,
so the kinetic energy,

575
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:19,720
if that's the difference between
potential and total is negative.

576
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,050
You never get that for
one half MV squared. Yes,

577
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,660
violate what

578
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,100
you'll see in a second. Okay, so anyhow,

579
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,930
the constant potential energy is greater
than the total energy for that. Now,

580
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,990
how about if it were minus exponential
e to the minus x now what would that be?

581
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,000
It would be the same deal. Again, it
would still be minus c over m and again,

582
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:55,990
it would be a constant potential
energy greater than the total energy.

583
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,900
This is not just a mathematical curiosity.

584
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,200
It actually happens for
every atom in you or in me.

585
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:14,130
Every atom has the electrons spend some
of their time in regions where they have

586
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:16,540
negative kinetic energy.

587
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,610
It's not just something weird
that would never happens.

588
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,000
And it happens at large distance
from the Nuclei where one over R,

589
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,100
that's the cool ohms law where
it stops changing very much,

590
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,960
right?
When you get far enough,

591
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:38,940
one over r gets really tiny
and it's essentially zero.

592
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:41,170
It doesn't change anymore,
right?

593
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,530
Then you have the
situation in any real Adam.

594
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,130
So, uh, let's look at, uh,

595
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:57,330
getting the potential energy from the
shape of sy via the kinetic energy.

596
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,950
Okay? So here's a map of PSI or a plot
of cy could be positive, negative,

597
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:07,870
zero as a function of the one dimension
x, wherever the particle is, okay?

598
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,730
Now let's suppose that
that is our wave function.

599
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,380
Sometimes positive, sometimes
zero, sometimes negative, okay?

600
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,620
And let's look at different positions
and see what the kinetic energy is and

601
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:27,610
then we'll be able to figure out,
since the total will be constant,

602
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,300
what the potential energy is.
Okay?

603
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,960
So we'll try to find out
what was potential energy
that gave this as a solution.

604
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,270
This is again, the
jeopardy approach. Okay,

605
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,040
so the curvature of minus,

606
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,610
remember it's a negative constant minus
the curvature over the amplitude could

607
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:50,090
be positive. That's going to be the
kinetic energy. Could be positive,

608
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,500
could be zero,
could be negative,

609
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,920
or it could be that we can't
tell by looking at the graph.

610
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,750
So let's look at different positions on
the graph and see what it says first.

611
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,130
Look at that position. What is the
kinetic energy there? Positive,

612
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,180
negative zero.

613
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,490
Ryan, why don't you help me out?
Well, no, you can help me out. Look,

614
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,090
so what do you need to know?
You need to know. You need,

615
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,780
here's the complicated thing. You
have to figure out. What is the,

616
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:32,610
is is minus the curvature divided
by the amplitude at this point?

617
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,430
Is it positive, negative, or zero? So
what's the curvature at that point?

618
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,700
Is it curving up or down at that point?

619
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:52,330
No idea. Anybody got an idea, Kevin?

620
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,760
It's not a settled point.
What do you call it?

621
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,980
Sample points three for three
dimensions in. In this. It's what?

622
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,970
Inflection point. It's flat there.
It's curving one way on one side,

623
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:11,610
the other way on the other side. So it's
got zero curvature there. Zero curvature.

624
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,110
Now Ryan, can you tell me anything about
that? Cause the curvature. Zero. Zero,

625
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,440
[inaudible]
not bad.

626
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,870
So that one will color gray for zero.

627
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,650
The kinetic energy at that point is zero.
If that's the way function.

628
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,620
Now let's take another point.
Who's going to help me with this one?

629
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,160
How about the curvature
at this point right here?

630
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,100
It's actually I chose a
point that's not curved.

631
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,600
It straight right there.
I assure you. That's true.

632
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,130
So I've met Ryan can help me
again on that one. How about it?

633
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,940
So we'll make that one gray too. Now
I'll go to someone else. How about there?

634
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,360
What's the curvature at that point?
Do you think Shai,

635
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,230
it looks straight. Zero curvature. So
does that mean the trust value is zero?

636
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,460
Ah,
the amplitude is zero there too.

637
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,690
So really you can't be sure,
right?

638
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,220
So that when we're going to have to leave
questionable. That's a question mark.

639
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,700
How about out here?
Not Curved.

640
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,430
So what's the kinetic energy,
Josh?

641
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,930
Questionable. Right? Because
amplitude is zero. Again, your device,

642
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,750
the zero in the numerator, also zero in
the denominator. We really don't know.

643
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,060
Okay.
How about here,

644
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,360
Tyler? What do you say? Is it curved?

645
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,370
They're curving up or
down? Yeah. So negative.

646
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,840
The curvatures negative.
The value of sy. Positive.

647
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,290
The energy. Kinetic
energy. Positive. Okay,

648
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:03,340
so we can make that when green.
Okay. Here's another one.

649
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,890
Who's going to help me here.

650
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,213
Okay.

651
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,860
Okay. So how about the curvature?
Curving up. Curving down?

652
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,100
Yeah. Amplitude. Ah, green again.

653
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,210
Okay. Uh, how about here? Ah, no.

654
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,340
Now about the curvature.

655
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,963
Seth,

656
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,100
which way is it curbing at
this point here? Curving up.

657
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,310
So the curvature is positive.

658
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,913
Yeah.

659
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,730
So what color we make it green again.
Okay.

660
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,790
So if you're,

661
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,040
you could have be curving down or curving
up and still be positive curving down.

662
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:00,730
If you're above the baseline, curving
up. If you're below the baseline. Right?

663
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:05,650
So as long as you're curving toward
the baseline towards cycle equal zero,

664
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,420
the energy is pop. Kinetic energy
is positive. How about here,

665
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,923
Zach?

666
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,710
Which way is it? Curving,
curving up or curving down?

667
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:24,120
It should be curving out. Serving
up curvature is positive. The value,

668
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,830
positive, positive, I guess
will be negative. So negative,
kinetic energy there.

669
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,720
Make that one whenever that
pinkish color is. Okay,

670
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,940
here's another one.
How about there

671
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:39,723
Alex?

672
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,650
Which way is it curving
at the new place here,

673
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,820
curving down negative curvature.
Negative amplitude,

674
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,010
negative, negative. Kinetic energy.
Pink. Again, is that enough?

675
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,840
Hope.
There's one more here.

676
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,013
The one right here.

677
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,423
Okay.

678
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,220
Pardon? Negative cause. It's how
can you, how did you do it so quick?

679
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:17,930
We didn't have to go through curvature
cause it's curving away from the baseline.

680
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,280
Negative. Okay. Uh, paint. Okay.

681
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,240
Curving away from cy equals zero means
that the kinetic energy is negative.

682
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,730
So now we know what all these positions,
whether the kinetic energy is positive,

683
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:35,050
negative or zero, although are a few that
we don't aren't certain about, right?

684
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,990
So here's the potential
energy that will do that.

685
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,710
If you have this line for
the total energy, right?

686
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,310
Then here and here you have zero,

687
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,950
right? Also, incidentally,

688
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,951
here and here you have zero
kinetic energy with me,

689
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,030
okay? So No curvature, right?

690
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,430
At these green places,

691
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,170
the total energy is higher
than the potential energy.

692
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,080
So the kinetic energy is positive,
okay?

693
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:20,290
At these places, the potential energy
is higher than the total energy.

694
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,520
So the kinetic energy is negative and
the thing is curving away from the

695
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,250
baseline.
All right?

696
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,600
And now we know something
about this point. If the,

697
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,420
if the potential energy is
continuous kind of thing,

698
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,230
then although we couldn't tell
by looking at the wave function,

699
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,300
it's curving away from the
baseline, but very slightly, right?

700
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,160
It's negative, kinetic
energy there. And also, uh,

701
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,600
on the right here is
negative kinetic energy.

702
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,170
And here we know that just by continuity,

703
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,990
that at this point it must have
been positive kinetic energy,

704
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:01,090
even though we couldn't tell
it by looking at the curve,

705
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,930
there must be an inflection
point when you go through zero,

706
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,050
otherwise you get a discontinuity in
the, in the, uh, potential energy.

707
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,620
Okay? So that one was green. Okay,

708
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,900
now I have to stop.
