00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.050
So, you think you know a lot about movies?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.150
You can recite every line from Jaws, you know
who composed the music for the Matrix Trilogy

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.070
and you know which year every Back to the
Future movie was released?That's impressive,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.860
but what about those lesser known facts from
behind the scenes?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.360
Some facts about movies that you might not
know will undoubtedly take you by surprise

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.250
- and that's what this video is all about.Here
are twenty shocking movies facts that you

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.619
won't believe are true...

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.230
Captain America: Civil War
One day prior to filming a fight scene with

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.930
Robert Downey, Jr. in Captain America: Civil
War, Sebastian Stan sent the Iron Man star

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.190
a text message saying"Looking forward to our
scene tomorrow Robert!"

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.339
Attached to the message was a video of Stan
doing intense bicep curls in front of the

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.010
decapitated head of an Iron Man suit.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.670
The Wizard of Oz
One of the stars of the classic movie The

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.720
Wizard of Oz was undoubtedly the little dog,
Toto.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.729
However, it's still pretty shocking that Terry
- the female Cairn Terrier who played Toto

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.610
- was paid more per week than the midget actors
who played the Munchkins.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.940
Terry received $125 per week, the Munchkin
actors received a mere $50.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.930
Sleeping Beauty
Although Sleeping Beauty - also known as Princess

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.050
Aurora - is the titular character in this
classic Disney movie, she actually only has

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.470
eighteen minutes of screen time and eighteen
lines of dialogue.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.690
That's the shortest amount of screen time
for any titular Disney character, and the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.910
second quietest of any apart from Dumbo.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.610
Psycho
Alfred Hitchcock's classic psychological horror

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.150
Psycho was the first movie to show a flushing
toilet on film.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.100
The flushing of a toilet had previously been
seen as taboo and was almost as shocking for

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.190
audiences to see as the infamous shower scene.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
Night of the Living Dead
George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.470
is a classic cult horror movie that truly
started the zombie genre way back in 1968.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.050
You may find it hard to believe, therefore,
that the word "zombie" isn't actually used

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.570
in the movie at any point.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.030
Star Wars
Star Wars is one of the most iconic movies

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.920
in cinema history - and it gave the world
one of the most iconic villains in movie history

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
in Darth Vader.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.979
But would you believe that he only had twelve
minutes of screen time in the original movie?

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.210
That really is testament to the impact he
had.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.160
Monty Python and the Holy Grail
Monty Python and the Holy Grail is undeniably

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.800
one of the greatest comedy movies of all time,
and one of its most memorable scenes involved

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700
using coconuts to mimick the sound of horses
trotting.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.359
This scene was actually filmed out of necessity,
because the movie's production team couldn't

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.500
afford to use real horses!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.719
Halloween
The terrifying mask worn by Michael Myers

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.150
in John Carpenter's Halloween has become one
of the most iconic props in horror movie history.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.329
Therefore, its origins may surprise you.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.019
It's actually a Captain Kirk mask, modelled
on William Shatner himself, painted white.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.549
Not so scary now, huh?

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.019
The Terminator
Although the Terminator character is now synonymous

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.540
with Arnold Schwarzenegger, studio executives
originally wanted retired footballer O.J.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.459
Simpson to take on the role as the titular
cyborg.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.830
However, director James Cameron intervened
because he thought Simpson was "too nice"

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.930
to be taken seriously as the character.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.450
If only he knew...

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.389
A Nightmare on Elm Street
The terrifying A Nightmare on Elm Street may

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.510
seem like it couldn't possibly be based on
a true story, but it actually was.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.450
Wes Craven based the movie on a real life
story about a traumatised young boy who had

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.510
survived the Killing Fields in Cambodia.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
The boy refused to sleep and, when he finally
nodded off, he died screaming in the middle

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.969
of a nightmare.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.920
Die Hard
Bruce Willis has famously made John McClane

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.099
one of the most iconic action heroes of all
time - but the leading man of Die Hard could

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.109
have been played by a very different actor.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.629
Due to complicated contractual obligations,
the part had to be offered to Frank Sinatra

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.629
first.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.109
Given that the crooner was 73 at the time,
it was definitely a relief that he turned

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.310
the role down.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.529
Jurassic Park
The special effects in Steven Spielberg's

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.569
brilliant Jurassic Park were revolutionary,
but one of the iconic sounds in the movie

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.629
was generated in a very simple manner.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.029
The T-Rex's monstrous roar was a combination
of a baby elephant’s squeal, an alligator’s

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.799
gurgling, and a tiger’s snarl, while its
breath was the sound of air escaping a whale’s

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.799
blowhole.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.569
The Lion King
The Lion King is an iconic Disney movie that

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.459
was undoubtedly made even better by the brilliant
music of Sir Elton John.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.309
However, the British superstar wasn't even
the first choice to write and perform the

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.309
soundtrack.

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.640
Swedish pop group ABBA were actually asked
first, but one of their members - Benny Andersson

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.620
- was unavailable at the time.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.489
Toy Story
Toy Story is arguably the greatest animated

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.470
movie of all time - and it forms part of what
is arguably the greatest movie trilogy of

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.460
all time - but it almost didn't exist in the
form that we know it.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.759
It was originally conceived as a half-hour
Christmas special.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.400
Thank goodness Disney ultimately decided to
make it a full movie!

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.720
The Machinist
When it comes to dedication to a role, very

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.520
few actors can match Christian Bale - and
this was never more evident than in The Machinist.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.550
In order to portray an emaciated insomniac,
Bale lost an astonishing 63 pounds.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.699
To do this, his diet consisted of nothing
more than one apple and a single can of tuna

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.780
fish every day.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.600
The Dark Knight
In The Dark Knight, Michael Caine was supposed

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.289
to have lines in the scene where the Joker
crashes Bruce Wayne's fundraising party for

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.300
Harvey Dent.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.410
But Caine was so shocked at seeing Heath Ledger
in character for the first time that he forgot

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.610
to speak.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.270
Frozen
When you consider how prominent female characters

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.840
are in Disney movies, it may come as something
of a surprise to learn that 2013's Frozen

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.540
was the first animated Disney production to
feature a female director.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.199
Jennifer Lee holds the honour of being the
first woman to helm such a movie - and even

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.970
she did it in a joint effort with the very
male Chris Buck.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.250
Zootopia
In Disney's hugely successful animated offering

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.909
Zootopia, pop star Shakira was one of many
huge stars to voice a character - in her case,

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.550
a pop star named Gazelle.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.610
When Shakira saw early designs of the character,
she thought it was too skinny and personally

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.830
requested that it was "meatier" with bigger
hips!

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.810
How very refreshing!

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.550
Independence Day: Resurgence
The sequel to 1996's Independence Day will

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.370
be released this summer and it will go ahead
without the previous movie's leading man,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.289
Will Smith.

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.310
However, the original plan was for Smith to
reprise his role as Captain Steven Hiller.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.159
Unfortunately, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
star demanded a staggering $50 million to

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.320
return, resulting in his character being killed
off instead.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.210
Suicide Squad
Due to the dark and tormenting nature of the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.180
upcoming Suicide Squad movie - and, in particular,
thanks to the disturbing behaviour of Jared

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.789
Leto as The Joker on the movie's set - an
on-set therapist was hired in order to keep

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.330
the all-star cast grounded and sane.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.949
