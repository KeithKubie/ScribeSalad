you know most of it is when I want to do

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750
you know most of it is when I want to do
 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.040
you know most of it is when I want to do
something on a computer and there's not

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050
something on a computer and there's not
 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.299
something on a computer and there's not
either there's not a way or there's not

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309
either there's not a way or there's not
 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.020
either there's not a way or there's not
a good way or there's not a free way to

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030
a good way or there's not a free way to
 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.890
a good way or there's not a free way to
do it so it comes out of wanting to use

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900
do it so it comes out of wanting to use
 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.920
do it so it comes out of wanting to use
the thing that I'm making ultimately and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
the thing that I'm making ultimately and
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.430
the thing that I'm making ultimately and
then once once it becomes a something of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440
then once once it becomes a something of
 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.030
then once once it becomes a something of
its of its own I think having other

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040
its of its own I think having other
 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120
its of its own I think having other
people use it is actually very rewarding

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
people use it is actually very rewarding
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.119
people use it is actually very rewarding
in that you get satisfaction from other

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129
in that you get satisfaction from other
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.459
in that you get satisfaction from other
people getting the same benefits that

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469
people getting the same benefits that
 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.140
people getting the same benefits that
you are from the software that you may

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150
 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.600
there are 13 people where I've looked at

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
there are 13 people where I've looked at
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.010
there are 13 people where I've looked at
the work they've done and had a lot of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
the work they've done and had a lot of
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.620
the work they've done and had a lot of
respect for them and like John Carmack

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630
respect for them and like John Carmack
 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.870
respect for them and like John Carmack
would be an example who was one of the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880
would be an example who was one of the
 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.180
would be an example who was one of the
founders of Ede software who made like

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
founders of Ede software who made like
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.470
founders of Ede software who made like
doom and quake and Wolfenstein 3d and it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
doom and quake and Wolfenstein 3d and it
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.870
doom and quake and Wolfenstein 3d and it
was always it was always impressive to

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880
was always it was always impressive to
 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.940
was always it was always impressive to
look and see the things that they would

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950
look and see the things that they would
 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.650
look and see the things that they would
produce and that they would be

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
produce and that they would be
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.380
produce and that they would be
successful doing it and and apparently

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
successful doing it and and apparently
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.350
successful doing it and and apparently
enjoy themselves so that would be one

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
enjoy themselves so that would be one
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.190
enjoy themselves so that would be one
top of my head example also in in like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
top of my head example also in in like
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800
top of my head example also in in like
the 90s and probably maybe before that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
the 90s and probably maybe before that
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719
the 90s and probably maybe before that
as well there was a big demo scene where

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
as well there was a big demo scene where
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.530
as well there was a big demo scene where
people would make demos where it would

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
people would make demos where it would
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630
people would make demos where it would
be trying to demonstrate what would be

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
be trying to demonstrate what would be
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850
be trying to demonstrate what would be
possible with the limited computers of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
possible with the limited computers of
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.760
possible with the limited computers of
the time and most of these people were a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
the time and most of these people were a
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.020
the time and most of these people were a
European I think but they would have

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
European I think but they would have
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.219
European I think but they would have
these big parties where they would show

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
these big parties where they would show
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140
these big parties where they would show
off their demos and a lot of those guys

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
off their demos and a lot of those guys
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410
off their demos and a lot of those guys
I don't remember specific names but it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
I don't remember specific names but it
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120
I don't remember specific names but it
was always impressive the things that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
was always impressive the things that
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.649
was always impressive the things that
they could accomplish

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.169
say that there are best programmers but

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179
say that there are best programmers but
 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.209
say that there are best programmers but
I think that there are programmers who

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219
I think that there are programmers who
 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.300
I think that there are programmers who
end up being probably 10 times more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
end up being probably 10 times more
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490
end up being probably 10 times more
productive than a sort of average

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
productive than a sort of average
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.149
productive than a sort of average
programmer and I don't know what it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
programmer and I don't know what it
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.279
programmer and I don't know what it
would really take I think it's it comes

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289
would really take I think it's it comes
 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.149
would really take I think it's it comes
down to it comes down to just the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
down to it comes down to just the
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010
down to it comes down to just the
ability to cut through what's really

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
ability to cut through what's really
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740
ability to cut through what's really
important and then focus on that and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
important and then focus on that and
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.259
important and then focus on that and
sort of having the the sense to know

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
sort of having the the sense to know
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.960
sort of having the the sense to know
that when you get that stuff right

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
that when you get that stuff right
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.220
that when you get that stuff right
everything else can fall into place and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
everything else can fall into place and
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.289
everything else can fall into place and
there's probably some some necessary

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299
there's probably some some necessary
 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.670
there's probably some some necessary
element of being able to keep enough

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
element of being able to keep enough
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500
element of being able to keep enough
things in your head at the same time but

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
things in your head at the same time but
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.259
things in your head at the same time but
I think really a lot of it's just sort

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
I think really a lot of it's just sort
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.089
I think really a lot of it's just sort
of a signal to noise if you find the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099
of a signal to noise if you find the
 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.819
of a signal to noise if you find the
right thing to focus on it makes

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829
right thing to focus on it makes
 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.710
right thing to focus on it makes
everything alright

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.280
I think a lot of it comes down to it's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290
I think a lot of it comes down to it's
 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.650
I think a lot of it comes down to it's
very easy to spend a great deal of time

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660
very easy to spend a great deal of time
 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.350
very easy to spend a great deal of time
focusing on something and and then

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360
focusing on something and and then
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.730
focusing on something and and then
forget to call your friends and that

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740
forget to call your friends and that
 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.710
forget to call your friends and that
sort of thing it's I probably would do

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
sort of thing it's I probably would do
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.900
sort of thing it's I probably would do
that more if I wasn't married so but

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910
that more if I wasn't married so but
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.860
that more if I wasn't married so but
yeah I think I think there are

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
yeah I think I think there are
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.910
yeah I think I think there are
programmers that way but I think there

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
programmers that way but I think there
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.290
programmers that way but I think there
are plenty of programmers who are just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300
are plenty of programmers who are just
 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.660
are plenty of programmers who are just
like regular people and do regular

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670
like regular people and do regular
 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.570
like regular people and do regular
things and go out and you know do all

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580
things and go out and you know do all
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.900
things and go out and you know do all
the things that are sort of normal ish
