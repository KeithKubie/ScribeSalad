00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.410
What I want to do in this video
is come up with an expression

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.710
for finding the sum from i
equals 0 to n of i squared.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.510
So if I were to
expand this out, this

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.250
is equal to 0 squared
plus 1 squared

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.940
plus 2 squared plus 3 squared.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.786
And we're going to keep on
going all the way to n squared.

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:24.660
So my goal is to find
some type of a function

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.450
that you give me
the n and I will

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.800
find the sum from 0
squared, 1 squared,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.300
2 squared, all the
way to n squared.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.966
And so you can imagine
that'd be useful,

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.110
because this might be OK
if n is reasonably small.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.484
But if n is a big
number, this is

00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:38.350
going to take you forever to do.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.870
So let's first study this.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.640
Let's study what the input and
the output of this function

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.680
needs to be.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.970
So the input is
going to be our n.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.044
So here we're starting with--
so n can go from 0 all the way--

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:51.710
and we'll just try
up a bunch of values.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.600
So n could be 0.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.250
We could go from 0
all the way to 0.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.490
n could be 1.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.650
n could be 2.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.580
n could be 3.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.980
And we could just keep on
going on and on and on.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.630
But I'll just stop
there for now.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.549
Actually, let's just
go to 4, just for fun.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.090
And now, for each
of these, let's see

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.840
what the output of our
function should be.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.020
The output of the function
should be this thing.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.560
It should be the sum from i
equals 0 to n of i squared.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.947
So when n is 0-- well, that's
just going to be 0 squared.

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:20.280
We'd just stop right over there.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.780
So that's just 0.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.900
When n is 1, it's 0
squared plus 1 squared.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.410
So that is 1.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.930
When n is 2, it's 0 squared
plus 1 squared plus 2 squared.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
So that's 1 plus 4, which is 5.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.510
When n is 3, now we
go all the way to 3.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.440
So it's going to be 1 plus
4, which is 5, plus 9.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.970
So 5 plus 9 is 14.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.240
And then when n is 4, we're
going to add the 16, 4 squared,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.780
to this.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030
So this gets us to 30.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.782
And of course, we could
keep going on and on and on.

00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.490
So let's study this
a little bit to think

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.790
about what type of a function
that, for each of these inputs,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.554
might give us this
type of an output.

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:04.970
So let's first look at the
difference between these terms.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.085
So the difference here is 1.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.167
The difference here is 4.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.000
And this is obvious.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.820
We added 1 here.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.550
We added 2 squared here.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.060
We added 3 squared, or 9, here.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.670
We added 4 squared, or 16, here.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.150
And the reason
why I'm doing this

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.557
is if this was a
linear function,

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.390
then the difference
between successive terms

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.790
would be the same.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.840
Now, if this is a
quadratic function,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.730
then the differences between the
differences would be the same.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.580
Let's see if that's the case.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.870
So the difference here is 1.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.840
The difference here is 4.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.805
So the difference
between those is 3.

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.500
The difference here is 5.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.970
The difference here is 7.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.840
So even the difference of the
differences is increasing.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.320
But if this is a cubic
function, then the differences

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.960
of the difference of the
difference should be constant.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.660
So let's see if that's the case.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.160
And you'll appreciate
this even more

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.430
when you start
learning calculus.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.971
So let's see.

00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.890
The difference
between 3 and 5 is 2.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.570
The difference
between 5 and 7 is 2.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.030
And so we keep having
a constant shift of 2.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.860
So the fact that the
difference of the difference

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.990
of the difference
is fixed tells us

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.880
that we should be
able to express this

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.740
as some type of
a cubic function.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.160
So this we could
write as this should

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.290
be equal to some
function in terms of n.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.890
And we could write it as An
to the third plus Bn squared

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.330
plus C times n
plus D. And now we

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.420
can just use what the inputs
are and the outputs are of these

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.490
to solve for A, B, C, and D.
And I encourage you to do that.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.750
Well, let's first think
about when n is equal to 0.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.180
When n is equal to 0, this
function evaluates to D.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.030
So this function evaluates
to D. But that function

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.650
needs to evaluate to
0, so D needs to be 0.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.410
So I'm just trying to
fix these letters here

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.260
to get the right outputs.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.060
So when n is 0, this
expression evaluates to D.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.860
And it needs to evaluate to 0,
so D needs to be equal to 0.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.870
So D is equal to 0, or
we could just ignore it.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.450
So that helps us a little bit.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.269
We know from this
data point we're

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.670
able to whittle it
down to it having

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.120
this form right over here.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.570
And so now we can take
each of these inputs

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.120
and figure out what their
corresponding output is.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270
So let's do that--
I'll do that over here.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.980
So when n is 1,
this thing evaluates

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.660
to-- let me do this in
a new color-- this thing

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.725
evaluates to A times 1 to the
third power, which is just 1,

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:46.800
plus B times 1 squared, which
is just 1, plus C times 1, which

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.690
is just C. And this
needs to be equal to 1.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.420
Now, when n is 2, we have
A times n to the third.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.100
So that's 8A plus
2 squared is 4,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.715
plus 4B plus 2C needs
to be equal to 5.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.860
And I need to set
up three equations

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.910
if I want to solve
for three unknowns.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.240
And so let's go to 3.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.240
So A times 3 to the third power,
so that's going to be 27A,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:44.180
plus 9B plus 3C is
going to be equal to 14.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.800
So I've set up three
equations in three unknowns.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.930
Now I just have to solve
these for A, B, and C.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:59.840
And I will have a generalized
formula for finding this sum

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.470
right over here, the sum of
the first n numbers squared,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.760
I guess you could call it.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.160
So what I want to do now is
I'm going to stop this video.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.560
I encourage you to try to
solve the simultaneous equation

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.060
on your own.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.760
In the next video, I'll
actually go and solve it.
