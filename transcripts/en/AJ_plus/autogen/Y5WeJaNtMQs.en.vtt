response to that would be do we have the

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
response to that would be do we have the
 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.020
response to that would be do we have the
same level of outrage when a window gets

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030
same level of outrage when a window gets
 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.510
same level of outrage when a window gets
broken as we do when a young black

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520
broken as we do when a young black
 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.280
broken as we do when a young black
person is killed in our communities and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
person is killed in our communities and
 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.320
person is killed in our communities and
if we don't there's a real disparity

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330
if we don't there's a real disparity
 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.670
if we don't there's a real disparity
there and we need to figure out what

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680
there and we need to figure out what
 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:48.220
there and we need to figure out what
that is

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.640
once we did you know it was beautiful
