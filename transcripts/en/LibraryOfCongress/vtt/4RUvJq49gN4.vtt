00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.580
&gt;&gt; I'm Jan Lauridsen.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.940
This is my colleague
over here Anne McLean.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.730
We both work in the Music
Division here in the Library

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.960
of Congress, and this
morning we're going to talk

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.730
about some very precious items
from the music collections,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.330
among them two crown jewels,
Cantata Number 9, the manuscript

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.070
of Cantata number 9 and
number 10 In Bach's Hand.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.720
They're hardly ever taken out
of the vault and put on display.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.580
So, all of us really
are very privileged

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.880
to have this opportunity
to study them up close.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.190
Let's start with
Cantata Number 9:

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.050
"Es ist das Heil uns
Kommen her", which means,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.450
salvation has come to us.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.420
The term "Cantata" is
associated with Bach

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.040
because he wrote
hundreds of them mostly

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.480
for Lutheran church services.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.000
Most of them date to his time
in Leipzig when he was cantor

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.290
of St. Thomas Church and
was also in charge of music

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.410
at the other main Lutheran
churches in Leipzig,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.160
St. Nicholas, St. Peter
and the New Church.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.650
By the way, Bach
was elected cantor

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.220
by the Leipzig town
council 294 years ago today

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.590
on April 22nd, 1723.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.430
As cantor, it was Bach's
job to prepare cantatas

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.380
for every Sunday and holiday
church service; too loud, okay,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.330
which would add up to
60 plus cantatas a year.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.930
Three more or less complete
full-year cycles of cantatas

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.510
by Bach have survived, but
he may have composed as many

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.040
as five with most of
the last two being lost.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.050
Bach's performances required

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.650
that musicians be extremely
well-trained and versatile,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.640
because Bach expected
a lot of them.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.260
The town pipers and art
fiddlers including woodwind,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.810
string and brass
players were proficient

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.730
of several instruments each.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.300
They were the best musicians in
Leipzig and the most well paid.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.220
The singers were mostly students
and alumni of St. Thomas School.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.710
On entry, Bach would
rank the best singers

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.300
as having a good voice, a
fine voice, a strong voice,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.650
or a good, strong voice.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.250
Having reliably fine
musicians was essential

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.480
to Bach the composer.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.010
Comparing his own music to that
of other composers, he said,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.090
"The concerto pieces that are
performed by the first choir

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.800
which are mostly of my own
composition are incomparably

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.330
harder and more intricate."

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.840
This is a lovely watercolor of
St. Thomas Church and school

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.770
where Bach and family lived
painted by Felix Mendelssohn

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.370
from the vantage point of
his apartment when he lived

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.090
in Leipzig about a
hundred years after Bach.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.700
A typical Bach cantata is
a multipart polyphonic work

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.460
for vocal soloists,
instrumentalists and choir

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.020
with texts that relates
to the Bible readings

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.910
in the Lutheran liturgy for a
particular Sunday or holiday.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.900
As "Es ist das Heil uns kommen
her" is a chorale cantata,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.600
meaning that the music
incorporates the tune

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.730
of a Lutheran corral or hymn
and the text incorporates

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.430
versus of the hymn, sometimes
verbatim, sometimes paraphrased.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.340
Bach wrote more than
50 chorale cantatas.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.500
"Es ist das Heil" is based
on a hymn by Paul Speratus,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.720
a Catholic priest who
became a Protestant preacher

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.330
and hymn writer.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.210
He and Martin Luther wrote the
First Lutheran hymnal published

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.200
in 1524 known as
the "Achliederbuch"

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.660
"Book of Eight" songs.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.560
The overall subject of the hymn
is justification by faith alone.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.720
Some of the text can be
translated as "Works never help.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.460
They cannot protect us.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.550
Lord, instead of good works
you look at the strength

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.850
of faith in our hearts.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.360
Only faith justifies us."

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.380
The composer of the chorale
tune itself is not known.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.430
It is cited as a
traditional German Easter tune

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.720
that dates back to around 1400.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.630
"Est ist das Heil" was composed
sometime between 1732 and 1735

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.220
for the Sixth Sunday
after Trinity which falls

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.100
in late July or early August.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.610
The cantata is in seven parts.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.030
As is typical of a
chorale cantata, the first

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.780
and last movements are based
on the chorale, both the tune

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.560
and the text and the middle
sections are recitatives

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.750
and arias which mostly
paraphrase the chorale text.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.180
Here is the first of
the seventeen pages

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.960
which comprise the manuscript.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.290
Originally, there were four
folios that were folded

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.130
into bifolios resulting
in four pages each.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.980
It goes like this, you
know, one, two, three, four.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.800
So, there are four of them.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.970
Bach added an additional
page after he crossed

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.510
out a messy version of the
last recitative and rewrote it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.030
on a clean page, and you can
see it a little bit later.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:06.460
Across the top, Bach wrote
"JJ Jesu juva", "Jesus help",

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.060
"Jesus help me crank
out one more cantata."

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.210
Bach always wrote "JJ" at the
beginning and "Deo soli gloria"

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.440
for the "glory of God
alone" at the very end

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.500
of his music for worship.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.930
Continuing across the top,
"Dominica 6 post Trinitatis."

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.500
That's the Sixth
Sunday after Trinity,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.650
"Es ist das Heil uns
kommnen her" for four voices,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.880
in transverse flute, one
[foreign word spoken],

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.440
or oboe d' amore, two
violins, viola and continuo.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.750
I know it's a travesty to play
little clips of a blind piece

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.730
of music by Bach, but we can't
just talk about the manuscript.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.650
We have to, we have to hear
the at some of the cantata.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.540
This is a recording
by Helmuth Rilling

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
and Back Collegium
Stutgart made in 1985.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.980
The first clip is the beginning
of the cantata which is a kind

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.270
of contrapuntal fantasy
based on the chorale tune.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.150
I'll play enough of it so that
you can hear the sopranos come

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.510
in with the chorale to and in
long, you know, sustained notes.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.510
You'll, you may recognize it.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:08:21.320
[ Music ]

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.190
The second movement is the
first of three recitatives sung

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.530
by the bass and Bach cantatas
and other vocal works,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.610
the bass voice is often
associated with God

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.780
or vox Christi, and
this recitative

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.940
of God the bass emphasizes
God's law.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.150
So, the bass will come in

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:49.300
"Gott gab uns ein Gesetz",
"God gave us a Law."

00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:27.900
[ Music ]

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.260
The third movement is an aria
sung by the Tenor beginning

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.500
with the words, "Wir waren
schon zu tief gesunken".

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.280
"We were sunk too deep."

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.830
"Tiefe drohte schon den Tod",

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.450
"The deep already
threatened us with death."

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.860
You'll note the descending
somewhat tortured melodic lines

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.430
that represent sinking into
the depths of sin and a sort

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:57.510
of jig-like rhythm that is a
bit jaunty for the ominous text.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:59.740
[ Music ]

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.030
I won't play a clip of
the fourth movement,

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.520
but it's again a
recitative sung by the bass,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.990
"Doch muste das Gesetz
erfullet warden",

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.960
"But the law had
to be fulfilled."

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.160
The fifth movement is an
absolutely elegant Soprano

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:22.320
and Alto Aria, "Herr, du siehst
statt gutter Werke", "Lord,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.020
instead of good works you look

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.720
at Auf des Herzens
Glaubensstarke",

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.890
"At the strength of
faith in our hearts."

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.850
It's actually a double canon
paring the flute and oboe

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.760
and the Soprano and Alto.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.950
I'll play enough of it so
that you can hear both canons.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:12:54.060
[ Music ]

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.980
The sixth movement is
a recitative, again,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:05.420
in the bass expanding on God's
law, "When we recognize sin

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.300
through the law", "So schlagt
es das Gewissen nieder",

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.290
"Than conscience
strikes us down."

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.970
I'll move on to the
seventh and last movement.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.570
It's a straightforward
four-part setting

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.410
of chorale tune which
is typical.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.030
"Ob sichs anlies, als wollt
er nicht" "Although it seems

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.190
that he is unwilling", "Las
dich es nicht ershrecken",

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.790
"Do not be dismayed."

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.100
And we'll play the
whole chorale.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:14:45.490
[ Music ]

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.230
You can understand why Bach
was so fond of this chorale

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.980
and used it in a
number of cantatas.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.820
Now, how did this manuscript end
up in the Library of Congress?

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.860
I will read from the
library's annual report of 1931

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.120
where Carl Engel then Chief
of the Music Division,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.020
gives the provenance
of the manuscript.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.190
I really can't improve on what
he wrote, so I'll just read it.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.660
"The most signal acquisition
by purchase for the year,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.200
and indeed for many
years, is the original

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.780
and complete holograph score

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.800
of Johann Sebastian Bach's
Cantata 'Es ist das Heil uns

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.100
kommen her.'

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.320
It is the first Bach manuscript
of any importance that has come

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.560
to the library and there
are few in America today

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.510
to match it in extent
and rarity.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.720
The purchase from the
widow of Dr. Wolffheim,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.030
the distinguished
musicologist and collector

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.100
in Berlin was made possible
only through a fortunate joining

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.520
of forces, that is, through the
gifts of money from the friends

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.730
of music in the Library
of Congress

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.820
and the Beethoven Association
of New York combined

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.830
with the resources
of the library."

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.270
Now I'll skip to the provenance.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.840
Nikolaus, "Johann
Nikolaus Forkel,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.990
J.S. Bach's first
biographer wrote

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.530
to an unidentified
correspondent on April 4th,

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:21.560
1803 that at a time when
Wilhelm Friedemann Bach,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.450
that's Bach's oldest son,

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.820
had been in particularly
reduced circumstances.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.930
The latter it offered to
him for sale an entire year

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.400
of J.S. Bach's cantatas
about 69 works

in the composer's handwriting
for 20 [foreign word spoken],

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.760
but Forkel himself at the time
not being insufficient funds

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.340
to accept the offer, paid

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.850
for the privilege of
examining these manuscripts.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.910
Taking advantage of the
opportunity, Forkel writes

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.120
that he copied some of the
finest of the cantatas belonging

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.050
to the set that Friedemann
had lent him.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.750
Among the cantatas copied
was 'Es ist das Heil uns

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.050
kommen her.'

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.360
The whole set according
to Forkel,

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.990
was sold by Friedemann
before 1778

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.060
for 12 thaler" that's
t-h-a-l-e-r,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.950
"or something like 9 dollars."

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.150
With all due respect
to Carl Engel,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.490
I think he may be mistaken
about that or errored in that,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:31.950
because I found a table
of the purchasing power

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.670
of various currencies that were
used in Germany at the time

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.250
of Bach and his sons,
and according

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:43.710
to this table 12 thaler would
have equaled 864 dollars

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:48.520
which is still a pittance
for 69 Bach manuscripts.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.010
It remains to be established

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.930
who bought the holograph
from Friedemann.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.120
The whereabouts of
this score was unknown

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.420
to Morris Helpmann
[assumed spelling]

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.700
when he prepared the
publication of the cantata

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:07.320
for the first volume of the
complete Bach edition in 1851.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.740
To judge by the character of
the binding and French imprint

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.400
on the silk back of it, the
manuscript must have been

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.280
in French hands about the
middle of the last century.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.780
The front cover has stamped
on it an English title.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.390
The manuscript was acquired

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.430
by the late Dr. Wolffheim some
10 years ago from the firm

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.240
of Liepmannssohn, the
musical antiquarians in Berlin

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.770
who purchased it through
a private agent in 1921.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.920
Mr. Liepmannssohn
offered the suggestion

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.840
that the English owner may
have been A. George Kurtz

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.550
of Liverpool whose important
autograph collection was

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.670
disbursed by sales in 1895
and the following years.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:01.090
Here is the likely
provenance of the manuscript.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.610
Bach, of course, was the
original owner and when he died

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.490
in 1750, it passed
to Friedemann.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.410
When Bach died his manuscripts

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.930
and books were divided
among his four musical sons

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.710
and his little Anna Magdalena.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.270
We know that it was in
possession of Friedemann in 1773

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.270
when Forkel saw it
and copied it out.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.040
We suspect that it was
sold by 1778 or soon after,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.540
because there is a stamped
letter from Friedemann

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.890
to family friend Johann Joachim
Eschenburg instructing him

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.640
to sell all his remaining
manuscripts.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.580
As Friedemann put it,
"Convert them to cash."

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.720
There is speculation that it
may have been in French hands

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.880
in the middle of
the 19th-century.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.000
At some point it was probably
acquired by Andrew George Kurtz,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.690
a collector and critic
in Liverpool as suggested

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.560
by the Liepmannssohns
when they sold it

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.890
to Werner Wolffheim in 1921.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.950
Wolffheim died in 1930 leaving
the manuscript to his widow.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.250
The library bought it

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.920
from [foreign name
spoken] Wolffheim in 1931.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.720
I located the Music Division's
order for the purchase

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.300
in 1931 which is on display.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:26.990
It indicates that
Ossip Gabrilowitsch,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.820
conductor of the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra from 1918

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.940
to 1935, made the
offer of the manuscript

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.850
to Carl Angle [assumed spelling]
on behalf of Mrs. Wolffheim.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.860
Gabrilowitsch had toured
and even lived in Berlin

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.230
in the course of his
career and must have gotten

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.010
to know the Wolffheims.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.910
Gabrilowitsch knew Carl
Angle as far back as 1917

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.290
and even Oscar [inaudible]
before

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.220
that having made many
requests to borrow

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.960
or have Photostats
made of scores

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.040
from the library's collections;
we don't do that anymore.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.180
And in 1931, he and Angle
collaborated on a music festival

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.190
in the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:15.180
A few of the many letters
between Gabrilowitsch and Angle

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.720
that year mentioned the
negotiations surrounding

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.020
the manuscript.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.920
He wrote as a postscript to a
letter to Carl Angle in 1931.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.090
"Now, here is an
entirely different story.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.720
Please read the enclosed
letter from my friend

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.290
and distinguished Berlin lawyer
Dr. Tiktim [assumed spelling]

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.900
and please tell me
whether you know of anybody

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.200
who might be interested

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.150
in buying the Bach
manuscript which he describes.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.690
I would really appreciate
your advice in this matter."

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.620
And Gabrilowitsch wrote to
Carl Angle again May 5th,

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.620
1931 "In accordance with
our telephone conversation,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.010
I shall make an effort
to ascertain as soon

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.910
as I reach Berlin what lowest
price Mrs. Wolffheim would

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.800
accept for the Bach manuscript.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.280
You mentioned in your
conversation the other day,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.080
that other cantatas
of Bach were for sale

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.080
in this country at present.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.290
My request to you is only that
you do not commit yourself

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.860
to buy one of these other
manuscripts until you have heard

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.940
from me, as I am almost,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.540
almost sure that Mrs. Wolffheim
will be most reasonable

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.840
in her demands."

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:36.080
And then on June 2nd,
Gabrilowitsch sent a telegraph

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.640
to Angle, "Mrs. Wolffheim,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.500
willing to sell Bach
manuscript $5000, please cable."

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.210
That wraps up my story
on the manuscript

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.860
of Bach Cantata Number 9.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.510
Thank you for your interest.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:23:00.710
[ Applause ]

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.010
Thank you.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.040
There will be time a little
later to see the items up close

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.350
if you haven't seen
them already,

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.230
but first I'll turn the floor
over to my colleague Anne McLean

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.340
who will tell you a bit
about the manuscript

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.150
for Bach's Cantata
Number 10, as well as,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:19.880
other items showing different
aspects of Bach's life and work.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good morning.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.340
It's very touching
to be in the presence

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.200
of these magnificent
scores really.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.800
To see the physical
manifestations of experiences

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.720
that hold such meaning
for us as music lovers,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.550
and it can be memorable to
appreciate them physically

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.770
and anesthetically, and
certainly from the point-of-view

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:50.880
of handwriting and notational
calligraphy they are beautiful.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.770
Today, about 805 of
Bach's manuscripts are held

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.150
in the Bach Archive in Leipzig.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.630
And we are fortunate as Jan
says, to have these two.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.250
It's remarkable really to see
them and to hold them here

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.210
at the Library of Congress.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.640
In addition to the manuscripts
for these two sublime cantatas,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.360
we've also brought out
for you a very small

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.230
and charming manuscript of his
French Suites for a keyboard,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.580
the very small manuscript you
see on this side of the table.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.050
This one is not in Bach's hand.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.970
It was copied by his son-in-law
Johann Christoph Atnickol,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.810
but it's quite significant as
a major source for the suites.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.400
First we'll take a quick look

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.100
at an interesting artifact
from the late 1740s.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.660
It places the composer in
a very earthly context.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.710
Earlier you saw Jan had
that beautiful image

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.190
of the one Mendelssohn
watercolor

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.140
of the St. Thomas Church.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.870
Here is an image of the
interior and a plaque with Bach

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.160
with the flowers as
you see in the floor.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:02.420
This shows the organ and
gives you a sense of the space

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.570
in the church, so have a sense

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.360
of what he would
have been looking

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.700
at every day when
he was in there.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.090
Bach's position gave him the
responsibility for the music

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.340
in Leipzig churches actually,
St. Thomas, St. Nicholas,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.550
St. Mathew and St. Peters.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.810
He himself directed at both
St. Thomas and St. Nicholas

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.310
and prefix handled the others.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.640
He also supervised
the musical education

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.460
of the choir boys of
the Thomas School.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.130
John Elliott Gardner has
written an extraordinary book,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.030
"Music in the Castle of Heaven"
and one of the things he says

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.200
in there about the, he has a
lot about the cantatas in there,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.010
how they are conceived
and used and so forth,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.630
he says he thinks one reason

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.640
that Bach may have been
interested in writing these is

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.100
as chorale cantatas is because
it would help him literally

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.050
chorale and anchor the voice
of sopranos because it was

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.630
that each one, each cantata had
a song that they would know,

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.690
a hymn tune rather
that they would know.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.040
So, we always think
of him working

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.910
with this 55-voice
choir, the Thomaner Choir.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.350
Let's see a document that
takes us into the realm

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.020
of Bach's business life into
the mundane and quotidian round

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.410
of duties he had
as a Thomas cantor.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.410
And this is something you'll see

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.620
on the table there,
the Nathan Bequest.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.710
They are receipts in the
hand of Johann Sebastian Bach

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.620
and this is why we
had this title

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.620
for our presentation
today, "In His Hand;

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.740
Notes and Accounts by Bach."

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.210
We have a page, a
very small page

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.300
of Bach's handwritten
receipts for payments received

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.190
from the bequest for a wealthy,

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.680
the wife of a wealthy
[inaudible] cabinetmaker

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.140
for preparing and
conducting the choir

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.130
in an annual memorial service.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.220
Each year on Sabina's
Day, October 26th,

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.490
the choir would perform
funeral motets

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.320
for this donor during
the service

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.950
at either St. Thomas
or St. Nicholas.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.810
Sabinaton [assumed spelling]
widow of this cabinetmaker died

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:12.940
in 1612 and a 134 years later
this bequest was still being

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.520
honored annually.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.420
Bach was the recipient of
this payment over a period

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.620
of 27 years and his
predecessors, of course,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.590
for many years before that.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.420
This receipt is part of the
library's Moldenhauer Archives,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.470
it's a wide-ranging
collection of more

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.950
than 3500 items documenting
the history of western music.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.670
Hans Moldenhauer was a noted
Alpine climber who immigrated

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.430
to the U.S. in 1938 and he also
wrote an important biography

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.920
of Anton Von Weber.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.310
The library owns a major
part of his collection

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.450
and you can find an
extensive book about it online

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.910
if you would like our website.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.980
Robert Marshall the
Bach scholar writes

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.640
that these receipts
were originally bound

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.190
into a big account book kept
by the cabinetmaker's gild

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.360
and as you can imagine, the ones
signed by Bach were extracted

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.280
and sold off over many years to
collectors like the one we have.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.310
On [inaudible] and you'll be
able to turn it, we'll be able

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.570
to turn it over for you, on
recto are receipts for 1746

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:16.100
and 47 and then on
the verso at the top,

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.350
which is what you see
here, the one for 1748.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.250
Below that, you see the
handwriting is different.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.110
It's a partial receipt created

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.510
by Bach's son Johann
Christoph Bach for 1749.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.020
He started to write this
for his father at age 14

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.640
and seeing this brings
the poignant realization

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.940
that he needed to do this,

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.710
because Bach was
losing his eyesight.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:44.160
The amount of the, the amount

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.630
for the services rendered was 5
golden, with two going to Bach

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.890
and 3 going to the choir boys.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.430
I believe this amount according
to Back documented book,

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.590
I believe this would
be around 75

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.930
to 80 dollars today, probably.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.740
And Bach actually derived
a lot of his income

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.530
from these kinds of payments.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.390
You know, of course, as any
church musician can tell you,

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.710
you do weddings and funerals and
these are part of your income.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.810
He also was paid in things
like candles and oil,

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.500
heating oil and things
like that.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.810
He had an income of about
700 thalers per year,

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.360
but he had all these
other small sources.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:31.940
Now, let's take a look at
the little score I mentioned.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.830
This is a manuscript of
Bach's French Suites,

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.120
the cover in red goat skin.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.250
This was not the original cover.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.550
It was part of his majesterial
group of keyboard works

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.980
from his late 30s including

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.940
"The Well-Tempered Clavier"
Goldberg Variations,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.860
Italian Concerto and others.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.070
This small score is a
very clear readable copy

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:58.420
of the French Suites BWV 812
through 816 made by his student

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.890
and son-in-law and it measures
less than 8 inches wide

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.090
and less than 6 inches high.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.890
Something that you think
about when you look

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.910
at this appealing little book is
the platoon of excellent copyist

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.030
that Bach deployed, most
of them his students.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.410
He also had a private secretary,
something you don't think

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.610
about with Bach for a number
of years in his later year,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.320
later career, although,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.940
very little of is correspondence
unfortunately have survived.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.440
This manuscript was
originally thought

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.630
to be a Bach manuscript
in his own hand.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.650
Phillip [foreign name spoken]
the biographer thought he could

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.850
authenticate it as such, and
in fact, we have a letter

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.040
about that, but as you've
seen this morning already

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:46.040
in the calligraphy, this
style is very different

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.560
or you will see in a moment.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.500
These French Suites are a
little more modest in scope

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.320
than the English Suites and
I imagine several of you

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.790
that have played
both those sets;

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.590
how many of are pianist
or keyboard people?

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.280
That's what I figured.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.730
These are a little shorter.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.870
Sometimes described as
domestic or a little lighter

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.020
than the English
Suites and partitas.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.090
They're less contrapuntal.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.520
Wilhelm Friedemann's
Siete Sinfonia

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.930
and Willem de Vriend the ones
written for him I should say,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.730
were more complex and
these do not have preludes.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.100
Neither set was published
in Bach's lifetime.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.800
He used these as teaching
pieces and like many of them,

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.360
like many of his compositions
including the Partitas flute

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.740
sonatas he revised
them extensively

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.210
over a considerable period.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.030
Five of these Suites are
from 1722 from his years

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.330
in [foreign word spoken].

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.950
The last one probably written
in Leipzig a little later.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.110
According to scholars, there
are at least 5 versions

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.620
of these Suites making it hard

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.980
to know what would be
the definitive version.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.640
He copied them into 5 of them
into his wife's notebook,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.630
the famous Clavier-Buchlein
of Anna Magdalena Bach.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.030
The first of two she had and
the one that he gave her shortly

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.310
after they were married in 1721.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.210
So, is there something

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.910
of Clavier that's
interesting for a quick look?

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.570
One thing is that the title page
does not say "French Suites."

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.260
It actually says, "Six
Suites" and then below

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.550
that a description of the
dance forms in German similar

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.160
to the title page, you
see on his partitas.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.650
The French title that we see on
modern scores came much later,

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.640
12 years after Bach's death
from Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.450
and also his biographer Forkel.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.810
Our manuscript copied
after 1744,

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.940
is the last chronologically
of the major sources for the

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.620
"French Suites" and
there were many sources.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.220
Often performers choose

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.290
to collate their own
performing edition

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.800
and that's what Richard
Egarr did

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.230
who was here just a few
weeks back in January.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.920
A lot of artists go back
to the source and look

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.840
at the manuscripts themselves
and collate and choose

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.280
and put together an
edition in which they like.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.360
Our score, the point of
showing this today is

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.310
that our score is important
for a Bach Scholarship,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:10.700
because it includes all six
suites and it is written,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.040
it is copied in what is today
considered the correct order.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.480
This score was one
of the sources

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.980
for the complete Bach edition.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.410
So, how French are they?

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.750
In fact, not so very.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.450
Many commentators talk about
the steel galant aspects

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.530
and French inflected melodies
and so on, but when you look

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.790
at the individuals suites,
you see both Italian

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.130
and French style
Courante movements

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.280
and quite an international
variety

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.430
of instrumental dance forms
including a Polish one,

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.370
"The Lure" you can see the
name up at the top at the left

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.730
and also an [inaudible] which
I believe is a form unique

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:56.330
to this source for Bach; his
only use of it I believe.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.920
He wrote these at
Kurten, a princely court

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.010
where he was definitely exposed
to all kinds of dance movements

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.660
at musical conventions from
the continent and elsewhere.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.000
When you look at this display
later, this volume is opened

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.910
to the Sarabande of the Fifth
Suite and is a rare chance

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:17.150
to see Bach's own ornamentation.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.480
Generally in terms of ornaments,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.850
there are very few indicated
in any of his scores.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.330
The thinking player,

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.480
a sophisticated musician would
have created his own ornaments

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.450
of course, according to the
taste and style of the day

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.890
and his own instincts.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.380
Bach would have been surprised
to see modern editions

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.250
with many ornaments
carefully indicated.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.960
There's one other rather
esoteric point that's fun

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.090
to make or interesting
to make based

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.590
on this particular Bach source;
I looked at Ruth Tatlow's book

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.340
"God's Numbers" which makes
an interesting and strong case

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.490
for Bach using revisions,
even revisions

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.570
to what are essentially finished
manuscripts to bring his works

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.680
into the realm of symbolism.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.250
She calls her theory
"proportional parallelism",

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.630
basing it on concepts
about proportions

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:10.280
of universal harmony, physical,
moral, and philosophical harmony

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.000
that reflected God's creation.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.150
And she believes that
he tinkered carefully

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.630
with final copies of his
work to bring them into line

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.560
with mathematical
concepts of proportion.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.510
Quote "Probably [foreign
name spoken] version has been

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:28.810
numerically revised in pursuit
of numerical perception."

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.450
That's our copy.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.710
Her book has a number
of charts including one

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:37.800
that shows a total count of 1380
written bars for this manuscript

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.290
in support of her theory
which reflects divine design;

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:46.220
interesting, though maybe you
might like to check it out.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.810
Now let's turn to the Cantata,
"Meine Seel erhebt den Herren",

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.320
"My soul that magnify the Lord."

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.720
This Cantata is for the feast of
the visitation of Mary performed

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.080
for the first time
on July 2nd, 1724,

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.900
probably not performed
again until, after 1740.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.220
The German text is based on
the story of the visitation

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.310
of the Virgin Mary to her cousin
Elizabeth and the prefiguring

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.460
of the birth of Christ.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.370
Bach's Chorale Cantatas were
written on text composed

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.310
by librettists generally
and these actually had

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:25.590
to be reviewed and
approved by senior clerics

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.020
in the Lutheran Church
before he could set them,

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.090
before he was able to
go ahead and do them.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.940
That's a new fact from me again
from this fascinating book.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.520
But for this cantata, the
opening chorus is taken

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.050
from Luke 1 verse 46:48 which
are familiar to many people.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.840
"Oh my soul praised the Lord.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.350
How my spirit rejoices
in God my savior."

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.200
The fifth movement
used the verse 54,

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.900
"He has helped his
servant Israel

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.760
and remembered to be merciful."

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.980
This cantata does not a
traditional chorale or hymn tune

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.490
from Lutheran Church as
it's musical foundation.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.160
It uses "The German
Magnificat" that you hear

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.140
in the Vespers' liturgy.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.580
It seems to resemble
a reciting tone

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.760
and it carries a melodic
hint of connections to chant

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.510
and to modal harmony that
give it an archaic character,

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.650
slight archaic character.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.370
The cantata has seven movements
with and overall tonality

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.020
of G major, sorry, G minor.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.990
In the opening of chorus, which
we'll hear in just a moment,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.720
you'll hear the [foreign
word spoken],

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.100
the foundational melody
first in the sopranos

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.140
and then in the altos.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.650
I wanted to show you this blank
page, the second of the page

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.800
of the manuscript,
because it shows you

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.690
that Bach made his own score
and probably everyone did

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.090
in those days, manuscript
paper was very expensive.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.770
He had a rostrum which is
those fork-like implements

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.620
that you draw across the page
and apparently he used some

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.720
of them until they were worn out
and you can see there are spaces

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.370
and they're not, sometimes
they're not even any equal,

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.120
you know, the lines
are not equal.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.340
But, he worked, he made his own
scores and he had three types

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:13.200
of ink which we'll
talk about in a moment.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.970
There, I said, there
are seven movements,

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.500
a chorus "Meine Seel
erhebt den Herren;

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:24.070
soprano Aria [foreign word
spoken] bass aria, a duet.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.910
A beautiful duet which has
the full chorale melody,

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:33.190
we'll hear in a moment
pointed out by the trumpet.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.700
[Foreign word spoken] and final
chorus which uses also a bit

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.710
of the, uses the
doxology at the end.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.860
So, Mike let's play this opening
chorus just for a moment.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.510
You'll hear the trumpet
right away.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:40:02.820
[ Music ]

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.480
So, written, this was written
for soprano, alto, tenor,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.830
and bass soloists an SATB chorus
with an accompanying ensemble

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.730
of trumpet, two oboes, two
violins, viola, and contiuo

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.660
and the trumpet which you
heard is very appropriate

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.310
for this cantata, because
during the Baroque period it was

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:26.500
associated with the
concept of divine majesty.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.080
The parts for this
manuscript score are held

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.090
in the Leipzig Bach Archive.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.890
Parts and scores were often
separated by the family

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.040
after his death with
the thinking

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.730
that the works themselves
might be better preserved

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.740
than if they were kept
everything by one party.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.030
Basaki Suzuki [assumed
spelling] made the point to us

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.960
when he looked at
this score with us

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.940
that he felt one
could learn much more

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.090
from the parts than
from the score.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:58.210
Scores as we can see with this
one have very few markings

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.620
for [foreign word spoken],
very few for articulation and,

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.430
in fact, they are, they're
rather bare bones compared

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.030
to what you see in
the parts in terms

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.180
of bowings and things like that.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.710
Here, in fact, for our score
the instrumentation is not even

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.430
notated on this score
proper, it's in the rapport

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:22.230
of the folios surrounding
the music.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.810
I wanted to mention that
this score is now avail;

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.490
actually both cantatas
are now available

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:33.490
in very handsome reproductions
from the [foreign word spoken],

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.190
both with an excellent preface

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.650
by our former colleague Dan
Boomhauer [assumed spelling].

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:41.940
Before we begin, Mike let's
hear a bit of the duet

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.410
of the alto and tenor.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.250
It's a beautiful piece and the
way the chorale is treated,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.510
melody is treated is very nice.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:58.510
[ Music ]

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.510
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:42:01.510 --> 00:43:04.400
[ Music ]

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.960
Before looking at a couple of
details from the manuscript

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.980
which are really instructive,

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.480
let's look at the
provenance for a moment.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.240
Gertrude Clarke Whittall
who donated this pavilion

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.690
and this Strauss which is
Stradivarius instruments

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:22.600
which you see here, gave the
funds to make this purchase.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.540
So, this manuscript
is not a part

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.040
of the Whittall Foundation
Collection.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.920
It's been owned by
a fascinating group

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.760
of notable owners including
first Wilhelm Friedemann Bach,

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.730
then Philipp Spitta the
19th-century Bach biographer.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.440
His work was very significant
for his time and, in fact,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.420
was almost unbudgeable

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:46.020
for generations afterwards even
though his information was often

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.760
later not proved so reliable.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.850
Carl Pistor, an inventor and
collector bought the manuscript

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.310
and gave it to his daughter
Betty who was a friend

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.380
of Felix Mendelssohn's,

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.940
and later the mining
magnet Carl Bechstein,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.630
the father of the
philosopher Ludwig Beshstein,

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:13.100
and his son Paul was a
pianist who was known

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.410
for having created a significant
rapport for a piano left hand;

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.710
you may have heard about him.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:25.420
He lost his arm during the First
World War and Revell and Straus

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.430
and a number of people
wrote works for him.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.940
He continued to tour
as a pianist

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.450
for quite a number of years.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.500
He immigrated to the
U.S. in the late 1930s

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.880
and he brought some
family valuables

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.990
with him including a
number of music manuscripts

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.050
which remained in this country.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:48.010
His sister Margaresia, married
an American psychiatrist named

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.530
Jerome Stoneburrow [assumed
spelling] who was a colleague

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.750
of Freud's and lived in
Vienna for a longtime.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.600
It was her son, John
H. Stoneburrow

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.140
who sold our manuscript

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.570
to a former music division
chief Harold Spivak in 1948.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.680
So, it's a colorful history
when you read about it.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.030
It's rather sad the family was
just estranged from each other

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.440
and there some acrimony
over the manuscripts,

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.000
but this how it came to
the Library of Congress.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.880
So, regarding this manuscript,
there it tells us a lot

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.540
of things that is really fun to
look at and we'll just have time

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.400
to look at them quickly
here, a few items.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.910
Bach, as we know, was incredibly
industrious and very meticulous

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:34.110
and he worked very quickly.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:38.360
In a composing score like the
two cantata manuscripts we have,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.730
you see he sometimes
works with just soprano

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.670
and bass and fills in later.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.960
Sometimes he completes
the full score pressing on

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.600
and sometimes even
continuing in mid thought.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.380
The sheer volume of this
tremendous output meant

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.430
that he was always
writing under pressure

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:55.730
and we've talked a little bit

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.810
about how many works
he was doing.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:01.350
At one point I think in
1723 he had something

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.990
like 9 works completed
to be done in 16 days

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.810
for a big Christmas celebration.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.300
And he revised his
work constantly.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.780
This is something
that you will read

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.870
about in many studies,
Bach studies.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.050
Within a composition
he revised them,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.820
while working he
revised them and then

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.370
when revisiting them he
made constant revisions,

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.890
sometimes much later.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.870
Throughout his life this was a
practice and also, as we know,

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.540
borrowing from himself
and repurposing material

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.550
from one work to another
or to several works.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:41.620
On this page that we're looking
at, see the part in tiny writing

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:45.770
at the very bottom, that there
are three, four empty staves

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.960
and they you see
sort of sketched

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:52.870
out something a little faintly,
a less, little less hard

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:56.930
in terms of bearing down on
the ink, than the pen rather.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:01.650
This is, he is thinking and
revising at the same time.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.840
He wrote in this phrase as
a kind of an aide memoire

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.600
to hold his musical
thought while the ink dried

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.870
like a little to-do
note for himself,

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:17.270
but he was also revising
certainly, because when you look

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:21.460
at the next page you can
also see, you see up here

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.470
in the middle of the page,
near where it says "page 2"

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.470
in revisions, you can see that
he has continued that thought

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.800
with those phrases, but they're
a little different already

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.420
by the time he had
turned the page.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.530
And a lot of people
talk about this,

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:42.720
because he apparently worked at
a desk with three types of ink,

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:50.780
black, sepia, and a powder that
he would stir water together

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.390
with a copper gallic powder.

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.690
He made his own ink.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:58.320
Anyway, he had an inkwell
there and he would have to wait

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.100
until the ink had dried before
he could go on, and sometimes,

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.740
this process would take maybe
5 to 6 minutes they say.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.050
There was a box of sand on
his desk, very find sand

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.750
and he would have sprinkled
over heavy ink passages

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.560
to make them dry
faster, but nonetheless,

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.140
it took a while for
this to happen.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.690
So, what you will find when you
look at these manuscripts is

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.200
that he did indeed
change a few things

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.990
when he continued even
on a one-page later.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:36.680
So, let's see this is the
page two of, or sorry,

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.760
this is the soprano aria

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:45.150
and at the bottom you see there
are three crossed out staves.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.660
This is another section
where he was sort of working

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:53.880
out his thoughts and he
actually, the same thing

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.390
when you have the chance to go

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.560
through there you'll
actually see

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.530
that what he has begun here
is not quite exactly what you

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.830
would expect.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:05.280
It's a little different.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.690
The next page, this
one is interesting

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:15.520
because it shows how he used
the manuscript pages of space

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.750
that he had available
to him, meaning you see

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.320
in the middle there are
these kind of little,

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.310
I don't know what you,

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:28.340
tadpole-like figures upside-down
tadpoles, he just kind

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.300
of made little notations
to himself,

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.740
he didn't write it all out.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.600
But he's backing this up
against other parts of the piece

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.250
and he's just basically,
you know,

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.390
continuing right along he
knows what he has in mind

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.550
and so forth, so
these kinds of usages

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:47.400
of joining sections together
it economizing on paper

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.260
and barreling through in a way
to get his ideas onto the paper.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:55.540
These are all very
indicative of his style.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.700
We find it astonishing
today the number

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.300
of what are considered
masterpieces that he created

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.480
on a steady schedule for the
yearly church calendar some 300

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.050
cantatas plus, of course,
the many larger works.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.280
Actually, it was common for
cantors to write annual cycles

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.980
of 60 works and I read that
Telemann wrote more than 1700

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.090
and Graupner more than 1400,

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.910
both of whom were offered
the Leipzig position before

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.680
Bach actually.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.100
But the level of writing
and musical thinking,

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.240
the mastery of these works
is at a far higher level.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.730
So, let's hear the final
chorale with the doxology

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.610
and then we'll just have
a moment about the ink.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:43.510
Yeah, this is the chorale page.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:51:36.080
[ Music ]

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.140
So, a word about
the preservation

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.540
of the manuscripts
and about the ink.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.300
He used something called iron
gall ink often in this kind

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.090
of an aubergine color, it
has come to that color today.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:54.790
It's a heavy ink with a lot
of tannin an oak substance

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:59.890
from those oak balls that
you see and lots of minerals,

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:03.000
a combination that today is
unfortunately rather deleterious

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.690
to the health of these
manuscripts and we know

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.890
that many, many of
them are deteriorating

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.190
at the Bach Archive too.

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.180
If you know of any Silicon
Valley tech moguls who would

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.520
like to underwrite preservation

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.890
of Bach manuscripts it would be
an extraordinary gesture to try

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:24.890
and find a way to preserve them,
but you can see here at the top

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:28.830
and elsewhere where the ink
is concentrated and blobs are.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:34.310
When you pick up the ink to
write, the minerals apparently,

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.750
the heavier minerals
dripped off under the papers

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.240
so they caused some
of the blobs.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.370
Today, those blobs are literally
eating away the manuscripts.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:46.780
Fortunately, here at the library
we have expert conservators

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.310
in our Conservation Department
who are have been able to work

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:52.990
with these manuscripts,
as you see,

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.210
they are handsomely preserved
and they have done a number

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:59.450
of things to them, for example,
bathing them in a warm bath

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:03.880
of calcium, magnesium,
magnate, yeah magnesium

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.350
and putting rice starch
into the binding and so on.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.710
If they were not preserved

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.840
in the Mylar they probably
couldn't really be viewed

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.460
and other museums and libraries
sometimes put them under glass.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.510
So, we are lucky
that we have these

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.170
that you can actually
turn the pages

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.080
and I encourage you
very much to do

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.130
that when you're
looking at them.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:27.860
It's a privilege to have
these in our collections

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.950
and a privilege to
show them to you today,

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.630
and it makes seeing them with
you, makes me think of a quote

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.580
that I found from a man
named Otto Bettmann,

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.960
"Bach's music sets in
order what life cannot."

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.510
So, please come up
and take a look.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:51.890
