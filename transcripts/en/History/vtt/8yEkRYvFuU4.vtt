00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.380
- What do we got?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.710
Hey.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.000
I have a military
payment certificate.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.540
It's a $20 one.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.040
And they were paid
to military personnel

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.330
to keep the American dollar
out of enemy's hands.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.790
They were produced
around 1940 to 1972.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.830
So how was Vietnam?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.620
[laughter]

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.960
WOMAN: I came down in
the shop today to sell

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.000
a military payment certificate.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.580
It was paid to military
personnel overseas.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.920
My son purchased it
at a coin auction.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.080
I'm hoping to get $250 out of
it for my son to go to a Boy

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.830
Scout trip this summer.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.250
Military payment
certificate for use only

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.040
in the United States
military establishments, $20.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.210
They're pretty cool.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.920
When the US was
fighting overseas,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920
there was a problem
with US soldiers

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.330
trading American dollars
on the black market.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.750
So to stop US
dollars from getting

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.170
in the hands of enemies,
our government actually

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380
came up with temp currency.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.750
This isn't money.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.210
This is a coupon that's
redeemable for currency.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.750
If you're in the army,
you're in Vietnam,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.960
and they hand you this
instead of real money.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.120
OK.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.540
It was an extreme
morale killer.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.040
Most of these guys are
over there in Vietnam,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.540
they didn't want to be there.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.290
They got drafted into
going, they're making just

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.120
a very small amount of money.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.040
And when they go
to get paid they

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.960
get handed some fake coupon
thing that says it's money

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.420
but it's not.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.620
OK

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.120
How much are you
looking to get?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.120
Uh, 250.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.210
250.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.620
OK.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.540
I've seen these go as
high as $2,500, $3,000.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.380
And I'm sure they've
gone for more.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.250
And I've seen them sell for $4.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.710
It's all about condition.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.540
And all this staining
that you see right here,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.330
it really just knocks
the value down.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.250
I'd go like $100.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.750
Can you do $150?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.330
I'll $125.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.580
That's the I'm
going to pay for it.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.000
OK.
Deal.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.920
Deal?
All right.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.290
Meet me over there.
I'll write you up.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.620
OK.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.330
I feel pretty good.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.750
I think my son will enjoy going
to Boy Scout camp this summer.
