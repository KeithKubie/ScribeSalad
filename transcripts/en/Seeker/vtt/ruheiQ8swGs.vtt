00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:08.830
I was going to write an intro just but then
like, I didn’t feel like it, y’know?

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.410
Hey couch potatoes, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.070
Recently we got a viewer question from presumable
dark wizard Voltrius asking if there was a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.530
specific reason why people are lazy.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.340
He said he was looking for an excuse next
time someone leveled that accusation at him.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.530
Well I have great news, Voltrius.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.480
Turns out being lazy is a huge evolutionary
advantage.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.560
Oh sure, “society” may not approve of
laziness.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.370
Inactive and unmotivated people are looked
down upon, while driven workers are held in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.579
high esteem.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.499
But have you ever considered the benefits
of being lazy?

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.350
It turns out lazy is a derogatory word for
efficient.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.530
When we think lazy, we picture people laying
on their couch, but laziness stems from a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.440
desire to be energy efficient.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.019
Evolution programs us to save energy, not
expend it for no reason.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.190
So, to some degree, all people have laziness
built into their behavior.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.839
At least that’s what Max Donelan of Simon
Fraser University is proposing.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.719
He and other researchers designed an experiment
where they had participants walk with a robotic

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.610
exoskeleton on their legs.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.660
If they walked normally, the researchers penalized
them by making it harder for them to move

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.660
their knees.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.000
If they wanted to save some effort, they needed
to get lazy, and adjust how they walked.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.350
That’s a remarkable idea when you think
about it.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.759
Up to this point, these participants had taken
millions and millions of steps over their

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.579
lifetime and had done them all the same way.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.350
Would they really change the way they walked
to save a bit of effort?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.270
It turns out, they absolutely would.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.759
Within minutes, they had adjusted their gait
even though walking normally would only cost

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.320
them just 5% more energy.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.380
So, yes, you are hard wired to be lazy.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.240
If we follow the cliche, necessity is the
mother of invention, then laziness is invention’s

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240
dad.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.229
Sure human beings invented clothes because
we needed to stay warm.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.340
But we certainly don’t need smartphones.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.719
And yet someone who needed money invented
them and got rich because we are lazy enough

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.119
to think it’d be kind of nice to watch a
youtube video when our portable computers

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.030
that already fit on our laps are all the way
across the room.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.219
The problem with laziness is it’s short
sighted.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.039
SittinGIFg around and not exercising feels
great for the moment.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.890
Heart attacks and strokes 40 years later do
not.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.990
Driving somewhere is much faster and easier
than walking.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.940
And because of that we have automobile accidents
and contribute to climate change.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.450
Like anything, Voltrius, there’s a happy
medium.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.410
Yes, you are wired to be lazy.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.000
And yes, being lazy demonstrates how clever
you are.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.500
But if you’re really clever, you’ll know
when it’s time to get off your backside

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.790
and do work.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.350
Speaking of smartphones, it looks like they
could feed your laziness too.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:48.120
Trace explains here.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.360
So with the benefits and costs of laziness
in mind, what’s your stance on lazy people?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.700
Do they infuriate you?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.630
Or are you a member of their noble ranks?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.030
