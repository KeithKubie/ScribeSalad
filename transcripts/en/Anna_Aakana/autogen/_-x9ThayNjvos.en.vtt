00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There comes a time in every girl's life when she wonders

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.800
What would I look like with bangs?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.260
Yeah.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.940
Be adventurous. Be spontaneous.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.600
Just do it.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.260
Just do it.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.130
Just do it.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.860
JUST DO IT!

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.920
Never cut your own bangs!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.020
I learned this lesson

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.560
THREE times.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.840
Lots of regrets you guys.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.300
Don't do it. Just see a professional, phone a friend.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.380
But anyway, I always have this moment.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.760
*gasps*
*non-diegetic twinkles*

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.240
Oh my gosh

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.300
Am I gorgeous?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Which is immediately followed by

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.720
*dramatic sound effects that increases in intensity*

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.240
Obviously these are very conflicting feelings 
and you might wonder

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.820
How could anyone possibly feel 
these two extremes back-to-back?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.479
Well, I had the same question. 
So I did what any one of us would do

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.440
And I was surprised to find this gem of an article.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.680
If you have time, you should read it
because not only is it hilarious

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.780
but it felt like I was reading a play-by-play 
of what I had just gone through then

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.460
and my entire life

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.640
So I was like, oh wow, okay

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.430
Is this just like a normal phenomenon?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.560
So I group texted a bunch of my friends to see if they sometimes felt this way and they all said

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.200
Oh totally

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.459
Goblin to supermodel 
All the time

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.049
My dysmorphia is usually fat and strange-looking
to sexy badass

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.579
I can just hear my mom's voice in my head saying, 
"Girls like us are an acquired taste."

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.509
Oh, I have more I'm a mole person days than 
gorgeous days

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I'm pretty horrible to myself

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.340
Why do we oscillate between these feelings? 
Why do we feel things?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.220
And so I was just like relentlessly searching the internet

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.000
And I found one theory that proposed

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.060
Specifically for women, that I found super fascinating

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.240
Is that we are actually

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.460
More attractive when we're ovulating

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.360
Because of our hormones during this time,
our faces and our voices will actually change

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.440
And reach peak attractiveness to the opposite sex when we are our most fertile.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.240
So next time your friend gets hit on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.540
*whispers*
You're ovulating

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.060
What?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060
You are so fertile right now

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.560
What?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.140
The men can sense that your estradiol levels are high

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.400
Or your progesterone levels are simultaneously low

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.400
Which is late in the follicular phase, 
near ovulation when fertility is highest.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.900
What?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.840
But I'm on hormonal birth control

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000
Which means my body already thinks it's eggo is prego

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.540
So this explanation felt like it didn't apply to the swinging pendulum of perception of my own face

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.419
So after a lot of googling,
I realized it can only be

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.209
Just part of the human experience

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.740
There's no salt for this.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.360
Life is a rollercoaster.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.180
Sometimes you look good. 
Sometimes you look terrible

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.899
Most times

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.280
Ya probably look fine.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.900
Sorry John.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.370
Our reflections are not objective, right?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.060
We're seeing them through the lens of whatever our current mind state is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.540
I'm a monster

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.040
Which fluctuates all the time

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.120
I'm an angel

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.960
So instead of indulging in either

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.380
The arrogance of beauty or the sadness of hideousness

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.880
I ask myself instead,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.040
Hmm. What is going on internally that is making me 
feel this way?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400
And if I feel good, 
and therefore see myself as good, great!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.920
And if I feel terrible and see myself as terrible,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.689
Well, how can I emotionally adjust so that I'm not repulsed by my own reflection?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.520
Puberty was not kind to me

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.319
I'm Anna Akana

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.280
You probably look fine.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.639
Thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's episode

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.539
I am very excited to recommend an 
absolutely remarkable book today

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.313
So I read about 70 books a year

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.800
At least 12 of those are audiobooks

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.000
Sometimes more, depending on LA traffic and how often I'll face my overflowing laundry

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.680
But in 2018, my favorite book
without a doubt was Hank Green's

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.800
'An Absolutely Remarkable Thing'

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.940
It's somehow coming-of-age,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.080
Sci-fi and accurately represents the moral struggles of being a digital personality

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.120
Plus the protagonist is bi

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.660

She interviews real-life couples and its so 
fascinating and educational.
