This session will be all about closures,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.610
also known as lambdas
in other languages.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.010
Closures are an advanced concept
that let developers treat methods

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.500
like any other value.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.860
Sometimes you'll hear closures
referred to as first class citizens or

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.560
first class values.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.140
Let's get started.
