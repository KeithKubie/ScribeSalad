00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
By putting together all of these pieces,
you should be able to create

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.530
a presentation about your prototype for
any audience.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.020
It's important to remember
though that you'll be

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.500
making a lot of these presentations if
you want to become an entrepreneur.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.780
Persistence will be key moving forward,
both in improving your prototype and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.880
in improving your presentation.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.130
The important thing to remember is that
nobody gets everything they need to run

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.200
a business off of their first demo.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.380
And that every time you make a prototype
that gets poor feedback from users or

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.610
a presentation that
doesn't wow your audience,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.460
you're learning more about the task,
and more about how to move forward.
