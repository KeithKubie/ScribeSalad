00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.759
 Whether you're trying to lose 20 pounds (9 kilos), get promoted at work or quit smoking 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.830
 Being committed to your goal is not easy. After all, 45% of people give up 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.469
 New Year's Goals One Month Later. So, why is it difficult to maintain motivation? 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.529
 And how can science help us achieve what we seek? 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.420
 In a study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students were given two kinds of tasks. In the first task they had 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.869
 Press the two keys of the keyboard as much as possible in 4 minutes, and do it faster 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.760
 Will get the money. For some, the prize was $ 300 and others were only $ 30. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 What is interesting is that performance was 95% higher in the top prize group ($ 300), showing how money can be a catalyst. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.180
 But in the second task, the same students were asked to solve a more complex mathematical problem 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.680
 This time, the students who received the highest award were performing slower than students with the lowest prize of 32% 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.280
 This is known as "distraction theory" when we are asked to perform a task 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.050
 Requires the solution of problems or economic pressure or emotional, this causes the shift of focus from the target to the catalyst 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.049
 Which quickly distracts you and reduces your performance as well 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.340
 When we take a look inside the brain, MRI shows that people are completing 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 Challenge just what fun is and the people who complete it for an award show the same activity in the brain 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.130
 But what is interesting is that if we ask who offered them the prize the first time participate 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.179
 Again without an award, the rays indicate a lack of activity in the frontal and frontal lobe regions 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.390
 And are regions of the brain responsible for self-stimulation. It seems that awards can eliminate the normal sense of our fun. 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.759
 So, how does this apply to you? Well, it seems that "fun" is the strongest catalyst 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.219
 For change in sustainable behaviors. It makes sense to complete the fun activities 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.460
 But given that 67% of sports club members do not use, it seems that most of us choose the wrong activities 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.979
 To reach our goals. You can burn a lot of fat on a treadmill, 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.409
 But not if you stop using it after just two weeks. Choose something you really like to do. 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.959
 Your goal itself also matters, in a study to find the reasons for training revealed that those who focus 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.580
 Weight loss training for 32% of those who said they were training to feel better 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.060
 In their daily lives 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 While it is always good to be positive, optimism can not always be 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.010
 The best way. In a study of 210 women trying to quit smoking, the participants just imagined 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 Great success with few consequences were less likely to reduce cigarette consumption. 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 Positive thinking can often fool the brain into thinking that you have already achieved the goal 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.560
 Giving you a sense of victory and reducing your motivation. But that does not mean negative thoughts are good 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.060
 Imagine the goal being achieved, then think about the obstacles that stand in your way 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.100
 Is the best way to think. Which is known as "mental contradiction" 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.840
 Finally, try to avoid the effect of "hell" this behavior was first known 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 When scientists gave some dieters different sizes of milk-flavored syrup - ranging from small to large - 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.120
 Then they gave them ice cream afterwards. It seems that those who got the large size of milk flavored also did 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.190
 Eat a larger amount of ice cream because "the hell I've already ruined my diet I can do what I want now" 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.910
 Doing so will lead to more problems on the road to success 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.010
 Whether the goal is to have fitness, quit smoking or work progress. It will make you soon 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.070
 From turning your goal into reality 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.900
