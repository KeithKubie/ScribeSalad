1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,040
This is Jocko podcast number
one 79 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,100
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
So

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,020
the Spear Danes in days gone by and the
kings who ruled them had courage and

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,920
greatness.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,540
Okay,

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,140
we have heard of those
princes heroic campaigns.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,680
Okay.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,000
There was shield Sheaf,
sin scourge of many tribes,

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,260
a wrecker of mead benches,
rampaging among foes.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,460
This terror of the haul troops had
come far a foundling to start with.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He would flourish later on as his
powers waxed and his worth was proved

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,953
in the end.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,080
Each clan on outlying coasts beyond the
whale road had to yield to him and begin

15
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,540
to pay tribute.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,590
Yeah,

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,740
that was one good king

18
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,790
boom opening with a little bit of Beowulf.

19
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:18,791
And that is the opening of Beowulf
translated by Shamus Haney.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,493
Okay.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,680
And what I notice is even back
in the day in the opening of the,

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,140
the original old English poem,

23
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,900
the first one written, what
are they talking about?

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,310
They're talking about war and
they're talking about leadership.

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,523
Yeah.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,510
And you can hear it in the beginning.
He was a little bit of a weak leader.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,060
He was a foundling to start with,
but he would flourish later on.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,150
Became a good king.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,093
No,

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,880
and that's what happens.
You learn, you get better.

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,720
And that is why we talk about
war and leadership here.

32
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,830
And speaking of war and
leadership back for a third time,

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,810
my brother Jason Gardener,

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,230
retired master chief who I've known
since I got into the James' in the early

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,880
nineties he's been on the podcast before.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So if you haven't listened to one 67
in one 68 go listen to those first.

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,830
There's a lot of ground covered in those
podcasts and I told him to listen in

38
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:24,980
and listen to him again and see which
what we missed so we could go back and

39
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,680
that's, we're going to do
now cover some more ground,

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,240
hit some of that stuff that we
missed. So welcome back Jason.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,760
Thank you. Check. There's I,

42
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,200
when I first got that translation,

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,250
which was actually when I was in
college and it starts off with,

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,370
so I just said, oh my God,

45
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,350
this is totally legit.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,750
So I start things with so a lot now
when I write, I do that. I do that.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,040
So yeah, welcome back. How's
retirement treating you?

48
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,070
Good

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,520
to go. I was going to say
awesome, but I'd be awesome.

50
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,580
Absolutely to death in
the last two podcasts.

51
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,390
So I'm going to try and
ban it into your life.

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,160
Is your southern California childhood
creep out with some awesome? Yes.

53
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,090
Everything is awesome. Yup. Yeah.
So you got to watch out for that.

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,000
So what do we miss? I know we
missed something from your youth.

55
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,030
What were you talking about the
best, the best show you ever saw?

56
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,490
The best punk rock show
you ever saw? Yeah,

57
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,100
there was one that,

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,730
and this is before I could
even drive buddy of mine,

59
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,160
Justin Hawkins and Alicia went up to this,

60
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:38,161
this Gig at Cypress College
and was DUI plain rap,

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,660
the Dickies, the vandals,
the circle jerks.

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,300
And there might've been one other
band for $7 in presale. Yeah.

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,910
So we got presale
tickets. We went up there,

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,600
got in there was probably about 500
people outside who weren't able to get in

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,433
because it's sold out.

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,180
So they just went ahead and knocked
the doors down and all flooded in.

67
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,630
So what that meant was nobody got searched
coming in for security and people had

68
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:15,820
crazy stuff like firecrackers.
It was way overcrowded for,

69
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,120
you know what the safe, safe
amount for the building was.

70
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,430
So when you went up by where the doors
were, the security guys had just put,

71
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,750
pushed all these tables and chairs and
we're sitting on them up against the

72
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:33,670
doors to keep anybody else from coming
in. And the, the show is just unreal.

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,050
There were three mosh pits and then
when the circle jerks came out,

74
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,270
they opened up with wild on the streets.

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,760
The whole floor exploded. One,
the pits started floating,

76
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,200
crashed into another pit.

77
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,810
We're throwing bricks
of firecrackers around.

78
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,940
It was mass pandemonium was so much. And
so you were like 14 or 1515 years old.

79
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:59,200
Yeah. My mom had dropped me
off, dropped us off there.

80
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,280
Oh that's awesome. Good for your mom. Oh
yeah, she's got the squared away, man,

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,850
that's squared away because a lot
of times you pay if your parents,

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,350
if parents try and shield their kids
from that or they won't let them go,

83
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,640
then you would have just snuck out.

84
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,540
They would have never
known where you were Yep.

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,380
And gotten in trouble and you had
rebelled against it. Right? Yeah.

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,610
Cause that's what happens
if you're, if you're,

87
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,620
if your parents trying
to control you too much,

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,060
it's kind of like with any person,
right. You try and control them too much,

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,880
then they get out of control.
They rebel against you. Right.

90
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,080
When was this discussion? I think I
was having the other day with a um,

91
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,860
your daughter about people just trying
to box people in and it's another example

92
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:42,550
of just over centralized
command and yes, it is too much,

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,800
too much stuff like that. They're
just going to go the other way.

94
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,813
I was actually,

95
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,870
I was talking about this with a leader
in a company and I was explaining because

96
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,710
you like for sure money drives
people, compensation drives people.

97
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,070
But ability to choose your fate or
some influence over your fate is,

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,300
is a also very powerful motivator
and incentive for people to follow.

99
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,680
So when you have a look,

100
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,200
like if you have one job where you
make more money but you don't have any

101
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,110
freedom and you don't have any control
over your own fate versus a job where you

102
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,870
get paid less money, but you
have really a lot of autonomy.

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,360
Most people will go with the autonomy.

104
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,970
There are rare people that
don't want any autonomy.

105
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,460
They just pretty much want to get
told, hey, give me my paycheck.

106
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,840
I'll do whatever you tell
me to do, and that's fine.

107
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,890
And that they're not into their
job, but, but a lot of people,

108
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,520
the more autonomy you give
them, the more intuit they are,

109
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,020
the more they enjoy what they're doing.

110
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,560
Whereas if you're just micromanaging
them or a centralized command scenario,

111
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,920
they're not intuit and that's a problem
at the first person you gave the

112
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,940
example, I'd probably exercises. No
initiative whatsoever. Exactly. Exactly.

113
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,070
You know, you have to address that.

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,680
You have to address that when we're
working with the companies that there are

115
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,320
people that they just want
to get their paycheck,

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,710
they're going to punch the clock at four
59 every day. And that's the way it is.

117
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,720
They don't want to get promoted.
They're fine with that.

118
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,650
And so you've got to know, and you know,
my answer to those people always is,

119
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,870
Oh, if you're leading someone
like that, okay, you know what?

120
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,420
You've got to get the most out
of them. Take good care of them,

121
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,450
and they'll do their job well and you
know, you can count on them for that.

122
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,980
So that's fine. There's
nothing wrong with that.

123
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,680
It's just that somebody that does
have higher goals or different goals,

124
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,120
I guess where they want
to break out of that,

125
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,130
then you've got to give them the
opportunity. And those people,

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,430
if you box them in, they're going to
rebel against, you've got to look out,

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,400
there'll be like Jason
Gardener, age 15 with a Mohawk

128
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,863
check check.

129
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,970
So I know one of the other things that
you wanted to talk about a little bit was

130
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,260
a was Scotty words.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,480
That's right. You know,
and just common after,

132
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:44,500
right after Memorial Day, it's
really fitting to discuss him.

133
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,930
Scotty was a good friend of mine. Um,

134
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,980
just a fantastic team guy. He did a,

135
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,050
he did six years in the teams and
then separated in 2005 and he did,

136
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:59,890
what a lot of guys did at the time was
he started contracting overseas because

137
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,920
he wanted to be at that point of friction.

138
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,020
And for Scotty, I don't think
he was ever, ever happier than,

139
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,500
than when he was at that
point of friction. So he
did a bunch of contracting.

140
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,580
He wound up getting hired by the
defense intelligence agency as a,

141
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,590
as a GS position, a full time
position. And then January, uh,

142
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,450
this last January,

143
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,980
he was killed by a suicide bomber
when he was out operating in Syria.

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,190
And I remember when I got the text
message, we were all in a group text that,

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,110
that he'd passed. And I just, man,
it kind of floored me for a second.

146
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,930
But then, you know,

147
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,110
it's like Scotty died doing what
he loved and he was just such,

148
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,430
he was a maniac in the
best sense of the word.

149
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,980
Like the hardest I've ever laughed
in my life is with him. And,

150
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,160
and most people will tell you that
anytime they've had a good belly laugh or

151
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,030
something, he, you know,

152
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,700
it was with Scotty and he had that kind
of contagious smile where you look at

153
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,760
pictures and Seth is a lot like
this. When I look at sets pictures,

154
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,210
he's got that smile that just has that
special thing about it that automatically

155
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,520
makes you use smile. Then you know,

156
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,630
you are not ever going to be the voice
of reason and you are always going to be

157
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,760
a good time and you're a good friend.

158
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,880
And so while there's, there's
remorse that he's not here anymore,

159
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm so fired up that I got to
spend the time with him that I did.

160
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,070
And uh, so anyway,

161
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,020
I mean there you really have it.
He passed, he's from St Louis,

162
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,050
so they had a big funeral form there
and it was at this Catholic Cathedral.

163
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,940
There had to be a thousand people inside
that cathedral and it was raining the

164
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,774
day they had it.

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,100
So the funeral procession from the
cathedral to the military sent a cemetery

166
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,760
where they buried him. I had
to be like at least 30 miles

167
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,920
every Stingel overpass on the freeway,

168
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:15,921
on the drive there had fire trucks
and first responders out on it,

169
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,430
the freeway, they shut the freeway down.

170
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,120
Every exit was stopped by
police officers, which is,

171
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,530
which is pretty pretty Dang
cool. Okay. That's all.

172
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,960
So then when we got off the freeway and
we were driving on the surface streets,

173
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,303
okay.

174
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,620
People,

175
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,620
the people of St Louis just pulled their
cars over and they were standing at

176
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:42,870
attention out in the rain. And so it's,

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,230
it's moving when someone
in uniform does that,

178
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,810
but you almost kind of
expect that out of them.

179
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,140
But when you see like a 30 year old
mother of two and her two like eight year

180
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:55,070
old kid and seven year old kid

181
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,040
standing at attention with
their hands in the heart,

182
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,240
over their hearts in the rain and
it was a cold rain as as he went by.

183
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,074
It's just,

184
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,383
yeah,

185
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,300
it's an, it's an amazing and
humbling experience to, uh,

186
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,540
to see that kind of love and respect
by the people of this country and the

187
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,590
people at St Louis.

188
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,270
Yeah, that's, that's awesome.
I, well, I was at with,

189
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,460
with Chris Kyle's per session going down
to where he was buried and that was a

190
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:33,210
long drive. I want to say it was
a few hours in the entire thing.

191
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:36,270
And again, it was raining. Same thing.
We're in Texas, but it's raining.

192
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,820
And sure enough, I mean there was,

193
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,180
people were aligned the entire way and
I was riding with one other guy and it

194
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,070
was just in, and we were in this massive,

195
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,530
there was a massive procession
of people, but it was just,

196
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,140
I remember sitting there
for a long time and it just,

197
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:55,030
the windshield wipers
just going back and forth.

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,810
We were not talking because
there's nothing to say. You can't,

199
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
you can't put words to that, you know,

200
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:05,281
you can't put words to thousands of
people standing out in the rain with their

201
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,820
hands on their hearts. Just
every bridge, fire trucks,

202
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,350
flags hung up from the ladders
extended. Yeah. This, uh,

203
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,420
the same, same type of feeling that
I had one when I was doing that.

204
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,710
And it definitely makes you
realize that regardless of all the,

205
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,470
what do they say these days,

206
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:31,471
that America is division all this
division that everyone talks about,

207
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,230
there's plenty of people
that, that understand what,

208
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,690
what it takes to keep this
country free. For sure.

209
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,650
Absolutely.

210
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,060
I feel like it's such a small
and maybe vocal minority

211
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,670
that's out there and I
don't think it's on a whole,

212
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,863
I think we're,

213
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,920
we're on even though a lot of us have our
differences and I think we're figuring

214
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:58,921
out how to discuss politics just by
looking at how people discuss stuff on

215
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:04,021
social media and people were dialing
it in and there they're able to have

216
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,330
realistic discussions with each
other without getting too hateful.

217
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,640
And there are some people that
are still figuring that out.

218
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,040
Yeah, for sure. I'll say two
things about that. I was on,

219
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,960
I was on Ben Shapiro's podcast
and you know, Ben was like,

220
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,350
and Ben's a real nice guy. He's,
you know, very nice to me and,

221
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,510
and all that. And he's, you know, he's,
what's pretty cool about him is he's,

222
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,870
he's like got this running list of
everything that he said that's stupid or

223
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:37,160
wrong or whatever, you know, his
mea culpa list. But anyways, yes,

224
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:38,210
we were having this conversation.

225
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:42,260
He was hinting at the fact of this
massive division and you know,

226
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:47,030
these massive, right against a massive
left and, and you know, I said,

227
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:51,800
listen man, I traveled our
whole country all the time.

228
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,400
I work with construction
companies, with finance companies,

229
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,190
with now you do to
insurance companies. I mean,

230
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,580
we meet people from every
different industry. I said,

231
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,840
these people aren't on the extreme,
right? They're not on the extreme left.

232
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,950
Their common sense. They're
Americans. And I said, you Ben, your,

233
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,990
you're like here at, at,

234
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,020
at ground zero for political like mayhem.

235
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,590
And so what do you expect to
see? Like you're, you're the,

236
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:23,510
you're the lightning rod
for a lot of this stuff.

237
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:28,340
And so that's what you hear normal
America in really liked that. You know,

238
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:30,320
it's just not, it's just not,
I'm out there all the time.

239
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,150
You're out there all the time
now, you know, you see it,

240
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,170
no one's coming up to you saying,
you know, with some extreme views,

241
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,230
are there small number of people?
Sure. On both sides, yes, absolutely.

242
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:43,490
But in general people are realizing,
oh well that's not a bad point.

243
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,750
And then I was on Brian Complement's
podcast and we were talking about the same

244
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:51,230
thing. And what's
interesting is, you know, um,

245
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,870
Ben Shapiro's pretty pretty
far on the right and,

246
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,170
and Brian Complement is
pretty far on the left and me,

247
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:00,440
I think they're both really nice
guys that are super cool. And,

248
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,270
but what I said to him was, you
know, w w what you're saying,

249
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,540
what I believe is leading to the attitude
kind of shifting is basically this.

250
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,440
If you're not humble and you
think you know everything,

251
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,970
then why should I listen to anything
that you say, you know, why should,

252
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,020
if I'm on the far left, why
should I listen to anything?

253
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,990
I know everything and everyone on the
right is wrong if I'm on the far right.

254
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,720
Why should I listen to anyone that anyone
say anything that anyone is saying on

255
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,680
the other side, I know everything. If
you're humble and you say, you know what,

256
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,860
I've got some ideas, but
I'm probably not 100% right.

257
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,960
You'll maybe I'm only 98% right? No. If
you just look at other people and say,

258
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,020
Oh, you know what, I probably don't
have the full solution for this.

259
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,340
Maybe I should listen to other people's
opinions and try and try and come up

260
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:50,570
with a a more broad based
idea than just what I think.

261
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,660
So I think people are starting to realize
if you take one extreme view and you

262
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,980
don't listen to anyone
else, then you're wrong.

263
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,150
And so I think people are becoming
a little bit more balanced.

264
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,670
I certainly hope I, yeah,

265
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,520
and, and I know that,
that I've got some really,

266
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,600
really close friends that are
on both ends of the spectrum.

267
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,760
How do I sit down with them and have
a logical conversation with them?

268
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,070
I find out that our values,

269
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,690
yeah.

270
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,120
Are the same. They're the same. Yeah.

271
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,340
And really it's just a
lot of misrepresentation.

272
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,170
And some unfortunate semantic
sometimes that uh, you know,

273
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,320
drawing us to different directions
or put us on different sides

274
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,030
and you know, that's it.

275
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,510
Speaking of the left hand
and the right hand know

276
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,770
this is, you got to tell this
story about, and this is,

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,500
this is a good revealing
story about, I've, I,

278
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I allude to oftentimes the dark sense
of humor in the teams and there's a dark

279
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:00,630
sense of humor in the military and you
kind of have to have a dark sense of

280
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:04,800
humor. And I think, did
you see the movie range 15?

281
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,270
No. Oh, okay. It's, it's about,

282
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,480
it's just a crazy movie
that Tim Kennedy and, and,

283
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,040
and Matt best and the black rifle coffee
company. Yeah. Like all those guys,

284
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,740
they throw the keys to the
girl. Yeah. Yeah. It's just,

285
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,270
it's just every horrible dark
joke that you can make they make.

286
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,340
And I don't know how well it did
or whatever. It did good enough.

287
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,130
It did good enough. I mean, I'm
sure it offended a lot of people.

288
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,260
I'm sure it offended a lot of people,

289
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,750
but they did it so good for
good on them. But you know,

290
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,990
you talk about that, that
kind of dark sense of humor.

291
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,500
And I think this story which you
like called me, I don't know,

292
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,250
whatever it was six months ago or whatever
you go to, I got to tell you a story,

293
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,950
which whenever you call me and
tell me that I get super excited.

294
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:56,400
I tell my kids to leave the room and I'd
like to put you on speaker phone and I

295
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,020
put you on speakerphone and then I mute.

296
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,440
So I don't interrupt you by laughing so
hard because whenever you call me and

297
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,970
tell me you got a good story. I'm
thinking, here we go. So yeah,

298
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:08,490
tell us about the hand. So, and,

299
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,590
and I talked to Aaron Kendall this
morning to make sure I got the details

300
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,053
correct.

301
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,530
So Aaron Kendall's a seal that was working
at the training detachment when I was

302
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:24,330
the command master chief there and
he is on a hunting trip out in Texas,

303
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,360
like a foundation supported hunting trip.

304
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,080
And he's driving one of
those side-by-sides out to
where he's going to hunt like

305
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:37,120
side by side ATV, like an ATV tribe.
Like one of those razors. Right.

306
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,110
And it rolls and it's smack. The
rollbar smashes his left arm.

307
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,710
So he makes a tourniquet out of his belt
and walks like a mile back to the range

308
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,740
house and then they call a,

309
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,530
they tried to call lifelight lifelight
can't come out. It's too foggy.

310
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,930
They get an ambulance comes and gets him.

311
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,340
They start driving him up towards
a, to a hospital at San Antonio.

312
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,800
Now he's in the hospital.

313
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,020
They wind up having to amputate his
left hand in the hospital in this first

314
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,550
hospital. Why is that?

315
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,630
Because it was just completely
smell was so smashed that every,

316
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,560
his arm was just smashed. It was done.

317
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,130
He was losing so much blood through
there and they ended up like,

318
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,050
they kind of had to fight to save the
amputation below his elbow cause they were

319
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,990
worried that because later on in
surgeries they're taking more and more.

320
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,140
So there were a couple of other team
guys that were there and other team guys

321
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,420
flew in to help out.

322
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,860
And they're staying at this hotel right
outside the hospital where he's at.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,940
So they take him from where he was,
they take them to this hospital,

324
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,920
this hospital, and at that hospital
they have to amputate his hand.

325
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,630
So he's bedside talking with the
other, with some other seals.

326
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,680
And they're the surgeon who amputate
his hand is in there checking on him and

327
00:19:55,681 --> 00:20:00,600
they asked the surgeon, hey, do
you guys still have his hand?

328
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,850
And the surgeon says, yeah, I
think so. I don't, you know,

329
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,490
we haven't destroyed. And they asked
him, what are you going to do with it?

330
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,160
And he goes, well, you know, I
guess they destroy it or whatever.

331
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,370
And so Aaron asked,
well, can I have my hand?

332
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,650
And the surgeon says, I'll go check.

333
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,050
So he goes and checks with
the administrators, right?

334
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,290
And they come back and they say, yeah,
you have to fill out these forms,

335
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,890
but we'll give you the hand.
So they fill out the forms,

336
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,890
they give the hand to. Um,

337
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,300
one of the other seals actually
receives a hand cause Aaron now has,

338
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,540
has had to move to a different hospital
that's a little bit better to deal with

339
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,550
the amputations and,

340
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,090
and they've got his hand with the
intent to take it to a taxidermist.

341
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,710
So in the meantime, they're keeping
it in the freezer of the hotel

342
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,693
and

343
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,460
they're taking turns
spending time with Aaron.

344
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,610
So guy will be there at
the hospital with Aaron,

345
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,470
Wally's in the other hospital and other
guys at the hotel and they're flipping

346
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,100
back and forth, which is a
little testament to like, well,

347
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,290
the way it is for team guys are just
looking out for [inaudible] take care of

348
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,730
you. Like you're in the hospital,

349
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,700
want someone's gonna stay with you
24 hours a day. It's awesome. Right?

350
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:18,701
So one of the guys that's back at the
hotel room decides that either he's got to

351
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,480
go somewhere and he wants to put the
hand in the other guy's freezer or he's

352
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,360
gonna play a joke on one of the other
guys and put the hand in his bed.

353
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,730
And so he comes up with these different
Roos to try and get the hotel staff to

354
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:38,030
let him into the room and they're not
having any of it because he looks kind of

355
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:42,230
shady or mean. He's a team guy. So
he, so he's telling him, Oh hey,

356
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,630
you know my friend left his phone
in the room, can I get in there?

357
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,690
And they're like, well no. Or Hey,
well no, actually it wasn't his phone.

358
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:50,280
It was his ID ready to go. Like
all that stuff that, that come,

359
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,280
they're shutting him down cause
he looks like a criminal. Yes.

360
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,930
So then he leaves to go to the
hospital I guess. But they're suspect.

361
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,200
They're suspect the poor may goes in
there and finds a hand in the freezer.

362
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,220
I have a picture of it. It's horrible.

363
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,750
It's all gray and just like
ripped off right there.

364
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,540
So Adam's family style? Yes.

365
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,600
And so they of course call the police.

366
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,470
The police show up and they just
detain every course of course.

367
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,120
And then Aaron's in the hospital and
all the nurses come up and they're like,

368
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,910
hey, all these police are calling
here. They need to talk to you,

369
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:33,350
something about your hand.

370
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,980
So he's got to get on the phone and
explained to the police why his hand is in

371
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:39,780
the thing.

372
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,980
I think they probably validated something
with the doctor too and you know,

373
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,970
calm him down that this wasn't
some kind of murder and a

374
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,690
okay.

375
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,110
Then they kind of settled everything.
They threw everybody out of the motel.

376
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,770
Aaron gave his hand to the
taxidermist. He had a nice,

377
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:59,700
what they call European Mt. Where the
tax and dermis and Texas is awesome.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,420
So they,

379
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,420
they mounted like the skeleton hand is
in this really cool mountain inside glass

380
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,180
all done up for him. And uh,

381
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,783
Aaron just had,

382
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,890
he had the best sense of humor
about the whole thing, you know,

383
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,440
if you're going to get depressed,
I mean losing a limb is,

384
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,450
it is a pretty good
way to do it, you know,

385
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,830
and in a lot of ways he's like some
of the stuff you see out of guys like,

386
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,920
you know, Travis mills where it's just
funny, you're not guys like that. You're,

387
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:34,170
you're not going to bum them out. Just
going to keep them going. But yeah,

388
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,520
hysterical.

389
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,020
So then that's obviously
one of the many stories.

390
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,940
How does that translate to like
when you're dealing with your,

391
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,150
with your family? Like, so
for instance, my wife, when I,

392
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,991
when I had to go to college,

393
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,250
I had to go to the nurse San Diego and
he says my first time in my adult life

394
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:58,460
that I wasn't like in a
platoon. And so I was,

395
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,410
I didn't really think about it,

396
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:04,490
but all of a sudden I didn't have
anyone to like attack verbally all day.

397
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,830
Cause when you're a seal platoon,
it's just constant, you know,

398
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,130
attack and combat, verbal combat,
sometimes physical combat.

399
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,060
And so when I would come home from school,

400
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,650
of course there's my wife and I want
to have some verbal sparring matches.

401
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,790
So I start hacking away at her, you
know, and finally, after three months,

402
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,900
she goes, she goes, she goes, she's
a bright, you know, she, she says,

403
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,270
Hey, I'm not a team guy. You know? And
when she said that to me, I instantly,

404
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,420
I instantly realized exactly
what she was talking about.

405
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,100
And I knew she was 100% right.

406
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,510
I can't treat my wife as if
she's an e five and a seal,

407
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,153
you know? And

408
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,590
especially like the weapons cleaning
table when we're all stuck there cleaning

409
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:50,610
weapons is when guys would
just, that's when the,

410
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,130
you would look for weaknesses in any spot
in any guy and just start, pick, pick,

411
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,780
picking, waiting for the reaction.

412
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,580
Yeah. You spend so much time with
people and so much time just waiting,

413
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:03,280
you know, it's a hurry up and wait
thing. So, oh, what do you want to do on,

414
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,300
on a four hour fan ride? We're
going to destroy someone,

415
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,640
get into a fight, spilled
Cheetos everywhere, you know,

416
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,880
just like total chaos and mayhem. But
yeah, it's all about that. But that,

417
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,850
but I guess what I'm asking
is, I know, you know,

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,530
Iris obviously had to get a,

419
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:28,000
what's the word, indoctrinated into
the life of [inaudible] cause you know,

420
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:32,380
I met my wife when I was pretty
young and you were not that young.

421
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,480
No. And so you, you know, you, how'd
that work out? Like the ideal wife, the,

422
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,420
I don't wanna say ideal on a throw
that on you pour iris, listen to this.

423
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:41,590
But the squared away,

424
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:46,270
let's say that just squared away
spouse was that look like it.

425
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,440
So I gotta go back to,

426
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,060
if you look at my career and you know
this because you said this to her,

427
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:58,200
when did you on the podcast,

428
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:02,850
like she used the best thing that ever
happened to me because she's completely

429
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:07,851
squared away and it's because
she's so solid and independent.

430
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
And so there was never,

431
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:16,401
ever any aspect of me having to worry
about the homefront and there is a

432
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:19,890
constant,

433
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,090
she's like very dialed
in and challenges me.

434
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,290
Like a lot of my,

435
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,850
I had a lot of like pretty
far right political views.

436
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,640
And then when we sit down and
have discussions and stuff,

437
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,900
she's really opened my aperture
up on that. But you know,

438
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,030
you look at her history where she, uh,

439
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,750
she worked on ranches where she was only
female wrangler with a whole bunch of

440
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:49,650
cowboys. So she, she got it.

441
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,340
She had that aspect of what it's,
what it's like to be around.

442
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:56,820
And then around guys and then when I'd
be messing with her like that, you know,

443
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:59,730
she just, same deal as Helen, let me know.

444
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,470
Just put you in check
basically. Yeah. And the,

445
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,693
okay.

446
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,840
You know, this,

447
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,960
this job that we have where we're
constantly going forward in harm's way and

448
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,630
they're there.

449
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,340
I chose my words kind of part a poorly
on the last podcast when I was talking

450
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:23,000
about her, I said that she put up with a
lot of stuff that other women wouldn't.

451
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,140
It meant that that gives the indication
that she tolerated a lot of shenanigans

452
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,400
negative.

453
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,210
She was the strength that she had to
have to be home while I was on combat

454
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:39,770
deployments and then deal
with me when I came back.

455
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,480
That strength.

456
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,320
Yeah.

457
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,910
Most, most women just can't deal
with that kind of lifestyle.

458
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,260
Okay.

459
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,610
And don't have that kind of,

460
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,510
what were the words that you used
on the last podcast she put up with?

461
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:56,020
A lot of times I said, and so that,

462
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:59,690
that was a really poor choice of words
because it indicates like she was just a

463
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:04,590
pushover and she is an absolutely
not a pushover. Yeah. It's

464
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,600
more like she had the strength
to contend with the, the,

465
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,670
the hard life that it is exactly like
being married to some guy that's going on

466
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,000
constant deployment
and isn't around a lot.

467
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,940
And then when they're gone
by the way they might die,

468
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,340
they might come back
horribly wounded, whatever.

469
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,200
And you sign up for that as well.

470
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,920
And she's working long hours
and raising two little kids.

471
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,350
Well, I'm going on six month deployments.

472
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,950
Okay.

473
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,010
Yeah. And then she's, she also

474
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,970
like in, in

475
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,430
I pretty much, I stayed in contact
with her pretty often. So we,

476
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,850
we pretty much talked at
least three times a week,

477
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,750
three times a week on
deployment. And uh, um,

478
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,810
and that's the model that worked for us.

479
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,400
I've described it and I
forget who I described,

480
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:01,420
it tears emotional
independence like my wife had,

481
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,910
has and had enough emotional independence
that she was just going to run the

482
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,290
show. If I'm not there, not freaking
out, you know. And I think that's,

483
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,430
if you're going to look for
a good spouse, they gotta be,

484
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,830
you can't be, they can't
be codependent. Right.

485
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,830
Cota band is actually actually
like a bad thing. Right?

486
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:25,780
I mean that's an an actual bad thing,
right? Codependency. Yeah. So, yeah. So,

487
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,720
but if you go to the other end of the
spectrum or not, maybe, I don't know,

488
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,060
maybe there's, I guess if you
go too far on that spectrum,

489
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,280
then you get to where, hey, I don't
even, Oh, you're gone. I didn't,

490
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,940
I wasn't aware of that. Sorry, I'm over
here doing my own thing. Is there you,

491
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,820
but you've got to find
a good strong balance.

492
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,270
Probably leaning towards
independent, in my opinion,

493
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,070
you've got to be leaning Independent.

494
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,240
Cause if you're not leaning
towards independent, I mean
when you don't get the,

495
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,780
you know, it sucks being here
by yourself for six months.

496
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,470
It's not a true partnership. If, if,

497
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,390
if they're not equal, right.

498
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:59,530
If you're kind of not equal footing and
one person really needs the other one,

499
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,570
um,

500
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,570
then then the partnership at ship
aspect of it is it's not there.

501
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah. That's uh, that's
something to pay attention to.

502
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:18,350
Cause the thing that's kind of weird is
when you're young guys get suckered into

503
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,060
the being, ha, it's,

504
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,690
it feels all empowering to have
someone that's all dependent on you.

505
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,733
You see what I'm saying?

506
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,390
When you're young and you've got the Carl
and she's all dependent on you and the

507
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,310
world revolves around you, and
then when you're not there,

508
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,420
she's falling apart and you feel, oh
yeah, I'm the man. And so it's easy.

509
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,080
I think that I've seen that happen a
lot where guys get suckered into those

510
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:44,200
situations and that's not
a good situation to get.

511
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,050
It never works out because
then they're like, well,

512
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,230
and then she's in a situation,
if it's that kind of girl,

513
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,170
she's going to find someone else to take
care of her while you're not there to

514
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:57,580
take care of her. Um, and then
the case with IRS is like,

515
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,540
we're inside the same box as far as,

516
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,420
uh, just the things that we enjoy, where
we want to be in the outdoors. It's,

517
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,270
it's all the same thing. So, you know,

518
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:13,180
it's like I said in my retirement
ceremony, when I look, look,

519
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:17,080
I look at the trajectory of my career
and then when IRS and I became together,

520
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,010
I went from platoon chief to master
chief first time up every time and just

521
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:28,170
hammered it because she was a good partner
and she drove me to be better and is

522
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,080
always driving me to be better.

523
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,070
It helps to have somebody that's
super squared away like that.

524
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,911
You know what that does?

525
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:42,080
It forces you like you're not dude's
doing it for yourself because it's easy.

526
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,970
It's sometimes easier to
let yourself down, right?

527
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,210
It's easier to let yourself down
than to let down this person that's,

528
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,020
that's looking at you thinking, Hey,
you could do better than that. Come on.

529
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,520
Are you serious right now? And that's
the kind of stuff that you'll say to me.

530
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,950
You know, she's very straight
forward and I'll be cold.

531
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,220
I'll just say check. Got It. And then we,

532
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:07,020
we've gotten to the point where we can
give each other pretty honest feedback

533
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,930
without there being any resentment

534
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,970
involved. I've been pretty
straightforward with iris on some things.

535
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:17,320
We're working on some projects together
and it's pretty cool for me to be able

536
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:21,310
to just be real straightforward with her,
you know? And she's like, no, tell me.

537
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,570
We'll actually know how to, she says it.
She says no, go ahead and tell me. Yup.

538
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:33,400
Jack. So you know, speaking
of Afghanistan, um,

539
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,610
your, you, you, you, you did
the last time you on, you know,

540
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,550
we breezed through Afghanistan pretty
quick. We did. But that was actually, uh,

541
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,290
a really, um,

542
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,560
pretty big deployment in terms
of what you guys did there. Yup.

543
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,020
And I know there were some details that
you wanted to get into on some of those

544
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:00,710
operations and some of the things that
you brought home from those operations,

545
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,680
lessons learned, et Cetera. I mean,

546
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,670
you were talking about one earlier
talking about the mall deuce and bringing

547
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:10,220
them all deuce. That's it. That's it.

548
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,550
That's a good piece of gear
to bring out on an operation.

549
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,750
Yeah. And usually you got it marked
on, mounted on top of a truck.

550
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,190
But uh, um, when we did
that, that operation, uh,

551
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:27,191
as frag o six and a CJ engine and we
actually went into Marsha and the element

552
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:33,761
that I was with was in a blocking position
that was looking down a road that ran

553
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:38,870
east west and we were the furthest east
position so we were locked in position

554
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,040
on, on that direction.

555
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,530
And where we got dropped off was really
close to where we were going to stay for

556
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:48,080
four days. So we were, you know,

557
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,780
we brought him mortar and we brought the,

558
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,420
the m to HB heavy barrel,

559
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,590
50 cal machine gun with the big
a tripod for it and everything.

560
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,540
How'd you break that up? How
many guys would carry that?

561
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,510
That's a lot of weight to carry, man.

562
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,430
You talked to Tim about the ammunition
and the weapon and the tripod. Well,

563
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:11,390
they ammunition got pair dropped into us,
but the initially, the initial insert,

564
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,020
we had an eight ATV on the helicopter
and a lot of that stuff was loaded on the

565
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,201
ATV.

566
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:23,201
Plus we were inserted maybe
200 yards from the position,

567
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,000
so everything was kicked
out of the Hilo got staged.

568
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,450
We went and cleared the building and
then hauled everything over there and set

569
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,290
it up and we'd done all the, you
know, the imagery set up for, okay,

570
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:37,080
here's what we're going to be, here's
where our firing liens, all that.

571
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,110
All that stuff was pretty
much set up ahead of time.

572
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,040
Once you guys were doing that. We
started the guys and trade at that.

573
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,480
We were putting through training, started
doing it, started carrying them in.

574
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,550
There was some big team guy, oh
he just got back from deployment.

575
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,250
I know exactly who you carry the 50 cow.

576
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Like he looked like he was carrying a
60 he did and it was a legit good to

577
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:01,080
watch. His nickname was pig nips.

578
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,640
His nickname was picnic and he's
a beast. I know he's listening.

579
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,480
Good on Ya. That's one of the,
one of my favorite nicknames.

580
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,830
You don't want to have some feature
about you that gets noticed in the days

581
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,050
cause everyone's gonna
call you by some weird day.

582
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,250
And the funny thing
about him is he is super,

583
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,590
he's a big guy and he's super intelligent,

584
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,780
just good good guy
everywhere you measure it.

585
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:28,781
So we set this thing up in a window in,

586
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,740
you know, inside. So just the
barrel was sticking out and uh,

587
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,440
of the compound that we were holding
aiming right down the east West road,

588
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,840
cause our, our biggest fear is a,

589
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,600
a vehicle born IED coming down that road.

590
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,040
And along across that road there was this,

591
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,140
there was like a hedge row and there was
a little irrigation ditch over there.

592
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,800
And so the Taliban kept coming down
that hedge row and firing at us from the

593
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:03,510
trees and then just put
that 50 on the tree line,

594
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,830
stitch it like at Shin level
because that would be Chester,

595
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,540
a little bit high level for somebody in
the ditch and just send up belt all the

596
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,930
way down and back and then
push them back further.

597
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,620
Well at one point some guys had come up
from a different direction and they were

598
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:26,400
getting really, really close in
this treeline, bad guys, bad guys,

599
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:30,840
Taliban guys. And we could not
traverse the gun over far enough.

600
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,000
So we tried to shove it out the
window, it wouldn't go out the window.

601
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:41,001
So me and a EOD warn
officer who was with us,

602
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,670
and then, uh, one of my
[inaudible] who right now he's a,

603
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,710
a troop SCA over at one in the seal
teams drug lifting out and put it in the

604
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,990
street and just started laying it down.

605
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,740
So he got the 50 cows set up in the
street right out in front of our compound.

606
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,840
And for a second there we
were taking heavy fire,

607
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,540
pretty heavy fire, PKM fired,

608
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:09,300
but it was all going a little bit high
and we just kept stitching, stitching,

609
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:14,220
stitching, and then they were
done. They broke contact.

610
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,650
They didn't not like
that big gun. In fact,

611
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,680
the next day it kind of slowed down for
us because they didn't want to come,

612
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,600
you know, they did. They're like,
ah, we'll find a different direction.

613
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,860
Because we were holding, you know,
basically four square blocks.

614
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:32,850
So they started penetrating in
from, from different directions. Uh,

615
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,340
the later on, two days later,

616
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,740
guys pushed out to another building that
was about a hundred yards in front of

617
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,950
the position and they got
into a little tick up there.

618
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:48,951
So we started lighting up the area that
we thought they were taking fire from.

619
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,363
And the 50,

620
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,490
cal was so loud that they thought that
they were taking direct fire from the 50

621
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,873
cow when we were shooting.

622
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,330
So the rounds passing by them and the
rounds passing by them are so loud and

623
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:03,070
knocking dust off the wall.

624
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,760
That's why I was saying I can't even
imagine what it would be like to be in a

625
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:08,660
building in, you know,

626
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,650
that one situation that Tony was in
where there's so much light and you're

627
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:16,120
building up with several hundred rounds?
No, the, the brew blue situation,

628
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:20,740
those guys put a 150 rounds into 150
rounds and 50 cal from Todd or no,

629
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,960
20 meters away. I mean from the corner.

630
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,960
It was a building on the corner and they
stopped in the corner and just shot.

631
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,940
And those guys coming out of that building
after we got the thing under control,

632
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,870
I mean I kicked open the door,
I saw Tony there and and then,

633
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:39,250
but and Tony looked pretty much
just like normal Tony. Yeah.

634
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,750
Everyone else in that building look like
they just saw death and they actually

635
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:48,310
just did see death. I mean they're in a
building, they get 150 rounds of 50 cal.

636
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,730
The guy that was on the roof,
he was, he, he was telling me,

637
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,040
he would tell me this like a year ago
like we were just talking about and he

638
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,060
goes, he goes, yeah, I got out my pistol.

639
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:59,560
I 100% thought that we were going to
get over Ron and I was going to die if I

640
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:04,120
didn't just take around through the
concrete into my head. Right. Yeah.

641
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,230
So did they know it was blue and blue
or they think that I'm just getting

642
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:10,810
hammered by, well one of the, one of the,

643
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,880
one of the many little like
components of this. So that guy,

644
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,330
the guy that was on the rooftop that
I was talking to [inaudible] 12 hours

645
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:24,331
before he was in another position
and he got lit up with a disco,

646
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,490
a 12.7 millimeter, you know, weapon,
which is the Soviet equipment of a 50 cal.

647
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:34,420
For those of you that don't know, he
got lit up with that and hit with RPGs.

648
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,960
So he said, I remember him as soon as
you know, as soon as this was all over,

649
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:41,200
we got back to base. He, he,
that's another thing he told me,

650
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:44,440
but he told me this way back
then. He said, he said to himself,

651
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,330
I can't believe the guy with the
dish guy found me again. He was so,

652
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,430
he was so, and we were only, you know,

653
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:56,230
a couple of days deployed and that
same guy. So when he got lit up,

654
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,160
he was in, he was in,

655
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,570
he was on Camp Corregidor in an Overwatch
position looking for ID and places.

656
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,970
He's sitting there on his sniper rifle
and all of a sudden he starts taking

657
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,610
machine gunfire and it's a dish cup.

658
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,160
And then he gets hit with a couple RPGs.

659
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,800
Well I'm inside with the company
commander from, from the,

660
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,690
from one of the companies from
the first and five oh six.

661
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,430
And we were planning an operation
that we're doing the next day.

662
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,290
So we start hearing gunfire and
all of a sudden we hear RPGs, boom,

663
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:30,940
boom. And I said to him,
the machine gun fire starts.

664
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,550
And he goes, oh listen. I was like,
where a contact. And I go, hey,

665
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:37,640
my snipers are up there. Don't worry
about it. Like just Jocko the bad-ass,

666
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,280
right. And all of a sudden boom,
boom. So we hear the RPG set.

667
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:47,470
So we go running outside and
um, I'm still just, I say,

668
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,410
hey, don't worry, my
guy's got this end. Right.

669
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:55,180
As those words are coming out of
the bottom of the sniper tower,

670
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,070
cause we, we were right next to it,

671
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,650
out of the bottom of the
sniper towel out pores.

672
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,700
That guy who I'm sure will
be on the podcast one day
he comes pouring out of the

673
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,380
tower, his, his weapon,

674
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:09,580
his sniper gun had been blown like
the stock up blown off bro by the RPG.

675
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,570
And He's, he just looks like, oh
my God. You know what I said? Okay,

676
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:18,520
well maybe not. It was horrible. But
so that's the guy when they're getting,

677
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,060
when they're getting shot up with
50 cal. Yeah. He just thought,

678
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:24,010
and the rest of the guys do, cause
everyone knew that this had happened.

679
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,970
Know we briefed it. Hey, hey, just
imagine the PLO going out to this.

680
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm saying, hey guys, these guys have
disc, a 12.7 millimeter, you know,

681
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,880
anti aircraft gun out there.

682
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,200
So be ready for some significant
heavy weapons. And sure enough,

683
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,690
that's the guy on the
rooftop thinking to himself,

684
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:45,770
I can't believe this guy with the
disco founding again. Yeah man.

685
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,630
The end.

686
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,980
And that was one of the big lessons
learned when I got to trade at where guys

687
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:56,270
would put 50 rounds of 50 cow into
a building with blanks, you know,

688
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:58,020
simulating combat and,

689
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,710
and then we'd have a trade that guy in
there that would get up and shoot someone

690
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,540
and they'd be like,
that's bullshit. You know,

691
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:06,260
the guy that that would never happen.
And I'm like, Oh yes, it would happen.

692
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,850
You know, you, we had guys survive
25 millimeter chain gun from,

693
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,410
from Bradley's and still stumble out
of, you know, not friendlies. Not, not,

694
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,390
not for me, but, but uh, you know,

695
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:21,710
there was enemy that made it out
of buildings that had whatever,

696
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,850
however many rounds,

697
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,050
a bunch of 25 millimeter chain gun
rounds coming out of the building.

698
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,150
They were coming and going into
your building and they'd still live.

699
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,780
So you don't know what's gonna
happen with bullets, you know,

700
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,350
you just don't know. It's
hard to tell. And that, yeah,

701
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,810
frustration in the blame casting
that goes on some of that training.

702
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,290
We'll get into that that later. But man,

703
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Gosh that that 50 cal is
such a bad ass weapon.

704
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,270
Yeah. Period. And then, you know,

705
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:57,130
later on we had those things
mount on our trucks and uh,

706
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,420
the clearance of Mozel guys were Stopping
v bids that are completely armored

707
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,180
with those things. Just hammering on him.
But then it's on a crows remote system

708
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,500
and what does a number,
that's just a beautiful thing.

709
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,800
It's incredible that that gun was made
in the early 19 hundreds. Yeah, yeah.

710
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,230
For sure. John Browning. Yeah.
That's an incredible weapon.

711
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,970
Use the exact same weapon today. That's
amazing. That's a feat of engineering.

712
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,330
Someone was asking me when I posted, uh,

713
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,680
pictures of all the brass all over the
floor of that room on, on Instagram.

714
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:34,750
They're like, oh, did
you have any jams? Oh,

715
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:38,860
we know how to set our head space and
timing. Got The gauge right there on it.

716
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,890
Boom. That's it. That's an awesome
weapon. Now another way, you know what,

717
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,850
you were telling me another one
about getting extracted in like a,

718
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,930
like a, like, like a Russian, like hip 17.

719
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,730
So the, um, we went into this
operation in Zari parents way,

720
00:43:57,731 --> 00:43:58,570
which is a really,

721
00:43:58,571 --> 00:44:03,571
really hot area and we didn't like to
drive anywhere because Afghanistan's

722
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,240
limited, you know,

723
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,650
it's limited roads and so
they're IED threat was huge.

724
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:15,490
Plus there were culverts everywhere,
so they would just pack all the,

725
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,370
a covert full of explosives and it
could blow up like, you know, to me,

726
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:25,120
uh, amwraps would kill
everybody that, and uh,

727
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,740
so we didn't have helicopter
support for this one operation,

728
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:34,741
but we were working with the DEA fast
teams and they had their own Hilo support

729
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:39,090
and they had these [inaudible] which are
these, you know, Russian helicopters,

730
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:44,230
which are super durable
helicopters and uh,

731
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,870
um, contracted, you know, American pilots
in them obviously. Okay, that's cool.

732
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,530
And so they had this operation
and they're like, hey,

733
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,590
you guys want to go on it
with us? So we're, you know,

734
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,610
we're the main force on that. And it
was during one of our turnover ops.

735
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,600
It was actually the op after
the, the a when Dan lost his leg.

736
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,960
So we did to two and uh,

737
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,170
get dropped off first
thing in the morning,

738
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,790
go in clear to compounds and we found
a whole bunch of a on that there were

739
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,880
fields and fields of marijuana around
here. And then on that operation,

740
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,990
one of the compounds just
had a whole bunch of Hash,

741
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,310
was like huge burlap sacks of,

742
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,590
of Hash. And I think,

743
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,460
I think they said there was 200 pounds
and in the middle they destroyed it.

744
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,840
And so it was the typical thing that
happened. Women and children left.

745
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,660
Fighters came in and then
we were in, you know,

746
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,240
a three 60 firefight and

747
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,730
we're in the firefight and over
the radio we're hearing from,

748
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,270
from our aircraft overhead,
they're saying, hey,

749
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:56,100
there's a white van

750
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,243
and

751
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,050
it's dropping fighters off
around you. So this white,

752
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,840
this white minivan is driving off,

753
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,940
picking up fighters and then driving a
big circle around us and dropping off

754
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:10,774
fighters.

755
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:17,130
So this is like an hour later
firefights that thing I did the story.

756
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,610
So about an hour later
there's, they're like, hey,

757
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,370
the white coming over because I'm a,

758
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,780
I'm on dual calm so I can
hear on the fires net and,

759
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,850
and that's like the other radio frequency
outside of inner squad comms for

760
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:31,180
those,

761
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,090
if you don't understand that is just this
one where the aircraft are talking and

762
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,940
when we're where we're all talking and
I'm on both of them and I can hear the

763
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:40,090
aircraft saying that white van is back.

764
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,480
And so all of a sudden I'm
looking straight north at
200 yards and I see a white

765
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:52,780
van pull into the open and stop
in, you know, in an alleyway.

766
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,260
So get on the radio.

767
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,360
Where's that white van
and is it directly north?

768
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:03,890
Our position and the aircraft comes
back. Yeah, I had just dropped off.

769
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:06,050
Two guys in there stop. They're
looking at you right now.

770
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:10,400
Crack that crack two rounds and then a
60 gunner just moes the thing down and

771
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,490
they're just done through, well,

772
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,400
firefight just kept going.

773
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,150
Now the MRI seventeens
they can't fly after dark.

774
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,040
They didn't have some
kind of certification,

775
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:27,250
so they had to come in there and do a
hot extract on that LZ to get us off.

776
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,020
So there's, there's bullets
flying all over the place.

777
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,170
We get stacked to set our breakout,

778
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,590
so everyone's kind of broken down from
their position. We slept security,

779
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,840
they're there setting up the LZ.

780
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,170
And then my job as the senior enlisted
guy on my aircraft was I run out,

781
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:51,610
I'm the first guy to the aircraft and
I count guys getting on and on the last

782
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:52,750
guy on that aircraft.

783
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,760
So that aircraft isn't going until I
have whatever number of people getting on

784
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,110
it, getting on it, everybody's piling
on there. I got a full head count.

785
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm like, I got a full head count
and there's no seats for me.

786
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,930
So I gotta hop on the ramp and hook
an arm through one of the guy's legs.

787
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,630
My feet are dangling off
the ramp as we take off.

788
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,170
And then I'm shooting just half ass from
the hip because it's fun just for John,

789
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:24,940
the qual, just for the call of the
apocalypse and now qual at at a,

790
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:27,700
you know, a place we were
taking fire from as we took off.

791
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:31,090
And then we got out of there.
That was a, it was a lot of fun.

792
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,060
I going to stop short of saying as awesome
cause I'm not going to use that word

793
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,960
anymore, but it was pretty Dang awesome
right there. That's the consequences.

794
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,790
Yeah, it was.

795
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,850
They no one got hurt. No one got
wounded. Not In that one. Nope. Amazing.

796
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,381
Like you said,

797
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:51,381
all these bullets are flying around and
it's just incredible because just the

798
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:52,824
laws of chance.

799
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,270
Yeah. Well those aircraft
too, you know, it's like, um,

800
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,490
those old school aircraft, like when
you read about the Vietnam guys,

801
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,810
and I'm reading a book right now, those
aircraft, they were flying these kings,

802
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,111
they were,

803
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:10,111
they had a Vietnamese pilots in these
king B Aircrafts and those things,

804
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,420
they, the guy came back from one
off, they had 48 holes in it,

805
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,110
been shot 48 times. And,

806
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,650
and this American SF guys looking at
the aircraft and if he's looking at the

807
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:26,500
pilot he's getting in like you were
and he gets in and he's looking at this

808
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,250
Vietnamese pilot and the
Vietnamese pilot looks cool.

809
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,070
He's just like Roger and I've
got to use a great quote.

810
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,380
The guy says something along
the lines of when I'm flying,

811
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,900
I'm just thinking about flying.
I'm not thinking about bad guys,

812
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:41,200
I'm not thinking about bullets, I'm
just flying my aircraft. If it's my day,

813
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:46,090
it's my day period and the story. But
that coming into hot extract like that,

814
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,840
that's catch and those guys, they,

815
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,910
they come in super fast
and super low speeds,

816
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,240
speeds on their side and
it is sketchy. It's a,

817
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,990
I was in a random Russian
aircraft helicopter.

818
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,500
A hip or what are you, am
I 17 I guess the, the, the,

819
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:05,560
the NATO term is like a hip. But yeah,

820
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:07,710
I was in Africa working and,

821
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,840
and that's like we needed to get somewhere
and the only thing they could get us

822
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,620
was he contracted contracted
helicopters but there was,

823
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,390
but it was contracted pilots too.

824
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,660
And I was happy to land on that one.

825
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,260
Those are a pretty common side
over there in Afghanistan.

826
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:28,010
A lot of the other other
agencies using those.

827
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,980
And somebody had told me, and I
don't know if this is true or not,

828
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,430
that they were, they were so inexpensive,

829
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,710
it wasn't worth doing
the maintenance on them.

830
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:38,300
So when they got to a
maintenance schedule,

831
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:43,130
they just destroy it and buy
another one. That's crazy. Yeah.

832
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,770
And I don't know if that's true. You know,

833
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,320
that's something I heard from some
guy over at the Chow Hall who yeah,

834
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,500
who was well informed apparently.

835
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:57,530
But those pilots were so,
so good and they, you know,

836
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,180
they were all probably ex TF,

837
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:04,181
one 60 guys that were now hired on by
these other guys that do the job over

838
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,720
there. I was incredible. So speaking of
wounded or in that case, not willing to,

839
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:10,670
but you were telling me a story about, um,

840
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,640
and I cut you off so you
didn't tell it to me.

841
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,800
You were telling me a story about a
Taliban guy getting shot in the leg. Yeah.

842
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:23,600
So last time I was telling you the story
about the last time I was telling you

843
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:24,770
the story about the uh,

844
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,660
the operation where we'd set
pop flares out cause guys were,

845
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,870
were able to get so close to
us and during that firefight,

846
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:40,390
one of our firing positions up on a
roof, they're like, hey there was,

847
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,340
there was someone that had circled
around kind of behind our position and we

848
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:45,010
weren't taking any fire
form. They were in, in,

849
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,300
in the process of trying to
flank us and they're like,

850
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:50,540
hey there's a guy back here and
we just shot him. We killed him.

851
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,460
So stuff calmed down and I talked
to the t u commander. I'm like,

852
00:51:55,461 --> 00:52:00,200
Hey I'm going to press out with these
two guys cause it appeared as if it was

853
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:04,310
like right around the corner around this
wall and we're going to go see if the

854
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:06,500
guy's got a radio on him
or anything like that.

855
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,230
So we push out of the compound and we
loop around a wall but it's not just one

856
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:15,530
wall, it's several walls and we
get a little bit farther away.

857
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,580
So we round the corner where the guy's
supposed to be and there's no dead guy at

858
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:20,180
all,

859
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,180
but there's a guy standing 30 yards
away on a hill and he shooting at me.

860
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,920
So I have got, I'm patrolling
with my scar heavy,

861
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:34,670
but I folded the buttstock like a dummy.

862
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,100
And because I, you know, I thought that
was a cool way to patrol. And so now

863
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,900
I'm like, oh no, I can't
shoulder my, my scar.

864
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:49,100
So I just tried to lock it
out on like five ks. Yes.

865
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,770
Lot Punch it out, dude. Just punch
it, squeezed at him, missed him.

866
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,610
And then it had a stove,
pipe and a g a fee jam.

867
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:03,611
So I just took a knee and
started to reload and then
cleared the jam real quick.

868
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,070
Started shooting again, but
he was gone. And then, uh,

869
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,990
he turned up again when, uh, when we had,

870
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,780
when we went to do our
extract the following day,

871
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:18,990
we had to clear a couple
buildings near where, uh, uh,

872
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,150
the Hilos were going to land.

873
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,230
And then we found that same guy
with his leg all bandaged up.

874
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,030
They, they didn't kill them.
They just shot him in the leg

875
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,340
and then we just wound up,
you know, leaving him there.

876
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,130
W so like,

877
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,650
so was that the last time you patrolled
with your scar or have you with the

878
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:42,450
stock folded it and then, you
know, on another op it was, it,

879
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,230
I learned the lesson of never taken off
my body armor and helmet because it was

880
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:51,030
hot. Yeah. What happened on
that one? Oh my goodness.

881
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,520
So we were, um,

882
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,490
it was a operation Swally caught where
we'd taken high ground above a couple of

883
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:02,820
compounds that we'd cleared and

884
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,990
the next day the towel, we,

885
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:10,440
we'd gotten to the point
right where we had,

886
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,650
we'd started to get a little
bit complacent and all
our engagements with the

887
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:20,580
Taliban, we'd always had the upper hand
against them. We'd a, uh, completely,

888
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,370
we had air power, we had better
weapons, we were trained better. Yup.

889
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,500
And on this operation we had a, uh,

890
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,730
a piece of high ground right
behind the compounds that we took.

891
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,250
Was everyone wearing, was that
when you use an AA cogs on their,

892
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:39,390
on their scars generally, or what were
they using guys? W variety of a cogs.

893
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,880
The snipers actually took the,

894
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:43,830
the scopes off their Sr 20
fives and put them on the, uh,

895
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:48,330
the scar everyone had basically
everyone had scopes and so lots of them.

896
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:51,480
And we had 300 s winmac sniper
rifles. So we brought along on this,

897
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,750
I'm just thinking mentally from the
viewpoint of where the enemy's at.

898
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,460
Like you're reaching out and
touching them accurately,

899
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,550
way further than they can
get you. Pretty much, which,

900
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,430
which again will leans towards
you thinking to yourself,

901
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,740
we're going to kick these
guys ass every time. Yup.

902
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,290
And then you did kicked
your ass a bunch of times.

903
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,270
And so then these guys start to take on
high ground all around all our positions

904
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,960
and we can see a guy pushing out
with a PKM onto this flat ledge,

905
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:19,351
a rock.

906
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:24,351
He's 1100 yards away and we're
shooting at him with a 300 wind magnet.

907
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,320
It's windy and we're missing,
we're missing clothes.

908
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,620
And he'd go back and then come
back out, go back, come back out.

909
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,750
And they were getting set up all around
us and then they just brought it.

910
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,480
They let us go with a salvo of uh, um,

911
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,430
rocket propelled grenade grenades
and then just steady PKM fire.

912
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,640
And we thought there 300 yards out,
they really can't do that much. Oh it's,

913
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,790
you know, 105 degrees out.

914
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:58,791
So we'll take our body armor and helmets
off and then they just laid the hammer

915
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:02,220
down. Luckily for me,

916
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,680
I happened to be right on top of my
body, arm and helmet cause I was in,

917
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,540
in the prone position and then I just
was able to snake into my body on my,

918
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,010
get my helmet back on my
head. And you know, in this,

919
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,730
this is a position where this is the
first time we'd been somewhere where we

920
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:18,880
couldn't feel sand back.

921
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:23,881
So we just stacked a bunch of rocks as
best we could to a fighting position.

922
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,880
And the bullets were just
steadily hammering the rocks
and hammering the rocks

923
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:30,460
and hammering the rocks. And
I was thinking, man, alive,

924
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:35,260
I'm going to get shot. And I
wonder if it's going to hurt,

925
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,850
but it's definitely going to happen.
The odds are odds are there and

926
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,570
somehow I didn't. And then a,

927
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,030
then B, a, B,

928
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,450
one bomber came on station and dropped
a whole bunch of ordinance and laid the

929
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:51,770
hammer down. But after that,
and I ran out of water,

930
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,790
we all ran out of water up on this
high ground position. It was like 112,

931
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,840
14 degrees at two in the afternoon we
ran under water and there was no getting

932
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:03,800
any water until uh, that
night when the sun went down.

933
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,130
Did you listen to that podcast with
Ron Sugar on? I'm sure I did. Yeah.

934
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,190
SF Guy. A medal of honor recipient.

935
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:15,320
But if you go watch the
videos. Oh, that, yeah. Yeah.

936
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,950
The like the castle that
they're attacking. That's
crazy. Just straight up hill.

937
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,780
I was just, I couldn't believe that I,
I, when I, when I, as I was reading,

938
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,950
like I was reading a bunch of articles
about this situation and then they kept

939
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:32,220
talking about video and I said, okay,
I'll check out youtube. And I saw it back.

940
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,620
I couldn't believe it. I couldn't
believe it in the way he described it.

941
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,700
It was just incredible. He just laid it
out there. He's like, Oh yeah, you know?

942
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:46,170
Yeah, he's so understated.
He's like, well, you know,

943
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,450
it was a little bit of a hill and there
was a pretty big building [inaudible] it

944
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:52,770
was a cliff and there was a
castle on top of the cliff. Now

945
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,910
if we get a awesome guy, you don't.

946
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,730
Other things that we were
talking about and you made,

947
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,680
obviously this is good
leaving Afghanistan,

948
00:58:01,681 --> 00:58:04,110
but it's getting back early
in your career when you were,

949
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:10,670
when you failed the stocking section of
sniper school and then you went back and

950
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:15,320
you and you, you obviously made
it through, you pass us the,

951
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,650
the stocking section. And you kind of
touched on it when you were on last time,

952
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:24,651
but I was wondering like a little bit
more granularity on what you changed that

953
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,910
you went from failing the
stocks to alright, here's,

954
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,640
here's me knocking out
whatever. A 10 yeah.

955
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,700
And it comes down to basically doing what
I'd been taught [inaudible] and people

956
00:58:38,941 --> 00:58:43,770
were telling me is that
you start the stock,

957
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,770
you're told to find the oop, which
is, you know, 1200 yards away.

958
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,040
And the first thing you've got to do is
figure out where that o p obser and o p

959
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:57,770
is an observation point and that's where
the the guys that are grading you on

960
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:01,520
the stock, who are other sniper
instructors, that's where they're at.

961
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,570
And you take that this model,

962
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,460
and I was just thinking how it applies
to problem solving basically across the

963
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:11,810
board where,

964
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,793
okay,

965
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:19,390
I need to find a goal in my future here
somewhere. In this case it's the stock.

966
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,660
And then before start executing
on moving toward that,

967
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,470
that goal, going to find that, oop,

968
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:32,510
I need to take some time and
study the terrain and see what my,

969
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,120
you know, line of attack
is going to be in hell.

970
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:39,740
I'm going to move all the way up to
where to where I'm going to go and then I

971
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:43,190
need to put it into action. And
while I'm putting an action,

972
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:48,191
I'm constantly reassessing that goal
and adjusting my actions across the way.

973
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:53,450
And that when I went from that
model, I went from, you know,

974
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:56,840
failing stocks to being
the first one done,

975
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,470
hardly spending any time on
my belly and doing that. So

976
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,360
then you take that and
you apply it to life.

977
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,750
And do you think about just
goal setting? Where do,

978
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:13,751
where do I want to be in five
years and identify it and then say,

979
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:18,080
okay, do a little research,
how do I get there?

980
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,260
And then get on that damn path,

981
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,940
stay disciplined and then just keep the
eye on the target and keep adjusting

982
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:28,760
your aim as you go.

983
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,900
And I can look back at times in my life
where really I wasn't paying attention.

984
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:37,100
I'm really just treading water, you
know, living paycheck to paycheck,

985
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,100
doing whatever. And now you know, I take,

986
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,160
take that model and I apply it to
where do I want to be in five years,

987
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,270
where all I want my kids to be,

988
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,820
what kind of parent do I want to
be and how am I going to get there?

989
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:53,400
And what's the path I'm
going to lay out for you?

990
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,920
And this is from a leadership perspective.

991
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:59,440
Obviously this applies because from
a leadership perspective, if you're,

992
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,100
and I was just on Peter t as a podcast
and we were talking about a little bit

993
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:06,860
about that strategic
framework, tactical, right?

994
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,390
And listening to that this morning hand,

995
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,540
and you know what I said to him where it
first started to occur to me that was,

996
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:18,680
hey, if my guys don't know what it
is that we're trying to accomplish,

997
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,250
they can't make it. They can't, they can't
move in there. Sure, I can tell them,

998
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:25,880
move eight yards forward and then
they can't hear me anymore. Now what?

999
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:27,970
They're going to wait for me to
get wherever they are. I can say,

1000
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,440
go take that building right there.
Well now they can't hear me any more.

1001
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:31,041
So now what are they gonna do?

1002
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,900
They're gonna sit there and wait for me
to come up and tell them to do something

1003
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:35,690
else. No, they need to know what
we're trying to get accomplished.

1004
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,130
And then they need to have this,

1005
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,110
the standard operating
procedures down well enough.

1006
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:41,330
So they end the parameters that
they're allowed to maneuver within.

1007
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,670
And that allows us to actually
accomplish the mission.

1008
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,630
And that's something I think I, I mean
I don't even know when I learned that,

1009
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:52,730
but without that strategic objective,
and that's a strong word. Okay, I get it.

1010
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,750
I get strategic. I get what it means,
and I'm not talking about you know,

1011
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,550
global warfare,

1012
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,640
but when you're in a town and you
have a mission objective that,

1013
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:06,950
okay, we're going to get to this building
or we're going to move to this area,

1014
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,160
or we're going to take this piece
of terrain and everybody knows that.

1015
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,190
And even when those things
change, because as you know,

1016
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,240
you get into a contact or you get into
a situation where you change what you're

1017
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:20,460
doing. You have to let know that, hey,

1018
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,100
we're breaking contact, we're
getting out of here. Hey,

1019
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:26,820
we're going to strongly in this building
or whatever. Once everybody knows that,

1020
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,420
then they can act on it. Then
they can carry it out. Same,

1021
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:33,390
same thing that w of what you're talking
about. They're now on a bigger picture.

1022
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,570
Of course it still applies on a bigger
picture of if your troops in the field

1023
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:39,540
don't know what it is you're trying to
achieve, then they make bad decisions.

1024
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,080
If they don't know that you're
trying to protect the populace,

1025
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:44,940
if they don't know that
that's a broad strategy,

1026
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,780
then they get out there and treat
the populace. They act like idiots.

1027
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,480
If they know that's what they're
trying to do, then they make better.

1028
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,760
I'm not saying they make perfect
decisions because they don't,

1029
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,630
but they'll make better decisions
because they understand what that broad

1030
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:00,690
strategy is and it's certainly the same
thing in business and with business that

1031
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:04,950
goes back and forth too because business
sometimes in business your, you know,

1032
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,890
I run into it with businesses
where there, for instance,

1033
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,920
trying to go public so they need
to make money every quarter.

1034
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,670
They can just show that profitability
increase and so the biggest thing they got

1035
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:19,671
on their mind is trying to show a good
quarter and they'll sacrifice some

1036
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:22,680
strategic things like the sacrifice,

1037
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:26,940
a little bit of taking care of a customer
because they want to scrape a little

1038
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:31,080
more money out of it, out of the
situation. That's a bad strategic play,

1039
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:34,600
but they do it short term at the time
because they know they've got to make more

1040
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
in the quarter so they can
come back and reinvest more so,

1041
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,980
but everybody's got to know that
because if everyone thinks, hey, hey,

1042
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:44,400
the number one thing is we never let
our customers down. Okay, guess what?

1043
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:47,880
We lost money this quarter. Now we,
now we can't go public because we,

1044
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,780
and again, this is really a
kindergarten level examples,

1045
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,750
but that's the kind of thing
where what you're talking about,

1046
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:58,650
if people don't understand
what that longer term goal is,

1047
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,490
then they can't really operate and
function on their own, which is a problem.

1048
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,550
No, you're not thinking longterm.

1049
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:10,470
You're just thinking day
to day basically. Yeah.

1050
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:15,510
I kind of went off at the muster
on that one kid that asked me,

1051
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,130
how often are you thinking strategically
and how often are you thinking

1052
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:24,660
tactically? And you know, I just kind
of was going off about, look man,

1053
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:28,260
every single thing I do is strategic.
I'm not making any tactical moves.

1054
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,320
I'm not, I'm not worried about
the tactical wins and losses. Now,

1055
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:32,130
there's a reason for that.

1056
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,220
I'm in a good spot right
now where a little tactical
loss doesn't mean that much

1057
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:36,000
to me right now.

1058
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,020
And it's really easy for me to just
focus on the strategic stuff. You know,

1059
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:42,840
when I was younger I had to focus more
on some tactical things. You know,

1060
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:46,590
that's the way it is. But
even as a young person,

1061
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,920
you got to keep that straight. You know,
you might have to take some tactical,

1062
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,371
you might have to,

1063
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:53,070
you might have to make some adjustments
and wind some short torn battles just

1064
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,870
cause that's the way it is. But you
should be thinking tactics all the time.

1065
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,610
Or sorry, you should be
thinking strategy all the time.

1066
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:02,420
You should be thinking long
game all the time. All the time.

1067
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,990
Thinking about the long game all the time,

1068
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,030
thinking about how was this decision
affect where I'm going to be in the long

1069
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,840
term because the short term decisions,
those are the ones that beat you down.

1070
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:18,610
Yeah. I've turned on that long game nested
inside that longterm goal, you know,

1071
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,290
strategy. Yeah. Yeah. I, I actually kind
of appreciated that he brought that up.

1072
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,830
Oh totally. It was a
good question. He was at,

1073
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,590
and he was a younger guy and you
could see he's thinking, you know,

1074
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,280
he'd probably, he probably
thought to himself, hey,

1075
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:34,060
it seems like Jocko keeps
talking about the long game.

1076
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,060
And he thought to himself, how
often is Jocko thinking about that?

1077
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,360
And so he asked the question
good on him. So I could explain.

1078
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,060
I'm thinking about it all the time.
I'm thinking about all the time.

1079
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:48,490
That's the way you gotta do it. And it
beat routine as well for bringing that,

1080
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:52,210
that the whole framework of the bringing
the whole framework and everything up.

1081
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,600
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Aspect of that.
Listen to that. And this morning I'm like,

1082
01:05:55,601 --> 01:06:00,520
yeah, this lase. That's the same thing
that makes you successful on a stock.

1083
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:04,060
Choosing that goal and then working
your way to it. Doing your, you know,

1084
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:09,070
and you gotta watch out for the situation
where you get paralysis by analysis

1085
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,670
or, and that's caught up by,

1086
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:17,680
you had a time limit on a stock. Okay,
you got three hours to get this done.

1087
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,800
So you got to get it figured out
and you've got to get moving.

1088
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:26,430
Or I think a lot of people will fall
into that trap where they do too much

1089
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:30,430
study, too, too much study,
and then they're, no,

1090
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:34,660
you're turning to actual life in
life in general. Sure. In stocks,

1091
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:35,770
guys will run out of time.

1092
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,520
I said something the other day, uh,

1093
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,240
most things don't get finished cause
most things don't get started then people

1094
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,380
won't even start peeling. Even make
that move. Of course. Hey, guess what?

1095
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:49,870
Big shocker. There's a dichotomy
and that's the bottom line.

1096
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,740
There's a dichotomy.

1097
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,070
If you rush into it and you start
moving without having a longterm plan,

1098
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,860
you're probably going to make a
bad move. If you take too long,

1099
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,350
you're going to wait too long. And
the whole, it's gonna pass you by.

1100
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,460
So you have to constantly modulate and
figure out where you're at and no one's

1101
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:05,740
gonna be able to give you the answer.
I can't sit here and be like, Oh,

1102
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:08,800
you know what you wanna do right
there. You want to make this? No,

1103
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,650
no one's gonna be sitting there telling
you that day by day you've got to figure

1104
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,480
that out and you got to
figure out if it's really,

1105
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,920
really moving you in the right
direction. Yup. Way It's gotta be.

1106
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,150
When you were talking about
coming back to trade at,

1107
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,530
and you know, you and I both had the, the,

1108
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,160
the luck to be at trade at in the
positions we were in. I was the,

1109
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,610
I was the trade at OIC.
You were the trade at CMC.

1110
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,580
So basically where the senior dudes,
we weren't together unfortunately,

1111
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,120
but what a good job and what a good
opportunity to see how things unfold and

1112
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:49,621
what a good opportunity to take these
standard operating procedures and pressure

1113
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:54,310
test them. Exactly. So

1114
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:01,600
I was hit up the other day in a brief
where I was talking about when I was there

1115
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:06,851
as a troop sea and we did our
first FTX and you had just trained,

1116
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,900
changed training to where we bef prior
to that and every time I'd been through

1117
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:16,610
land warfare prior to coming through as
as at the troop senior enlisted advisor

1118
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:19,550
in 2008 our FTX is, we're all live fire,

1119
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:23,360
great live-fire school,

1120
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:28,390
but it's so canned because it has to be
for safety that it really doesn't put

1121
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:33,800
any pressure on the leadership and
there's not really any pressure brought to

1122
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:35,790
bear on any of your slps. Yeah.

1123
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,710
To put this simply to everyone,
when you're in a gunfight,

1124
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,070
there's two horrible things
that the enemy will do.

1125
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,650
They will shoot at you
and they will maneuver.

1126
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,320
And when you're using
live fire for training,

1127
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,490
your enemy is a bunch of
paper targets. At best.

1128
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:56,360
They're mounted on those little carts
that can move around, but they're very,

1129
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:59,990
very limited. No, not even remotely close
to what a human being is going to do.

1130
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,180
So when you're going with live fire,

1131
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,320
your enemy neither shoots back
at you nor do they maneuver.

1132
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,180
So in the seal teams we would destroy
our paper targets all the time.

1133
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,640
We would crush them all
the time relentlessly.

1134
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:16,040
We would out maneuver them
cause they couldn't move.

1135
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,750
We would out shoot them
cause they didn't shoot.

1136
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:22,970
So it was pretty easy to dominate
and you sure there was that level of,

1137
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,040
of stress of the fact that is live fire.

1138
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:30,050
And when you're out like in the
desert you are and you and you do do,

1139
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,230
and we still do this where you have to
shift fire and you're walking and you're,

1140
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,470
you know, you're, you're making sure that
you're safe cause you can't, you know,

1141
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:37,850
you can, you can shoot each other.

1142
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:41,000
But that type of stress
compared to the stress of,

1143
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,740
okay now the enemy we're using,

1144
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,540
we're using laser tag guns or paint ball
and the enemy has a full on maneuvering

1145
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:52,190
their full on shooting back at us.
That's a, that's a big step up. Yeah.

1146
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,090
And so we just completely epically

1147
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:01,610
that first operation and we took a hard
look at the four biggest things we did

1148
01:10:02,401 --> 01:10:07,401
wrong and identified where our standard
operating procedures were flawed.

1149
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:13,910
And then we sat down with our leadership
and we got input and started a Mont

1150
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,470
modify those slps too,

1151
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,570
so we could build up standard operating
procedures that were resilient enough to

1152
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:24,600
withstand all the pressures that you
guys were putting on us and training.

1153
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,270
And uh,

1154
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:33,540
someone asked me [inaudible] at a, uh,
a keynote I was given the other day.

1155
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:37,860
Like, well, didn't you guys have sop
prior to that when we absolutely did,

1156
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:42,120
but they weren't good good enough because
they couldn't withstand the pressure.

1157
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:43,380
So they had to be modified.

1158
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:47,570
We had to modify the way we were
doing slps for getting headcounts.

1159
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:52,080
We had to modify how we were dealing
with our down men. Like, honestly,

1160
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,860
we weren't carrying
litters around. We weren't,

1161
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,300
but it's just an absolute abject
disaster. If you get a wounded guy,

1162
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:02,370
sure I can drag him off the x.

1163
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:07,560
But now if I patch him up and I got
to throw him over my shoulder again,

1164
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:12,510
I'm going to blow out every bandage I
just put on him. That's stupid. You know,

1165
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:17,400
um, our radio comms going
with when everything is
confusing, we had to fix that.

1166
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:21,480
So we had to dial those slps in
the standard operating procedures.

1167
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,080
And the beauty of,

1168
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:30,120
of trade at is that as stuff is
happening on the battlefield,

1169
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,990
we immediately modify
that in the training.

1170
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:37,860
And we're putting that on top of the guys
and training so they can see if their

1171
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:42,390
standard operating procedures are good
to go or if they're flawed and they need

1172
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:46,250
to be modified. So we can constantly
modified if people are honest about them.

1173
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,660
Yeah. And that's, that's
the beauty of the,

1174
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,730
basically the petri dish or the lab
that we had out there at trade at.

1175
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,040
Cause the other thing
is we could see when,

1176
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:01,000
when people were being honest about their
mistakes or one guys where were blame

1177
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,710
casting and not taking ownership
of what was going on and uh,

1178
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,940
and not being honest with the recipes.

1179
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:13,941
And then you just develop these slps
like they don't just apply to the

1180
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:20,490
battlefield. We came up with
standard operating procedures for uh,

1181
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:25,320
you know, how we did our admin
stuff, how we dealt with,

1182
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,630
with anything that you can think of.

1183
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,660
We would think of a good way to do it
and then test it and then run through it.

1184
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,730
So you know, you might not
like this, this analogy,

1185
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:40,731
but I think that sop is kind of our a
life hack because is one of those things

1186
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,280
that you can lay,

1187
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,720
there is no work.

1188
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,610
I know except for the standard operating
procedure is pretty Dang close to one.

1189
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,400
Yeah. You know what's, as you were,
as you were talking about that,

1190
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,530
one thing that I
definitely noticed is the,

1191
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:01,980
you could have almost 90% of the time
that you use the word modify our sop.

1192
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:07,830
You could have used the word simplify
because most of the time it was someone

1193
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:12,400
saying, hey, we got this crazy we,
this is what we're going to do.

1194
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:14,560
We're going to do this and you can do
that. And it has all these crazy things.

1195
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,890
And they realized that doesn't work. So
you make it simpler and simpler. Now,

1196
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:22,891
where that's counterintuitive is like in
extreme ownership where I talked about

1197
01:13:23,351 --> 01:13:27,190
doing SSC, and when we first started
doing SSE, the plan was real simple,

1198
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,800
just smash everything and just
take whatever you'd find right.

1199
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,680
But that was horrible plan and
it didn't work. So we had to,

1200
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:36,040
we had to put something that was a little
bit more looked on the surface to be a

1201
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:36,910
little bit more complex,

1202
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,550
even though when you broke down the
individual human beings and what they were

1203
01:13:39,551 --> 01:13:44,050
doing, it was a very straightforward
and very simple, so, so yeah. Yeah, no,

1204
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:49,051
there's no doubt that having that
opportunity to watch slps get tested and

1205
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,810
either pass or fail, and it
was so obvious either way,

1206
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,170
because it was so cool in the tunes.

1207
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:59,890
And the taskings would start to work
together and they'd start to cover,

1208
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,750
move for each other, and they'd
start to use the centralized command.

1209
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,000
They would, they would
crush the trade at guys,

1210
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:08,080
or they would absolutely would
at least get the best of them.

1211
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,080
They'd at least kill them all.
Whereas when they're not doing it,

1212
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:16,140
it would be comical for Che that guys
would kill 40 guys or whatever it was.

1213
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:20,260
Then you just be thinking,
hmm, and and, and you're right.

1214
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,760
This is where you'd have ego problems
would show up because guys would think,

1215
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,220
and it was so hard from,
from my perspective,

1216
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:28,540
from your perspective
when you're like, listen,

1217
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:34,540
the Trade Ed cadre is going to do the
same there they did the same thing to last

1218
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:36,850
nine troops or the last five troops.

1219
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
They did this exact same scenario and
and the other troops used simple standard

1220
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:44,020
operating procedures that cover to move.

1221
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,830
They use decentralized command and they
they one, here's what you're doing.

1222
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,480
This is from my perspective
and I know it's hard,

1223
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,270
but what you're doing is you're trying
to control everyone or what you're doing

1224
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:53,104
is you've got these,

1225
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:56,350
these standard operating procedures
that are too complicated or you're not

1226
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:57,760
prioritizing and executing your just,

1227
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:03,010
you've got to follow these simple rules
and it would be hard to convey to some

1228
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:07,720
guys if the guys wanted to put up their
ego barrier and let it offend them and

1229
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:09,580
think no would never happen or no,

1230
01:15:09,581 --> 01:15:12,910
that's just the trade that guys
knew what we were going to do. Yeah.

1231
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,380
The trade guys know what you're gonna do.

1232
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,280
You know what you're attacking
a target area. Anyone, any,

1233
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:23,050
any military mind in the world is going
to get the high ground and then they're

1234
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,680
going to sweep through if they can
from high ground to low ground.

1235
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,110
That's what the s what
everyone's going to do.

1236
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:31,480
It's not like the trade hat guys
that anybody could figure that out.

1237
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,600
Any military mind is going to look at
a target and do it one of three ways or

1238
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:41,260
one of four ways, and 50% of those
four ways actually is going to overlap.

1239
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:46,060
So you don't have to be a freaking
rocket science or scientist or or, or,

1240
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,000
or Napoleon to be able to figure
out, okay, here's the target.

1241
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,420
Where do I think the seals are going
to come in from? It's like, oh, okay.

1242
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:54,700
They're probably gonna come in from
here. I'll set up two guys there.

1243
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,650
There's also a chance they're
gonna come in from over here. Call.

1244
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:00,490
I'll put two guys over there. There
you go. We knew you knew our plan.

1245
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,470
It's like, yeah, Bro. The enemy
is, it's like you talked about,

1246
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,840
you had situations where you
went in and you're like, oh,

1247
01:16:08,841 --> 01:16:12,520
well we'll go get on the high ground.
Oh, the enemy put ids there. Yeah.

1248
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:15,340
Guess what? It doesn't take a
rocket science to figure out, Oh,

1249
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:16,750
if you're going to assault us here,

1250
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,900
you're probably gonna want to get this
piece of this piece of terrain over here.

1251
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:25,180
So that would offend guys. And they'd get
into the, hey, this is, this is wrong.

1252
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,500
And instead of saying, okay, what
did I do wrong? Can you just,

1253
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:30,120
can you just tell me what I
did wrong again cause I didn't,

1254
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,470
I'm not sure I understand it.
Oh well what you did is this,

1255
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,320
you didn't prioritize next to you or
you didn't use decentralized command and

1256
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:40,090
they will just fit if you're not gonna
listen to that, you know, it's a problem.

1257
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,830
I had a guy at the muster just asking
me about like how do you handle it when

1258
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:48,730
someone really picks
you apart on a debrief?

1259
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:52,690
And I'm like, Bro, you
know I handled that.

1260
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:57,750
I what I do is I look them right
in the eye and I say thank you.

1261
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,350
Thank you for telling me
that. Please thank you and,

1262
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,080
and I appreciate it and I'm going to go
look at what you just told me and I'm

1263
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:09,770
going to try and figure out if
I can fix it. Because otherwise,

1264
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,780
like you, you just, I could
see it in this guy's eyes.

1265
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:15,960
Like he's asking me that question
because his ego is getting offended. I,

1266
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:18,340
everyone's ego gets
offended. Mine gets it.

1267
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,230
I get offended when somebody tells me
that when somebody gives me the nine big

1268
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:23,480
debrief points on what I
did wrong, I'm freaking mad.

1269
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,850
I don't want to make mistakes. I
even ego just like everyone else,

1270
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:27,710
if not a freaking larger
ego than anyone else.

1271
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,130
And when somebody tells me I did
nine things wrong, I'm pissed.

1272
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,300
I'm pissed at myself,

1273
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,480
and it's really easy for me to look at
you and get pissed at you for telling me

1274
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:36,470
that I screwed this up.

1275
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:41,860
But instead I've gotten old enough
to realize even if I don't like you,

1276
01:17:42,581 --> 01:17:44,900
it's even harder if I don't like you.
It's even harder when I don't like you.

1277
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:48,140
It's even harder, right? That's what
makes it super hard. But when you go,

1278
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:52,610
you know what, Eh, you bite down
and you go, okay, thank you.

1279
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,990
Let me assess what you just told me.

1280
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:58,580
If you could make that little
step up in your life, it's epic.

1281
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:00,050
And when guys would, to your point,

1282
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:05,051
when guys wouldn't make that step in that
step up in coming through the trade at

1283
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:10,130
training, it would be a nightmare.
It was a nightmare. And the thing is,

1284
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:14,960
man, like I love all these team
guys. I want them to go kick ass. I,

1285
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:18,710
that's all I wanted was them to like
go do great things on deployment.

1286
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,173
And when you get that,

1287
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,600
the guy coming through that just
would be offended by it and I,

1288
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,370
I'd be so bummed out, I'd, you know,
I'd just, I'd be so bummed out.

1289
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,200
I'd be like, Bro, I just
want you to do good.

1290
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:32,780
I'm just telling you like don't focus
on a head count when you're in the

1291
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:37,220
firefight. That's what I'm
saying. Yeah. And then,

1292
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,890
then you get to the point where

1293
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,920
you're just like, oh man,
you're not going to get it now.

1294
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,750
I'm just going to make you suffer. Yeah.

1295
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,790
But the cause you get,

1296
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:56,990
you'll get critique points
where guys will say, hey,

1297
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:02,020
we need to get an op so we can go
start to finish where you let us win

1298
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:05,150
basically. And you know,

1299
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,600
if you're playing football and your
college team goes against the high school

1300
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:08,811
team,

1301
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:11,870
that's not challenging for anybody and
you're not gonna really learn anything

1302
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:15,500
out of it. And that's the learning thing.
That's why I gave you a walkthrough.

1303
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:20,830
And so after seeing that so many times
and running land warfare and I started

1304
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:25,910
going out at the front day one
and saying, hey guys, listen,

1305
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,070
you're going to get a walkthrough.

1306
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,000
That's your time to work through your
whole script on how you're going to run a

1307
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:32,840
target assault.

1308
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:37,490
But I'm shortchanging you if I'm not
putting pressure on you when we have these

1309
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:38,324
FTX nights,

1310
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,690
cause we only have this place for a
limited period of time and this is where

1311
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:44,600
you're going to find where your
weak points are and get better.

1312
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:49,600
And then knowing about myself when I
have those two voices arguing in my head,

1313
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:55,151
the one that's my ego and it's making
an excuse for everything that you're,

1314
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:59,900
that someone who's debriefing me is
picking apart and the other reasonable

1315
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:04,520
voice, which I'm trying to turn
the volume up on, um, that's going,

1316
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,740
oh yeah, that's a fair critique. Yeah.

1317
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:11,850
Well I got a little lazy there.
Shouldn't have taken my body armor off.

1318
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,480
Uh, that, that kind of stuff.

1319
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:20,510
Or where the worst was like the OIC that
would come out after you were OIC in

1320
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,720
he,

1321
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,140
if he came out to training and he would
find some stuff that was screwed up and

1322
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:29,310
he's like, why am I the one
fixing it? And I'm like,

1323
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,470
you are exactly right. And
guys who get angry, he's like,

1324
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,910
you'd come down here and he calls
us out. He goes, we deserve it.

1325
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,640
Let's not do this ever again.

1326
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:43,590
We cannot have our boss coming out
here and looking at how we're running,

1327
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:47,730
training and calling us
out. And a lot of it was

1328
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,060
for, I'll give you an example,

1329
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:55,830
go out to an I ads range and a platoon
is decided to have their 60 gunner walk

1330
01:20:55,831 --> 01:21:00,060
point because that's going to work
good for an immediate action drill.

1331
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,960
But that's not what you're really
going to do. That's patrol to contact.

1332
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:06,810
That's not what we're training in an
immediate action drill when we're training

1333
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:08,610
for a sucker punch and he's like,

1334
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,050
what in the wide world of sports
is going on here? And we'd be like,

1335
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:18,210
yeah, but guys wouldn't
want to tell the platoon.

1336
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:23,400
It'd be one of these small things
where, and I failed in this.

1337
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,860
And in leadership a lot of
times where it's just like,

1338
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,490
oh I'll just let that
slide, I'll just let the,

1339
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:31,350
I'm pretty soon everything's sliding
and you're not really given people any

1340
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:35,040
guidance. But uh, um, yeah,

1341
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:36,840
people comment,

1342
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,780
you gotta be honest with the critique
and look at it and then move forward.

1343
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:44,781
And at the end of the day you always kind
of know when you're wrong and to take

1344
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,870
ownership of it, you feel better about it.

1345
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:52,950
Cause now you have power over it,
right? And then it's like, Oh,

1346
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:57,951
if I think that the trade ed staff is
cheating now I'm powerless against it and

1347
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:05,010
it's just kind of a stressor that I'm
deal. Exactly are just going to win.

1348
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,020
It doesn't matter. Blah
Blah. And then it's,

1349
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:11,340
it's also on on a trade debt. It's,

1350
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,230
and it's difficult to to debrief people
and not come off as condescending.

1351
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,420
That's a real skill. And that's the,

1352
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:21,840
some guys are really good at that and
that's something I tried to work on and

1353
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,910
I'm not perfect at it.

1354
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,380
But to give people constructive criticism
in a manner that they'll accept it,

1355
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:31,800
that it doesn't want to like on poker
talked about that and traded is you don't

1356
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:34,590
really have a good relationship with
50% of the guys that are coming through.

1357
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,690
So some guys that come through, like
when you're coming through I'm like,

1358
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:40,160
hey bro, like we, I could just like
be pretty straight up with you guys.

1359
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:42,990
I don't really know you and you're from
like a different team and I never worked

1360
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:47,520
with you before. So I have no sort of
sort of relationship and then it's harder,

1361
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:52,350
you know, to say, hey man, that
was a really bad job, you know,

1362
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,720
now I don't know. I what I,

1363
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,910
what I ended up doing the trade
out was I would just be like, hey,

1364
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:59,010
this is what happened,
you know? And by the way,

1365
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:00,900
I recorded you on my audio thing.

1366
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:04,380
Like I would carry a little voice
recorder and then when people would be

1367
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,370
panicking or freaking out, I would record

1368
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,360
them and I'd say,

1369
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,700
you were kind of freaking out out there
and you'd see them olds and freaking out

1370
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:13,280
and be like, okay, listen to
this. And everybody was like,

1371
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,950
does that sound like freaking out
to your, is that your calm voice? So

1372
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:23,430
the, and the other fun thing
about the dead skier was

1373
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,650
you could hit them with the near
miss because if they got killed,

1374
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:33,680
they would get now drugged through the
desert by their ankle and guys didn't

1375
01:23:33,691 --> 01:23:38,250
want to die. So they still weren't as
honest about fire as they could be,

1376
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:43,251
but they would still like my favorite
thing to do would be put the God gone,

1377
01:23:43,261 --> 01:23:47,580
which is just a regular thing I had
as it lane greater on near Miss.

1378
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,670
And if guys were screwing around
like they, they would not, you know,

1379
01:23:50,671 --> 01:23:54,360
they'd all be standing up in a perimeter
where they shouldn't be standing and I

1380
01:23:54,361 --> 01:23:59,360
would just near miss them all
guys would just dive, dive in.

1381
01:23:59,361 --> 01:24:00,280
No real else.

1382
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,090
It was like legitimate real routes were
covered out of where they'd hear that

1383
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:05,670
near missing cause they didn't want
to get drugged through the desert for

1384
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:09,300
freaking two kilometers
to the extract point.

1385
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:13,200
Have all their gear be beat
up and bruised, gone punished.

1386
01:24:13,201 --> 01:24:17,580
All their liver has to carry. You was
just getting completely punished. Okay.

1387
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,180
I'm feel buffalo you smell. Yeah.

1388
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,120
Well I would them younger guys coming out.

1389
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:29,700
You know everyone talks about the big
millennials and I'm w from what I've seen

1390
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:33,610
when I, when I talk to the teams and when
I've gone out to some training sites,

1391
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:38,030
you guys are awesome. I think across
the board they are. Yeah. I've,

1392
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,420
I mean I've looked at all,

1393
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,480
all the new guys and the quality of
the new guys now compared to who I was.

1394
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:47,110
Yeah.

1395
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:50,860
I'm not sure I could have made it through
training if I was compared against all

1396
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:52,720
the guys. Now they're smart,

1397
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:57,990
they're motivated and they're hard and
they're only coming in because they want

1398
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:01,240
to go to a war II. I mean,
cause that's a given.

1399
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:04,450
Yeah. Did I want to go to war?
Absolutely. But it wasn't a known thing.

1400
01:25:04,451 --> 01:25:07,090
I got to admit that. I kind of
thought it was, I thought like,

1401
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:08,560
oh I'm going to nom.

1402
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:14,230
I thought I was going to Nob
in 1991 when I got to the team.

1403
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:18,850
But yeah, these guys know for a fact.
I mean they, they, they see, they see,

1404
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,550
they see, you know,
memorial services on TV.

1405
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:23,740
They know what's what they're
getting into for sure.

1406
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,680
And the, the complaints,

1407
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:32,690
the complaints about the millennials
that I hear are that, oh,

1408
01:25:32,691 --> 01:25:36,800
they want to know why they're doing
something. Well, Duh. Yeah. You know,

1409
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:38,420
and you just covered that in that,

1410
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:41,630
that document that was written after
rule or two that says, hey, guess what,

1411
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:46,010
you need to tell guys why they're doing
something or they're not going to be the

1412
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:50,300
most effective. And it's generationally,

1413
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,500
generationally,

1414
01:25:51,501 --> 01:25:55,170
it's just more blame casting where people
are whining about the next generation

1415
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:57,230
goes back forever. This is normal, right?

1416
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,520
I think it's one of those normal whiny
things that you got to be the young suck

1417
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,460
[inaudible] no they don't. You suck.

1418
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:14,680
When I was at one of the leadership
courses with some regular navy leadership

1419
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:20,350
and one of the master chiefs was
telling the story that she had any five

1420
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,100
[inaudible], she worked in, in,
in supply and she's like, Hey,

1421
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:27,830
I need you to go do the
inventory today. And

1422
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:33,830
she's checked back, comes back
like an hour and a half later.

1423
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,100
And uh,

1424
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:39,800
the guy had to go inventory this whole
warehouse and he's hanging out in the

1425
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:41,450
coffee lounge and hour and a
half later and she's like, Hey,

1426
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:43,200
what the heck is going
on here? Should freeze.

1427
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:47,510
Like I did the inventory
and she's like, no way.

1428
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:49,610
But it takes all day. Let's spot check it.

1429
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:54,260
Spot just randomly pulls up a couple
items off that inventory list, checks it.

1430
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:58,820
She's like, how did you
do this? And he's like,

1431
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,821
well you know I got this app reader on
my phone and I just went and scanned all

1432
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:04,590
the bar codes,

1433
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:09,590
used his phone and completed the
inventory like that with a little bit of

1434
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:14,801
ingenuity and so basically she just told
him the end state and got out of his

1435
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:16,640
way. It was by accident,

1436
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,660
but she got out of his way and let him
figure out how something to do it and

1437
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:22,610
then then went with it.

1438
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,580
Nothing wrong with that. Nope.

1439
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,360
What about for you as you've gotten older,

1440
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:35,420
what kind of mindset changes have you
gone through where like I've just kind of

1441
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,070
talked about one from
my perspective, your,

1442
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:44,090
as I got older I see see different
things and I always try and make that

1443
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:46,590
perfectly clear to everyone
that you know, I kind of

1444
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,323
okay,

1445
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:52,990
you know, I learned, I learned
and I'm still learning.

1446
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:57,490
And so, you know, would you, what, what,

1447
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,050
what like were some things that if you
could have learned or changed your,

1448
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,030
your mentality on earlier?

1449
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,830
Like what, yeah, I mean for
shutting down the Ego, uh,

1450
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:11,463
you know,

1451
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,600
a lot of my growth honestly is being
married to IRS and is 100% responsible for

1452
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:20,170
her and just shuts down
your ego, shuts my ego down,

1453
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,330
but then has on honest
conversations about,

1454
01:28:22,331 --> 01:28:26,740
well what are you really thinking
here? And then, you know,

1455
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:32,550
actually listening to what someone's
saying cause the trap I used to fall into

1456
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:37,630
was when someone was talking to me,
I wasn't really listening to them.

1457
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:40,230
I was just formulating what
I was going to say back.

1458
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,660
Did that formulating your calendar?

1459
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:44,380
Exactly.

1460
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:49,410
And I probably score a high in
trait disagreeableness yeah.

1461
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:52,360
So you know,

1462
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,780
it's just my nature to want to
be at that point of friction.

1463
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:58,180
But that also makes me just, you know,

1464
01:28:58,181 --> 01:29:02,340
want to go stick my finger in people's
eyes and offend them and stuff that and

1465
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:07,341
so stepping back and opening my
mind up to other points of view,

1466
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:10,530
um,

1467
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:15,530
and then being a little bit more
cognizant of other people and how they're

1468
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:21,090
reacting to me so I can adjust
how I interact with them. Relation

1469
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:24,340
ship wise, I don't know if you remember
this question at the muster guide asked,

1470
01:29:24,341 --> 01:29:26,230
hey, what, what do you do when you,

1471
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,910
how do you deal with someone who's
super negative and about, you know,

1472
01:29:30,911 --> 01:29:35,620
the, the, the team or
whatever. And you know, I said,

1473
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,950
here's a really good leadership
technique that you can use.

1474
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:42,940
It's very complicated. It's called
listen how much you listen to them,

1475
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,250
but you actually listened
to what people are saying.

1476
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,790
Somebody feels really negative about my
team. Guess what? I want to know why.

1477
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:52,180
I want to actually hear their
explanation as to why they're being super

1478
01:29:52,181 --> 01:29:53,650
negative. And by the way,

1479
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,730
when you allow someone to voice their
opinion and you listened to them

1480
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,680
carefully, instead of
formulating our counterparts,

1481
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:03,340
which is what our instinct is to do, if
instead of you go, okay, what's wrong,

1482
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:05,020
Jason wouldn't mean what's,
what's the problem over here?

1483
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,690
I actually want to listen to you. I
want to hear what you have to say.

1484
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:13,110
And that is such an advantage as a
leader instead of always feeling like,

1485
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:17,800
Hey, anybody that steps to me
is getting crushed. Like no,

1486
01:30:17,801 --> 01:30:19,240
actually anybody that steps to me,

1487
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:23,750
he's going to teach me something and
I'm happy to hear it. Yeah. Boom.

1488
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,490
And then just

1489
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:32,170
are you aware of, you know, by my biases,

1490
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,790
my biases.

1491
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:38,140
And then I find this a lot of times with
the Dang media presses the heck out of

1492
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,270
my buttons. And so

1493
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,630
I got to the point where I just,

1494
01:30:43,631 --> 01:30:47,380
I don't watch the news anymore
because the news is, is hard.

1495
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:52,090
It's there to get you angry so you'll
pay attention to it and gets them better

1496
01:30:52,091 --> 01:30:52,924
ratings. Yeah.

1497
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,470
And a lot of times when I'll see some
really extreme things that they're

1498
01:30:56,471 --> 01:30:59,380
claiming people said, when I dig into,

1499
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:03,370
when I actually take the time to dig
into it, it's like not quite what it was.

1500
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:09,060
And now that I've become a
lot more introspective and
so I'm paying attention to

1501
01:31:10,151 --> 01:31:11,770
how things make me react.

1502
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:15,490
I'm paying attention to when my face
flushes out or I grip. And I'm like, okay,

1503
01:31:15,491 --> 01:31:19,840
now it's time to detach and step back.
I've noticed that that just like,

1504
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,840
it's not as not a positive
positive, you know,

1505
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,960
thing in my life to have my blood pressure
spiked again and again and again and

1506
01:31:28,961 --> 01:31:33,730
again because I've got a 24 hour
news feed coming in. And so,

1507
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:37,900
uh, another teen guy pointed
this out to me. He's like, Hey,

1508
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,760
I'm just talking about the news and I
was all angry about something and he's

1509
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:44,470
like, you know what? I quit
watching the news and he goes,

1510
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:47,770
I'm a lot happier since I stopped
watching the news. It doesn't matter.

1511
01:31:47,771 --> 01:31:50,290
And I'm like, are you kidding
me? Of course it matters.

1512
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:54,850
But he planted a little seed and
watered it. And then I'm like, okay,

1513
01:31:54,851 --> 01:31:58,480
I'm going to quit watching the news
and it doesn't, it doesn't matter.

1514
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:02,380
And I was the point where I'll just
check the news like first thing in the

1515
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:05,110
morning and make sure a volcano went
off. Right now I don't even do that.

1516
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,370
If there's a volcano going off,

1517
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:09,310
I'll see the smoke or someone will tell
you that you're going to find out about

1518
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:09,520
it.

1519
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,540
The 24 hour news cycles filled with a lot
of things that you don't need to know.

1520
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:17,230
You don't need to know at all. And
that's, that's Kinda the way I am. I mean,

1521
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:20,770
I still look at it, but it doesn't,
it, I'm completely, I, I can look at,

1522
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,800
I can look at 19 headlines in a row and
none of them have any remote impact on

1523
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:30,910
my mentality at all until
I see one that says, oh,

1524
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:33,670
there was a terror bombing here. And I
go, oh, okay, let's see what's going on.

1525
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:36,820
Or Hey, there was a US servicemen
killed here. And I'm like, oh, okay.

1526
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:42,150
But every other of the 17
headlines that I read that were,

1527
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,510
um, I'm trying to think of a good one
right now cause there's just, you know,

1528
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:52,120
everything is going down and you're
like, okay, fine. Yeah I can get no,

1529
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:55,300
everything's not going down.
The world isn't going to end,

1530
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,010
but it's clickbait isn't, yeah, it is.

1531
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:01,630
You guys are the first ones I
heard use that word. I'm like, oh,

1532
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:06,160
that's what that is. Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah. Well what? It's going clickbait,

1533
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:09,640
but it's just clickbait on the TV to
get you to dial in and get them higher

1534
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:12,220
ratings. And then you got to
listen to that. Sam Harrison,

1535
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:14,200
I forget the female's name that was on,

1536
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:18,160
but she did this whole research about it.
They're talking about how the Russian,

1537
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,220
the Russian bots and
all that stuff and yeah,

1538
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:25,240
you can create headlines that are gonna
make people click and then you can make

1539
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:29,680
fictional random, you can
just make up stories and peep.

1540
01:33:29,681 --> 01:33:33,970
They'll catch fit. You know, someone else
will report that story as being true.

1541
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:37,600
It's a crazy world. The onion joke,

1542
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:42,580
newspaper AP is pick their stuff
up like two or three times before.

1543
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:45,250
Totally nuts. So you got to learn.

1544
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:50,280
You should definitely adult mom learn
to detach when you read the news.

1545
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,160
Yeah. And then, uh, something
that I found real helpful is,

1546
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,430
is putting a filter on my thoughts.

1547
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,770
So the, and this is something that
iris is Kinda talked about. She's like,

1548
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:04,780
the first filter is am I whining?

1549
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,790
And then the second
filter is, am I resentful?

1550
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:13,240
And then the third
filter is, am I jealous?

1551
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,990
And if I can just catch that
stuff, once I identify it,

1552
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,700
it doesn't bother me anymore.
But prior to identifying it,

1553
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:26,410
if I'm just like, oh, someone told just
got a promotion, well that's bullshit.

1554
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,170
He, you know, and then, then
I realize, oh, wait a minute,

1555
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:33,040
I should be happy for him for
getting that promotion. Uh,

1556
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:38,740
and Jordan Peterson says something about
be careful who you share good news with

1557
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:43,960
and, and, and I just don't, I, that's
not, that's not something I, I,

1558
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:48,760
I'm proud of when I see it come up in
myself. And it's one of the things that,

1559
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,020
that as I age on, I'm trying
to fix. The other thing that,

1560
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:58,380
that as I've gotten older is
I used to be very identified

1561
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,930
and now I find myself becoming
more of an individual,

1562
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:07,660
if that makes sense. That makes
sense. And understand this, this is,

1563
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:12,320
that's where I'm trying to go and
this is, this is the path that, uh,

1564
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,800
that I'm on and it's a
struggle and it all comes down.

1565
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:19,250
And I kind of wished there
was two words for ego, right?

1566
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:24,740
Cause the ego, if I didn't have
an ego driving me to be better,

1567
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:28,830
I would just be sitting at home
eating chocolate chip cookies on the,

1568
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,300
on the college. There's not two
words to describe you to go,

1569
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:35,190
but there is the dichotomy of it though.
And so then you're good to go. Yeah.

1570
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,170
You know, uh, what am
I a team guy buddies.

1571
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:44,210
A long time ago you could
use this phrase, which I,

1572
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,580
which I always remembered cause
I thought it was really good.

1573
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,240
Basically someone was whining
about something and you know,

1574
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,550
raise their hand and said, well,
you know, why are we doing this?

1575
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,310
And then afterwards my buddy
goes, hey, that's cool.

1576
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,890
Put yourself on report for being a bitch.

1577
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,940
And so like I've been hypersensitive
to that for a real long time.

1578
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:08,090
I do not ever, you know, I don't
care what I'm broke through,

1579
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:09,830
I will not complain about anything.

1580
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:13,610
Like I am hypersensitive about that
at least I've tried to be. I mean,

1581
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,100
you know, cold blocking mockups,
anything, uh, you know, hurt.

1582
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:24,020
Like I hurt my knee and I might need
was all swollen up, all jacked up.

1583
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,040
And I didn't tell anyone. I told her,
hey, injured my knee. Nope, no factor.

1584
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:31,520
And finally Lafe was like, Hey,
you know, what's up with your knee?

1585
01:36:31,521 --> 01:36:35,330
I sent him a picture, like the knee
is just twice as big as the other one.

1586
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:39,500
He's like, oh my God, are you going to
need surgery? I'm like, no, no factor.

1587
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:42,980
But, and I only sent it to
him like six or seven days.

1588
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,330
The swelling had gone down,

1589
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:46,910
but out of the gate I wasn't going
to say anything cause I don't,

1590
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:50,630
I don't want to sit there and complain.
Like, Bro, I hurt my knee doing Jujitsu.

1591
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:53,180
Oh No. You know what I
mean? Like, come on Bro,

1592
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:55,880
I'm not going to complain
about that. Uh, but yeah,

1593
01:36:55,881 --> 01:37:00,881
those other things about being resentful
and being jealous when ever I feel that

1594
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:06,821
tinge of what I feel that tinge of
jealousy when I feel that tinge of,

1595
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:11,240
when I feel like I feel like mad
at someone for doing something,

1596
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,430
I automatically know
it's me. I automatically,

1597
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:16,470
and I've known that for years there
was a stoner. As a matter of fact,

1598
01:37:16,471 --> 01:37:21,170
I was going to, he wanted
to go to Princeton and he,

1599
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:25,580
he said to me, he and he,
I wasn't that, we weren't,

1600
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:26,900
we weren't together at team three anymore.

1601
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,690
And so he was talking to some people
and finally he comes to me and he says,

1602
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:31,610
hey man, I want to go to Princeton.

1603
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:35,380
I want to put together this package
and go to Princeton. He said, but, uh,

1604
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:39,050
some of the other people I'm talking
to are telling me it'd be bad for my

1605
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:42,020
career. And I'm like, Bro,

1606
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:46,160
those guys are just jealous.
Uh, that's not happening. I go,

1607
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:49,670
you go and you get your freaking degree
from Princeton. Are you kidding me?

1608
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,610
How's that going to be bad for? And he
did. He ended up doing it and he had got,

1609
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:54,740
he got in, he got accepted. And,

1610
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:57,990
but that was one of those things
where it was so obvious to me,

1611
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:01,680
like whoever told you that is just telling
you that cause they don't want you to

1612
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:05,790
have, have another punk card to pull
on you. Cause like, hey, you're stoner,

1613
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:09,240
your, you know, you got a
bunch of combat experience,

1614
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,440
you got a bunch of combat awards.
You're, you're this big strapping dude.

1615
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,240
And by the way, you're
going to go to Princeton.

1616
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:19,080
Like no one wanted that final
punk card to be issued as donor.

1617
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,200
It's hard when you see someone else
that's successful and you know that like I

1618
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:29,541
should be getting up off my ass and
getting into Princeton myself or going,

1619
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:32,870
you know, you can't control whether or
not you're deployed to combat there.

1620
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,320
A lot of that other stuff is, and I think
that's where it gets painful for guys.

1621
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:38,940
It's like, okay,

1622
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:42,810
well I'm not going to make the efforts
so I don't want anybody else to make the

1623
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:43,351
effort either.

1624
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:46,710
I'm a crab in this bucket and I'm going
to drag that crab that's trying to climb

1625
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:51,420
out back in the bucket and
this is actually in a way
the warrior kid three this

1626
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:52,800
is why I had to address this,

1627
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:56,550
which in a way the where your could three
you'll have you read it yet. Not yet.

1628
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,660
That's one way. The where your kid,
there's a new character that comes in,

1629
01:38:58,661 --> 01:39:01,020
his name is Danny Reinhart and
he's like good at everything.

1630
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:04,250
He's better at mark than
ever and everything. He's
like a little bit smarter,

1631
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:07,500
does better on the tests in school and
he's a little bit faster and he can do

1632
01:39:07,501 --> 01:39:10,830
more pull ups. And then like to take
the cake because he's a new kid,

1633
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:15,690
moves in and and mark still thinks he's
got the ultimate punk card to pull,

1634
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:18,920
which is I do Jujitsu and I
can choke you. Some of the,

1635
01:39:18,921 --> 01:39:19,920
most of the stuff matters.

1636
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:24,150
It turns out Danny Reinhardt's been
trading for two more years and that's

1637
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:28,770
exactly what happens is mark, instead of
saying, wow, I can learn from you. Wow,

1638
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,100
you can help me. Wow, that's awesome.
I know you worked hard for that.

1639
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:36,600
Instead he just tries to undermine
and he just is jealous and so that's

1640
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:39,660
something that you deal with when you're
starting to be, even as a little kid,

1641
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,060
you know you as even a little kid,
you can be jealous. So checking,

1642
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:47,730
check yourself if you're being
resentful, if you're jealous of someone,

1643
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:52,470
those are like the first things I check
when I start getting mad at someone.

1644
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,140
Those are the first things I check when
I start getting mad at someone. I go,

1645
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:57,840
am I being jealous right now? Yes I am.

1646
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,740
He didn't say filter is not is not good.

1647
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:05,640
And what's worked out really well
for me is when you identify these,

1648
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,290
these people that are good at everything,
keep them around you. Oh for sure.

1649
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:13,320
For sure. For sure. And that's the other,

1650
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:17,490
the other clincher in the way the where
you could three is, is Danny Reinhardt.

1651
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,570
He's not only like better,

1652
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:23,600
he's also like a really nice kid and
so that makes mark even matter cause

1653
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:28,830
everyone wants to be friends with
them just cause he's nice. So yeah,

1654
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:31,290
you got to watch out for that.
Check yourself. Don't get that.

1655
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:37,190
I wanted to talk about some leadership
mistakes that you've made and I was

1656
01:40:38,251 --> 01:40:39,420
thinking to myself while I could talk,

1657
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,870
I could call out Jason for leadership
mistakes that he's made that's kind of

1658
01:40:42,871 --> 01:40:45,630
jacked up if I don't talk about any
leadership mistakes that I've made.

1659
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,540
Now of course I've listed a bunch of
leadership's mistakes that I've made in

1660
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:52,290
that kind of me of leadership and an
extreme ownership. So there's that.

1661
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:56,680
But I've got a couple that I thought of
and I was trying to think of some broad

1662
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:57,220
ones.

1663
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:01,870
One of them is when I was in Ramadi,

1664
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:04,870
I hate to start off like
that when I was in Ramadi,

1665
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:10,630
I did not do a as good
a job as I should have,

1666
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:12,730
you know, go a little bit further

1667
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,800
to keeping the rest of our community
informed as to what was happening and why

1668
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:24,370
it was happening. And to be honest with
you, the reason I say I'll go further,

1669
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,070
then I just didn't keep them informed.
I wasn't even thinking about it.

1670
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:32,310
I wasn't even thinking about it when I
got home and one of our good friends said

1671
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:38,770
to me, and he was all fired up and
he's like, we will read in your,

1672
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,390
he's like, we read your ars at quarters
every day like he every day at trade at,

1673
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:47,710
at the time while we were in
Ramadi, they were reading the ars,

1674
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:50,680
the after action report for
the, Hey, they killed nine guys.

1675
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:54,040
They killed seven guys in I. That's, you
know, I was like, hey, that's awesome.

1676
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,810
That's cool. I didn't
really even think of that.

1677
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:59,470
But what I also didn't think of was guys
that were saying, Hey, wait a second.

1678
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:02,290
What are these guys doing over
there? Hey, wait a second. Wait,

1679
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:06,250
why are you conducting operations
during the daytime? Hey, wait a second.

1680
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,330
Why are you staying out
after you get contacted?

1681
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:13,300
Why are you staying in
position? Hey, wait a second.

1682
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:17,590
Why are you working alongside
the conventional forces?

1683
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:20,740
Why aren't you doing stuff
with just special operations?

1684
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:26,190
And I did a bad job of explaining these
things to our community as a whole.

1685
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:30,340
And even when we got back, I had
the opportunity to do it and I,

1686
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,650
I spread the word to some people
and was able to explain to them.

1687
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,840
But by then some people
had already thought, oh,

1688
01:42:34,841 --> 01:42:36,310
well these guys were just over there.

1689
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:40,030
Do we these rogue operations by themselves
and they shouldn't have been doing

1690
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,460
it. So that's, that's one,

1691
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:46,330
that's one big one that I wish I
would've done a better job. And I just,

1692
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:50,020
I just wasn't even paying attention.
And you know what, it's like, man.

1693
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:54,850
I mean this is my, this
is my excuse is my,

1694
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:59,500
it's my fault because I was over
there and I'm thinking like, Hey,

1695
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:01,450
we got an operation
tomorrow. I got to, I got,

1696
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:02,770
I got two elements going out in the field.

1697
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:04,180
I'm not worried about
what they're thinking.

1698
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:06,490
I just didn't even think
of it and I should have.

1699
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:08,620
So I don't know if that's an excuse.

1700
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:12,550
It's the reason why I didn't think of
a way I should have and I was wrong for

1701
01:43:12,551 --> 01:43:15,940
not doing that. Bandwidth could you've
expended on it though in the moment.

1702
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:16,774
You know what?

1703
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:21,160
If I would have been a little bit
smarter and a little bit better,

1704
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:25,030
I could have taken 15 minutes to
send out an email and say, hey,

1705
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:28,260
everyone want to let you know what
this op was really like because they're

1706
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:30,940
reading the OP sums, right? The
optimum is an official document.

1707
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:34,300
If I could have supplemented
that with, hey guys, Jocko here,

1708
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,330
I know this one sounds a little
bit crazy. Here's what's going on.

1709
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:40,990
The Iraqi soldiers that we're working
with, they don't have night vision.

1710
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:46,680
They have one flashlight per fire team
to go out at night with these guys is

1711
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,000
completely, uh, it doesn't work.

1712
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,920
And so we got to go out
in the daytime with them.

1713
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,590
And so that's what we're doing.
Here's why we're doing it. You know,

1714
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:55,941
I could have done it,

1715
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:59,450
I could have expended a little bit and
I just didn't have the awareness that I

1716
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:01,940
should have had to explain these things.

1717
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:05,300
Also to explain them in plain English
because it's one thing to read the OPSM

1718
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,780
that's an official document
that's written a certain way.

1719
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:13,250
It's another thing to say, hey guys,
Jocko here, here's what's going on.

1720
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:15,740
And cause I mean let's face it
at that time I'd been in for

1721
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,270
a long time and I had
friends everywhere. I mean,

1722
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:21,920
and when my friends would reach out to me,

1723
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:23,570
this is probably should
have been my best indicator.

1724
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,690
Some of my friends that reached
out to me and said like, hey dude,

1725
01:44:26,691 --> 01:44:29,860
what's going on? Like I
heard you just got a go.

1726
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,180
I heard one of you guys got shot.
What's going on? How that happening.

1727
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,330
And I had one specific friend of mine
who wrote me like a long email and,

1728
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:41,300
and I wrote him back, right. And said,
hey man, this is what's going on.

1729
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,550
But that should have been an indicator.

1730
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:47,060
If one of my friends was reaching out
to me and saying, Hey, what's going on?

1731
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,440
I should have been more cognizant
of the fact that people beyond,

1732
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:55,190
and people that didn't know me at all,
you know, would be thinking, well,

1733
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,280
you know, well this guy's,
this guy's a hyper aggressive.

1734
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:02,030
And they're just out there taking
too many risks. It's like, no. And,

1735
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:06,110
and what was cool was there were
some guys that were in Ramadi,

1736
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,190
other seals that were in Ramadi or working
in and around Ramadi at the time who

1737
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:12,410
I knew and they were like,
Oh, you guys are crushing it.

1738
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,710
You guys are doing great. This is
awesome. But I didn't do a good job.

1739
01:45:15,711 --> 01:45:17,510
So that's, that's one thing. Um,

1740
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:19,280
I dunno what it looked
like from your perspective.

1741
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:24,281
Where were you when I was over there in
Pei calm poolside at Thailand explaining

1742
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:29,360
to my guys why we had to put the missions
first. Yeah, yeah. Check. Check. Yeah.

1743
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,040
But at the time I was excited for
you guys because it was like the,

1744
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:39,470
that was like the first
sustained heavy combat

1745
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,230
of that war. Yeah. Everything had been,

1746
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:50,960
we were talking about the big news to
stand around and talk about when you were

1747
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:51,920
at the bar was,

1748
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:56,980
was maybe a tick or a firefight that
lasted five minutes and you guys were

1749
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:01,010
troops in contact 100% of the time.
Every time you walked outside the gate.

1750
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:04,550
Yeah. It wasn't quite that, but it
was a lot. Yeah. And that's for sure.

1751
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:07,460
And that's what, that's what I think.

1752
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:11,420
I think I should've explained that better
than I did throughout the community.

1753
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:13,930
And you know, I still talk to guys.
I still have the opportunity when it,

1754
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,800
cause you know, some guys that I'll,

1755
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:18,260
I'll still explain this to some guy that
I haven't seen cause you know how it

1756
01:46:18,261 --> 01:46:20,720
is, you run into a guy that you
hadn't seen in 15 years, you know,

1757
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,520
and they'll be like, dude, what were
you doing over there? I was like, Hey,

1758
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:25,570
let me explain it to you. I've had
people sit through kind of the,

1759
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:30,290
the Ramadi brief and be
like, okay, I get it.

1760
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:34,220
I get it. Yeah, that makes
sense. Hey Roger. But yeah,

1761
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,230
should have done a better job of that
from a leadership perspective. Um,

1762
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:41,000
I was trying to think of
a tactical example of,

1763
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,890
and this is real easy story.

1764
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:46,730
One time I personally chase down some
dude over like multiple rooftops as a in

1765
01:46:46,731 --> 01:46:47,451
Baghdad, you know,

1766
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:51,570
like just got in a one band pursuit
while I had another guy like trailing me.

1767
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:54,300
But basically we're hitting a target.

1768
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,420
There's a squirter I'm outside
the building as it's happening.

1769
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:01,200
And all of a sudden, you know that the,

1770
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:05,130
the overhead asset reports that there's
a squirter and he jumped to another

1771
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:09,030
rooftop and I had a radio man.

1772
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:13,800
The radio man was like near me and we
both know the radio man and he's like,

1773
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:18,240
hey. He's like, oh, you went to the
next roof. And I was like, God, him.

1774
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:22,470
And so I climb up a palm tree
of a climb up a palm tree,

1775
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,940
like in between a palm tree and like the
garage and I get to the roof and I get

1776
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:28,410
in and he's like, you jumped to
the next one. And so the radio,

1777
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:33,411
the t j tack is in the street with me
following down and telling me what's going

1778
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:36,630
on. And basically I left my, I
shouldn't have done that, you know,

1779
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:39,810
I should've sent a couple guys and
eventually I got someone else with me and

1780
01:47:39,811 --> 01:47:44,050
then we got the guy. But you know, I
just was trying to think of, hey, where,

1781
01:47:44,051 --> 01:47:47,760
where did I make some mistakes? Where
that were more on a tactical level.

1782
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:51,030
And that's one right
there is, you know, I,

1783
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:55,950
I'm in charge of the assault and if I'm
out there chasing the guy from rooftop

1784
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,790
rooftop, I'm not doing my job. I,

1785
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,800
but they did have it on video

1786
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,500
[inaudible] and I tried
to get ahold of it,

1787
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:09,870
but of course it's classified
so I couldn't have it. But yeah,

1788
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:14,220
it was pretty cool to watch. You
know, you're doing like par core in,

1789
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:16,190
in Kit punk.

1790
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:20,670
It's called the palm tree and then
jump from roof to roof to roof.

1791
01:48:20,671 --> 01:48:25,350
And then eventually they're like, he
said that one right there. And uh, yeah,

1792
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,750
so that was one. And then
the last thing again,

1793
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:30,450
I was trying to think of like a
variety of different mistakes.

1794
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:34,050
And here's something from a
leadership perspective that I really,

1795
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:36,480
when I look back, I wish I
would have done a better job.

1796
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,190
And that's helping guys with their
finances. Young guys, I mean,

1797
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:44,070
how many young guys enlist?

1798
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:49,020
They get $150,000 reenlistment bonus
and they show up at work two days later.

1799
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:54,021
They've got a new FordF three 50
super duty Harley Davidson a version.

1800
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,270
And they have, you know,
they're, they have a,

1801
01:48:57,271 --> 01:49:01,320
they have a $62,000
truck that is now worth,

1802
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,990
they just had it for a day
and they've now worth 48,000.

1803
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:07,920
So they already lost money and guys that
would rent instead of buy, you know,

1804
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:09,600
just all those things were,

1805
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,320
and I wasn't like super at it,

1806
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,070
but I was ahead and I should have
been telling guys like, Hey man,

1807
01:49:17,071 --> 01:49:19,590
let me talk to you like, hey
guys, let's do a little lips.

1808
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:22,980
Was to talk for half an hour
about where you're at right now.

1809
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,900
Let's come up with a strategic objective
of where are you going to be and five

1810
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:28,711
years, you know,

1811
01:49:28,711 --> 01:49:32,790
do you still want to be
renting an apartment in IB
because that's probably not

1812
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:36,450
great. Or do you want to be buying a
place, get with one of your buddies.

1813
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:40,470
So I never talked about that
kind of stuff. And again,

1814
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:44,880
what it boils down to is my
own, my own, uh, being obsessed.

1815
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:48,100
Like I didn't care about that
stuff. You know what I mean? I guess

1816
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,980
I cared about it enough to do
it. And I got lucky. I had a,

1817
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:56,280
I had an officer one time that said I
bought a house every three years and kept

1818
01:49:56,951 --> 01:50:00,700
it. He just said that to me and I was
like, that seems like a really good idea.

1819
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,750
And that's what I tried to do,

1820
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:06,280
but I didn't pass that word on and I
could have probably helped out more guys.

1821
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:10,390
So kind of a bummer on
that one. Yeah. Because

1822
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:13,510
that aspect,

1823
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:18,550
and I completely dropped the ball on
that early in my career as well. Later,

1824
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:22,870
later on I got a little bit better
at it, but you know, cause I did 30,

1825
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:27,040
but uh, um, I, I could tell a guy
how to be a good shooter. Yeah.

1826
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
But then I didn't look at the whole rest
of the Dang pie chart and realize that

1827
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:36,310
if I fixed all that other stuff,
they'd be an even better shooter.

1828
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:38,770
Exponentially better. Right.

1829
01:50:39,490 --> 01:50:43,780
And Yeah. That, that,
that was something that,

1830
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:48,070
that actually helping guys, and
there were stuff that this is,

1831
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:52,630
this is something I really failed at
is like, I could see guys messing up,

1832
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:58,050
but I didn't want to
have that uncomfortable
conversation with them to like,

1833
01:50:58,330 --> 01:51:02,500
Bro, you gotta you to kind of
fix this. Like, Hey, you know,

1834
01:51:02,501 --> 01:51:04,990
you've used the analogy before.
If I have a booger hanging out,

1835
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:06,390
I want somebody to tell me. Yeah.

1836
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:11,850
And so I see get mad at them when he
was talking about I wanted that booker

1837
01:51:12,191 --> 01:51:16,390
there. No, I definitely wouldn't.

1838
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,780
I had some of those conversations for
sure. And I'm sure you did too. Like,

1839
01:51:19,781 --> 01:51:24,190
hey bro, this girl, she's not the one
I'm going to tell you that right now.

1840
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,860
Uh, this isn't gonna
work out well for you.

1841
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,700
The problem is getting somebody to listen
to that conversation is real hard when

1842
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:33,700
it comes to the ladies. Yeah.
And that aspect of just,

1843
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:38,200
most times it blows up in your face and
then sometimes you're just like, hey,

1844
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:42,700
I realize that maybe I'm going to lose
my friendship with you. True. But, uh,

1845
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,140
I got to tell you this, and

1846
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:51,880
later on in my career
when I started to, to,

1847
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:56,910
to start like struggling with anger issues
and that were probably a result of my

1848
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:02,460
combat deployments and started to go
sit down with a psych and I would see,

1849
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,680
you know, you were super
angry even before I was,

1850
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:10,120
I was like probably pretty predisposed
to it all. And it just, man,

1851
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:13,540
it just turned it up
to 11. Right. And, uh,

1852
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:19,060
and then I would see myself and other
guys and I would tell him, hey man,

1853
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,790
here's the deal. Here's the psychs number.

1854
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:25,660
I want you just to give them a call and
you don't have to see him after that,

1855
01:52:25,661 --> 01:52:27,220
but do me this favor.

1856
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:32,320
And some guys that would
help and other guys, the guy,

1857
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:36,280
I made the effort and they'll come
to that conclusion at some point,

1858
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:38,680
but it's like some, you
know, we got to look out,

1859
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:42,280
look out for each other and do the best
we can. And that was something that I,

1860
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:44,650
you know, missed out on. Uh,

1861
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,880
I think I probably would have made an
awesome platoon chief about the time I

1862
01:52:49,881 --> 01:52:50,360
was, uh,

1863
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:55,360
ops master chief two echelons above it
and really realized what that job was.

1864
01:52:56,301 --> 01:53:01,240
Because as a platoon chief, one of the
things that I missed out on was, uh,

1865
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,780
that the guys are always looking
at me to set the example.

1866
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:09,770
And so it was one thing during
working hours, I could set an example,

1867
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:14,570
but if I'm a buffoon out drinking too
hard, they're like, you're an idiot.

1868
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,800
Or they follow your
example. They, and they,

1869
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:22,820
they'll follow my example and think that
this is acceptable behavior. Uh, if,

1870
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:26,840
if I'm going to bad mouth my leadership,
which is, I'm embarrassed to say it,

1871
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:28,820
but it's the stuff that if I didn't,

1872
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:34,360
didn't really have my aperture open on
the big picture and would complain about

1873
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:38,620
the command and then I complain in front
of the guys just screwing them over.

1874
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,710
And I did because they're
like, well, he's whining now.

1875
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:45,650
I'm going to go ahead and whine. Uh,

1876
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:50,860
I had issues where like personally I
didn't like the person that I was working

1877
01:53:52,491 --> 01:53:55,910
directly for and that,

1878
01:53:55,911 --> 01:54:00,911
that tainted my interaction
with that person.

1879
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:03,830
I didn't have any relationship with them.

1880
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:08,860
And then my whole platoon would suffer
because I had a bad relationship with the

1881
01:54:10,731 --> 01:54:15,020
next guy up just cause I didn't like him.
Uh, which is complete weeks off. Yeah.

1882
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:15,310
Oh yeah.

1883
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:18,600
I was having a conversation with
Dave Burke. Good. Guilty. Yeah.

1884
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:22,310
And it was, we had, he just quoted me yes.

1885
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:27,790
Yesterday I was hanging out with them
and the quote was like, whatever,

1886
01:54:27,791 --> 01:54:32,020
six months ago we were having a
conversation and I said something like,

1887
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:33,010
Hey Dave,

1888
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,780
whether I love you or hate you,

1889
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:43,540
you won't know either
way. And, and he was like,

1890
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:44,561
yeah. He's like, well,

1891
01:54:44,561 --> 01:54:48,360
it kind of freaks me out cause you're
super nice to me and now I'd say you could

1892
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:51,010
just hate me and don't care. And
you know, we laughed about it,

1893
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:53,740
but that's exactly right.
And that is the truth.

1894
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,920
Like the guys that I hated never knew it.

1895
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:04,270
I mean, to this day they
don't know it. And so, I mean,

1896
01:55:04,271 --> 01:55:07,540
you and I were having a conversation
about a couple of people that I obviously

1897
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:13,050
don't like at all. They
don't know that so,

1898
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,340
so you've gotta be professional at all,

1899
01:55:15,341 --> 01:55:18,100
at all times and it's a
very small number of people.

1900
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,380
Most people are pretty
cool to me, you know,

1901
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,380
and most people support
what I'm trying to get done.

1902
01:55:23,381 --> 01:55:26,170
So I'm pretty lucky in
that way. But yeah, if you,

1903
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:28,900
if you let that out as bad,

1904
01:55:29,170 --> 01:55:33,940
is there ever really a reason not to
be polite? The a very seldom. Yeah.

1905
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:38,920
You can politely punch someone in the
face. Here's what people would freak out.

1906
01:55:38,921 --> 01:55:40,990
Here's what, here's what people
get all like, oh well, you know,

1907
01:55:40,991 --> 01:55:43,650
that's what you're talking about, Jocko.
You're, you're a kiss ass. It's like,

1908
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,330
actually, let me tell you
what I actually want to do.

1909
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,040
What I actually want
to do is I want to win.

1910
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:50,220
What I actually want to do is I want
us to have my platoon able to get the

1911
01:55:50,221 --> 01:55:51,054
support that they need.

1912
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:53,760
What I actually want to do is I want to
be able to have my platoon and get the

1913
01:55:53,761 --> 01:55:56,910
support that they need so that we can
actually do a better job doing our

1914
01:55:56,911 --> 01:55:58,650
mission. That's what I'm doing.

1915
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:02,580
What I care about is
my guys and my mission.

1916
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:06,720
That's what I actually care about and
if I've got to be polite to someone to

1917
01:56:06,721 --> 01:56:07,470
make that happen,

1918
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:10,770
if I've got to overlook the fact that
someone might not be the personality type

1919
01:56:10,771 --> 01:56:15,060
that I particularly like, I don't
care. I don't care. Guess what?

1920
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,040
I'm going to deal with it.
I'm going to accept it.

1921
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:21,330
I'm going to absorb whatever kind of crap
that they want to throw and I'm going

1922
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:22,710
to deal with it. It's fine. Now,

1923
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:28,190
do you get into situations where you
actually have a bad boss that you have to

1924
01:56:28,531 --> 01:56:29,850
show? Let's face it,

1925
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:34,970
if I'm treating you like a piece of shit
and and you or I'm making really bad

1926
01:56:35,611 --> 01:56:38,460
decisions and all you do is
support me and you're a yes man,

1927
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,830
well your guys are going to
lose respect for you. So you,

1928
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:44,370
there's times where you have to say,
hey listen guys, here's what's going on.

1929
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:46,950
I don't agree with everything that
the boss says, but you know what?

1930
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:51,540
He's the boss right now. And what we're
going to do is try. The easiest way,

1931
01:56:51,541 --> 01:56:55,080
the way for me to get him to make
better decisions is if he trusts me.

1932
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:59,040
So right now what we're going to do is
we're going to kick ass and so suck it

1933
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:00,690
up. Quit complaining,

1934
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:04,260
we're going to do a great job and I'm
going to get a better relationship over

1935
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:08,130
him where he will start listening to me
and we'll move forward. And by the way,

1936
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:11,730
unless we're going to have a mutiny,
which we're not going to have,

1937
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:13,440
this is the best option.

1938
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:16,230
The other option is me to have an
antagonistic relationship with the boss,

1939
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:18,450
in which case all he's going
to do is screw us over.

1940
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,880
So how do you guys want to play
this? You know what I mean?

1941
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:24,690
So sometimes you got to be transparent
about that stuff and that's fine too.

1942
01:57:24,691 --> 01:57:27,570
I mean, I've, I've been in situations
where I've had to do that where it's like,

1943
01:57:27,571 --> 01:57:30,090
okay, hey guys, here's what's going on.
I know this seems a little bit crazy.

1944
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:33,480
I know that the boss may seem like
he's making a rash decision on this.

1945
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:37,050
Here's what we're going to do.
Let's explain his perspective.

1946
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:39,480
Here's what the boss is saying. He
doesn't want this to happen again.

1947
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:40,530
He's tightening the news.

1948
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,250
He's tightening the bleach way more
than I want them to, but guess what?

1949
01:57:44,251 --> 01:57:47,760
Let's show him that he can let loose
on the leash again. Let's get in line.

1950
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:51,660
You'll see you've got to have those
conversations sometimes, but broadly,

1951
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:55,620
I'm going to get along with everybody.
Why not? I want to do my mission.

1952
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,760
I want to take care of my guys.

1953
01:57:56,761 --> 01:57:59,370
The best way to do that is if I have good
relationships up and down the chain of

1954
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:03,270
command. Boom. A question. And you know,

1955
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:07,650
I don't like you even in
secret, the secret is out.

1956
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:13,980
Kind of got that either
way. In your view, what um,

1957
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:17,040
what's the difference between that?
How you say like you get along,

1958
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:17,970
like even if you don't,

1959
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:20,670
if you really don't like someone
they will never know in your view.

1960
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:22,530
What's the difference between
that and being like, oh,

1961
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:25,570
what do you call like a to face
or you know, I'm like love to say,

1962
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:29,190
oh he's a toothpaste person or whatever.
One big thing is I'm not, I'm not,

1963
01:58:29,191 --> 01:58:32,720
I'm not, I'm not getting along with
them so that I can so that I can uh,

1964
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:35,930
better my own life. I'm not doing
it so I can take care of me. Yeah.

1965
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:37,380
Cause I don't really care about me.

1966
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:40,740
I'm doing it so I can do my job well so
I can take care of my platoon so I can

1967
01:58:40,741 --> 01:58:43,450
take care of my team so I can accomplish
my mission. That's number one.

1968
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:45,520
If I'm doing it so I
can get the promotion.

1969
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:49,840
I'm actually the guy that I
don't like the guy that like, oh,

1970
01:58:49,841 --> 01:58:51,880
I'm doing this so I can get
promoted. No, I'm not doing that.

1971
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:53,680
And that's another thing.

1972
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:58,270
The troops see through that every single
time they have a name for it in the

1973
01:58:58,271 --> 01:59:01,120
teams. That guy's a ticket
puncher. They're trying to
get their ticket punched.

1974
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,340
Oh, he's just trying to
get his ticket punch.

1975
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,150
He's trying to grab onto that guys,

1976
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:07,600
grab ahold of that person's
coattails and ride him up. You know,

1977
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:10,960
ride them up to the next rank. It's
like, no, everyone sees through that.

1978
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,720
If you're doing the right things for
the right reasons, people are like, hey,

1979
01:59:13,721 --> 01:59:16,750
you know what, Jocko European, I mean,
and many times people will look, dude,

1980
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,560
you're your patient guy. Leif Babin
told me that, hey, you're so patient,

1981
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:22,570
I don't, I don't see how you do. I don't
want to see how you do it. You know?

1982
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:25,690
This is when he was younger. Like,
Bro, how do you deal with that?

1983
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:30,760
I care about our task unit. I
will make this happen. I can,

1984
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:34,090
I can absorb some impacts,
no factor, bring it.

1985
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:39,660
I remember when I was working the club
is a guy who I thought was two faced and

1986
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,440
when I listen to you like you're like,

1987
01:59:41,441 --> 01:59:43,840
oh yeah cause he said that'd
be four that you like.

1988
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:47,520
If you didn't like someone they probably
wouldn't know. And I was like, Oh yeah,

1989
01:59:47,521 --> 01:59:50,740
yeah, that makes sense. You know, cause
it like it helps the relationship,

1990
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:54,360
helps morale, like health helps all
these things. Right. And then so I think,

1991
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,420
well yeah a face guy,

1992
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:59,260
there was a distinct difference and one
of the main things on top of what you

1993
01:59:59,261 --> 02:00:03,250
said because what he said was like,
I think it wouldn't work thorough.

1994
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:07,960
Ultimately view minus a little bit more.
How should I say? Straight forward,

1995
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:12,700
ground level I guess. Can I guess what
you're going to say? Sure. You can.

1996
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,260
Well cause the other option,

1997
02:00:14,261 --> 02:00:18,640
the other answer I was going to give
is I'm not acting differently in one

1998
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:21,850
situation or I don't go,
hey boss. Yes I got it.

1999
02:00:21,851 --> 02:00:24,280
And then go back to the platoon
and go, he's an idiot. No, no, no.

2000
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:27,940
I don't do that. I go, Hey
boss, I, you know what?

2001
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:29,860
And even if it was a situation
where I was saying like,

2002
02:00:29,861 --> 02:00:31,960
I might go back and tell the guys like,
hey guys, this is what's going on.

2003
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:33,370
I would tell the boss,
I wouldn't say boss.

2004
02:00:33,371 --> 02:00:36,190
That sounds like the greatest plan ever.
Yeah, no, I'd say, Hey boss, I'm not,

2005
02:00:36,191 --> 02:00:37,720
I don't think I'm 100% on board with this.

2006
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:39,400
I see some other ways
we could get this done.

2007
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:41,560
If this is what you're
telling me you want me to do,

2008
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:45,300
I'm going to make it happen. But I think
we could, you know, I'm, I'm going to,

2009
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:47,980
I'm so I don't act
differently. Yeah, I'm not,

2010
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:49,900
I'm not a different person
in front of, you know,

2011
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,520
was I was doing an event the other day
and I was like talking to a company and I

2012
02:00:54,521 --> 02:00:58,870
was backstage talking to CEO and we were
just, you know, and all of a sudden,

2013
02:00:58,871 --> 02:01:00,280
you know, there's like, he's like, hey,

2014
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:03,250
it's only another half an hour before
you go on, do you need some time?

2015
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:05,410
And I was like, no,

2016
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:08,590
I don't need any time because the person
that's going to walk out on that stage

2017
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:12,460
is me and I'm not acting any different
way. It's just me. I'm going to,

2018
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:15,250
you know, I don't need to get
into character. I'm in character.

2019
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:17,950
I'm walking around. I mean, this is me.
And he was like, oh, that's awesome.

2020
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:19,370
So same thing. I don't,

2021
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:22,000
when I'm dealing with the boss
that I don't like or whatever,

2022
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:25,840
I don't show that to anybody.
Yeah. I go act differently.

2023
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,670
But you're also,

2024
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:32,470
you're doing a good idea.
You're doing a good,

2025
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:36,760
you're managing what hills
are worth dying on for sure.

2026
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:40,130
When you go to your boss, so that

2027
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,640
you built up that equity with them,
no doubt about that. When you need it,

2028
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:44,810
you can cash it in.

2029
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:47,330
And that's why you have to establish
those relationships with them.

2030
02:01:47,331 --> 02:01:52,331
And that's what I really failed as as a
young leader before my aperture started

2031
02:01:53,781 --> 02:01:54,591
to get opened up,

2032
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:58,310
before I got introspective and I started
thinking about all this stuff from a

2033
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,180
big picture.

2034
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:00,380
Okay.

2035
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:04,460
And then my little ego was in
the way. Yeah. And, uh, um,

2036
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:05,963
okay.

2037
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,380
You know, if you're not,

2038
02:02:07,410 --> 02:02:11,460
if you're not the guy that is bitching
every time when you do bring something up

2039
02:02:11,461 --> 02:02:12,750
in a respectful manner,

2040
02:02:12,751 --> 02:02:16,440
then they're going to at least
consider what you have to say.

2041
02:02:16,441 --> 02:02:19,000
And nine times out of 10, they're
actually going to go with them. Oh

2042
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,960
they're going to go with it.
Yeah. That's, that's the, uh,

2043
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:27,040
that's the extreme
ownership story at the end.

2044
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:31,120
It was me sitting around with your
task to command to the other tasks and

2045
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:33,440
competitors from all the different
teams and everyone's, you know,

2046
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:36,130
say they got this problem, that problem.
The other problem, you know, and the,

2047
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:40,300
the commodore at the time who was
a friend of mine says, Hey Jocko,

2048
02:02:40,301 --> 02:02:42,820
what do you need? And I was like,
Hey sir, we don't need anything.

2049
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:47,380
We're good to go. And you like
it. You know, for whatever reason,

2050
02:02:47,381 --> 02:02:48,910
I was like the last guy to go.

2051
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,360
So it had even more impact cause everyone
was complaining about this thing or

2052
02:02:52,361 --> 02:02:54,730
the other thing used to lose
and he goes, he goes, Jocko,

2053
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:57,760
which this that they gave it even more
in back cause he's just like, you know,

2054
02:02:57,761 --> 02:03:00,250
he knows me. He goes, Jocko, what do
you need? And I'm like, nothing sir,

2055
02:03:00,251 --> 02:03:02,760
we're good to go. And
you can say, you know,

2056
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:07,060
four months later when I go in there
and I say, hey sir, we need x. He goes,

2057
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:11,650
cool, go to supply. I'm calling them
right now. Boom. Taking care of. That's,

2058
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:12,663
that's how it should be.

2059
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:17,440
Another thing that I was thinking
about when you were talking,

2060
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:21,910
somebody asked me at some
point, you know, which,

2061
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:25,900
what point did you start sort
of like looking at yourself,

2062
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:27,910
kind of what you're talking
about. At what point did,

2063
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:33,120
did I start to look at myself from an
external position and say from a detached

2064
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:37,030
perspective and same weight, are you
being jealous? Are you being resentful?

2065
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:38,470
Are you complaining?

2066
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:43,090
I can tell you right now that when I
stepped into a leadership position,

2067
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,850
what I knew was that as you said,

2068
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:50,500
every guy in my platoon is looking at me.

2069
02:03:50,830 --> 02:03:55,480
And I looked at myself the same way
I s because as a young enlisted guy,

2070
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:58,690
cause my first leadership
inside of Mattoon was as an,

2071
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:03,100
as an assistant platoon commander. You
know, it was an ensign and so sure,

2072
02:04:03,101 --> 02:04:05,790
I was a little bit, you know,
when I was an e five Oh is this,

2073
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:10,840
oh is a three platoon e five and
are you in a leadership position?

2074
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:15,190
You know, a little bit. Sure.
But not really a little bit.

2075
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,350
When I was a platoon ensign,

2076
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:21,940
I was thinking the whole time these guys
are looking at me just like I used to

2077
02:04:21,941 --> 02:04:23,140
look at my officer.

2078
02:04:23,590 --> 02:04:28,540
So if I complained that it's cold or
I complained that it's because when my

2079
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:32,380
officers used to do that,
dude, this sucks. Oh really?

2080
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:35,650
I'd be like, I would,
I would just, I would,

2081
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:42,060
I just fee. I would get
furious and that's why,

2082
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:45,770
that's when I really started
looking at myself and I'll,

2083
02:04:45,771 --> 02:04:47,550
I'll quite frankly,

2084
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:52,560
when I started putting in an officer
package as a young enlisted guy and I was

2085
02:04:52,561 --> 02:04:54,300
like, wait a second, these guys,

2086
02:04:54,301 --> 02:04:57,720
I want these guys to think that
I actually should be in charge.

2087
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:00,570
I needed to tighten it up. They're
looking at me right now thinking,

2088
02:05:00,571 --> 02:05:04,280
why does Jocko think he should be
an officer? Here's why. Here's,

2089
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,690
I need to act like I
actually deserve this.

2090
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:12,170
So that was a real precursor to me
looking at myself from the outside saying,

2091
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:14,520
man,

2092
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:18,480
I know what it's like to be an e five in
a platoon looking at the officer going,

2093
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:22,950
Oh, you forgot that piece of gear.
Did you? And you're in charge of me.

2094
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:25,110
You're making more money than me.

2095
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,080
You're making the decisions
tonight on this operation.

2096
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:32,010
You didn't bring your handset.
Really that's where we're at.

2097
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,960
I know what that felt like.

2098
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:37,440
And so I held myself to a high
standard because I didn't,

2099
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:42,390
didn't want somebody to be looking
at me thinking jock was complaining.

2100
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:46,110
He's weak, he's making a, he's,
he forgot a piece of gear.

2101
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:49,590
He didn't show up on time.
He didn't show up on time.

2102
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:52,710
You know how many times I was late when
I was in the u s navy for 20 years.

2103
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,460
Zero, zero times late.

2104
02:05:57,030 --> 02:06:00,780
Zero never wide paranoia,

2105
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,490
high level of paranoia.

2106
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,440
Don't want to have guys like when my
officers were late and I look at them and

2107
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:11,280
think, oh, you can't even show up on
time. You're in charge of me. You know,

2108
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:16,020
that's a young arrogant kid for sure.
Absolutely. That's me. But I, I,

2109
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:21,530
I ate that and I held onto it and that's
one of the first things that made me,

2110
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:26,910
and at some point it turned from
this kind of hostility into like,

2111
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:30,630
you need to be a better person. You
know, if you're going to be in charge.

2112
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:33,810
It went from like this attitude that I'm
kind of portraying right now of like,

2113
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,020
oh you suck into like, hey,

2114
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,910
you need to do a better job. You need
to hold yourself to a high standard,

2115
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:46,110
you need to be a better person. If
you're being charged with these guys,

2116
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:49,470
you need to hold the line and you need
to elevate that line. So that had,

2117
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:54,360
that definitely had a big impact on me.
And Bro, if anybody knows this, you do,

2118
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:59,040
you knew me when I was at
e for 20 years old maniac.

2119
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,830
Right. And then you, you
know, you ran into me what,

2120
02:07:01,831 --> 02:07:04,350
however many years later and you're like,
let me seems a little bit different,

2121
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:05,213
you know,

2122
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:08,910
not totally different but cause even
when I was a young kid I was fired up.

2123
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:13,350
Oh yeah. But you know, I had to elevate,

2124
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:18,360
had to elevate some. Yeah. That
introspection is something that,

2125
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:21,270
that I didn't figure out until way later,

2126
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:25,860
but I'm sure glad I'm dead
cause I think it paid off.

2127
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:33,060
It's, that's one of the things,
and it's one of those things that,

2128
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:38,230
you know, did your dad
ever give you any advice?

2129
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:43,330
Yeah. So did mine. How much I listened to?

2130
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:46,240
This is about the same amount
as I listened to my dad.

2131
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:50,080
It's one of those things
where you're, you just,

2132
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:53,260
there's some things
that you have that you,

2133
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,770
it's like you can't be taught Yay,
but you, you can use it. Like,

2134
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:58,870
someone can't tell you
this for some reason.

2135
02:07:58,871 --> 02:08:01,900
There's somethings that people can't
tell you unless you can just completely

2136
02:08:01,901 --> 02:08:04,120
open your mind and get humble
and put your ego in check,

2137
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:09,121
which is really hard to do when you're
22 2124 like there's things that I look

2138
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:13,630
at and I go, Oh, you know what? I've
heard that before. I learned that lesson.

2139
02:08:13,631 --> 02:08:15,400
I got told that lesson,
but I didn't learn it.

2140
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:20,160
But it's, you can pick it up pretty
Dang quick by by example. And so,

2141
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:22,890
you know, how often do you
get people asking you, well,

2142
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:26,700
how do I get that guy over there
to take extreme ownership? Yeah.

2143
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:29,370
It's like you do it. That's true.

2144
02:08:29,371 --> 02:08:34,230
You take extreme ownership and it
will be contagious. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

2145
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:39,330
and in, in that manner, when
people see those modeled behaviors,

2146
02:08:40,890 --> 02:08:45,120
then it just goes out and it, it goes
back to that thing that life talks about.

2147
02:08:45,121 --> 02:08:49,080
There's no bad teams, there's
bad leaders and I've seen groups,

2148
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:52,950
seal platoons and seal troops that have
brought talented them. Oh, for sure.

2149
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:54,660
And then they'll have kind of a,

2150
02:08:54,661 --> 02:08:59,661
a guy come in that's a tyrant and an
egomaniac and that will permeate into

2151
02:09:02,641 --> 02:09:06,270
everybody the same way as you know,

2152
02:09:06,271 --> 02:09:08,830
the one all I see that
you're talking about that,

2153
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:12,150
that I've worked around
everywhere that guy goes,

2154
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:14,490
he lifts everybody else.

2155
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:18,630
Everyone that's around him becomes
better by his example. Yeah.

2156
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:22,890
Yup. Any other mistakes

2157
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:28,350
or major mistakes? You know,

2158
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:32,820
it just back to being a,
when I was at the troop,

2159
02:09:32,821 --> 02:09:36,000
senior enlisted advisor
over in Afghanistan and we
were doing the remain over

2160
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:41,001
day operations and there were a lot of
my younger guys that didn't understand

2161
02:09:41,071 --> 02:09:44,050
why we weren't going, why
we weren't just going in,

2162
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:47,010
hitting a target and coming out
during the same cycle of darkness.

2163
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:48,810
They felt like that
would be more effective.

2164
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:53,790
And instead of sitting down with them
and explaining to them why we were doing

2165
02:09:53,791 --> 02:09:56,430
what we were doing, I would just
tell him shut up and get out.

2166
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,410
And you know, hindsight not,

2167
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:05,070
not the right thing to do because then
they really don't know why they're doing

2168
02:10:05,071 --> 02:10:06,540
what they're doing. And then there's,

2169
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:10,350
there's resentment that's building and
then they're just not going to be the

2170
02:10:10,351 --> 02:10:13,770
most effective at what
they've got going on.

2171
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:17,850
Man, I wish we could do
this whole job over again.

2172
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:23,090
We kind of can though. I mean it's, it
goes back to the resentment thing and,

2173
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:27,710
and another bad, our word
is that regret. I've,

2174
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:32,750
I've learned like all these Dang mistakes
I've made and every big setback that

2175
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:34,010
I've

2176
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,420
experienced in my life,

2177
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:39,770
I feel like it's kind of set me up
for success through moving forward.

2178
02:10:39,771 --> 02:10:43,760
So it's Kinda like glacier, you know,
every time I've taken like a foot back,

2179
02:10:43,761 --> 02:10:48,030
I then move forward.
Yeah. Three feet. Yeah.

2180
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,670
Learn from it and press on.

2181
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:53,900
What's interesting for me is as
I look back at my career now,

2182
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:57,410
and I was actually doing this when
I was thinking about mistakes, man,

2183
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:01,230
and I was actually talking to,
uh, Dave Burke, the deal, Dave

2184
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:07,960
and like all the things that
I talk about all the time now,

2185
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:12,860
I did those things. Like when I was a
platoon commander, I was doing this stuff.

2186
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:17,420
I wasn't, I wasn't as crystallized, but
like when I was a task unit commander,

2187
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,720
boom, I was, this is what I was
doing, this is what I was doing.

2188
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:24,980
It wasn't like I had it crystallized.
It wasn't like I had this like, oh,

2189
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:28,700
this is what I had seen enough. And
most of it I'd seen, as you just said,

2190
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:32,810
through modeling from some good officers
and from some bad officers and some

2191
02:11:32,811 --> 02:11:35,150
good chiefs and some bad
chiefs where I'd say, oh,

2192
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:37,520
that's all what that I'm going to,
hey, why does that guy do that?

2193
02:11:37,521 --> 02:11:39,830
He always tells me what's going okay,
I'm going to always do that. You know,

2194
02:11:39,831 --> 02:11:44,240
like that kind of thing.
It's, but, but like you said,

2195
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:46,910
when you get done with the job,
you look at it and be like, man,

2196
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:49,940
let me just do that one more time cause
I will knock this thing out of the park.

2197
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:53,930
So when is the moment, do you
think for you that you're,

2198
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:58,940
the collective light bulb went off and
you kind of put a lot of this together,

2199
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:01,940
the collective well that, you know,

2200
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
the first FTX is a trade at when you
got there. And that was part of it.

2201
02:12:05,001 --> 02:12:10,001
Like I like my assistant
platoon commander in my OIC,

2202
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:15,740
um, I was telling him this stuff,
you know, I was like, hey man,

2203
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:19,070
here's what's going on. Like, Hey,
we needed to do this. Hey you,

2204
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:22,820
when you go in and brief this guy,
you need to be like this, this stuff.

2205
02:12:22,821 --> 02:12:27,590
I was doing it, but then the next
deployment, it was like when I was,

2206
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:32,150
you know, when I was working with Lafe
and Seth, you know, it was me saying,

2207
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:36,470
hey man, come here. And, and you know,
those guys would whip out the freaking,

2208
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:40,460
uh, the wheel books. You know, like
after they realized what was going on,

2209
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:44,870
which was like three days
into our, our, our task unit,

2210
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:48,290
I'd be like, hey, check
this out. And Boom,

2211
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:51,170
they'd get out and they'd write and they'd
write down like, okay, this is what,

2212
02:12:51,171 --> 02:12:53,840
okay, got it. Yes, that makes sense. And,

2213
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:59,180
but as far as actually taking it and
crystallizing, I was absolutely my first,

2214
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:04,210
the first FTX I went on with [inaudible]
and watched it watch a task and you're

2215
02:13:04,281 --> 02:13:06,120
out there just fall apart and, and,

2216
02:13:06,121 --> 02:13:08,060
and all I was doing was
sitting there thinking,

2217
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:14,270
if this was my task unit number one,
here's what I'd be doing. And number two,

2218
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:16,970
when I got back, I'd be telling the
platoon commander this, this, and this.

2219
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:18,980
I'd be telling those guys, Hey,
this is where you screwed up.

2220
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:22,640
And I just was watching it
and go, okay, all right. Here.

2221
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:26,390
I basically condensed everything that
I had told my guys and said, okay,

2222
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:30,650
here's what you guys need to do. And
that was cover move, simple, prioritize.

2223
02:13:30,651 --> 02:13:33,720
Next you can decentralize
command the answers to so many,

2224
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:35,010
the answers to all problems.

2225
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:39,250
Oops. Boil down to four things and
they all kind of overlap. Yeah,

2226
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:40,780
they definitely are
intertwined and they overlap.

2227
02:13:40,781 --> 02:13:44,110
And you do have to throw extreme
ownership on there only because,

2228
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:45,580
okay.

2229
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:49,360
If you don't take ownership
of the problems then they're
not going to get solved

2230
02:13:49,361 --> 02:13:50,710
and that is going to hurt you.

2231
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:55,520
So yeah. Yeah. At at the muster,

2232
02:13:55,790 --> 02:14:00,230
JP was saying some stuff that really
stuck with me and he said it out at the,

2233
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:03,530
at the PT and he's like, hey everybody,

2234
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:06,440
we get to be here.

2235
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:08,890
Okay,

2236
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:12,010
this is an opportunity
that you have to be here.

2237
02:14:13,390 --> 02:14:16,660
And he said that. And I thought, man,

2238
02:14:16,661 --> 02:14:21,160
that is just an awesome perspective to
had. I called him up yesterday, I'm like,

2239
02:14:21,161 --> 02:14:24,460
Hey I want to talk
about this and you know,

2240
02:14:24,461 --> 02:14:28,720
just fill me on and on what your
mindset is. And he goes, yeah, he goes,

2241
02:14:28,721 --> 02:14:31,450
you don't want to cause,
cause when he was at buds,

2242
02:14:31,451 --> 02:14:35,830
the way he looked at a four mile time
Brun which I hated four mile time runs,

2243
02:14:35,831 --> 02:14:39,580
I just, I would throw up
every four mile time run his,

2244
02:14:39,581 --> 02:14:43,180
his attitude was I get
to do this for bile time.

2245
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:47,230
Brun so if you take that and you
start applying that to everything,

2246
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:50,290
heck yeah. They just don't have,

2247
02:14:50,291 --> 02:14:55,150
there's no room to bitch
about a damn thing. You know,

2248
02:14:55,151 --> 02:15:00,151
I moved through the airport today and
I see a guy with no legs and I'm like,

2249
02:15:01,150 --> 02:15:05,550
man, my life is so good.
Both my legs work and,

2250
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:08,410
and I shouldn't, I shouldn't
have a complaint in the world.

2251
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:12,100
One of the, one of the last thing,

2252
02:15:12,101 --> 02:15:16,090
and we're getting kind of like getting
pretty long here, but um, you know,

2253
02:15:16,091 --> 02:15:18,700
one of the things I w I
wanted you to talk about,

2254
02:15:18,701 --> 02:15:20,370
and I know this isn't really well, it's,

2255
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:24,130
I guess it is because as
a leader of your family,

2256
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:30,490
um, I know that we, we have to,
we have to lead our family. Right.

2257
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:35,020
And what you, you, you posted
something the other day that was legit.

2258
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:39,670
Um, I think it was called a
promise to my daughter and I was,

2259
02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:42,100
I just asked if you could
bring it in cause I think if,

2260
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:45,970
if you don't mind
reading that to everyone,

2261
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:50,320
I think it's a pretty cool set
up of how to take ownership of,

2262
02:15:51,070 --> 02:15:53,410
of your family and how to, how, what you,

2263
02:15:53,411 --> 02:15:58,411
what you as a leader and as a dad
and as a father and as a husband,

2264
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:03,760
what you are putting forth as your goal,

2265
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:08,260
as your objective, as your
strategy with your daughter.

2266
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:10,480
And I thought it was pretty awesome.
So if you wouldn't mind reading that,

2267
02:16:10,481 --> 02:16:11,314
that'd be cool.

2268
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:15,120
Absolutely. A promise to my daughter.

2269
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:16,960
Okay.

2270
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:21,370
I will love you always,
unconditionally. No matter what.

2271
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:24,630
I will not pamper you.

2272
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:30,050
This will forge a resilience that will
help you conquer all of life's obstacles.

2273
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:31,960
Yeah.

2274
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:35,350
I do not intake intent
to raise a princess,

2275
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:40,000
but rather a warrior with fire in
her heart and ice in her veins.

2276
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:44,410
In my mind there is nothing you can't do.

2277
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:46,900
No job or goal beyond your reach.

2278
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:54,460
I will challenge you so that you stand
confidently on your own two feet.

2279
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:55,970
Yeah.

2280
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:59,930
And I will set the example on how to
treat those you love so that when you

2281
02:16:59,931 --> 02:17:02,840
choose a partner, it will be
someone that lifts you up.

2282
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:04,420
Fine.

2283
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:08,530
I will invest my time and energy
in you so that when I am gone,

2284
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:13,750
enough memories of me will be with you
in your heart to keep forever stand tall

2285
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:19,840
with your shoulders back. This
world is yours for the taking.

2286
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:25,860
Boom. Yeah. That's awesome man.

2287
02:17:26,330 --> 02:17:30,200
And obviously I would think the
same stuff for my son. Yeah. Yeah.

2288
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:33,443
But

2289
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:37,830
well, you'll have to write one a little
bit specific to him. Very similar,

2290
02:17:37,831 --> 02:17:42,780
I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. No,
that's awesome. And uh,

2291
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:46,410
that, that's really cool and I'm
better, a lot of people will a,

2292
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:51,840
listen to it and B, plagiarize it
and eh, you know, ab absolutely.

2293
02:17:51,841 --> 02:17:56,400
Yeah. For their own family. But
no, that's awesome man. And um,

2294
02:17:56,490 --> 02:18:00,180
like I said, we're, we're
going pretty long right now,

2295
02:18:00,210 --> 02:18:04,470
so that's a good place to wrap
up. This one. What is this?

2296
02:18:04,471 --> 02:18:07,860
Now we've done something
like seven or eight hours.

2297
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:12,230
Seven or eight hours. Awesome. So, uh,

2298
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:14,730
echo speaking of,

2299
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:16,633
okay.

2300
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:21,700
Having a strategy to get to where we want
to go to be a little bit better across

2301
02:18:24,231 --> 02:18:29,000
the board in all aspects. What do you got
for us yet? Some tips. Oh, by the way.

2302
02:18:29,090 --> 02:18:32,390
Yeah, I read that on
Instagram if I'm not mistaken.

2303
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:35,600
And I considered plagiarizing
it please. My daughter.

2304
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:38,210
Now I got the confirmation or what
do you, what do you guys call it?

2305
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:41,840
Cleared hot. Yeah. All
right. There you go.

2306
02:18:42,590 --> 02:18:46,130
And you were right about the, the
two phase things when you said, oh,

2307
02:18:46,131 --> 02:18:47,870
let me guess what you're gonna say. Oh,

2308
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:52,140
you're absolutely a hundred
percent correct. Cool.
Yeah. Like act one way like,

2309
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:55,970
hey boss, hey, you know, hates them.
Nope. Didn't they? I think you're awesome.

2310
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:58,720
Yes. And then right when he leaves,
then you know, yeah. You see that guy?

2311
02:18:59,050 --> 02:19:02,430
Let's see. Okay. Yeah. Go do that.

2312
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:06,940
Alcohol last. Yes, we are on
the path. Okay, good. Straight.

2313
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:11,180
The strategic versus a tactic. Tactical,

2314
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,560
long game. Short game. I know you've
been in new long game picture,

2315
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:18,140
small picture, all the same thing.

2316
02:19:18,170 --> 02:19:23,170
When people ask Echo what's
like the big takeaway?

2317
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:26,640
I think that's his primary
takeaway. Biggest yes.

2318
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:30,980
Focusing on the long game, which
he's a football so you know,

2319
02:19:30,981 --> 02:19:34,130
he like thinks the game thing
or Super Mario brothers.

2320
02:19:34,570 --> 02:19:38,270
Well more appropriately is, but you
know, as opposed to thinking short game.

2321
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:41,960
Yeah. And if you look at your
life every day in long game,

2322
02:19:41,961 --> 02:19:45,260
slash strategic instead of short
game, slash tactical, yeah.

2323
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:48,140
You're going to end up in a better
spot. Yeah. And when I say the biggest,

2324
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:52,010
I mean that's the one that applies
to like the whole my whole life.

2325
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:56,240
There's the other stuff. No complaining.
The Allan was, that's a big one.

2326
02:19:56,270 --> 02:20:01,220
No complaining, no blaming of
course. And then, um, resent.

2327
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:05,500
I never really had the
resent the jealousy thing.

2328
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:08,640
That's something I really
had kind of entwined. Um,

2329
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:13,010
that one to me always felt obvious
when I, when I, when I discovered, um,

2330
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:17,930
like anger. Like when you're mad, that's
like something up with you kinda thing,

2331
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:22,520
you know, it's natural, whatever.
That's one of the biggest,

2332
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:26,450
one of the biggest things I got from
doing this podcast is captain plumb seen

2333
02:20:26,451 --> 02:20:28,670
when they were in the,
in the Hanoi Hilton.

2334
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:33,710
Yeah and him saying if you were annoyed
with your prison bunk mate it was your

2335
02:20:35,841 --> 02:20:39,730
fault. I was like hit
me diamond bullet. Yeah.

2336
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:42,290
Right between the eyes.
That was extreme ownership.

2337
02:20:42,291 --> 02:20:47,270
Next level cause always
annoyed with that other person.

2338
02:20:47,271 --> 02:20:52,010
You don't know actually know what. That's
my fault. Yeah that was good. When I,

2339
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:54,710
when I discovered it was a book
I was reading called Mind Games,

2340
02:20:54,711 --> 02:20:59,570
I mentioned it before and it said
small little passage said basically.

2341
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:02,720
Um, in a nutshell like
when you have anger issues,

2342
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:05,510
not to say that when you get mad but
it just as if you have anger issues,

2343
02:21:05,511 --> 02:21:07,280
it has something to do
with your self esteem.

2344
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:10,490
Like you have low self esteem
and that hit me really hard.

2345
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:13,520
Like aw man that hit me so hard that I
was like man I can never get mad ever

2346
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:14,354
again.

2347
02:21:14,470 --> 02:21:18,960
That's like a reverse psychology on
your ego because then your ego is going,

2348
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:22,940
not going to turn myself down because
I got low self esteem here. Oh yes.

2349
02:21:22,970 --> 02:21:25,700
Genius. Same thing with
the drinking. You, you uh,

2350
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:28,130
you put it into words good
where kids drinking, right?

2351
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:31,430
I ended up figuring out or it
being revealed to me that drew,

2352
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:32,091
like when you drink,

2353
02:21:32,091 --> 02:21:34,490
when you have a drink and you want another
one and you want another one and your

2354
02:21:34,491 --> 02:21:36,260
mind and the more you have,
the more you sort of want,

2355
02:21:36,261 --> 02:21:38,270
you can't really stop or
whatever. You don't want to stop.

2356
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,600
It's just your brain tricking you,
you know, it's your brain tricky.

2357
02:21:41,601 --> 02:21:44,870
Like your brain is chemically saying,
oh, we need this. Hey, we need this.

2358
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:48,100
You know, we need more of whatever you
felt like you were getting manipulated.

2359
02:21:48,130 --> 02:21:51,950
Felt like I was a sucker as you said.
And my ego was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

2360
02:21:51,951 --> 02:21:54,040
I'm not a sucker. I don't
care if it's my own brain.

2361
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:55,130
I'm not a sucker or whatever.

2362
02:21:55,131 --> 02:21:58,280
And it was just that easy man
that easy to control it. But yes,

2363
02:21:58,310 --> 02:22:02,620
it is a reverse psychology
on your ego. Good.

2364
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:05,480
As opposed to regular
psychology on your ego,

2365
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:08,340
short term and longterm
did you get to right?

2366
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:14,400
I thought I'm going to use
the word reverse reversal
reversal that that's a true

2367
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:17,710
going to handle the transition
negative, negative. I'm saying. Yeah,

2368
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:20,270
I'm on the first, uh,
long game and short game.

2369
02:22:20,610 --> 02:22:24,080
Jujitsu is one of those long
game short game situations,

2370
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:25,920
hundred percent part of the path.

2371
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,590
Part of the many activities that
we're all doing on the path.

2372
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:33,480
Jason Gardner got into good shape,
uh, easily. So we're exercising,

2373
02:22:33,481 --> 02:22:36,570
we're doing Jujitsu, we're eating
healthy. We're not getting mad at people.

2374
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,630
We're not showing resentment.
We're not complaining

2375
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:43,230
various other things. So we'll go
over it anyway. Did you do this?

2376
02:22:43,231 --> 02:22:45,690
What did you do? Did you just said you
going to need a g? What gear do we get?

2377
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,590
Origin G, get it from origin main.com.
This is where all their stuff,

2378
02:22:49,591 --> 02:22:53,490
by the way, is made all in
America from the cotton.

2379
02:22:53,491 --> 02:22:56,370
They grow from the ground
all the way to the end,

2380
02:22:57,690 --> 02:23:01,810
from the dirt to the shirt
shirt, all that. Anyway,

2381
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:06,060
origin main.com so you get the
stones. Yes. American Americana.

2382
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:10,320
Yes. Which we are producing right now.

2383
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:16,260
We are hiring more people to produce
even more so my apologies on it.

2384
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:19,560
If you're ordering right now, maybe we
don't have your size. We're working at,

2385
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:22,740
we're working it hard. We're
growing. Yeah. That was good.

2386
02:23:22,741 --> 02:23:25,830
Some people at the higher appreciate
them. They have the 28 inch in seam.

2387
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:31,400
Usually I can only get 30
oh, there you go. Boom.

2388
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:35,190
Accommodating everybody. Yeah. There's a
few guys at the muster who had them on.

2389
02:23:35,250 --> 02:23:39,090
I was like, I'll hold couple of
people crowded, man. It's good.

2390
02:23:39,091 --> 02:23:42,180
I don't have anybody that, those are the
breaks and that's just the life I live.

2391
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:46,390
Also, if sweat pants and shirts
and whatnot, other stuff on there.

2392
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:50,070
Also supplements, supplements, the
best kinds of supplements. By the way.

2393
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:52,260
There was some,

2394
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:56,610
there was some people freaking
out on the strawberries that,

2395
02:23:56,620 --> 02:24:00,720
have you tried to strawberry slayer
yet? Yeah. That's just not me. Oh,

2396
02:24:00,721 --> 02:24:03,390
you don't want, I'm not
that kind of strawberry guy.

2397
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:07,050
I definitely got some and tried. It
didn't work. I'm, I'm a hardcore mint.

2398
02:24:07,051 --> 02:24:09,320
Chocolate chip and then
the vanilla for Mega,

2399
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:12,990
you get that vanilla gorilla and
throw it inside your, uh, your coffee.

2400
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:18,540
That's your sweetener kind of.
That's your [inaudible] boom.

2401
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:20,510
Dope. Yeah, that was good. Methane.

2402
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:23,590
And then that's iris is
mixing that in when you,

2403
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:28,620
when you drink that in the morning.
Like what time? Like right at,

2404
02:24:28,621 --> 02:24:32,790
right after I PT. And then how long, when
do you feel hungry for your next meal?

2405
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:37,050
Oh, I don't eat until like one
cheering or two o'clock check

2406
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:43,380
in. I was just putting it in everything.
She's making multiple pancakes,

2407
02:24:43,381 --> 02:24:46,740
making milk, whatever and
smoothies and all that stuff.

2408
02:24:46,741 --> 02:24:49,710
So we go through quite a bit of milk in
our house. Yeah. And the kids love it.

2409
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:53,610
Yeah. That's strawberry can make
like a, it's like a milk shake.

2410
02:24:53,611 --> 02:24:56,640
Smoothie hybrid. Here's
what I said the other day.

2411
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:59,760
If you put in front of me

2412
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:05,190
Haagen daas strawberry
milkshake. Yes. Right? Sure.

2413
02:25:05,790 --> 02:25:08,850
Nestle's strawberry quick. Yes.

2414
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:14,450
And Strawberry slayer milk and I
was going to die in 15 minutes,

2415
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:19,680
so we're just going pure satisfaction
short. You're short term.

2416
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,390
The long game is out of the picture.

2417
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:25,180
I'm going straight to the strawberries
are moke cause that's what tastes the

2418
02:25:25,181 --> 02:25:28,630
best. That is the taste test, right?
No one does a taste test like that.

2419
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:30,340
I'm not filling a caveat on there,

2420
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:35,140
but the hoggin downs is going to be sugary
or the Nestle's Quik is going to give

2421
02:25:35,141 --> 02:25:38,260
you a sugar. No, we're taking the
long game. Totally out the picture.

2422
02:25:38,261 --> 02:25:43,090
We're going to cure short term
tactical taste. Where you at?

2423
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:47,900
Strawberry slayer Brigit
names awesome too.

2424
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:51,670
You know. I agree. Also joint Pete.

2425
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:55,360
Pete was trying to like tell me
product names and he's like, he's like,

2426
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:59,440
and Pete Goes, you know pizza
like Mr Creative. Yes. Right.

2427
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:02,470
He's like getting to be creative. And
he even told me, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

2428
02:26:02,471 --> 02:26:04,570
He'll tell you. He was like,
that's his creative stuff, right.

2429
02:26:04,571 --> 02:26:07,750
So pizza hit me up. He says, so
he set up sending me all these,

2430
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,770
all these things. Strawberry sniper.
I'll have to pull out the list.

2431
02:26:11,771 --> 02:26:15,310
It's so funny. Everything
these random military terms.

2432
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:19,330
But yeah, don't catch Pete.
He gets into these moods.

2433
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:23,950
Creativity is just coming out of his
coming out of his brain and he'll start

2434
02:26:23,951 --> 02:26:27,730
hitting me up with texts
about strawberry sniper.

2435
02:26:28,510 --> 02:26:33,490
I'm not ever, I'm not that mad at that
man. He had some ones we used to slayer,

2436
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:34,450
so when he hears sniper I'm like,

2437
02:26:34,451 --> 02:26:36,650
oh I see why that was
like a distant second one.

2438
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:39,940
I'm trying to think of some of the
other whack ones that came cause sorry.

2439
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:44,860
Yeah, some of them were real
funny actually. I texted him,

2440
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:49,120
he texted Brian and me, he's texting us
all these names and I was like, okay,

2441
02:26:49,121 --> 02:26:53,110
stop no more. He just
started laughing. Yeah.

2442
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:56,420
So check that. Yup. Well he's
probably had a, he had a pray.

2443
02:26:56,421 --> 02:27:00,220
A little too much discipline go.
Yeah, potentially. Yeah. Yeah.

2444
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:05,080
How many discipline go are you
on right now? For daily? No.

2445
02:27:05,081 --> 02:27:06,100
Per Day? Yeah.

2446
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:11,440
Just cause I had to get up at 3:00
AM what time did you go to bed? What?

2447
02:27:11,441 --> 02:27:15,490
10:10 PM so you're on five hours of
sleep, right? Did you sleep on the plane?

2448
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:19,710
No. Can you sleep on planes? Yes.
I can see sometimes when I was,

2449
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:23,290
I was just writing all these notes
and you're ready for this. And some,

2450
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:27,020
sometimes I can just turn it off, but
I wasn't able to sleep on the point.

2451
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:28,990
I can sleep on planes, not
as well as echo though.

2452
02:27:29,230 --> 02:27:33,850
Echo gets the world championship belt.
We're seeing my plans. We get on a plane,

2453
02:27:33,851 --> 02:27:38,320
I got to play with them within
within 38 seconds. He's asleep.

2454
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:40,990
He looks and he puts his sunglasses
on. He looks like he's awake,

2455
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:46,000
but it's a lie. So yeah, so discipline go.

2456
02:27:46,001 --> 02:27:49,480
That's a good situation. I
take two every morning check.

2457
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:53,960
So get up in the morning to
discipline, go and then um,

2458
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:58,210
joint warfare taking morning and
night. Yep. And I noticed a different,

2459
02:27:58,211 --> 02:28:01,630
how many do you take? I'm taking
two in the morning and two at night.

2460
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:05,330
And then what's your body
weight? Right now? One 16.

2461
02:28:05,890 --> 02:28:10,660
I take three. I take three.
Joint Warfare, three curl oil,

2462
02:28:10,690 --> 02:28:15,010
mourning three joint wear for
three Carrillo night. If I'm,

2463
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:19,360
if I got a little little situation
going on too, I might, if I'm around,

2464
02:28:19,361 --> 02:28:22,190
I'll take three during the day.
For the lunchtime too. Dang.

2465
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:26,180
She just got the infusion infusion
situation fusion. That's good man.

2466
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:29,510
So that's that. Yeah. Don't forget
about the warrior kid milk too. Yeah.

2467
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:33,540
For the warrior kits. Yeah.
Well, so, all right, well let's,

2468
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:34,670
let's talk about it then.

2469
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:38,900
What to what in your opinion or you can
mock strawberry or strawberry slayer,

2470
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:43,910
strawberry slayers. Thicker. It's like
a shake. Yeah, I think it actually,

2471
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:45,800
I think the way that they are,

2472
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:49,910
they are actually suitable
for their audience,

2473
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:53,240
so that's true. The
strawberry, the warrior kid,

2474
02:28:53,241 --> 02:28:56,990
strawberry milk is just a little bit,
a little bit in the lighter we'll say,

2475
02:28:57,170 --> 02:29:00,200
cause it does have less
protein and the one,

2476
02:29:00,201 --> 02:29:02,270
the adult one is a
little bit heavier Gush,

2477
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:06,940
a little bit more like that hog and
Naas hit her. I just think that,

2478
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:12,380
where are you at Theo
Vaughn with that hit her or

2479
02:29:14,390 --> 02:29:19,130
also Jocko white tea. Yes. Very
reframed. I'm going to say the light,

2480
02:29:19,131 --> 02:29:21,230
the nice stuff about it. Very refreshing.

2481
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:25,220
Certified Organic pomegranate
white tea doesn't sound hardcore,

2482
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:28,940
but it can after you dead
lifting 8,000 pounds,

2483
02:29:28,941 --> 02:29:32,420
that is kind of hardcore proven. By the
way, Jason Burton or scientifically,

2484
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:35,870
you know, you go on about that. What
I'm talking about 100% guaranteed.

2485
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:38,810
Can I get sued for that? I, you know,

2486
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:42,590
maybe I guess if there was some that
couldn't hit at 8,000 pound deadlifts,

2487
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:46,790
then they might come at me. Yeah, come
at me. Burlington. I'll say lift harder.

2488
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:48,770
Yeah man. Drink more. You can't. Yeah,

2489
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:51,700
you gotta train 'em cause there's no
way everyone else is dead lifting a

2490
02:29:52,310 --> 02:29:55,310
thousand pounds. What's wrong with
you, the guy? Yep. Yeah, yeah,

2491
02:29:55,390 --> 02:29:58,490
it makes sense. Also, we have a
store, it's called Jocko store.

2492
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:03,140
I think we all know that. This is where
you can get rash guards, tee shirts,

2493
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:08,030
going to represent discipline equals
freedom. Truckers, hats, truckers,

2494
02:30:08,031 --> 02:30:12,250
hats, beanies, some beanies. That man,
I gotta refill the beanies. Go take.

2495
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:16,730
So maybe you don't have beatings
there. Well, politico never wears hats.

2496
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:21,170
So these apparently on no on the bro.
Have you even had a cold head before?

2497
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,450
Yeah, I haven't had a
cold head before. Sure.

2498
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:28,760
Well depends on what you mean by cold,
but you know, yeah, you put the lid on,

2499
02:30:28,761 --> 02:30:32,850
you know, put the lightweight,
put the coldness on the head,

2500
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:35,240
and then right when you shave it,
like with the, what do you call the,

2501
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:39,050
the braiser never the bakery. They say
when you bake your head. That's what,

2502
02:30:39,051 --> 02:30:43,100
that's an expression. Oh yeah. I can
get a little nippy, I guess. Kinda cold.

2503
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:47,390
Well anyways, the rest of us would
like some more beanies online. Yes sir.

2504
02:30:47,391 --> 02:30:50,360
You got it. And for the
summertime, yes sir. No problem.

2505
02:30:50,361 --> 02:30:52,120
You're up in Maine in
the summertime. Yeah.

2506
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:54,910
Or you're up in Michigan
in the summertime. Yeah.

2507
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:59,810
Or you're up in Washington in the
summertime. Once the sun goes down. Yeah.

2508
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:03,890
You can get that little Chile.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree.

2509
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:05,960
And that's how it is
here too, in my opinion.

2510
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:10,370
And you might as well have a beanie that
says discipline equals freedom. Yeah.

2511
02:31:10,371 --> 02:31:13,790
Man. Represent with everything.
Also, the hoodies, like I mentioned,

2512
02:31:13,791 --> 02:31:18,450
lightweight hoodies, lightweight is
Jason Guy. I saw you down at the muster.

2513
02:31:18,451 --> 02:31:20,670
I look good, right? Not
Bad. Well thank you. Oh,

2514
02:31:20,900 --> 02:31:24,240
now we're on the how everyone looks.
Wow. Well it's part of the game.

2515
02:31:24,490 --> 02:31:27,810
They can be part of. Maybe not for
you. Uh, aesthetics wise. Right?

2516
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,980
We got functionality. We have
aesthetics. They're not exclusive. Yeah.

2517
02:31:30,981 --> 02:31:34,170
And you remember I was asking you about
the heavyweights cause that's what I but

2518
02:31:34,171 --> 02:31:38,070
that's what I need up in northeastern
Washington on the Canadian border.

2519
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:39,470
We all work functionally. You're current.

2520
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:43,470
We are working currently at this time
so that by the time fall walls rolls

2521
02:31:43,471 --> 02:31:47,910
around we offer the heaviest
of heavyweight hoodies. Yeah,

2522
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:51,270
that's the plan. Yes.
I'm talking big time.

2523
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:55,050
The real deal for free yet where there'll
be no doubt in your mind you're like

2524
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:55,830
Oh yeah this is a,

2525
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:59,430
this is the heaviest Hoodie I've ever
heard that putting on five pounds. Yeah.

2526
02:31:59,970 --> 02:32:03,480
That's what we want to lead.
But aesthetics, how let's say,

2527
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:07,290
and a factor of 10 is function, right?
You don't have to answer this question.

2528
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:12,300
You need, you need level 10 functionality
obviously aesthetics. What are we,

2529
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:17,250
what are you at what number? A
seven. That's pretty significant.

2530
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:20,640
What do you at zero, zero,
straight up. Zero like the like

2531
02:32:22,350 --> 02:32:25,950
the lightweight. Any anything
having to do with fashion? I think.

2532
02:32:25,951 --> 02:32:29,140
I think you're at a one.
That's what I think. You know,

2533
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:32,730
if there are some things where
I'd be like this looks stupid,

2534
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:35,160
therefore I will not wear
it so that we are correct.

2535
02:32:35,161 --> 02:32:37,860
That puts me in a level one. All
right. Well how about this? You got,

2536
02:32:38,050 --> 02:32:40,950
you got three t four t shirts. One

2537
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:47,820
green like green, green not
oh d green, green, green,

2538
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:52,800
one red, one black, one purple.
Which one are you choosing? Black.

2539
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:57,320
Why looks better, right?
Doesn't get dirty as easy.

2540
02:32:57,440 --> 02:33:01,590
Nah Man. Anyways,

2541
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:05,690
punk card boy. Anyway, some
women's stuff on there too.

2542
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:10,940
It is Jocko store.com this is where
he can get stuff to represent. Yeah,

2543
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,560
check it out like something.
Get something. Did you
say origin maine.com yes.

2544
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:18,860
That's for it. Yes. For the
words. Somebody might want
somebody that strawberry

2545
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:25,490
of course. Man of course. Yes. Also
strawberry, slayer, snap like a, like a,

2546
02:33:25,491 --> 02:33:27,990
like a theme. Like when you say it,
it should be like in the background.

2547
02:33:28,070 --> 02:33:32,930
She goes, strawberry slugger, double bass,

2548
02:33:32,931 --> 02:33:34,850
drum Yammer, and you could do,
could do good. Do, could do good.

2549
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:39,050
You railing you, I don't know if
I agree with that, but you know

2550
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:44,600
named for sure 100% also subscribe to
the podcast if you haven't already on

2551
02:33:44,601 --> 02:33:49,040
iTunes and wherever you get your podcasts
and don't forget about the warrior kid

2552
02:33:49,041 --> 02:33:53,810
podcast. Yes. Which comes out
not as frequently as it should.

2553
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:58,930
It should step up this summer as time
opens up to create and record that

2554
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:06,200
particular podcast and then you can
get some of that more your kids.

2555
02:34:06,201 --> 02:34:10,280
So you're friends with
Matt, right? Yeah. Up there.

2556
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:13,270
Aiden making it on his farm. Irish jokes,

2557
02:34:13,630 --> 02:34:18,370
Irish show trends.com how do
you know him? Through Iris.

2558
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:21,730
You come to your farm? Yeah, we
were going to buy meat from him.

2559
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,180
Then when he came to deliver it to
you, he swung by and visited us.

2560
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,190
I was gone that day so I didn't meet him,

2561
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:30,130
but him and I have chatted on the phone
a whole bunch of times. Awesome. Yeah,

2562
02:34:30,131 --> 02:34:35,131
he's a firefighter up in Aventura county
and he's got a farm as well and his son

2563
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:38,140
Aden was a young warrior kid,

2564
02:34:38,670 --> 02:34:43,570
makes soap so that everyone
in the world can stay clean.

2565
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:48,940
That's a cool, that's a good soap
too by the way. External soap,

2566
02:34:48,941 --> 02:34:50,320
it's not the decorative,

2567
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:54,110
you know the ones that you little neath
makes and it's like here, it's not,

2568
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:59,110
not even supposed to really use it as a
decoration like gift, if you will. Yes.

2569
02:34:59,111 --> 02:35:02,200
Also we have a youtube channel,
the Jocko podcast, youtube channel.

2570
02:35:02,201 --> 02:35:03,940
This is where you can
get the video version.

2571
02:35:03,941 --> 02:35:08,170
Of course you wanna see what Jason
looks like, right? Handsome looking guy.

2572
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:13,510
I'd say, Bro, Jocko,
what? Just take it easy.

2573
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:17,660
Hey Man. Either way, if
you are interested in that.

2574
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:21,370
We have a youtube channel also
some excerpts on there. You know,

2575
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:26,430
we'll cut up little excerpts and sometimes
echo puts cello music behind him and

2576
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:32,230
he puts explosions in them sometimes
when I want to enhance them. Maybe,

2577
02:35:32,231 --> 02:35:35,650
maybe like a certain message that you
talk about hits me hard. I say, Hey,

2578
02:35:35,651 --> 02:35:38,880
let me express this, you
know, put some stuff on them.

2579
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:42,670
You ever feel like maybe we should just
get a couple of cello players in here?

2580
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:45,890
No, I don't tap. I don't ever feel
like that at all. And you know,

2581
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:48,310
I think we should stick with what
we're doing. That's my opinion.

2582
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:51,820
Here's the thing about youtube
though, as far as subscribing,

2583
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:56,110
so it doesn't even matter. And you might
notice Jay, you spend time on Youtube.

2584
02:35:56,400 --> 02:36:00,850
Yes. Like, okay, so here's
what I learned and observed.

2585
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:04,690
If you subscribe to someone on
Youtube, it doesn't matter that much.

2586
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:09,130
Like their stuff won't show up all
the time. Like how you'd expect,

2587
02:36:09,131 --> 02:36:10,570
you'd think like, Oh, if you subscribed,

2588
02:36:10,700 --> 02:36:12,760
their stuff is going to sort of show
up on your, what do you call it,

2589
02:36:12,761 --> 02:36:16,850
the home page or whatever. It
doesn't so much to do that anyway.

2590
02:36:16,851 --> 02:36:19,420
When I get an email, every time
you post something new, okay,

2591
02:36:19,421 --> 02:36:20,254
now you're talking,

2592
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:23,710
now you're talking because when you
subscribe to some money and you do that

2593
02:36:23,711 --> 02:36:26,110
additional step, you
click on the little bell.

2594
02:36:26,170 --> 02:36:29,080
I think it's like right next to or on
the subscribe button or wherever it is

2595
02:36:29,081 --> 02:36:32,260
right there. If you do that,
then you'll get the alert email.

2596
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:36,220
You know my alert ever, my alerts
actually come onto my phone.

2597
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:40,990
They like spring up on that from
youtube or for your Junko podcast.

2598
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:45,640
Just posted a new video that's from
my, from the app. From the Youtube app.

2599
02:36:45,641 --> 02:36:49,090
From the Youtube app. Yes. Which
is pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah.

2600
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:51,970
So if you want that, this is what
I'm saying. So when you subscribe,

2601
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:54,400
it's almost like a half
subscribed, not even a half.

2602
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:58,720
It's like a quarter subscribed. That's
what it is. Cause you're sorta like,

2603
02:36:58,750 --> 02:37:02,350
oh yeah, I officially sorta subscribed,
but you do like, cool. Okay.

2604
02:37:02,351 --> 02:37:03,970
I think we're not going
to let you know a lot of,

2605
02:37:03,971 --> 02:37:06,520
since he described this is way
different. This is different.

2606
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:10,120
I'm saying if you want to subscribe and
you want to get alerts and you want it

2607
02:37:10,121 --> 02:37:13,030
to sort of be in your, what do
you call it, the feed or whatever,

2608
02:37:13,130 --> 02:37:15,860
you've got to get the little bell.
This is what I'm worried about.

2609
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,050
Since you're very decentralized,

2610
02:37:18,051 --> 02:37:20,420
since there's a lot of
decentralized command here. Yes.

2611
02:37:20,930 --> 02:37:23,120
I'm worried that if
people don't subscribe,

2612
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:26,450
all of a sudden you're just going to
start putting the little thing at the end

2613
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:31,451
of your enhanced videos that says that
says like Sharon's click subscribe,

2614
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:37,480
like it shows the little finger. Click
subscribe there and if that happens, no,

2615
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:38,840
we're going to have a problem. Yes sir.

2616
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:43,940
The videos make it centralized
real quick, real quick. Well,

2617
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:48,110
we're not going to worry about that
because I agree with you 100% like share,

2618
02:37:48,111 --> 02:37:51,380
subscribe. Yeah. Hey,
before you watch this video,

2619
02:37:51,410 --> 02:37:53,960
go down to the bottom line
and click subscribe. Now

2620
02:37:56,930 --> 02:38:00,020
I'm just saying, I'm sure there's some
knowing I hate it when I see that,

2621
02:38:00,430 --> 02:38:02,480
but I'm sure there's some
functional, what's the,

2622
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:05,960
what's the equivalent of when you meet
someone, like what's the equivalent of a,

2623
02:38:05,970 --> 02:38:09,260
of a human interaction
where you say that we, we,

2624
02:38:09,261 --> 02:38:12,120
that'd be somebody dropping the
s bomb. Would it be like that?

2625
02:38:12,150 --> 02:38:14,120
But it would be like, like,
hey, good to meet you.

2626
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:17,060
Can I have a pat on the back please?
Like, isn't that basically what it is?

2627
02:38:17,061 --> 02:38:21,290
That's the human interaction equivalent.
Like, Hey, nice to meet you. Um,

2628
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:23,510
give me your phone and I'm going to index.

2629
02:38:23,511 --> 02:38:28,511
I'm going to put my phone number in there
so I can text you what I'm doing all

2630
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:32,570
the time. Yeah, give me a pat
on the back. All right, sorry.

2631
02:38:32,680 --> 02:38:33,830
I know I might figure that out.

2632
02:38:33,831 --> 02:38:38,270
That's actually a good little
analogical annaleigh analogy.

2633
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:42,050
I'm like comparison task.

2634
02:38:43,030 --> 02:38:46,400
Take find the analogy is what I'm
saying. Psychological warfare, iTunes,

2635
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:49,680
Google play and be three
platforms if you want to. If,

2636
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:52,610
if you want to wake up call.
Yes. Which a lot of people say,

2637
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,980
can't you make an long? Can't you make
an alarm? Can't you make an alarm? Yes,

2638
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,440
you can use psychological
warfare as an alarm.

2639
02:38:57,470 --> 02:38:59,810
There's a bunch of alarm options
there. There's also something on there.

2640
02:38:59,811 --> 02:39:00,140
If you're,

2641
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:04,580
if you're feeling like you want to eat
a doughnut or you want to eat a bag of

2642
02:39:04,581 --> 02:39:07,760
Cheetos. When's the last time
you ate a bag of Cheetos?

2643
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:11,570
One time I ate a whole bag of Hershey's
kisses and this was when I was in the

2644
02:39:11,571 --> 02:39:15,770
teams. I'm talking to grown man. How big
was it back like a black, a good size,

2645
02:39:15,771 --> 02:39:18,440
like the size of a book, the
size, a regular size book.

2646
02:39:18,441 --> 02:39:19,274
Like it was one of those,

2647
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:24,500
it was like six years ago my mom came
over to my house and put a whole bag of

2648
02:39:24,501 --> 02:39:25,331
candy corn.

2649
02:39:25,331 --> 02:39:28,710
It was around Halloween and every time
I walked by it I was stuffing the things

2650
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:30,470
in my mouth and pretty
soon they're all gone.

2651
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:35,360
You like Candy Court there? They're good.

2652
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:39,160
I bet I couldn't eat one
right now cause I, you know,

2653
02:39:39,490 --> 02:39:42,890
kind of cut sweet stuff out. And every
time I slip I taste something. I'm like,

2654
02:39:42,891 --> 02:39:46,850
holy cow. The thing I noticed
that is with, with Coca-Cola.

2655
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:51,170
Oh like I can't even, can't even come
close to drinking a coca cola. I haven't,

2656
02:39:51,171 --> 02:39:52,880
haven't had one, a legit like, hey,

2657
02:39:52,881 --> 02:39:55,610
I'm going to have a coke and probably
10 or 15 years or something like that.

2658
02:39:55,611 --> 02:39:59,120
A long time or two. Probably even
longer than that. But when I,

2659
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:03,350
when I look at them or like the last time
I tried to sip when I was like, yeah,

2660
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:08,390
they're like syrup. Yeah. So anyways.
Yeah to make sense. Like see that?

2661
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:11,060
I can drink coke though. So
that's psychological warfare.

2662
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:14,010
You can get that on any of those
platforms. Also, flip side,

2663
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,650
canvas.com if you want the visual

2664
02:40:18,210 --> 02:40:19,140
reminder or something.

2665
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:24,350
My brother Dakota Meyer has a company
called flipside canvas.com and he's making

2666
02:40:25,591 --> 02:40:29,190
all kinds of cool stuff. He's about
to run out some warrior kid stuff too.

2667
02:40:29,250 --> 02:40:32,430
Some little warrior kid and like
his Teddy Roosevelt's definitely,

2668
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:35,850
he's just getting after it. So
he's making some really cool stuff.

2669
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:40,980
Art with layers, by the way. Art with
layers. There you go. I like that.

2670
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:44,670
You know also on it, if you're
expanding your home gym,

2671
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:48,390
you're getting more kettlebells,
which I did by the way. Darth Vader,

2672
02:40:48,890 --> 02:40:52,800
how much does it weigh? 70 okay. Here's
the thing about the 70 pound like, sure.

2673
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:54,760
I'm not, you know, I'm
going to be more abreast.

2674
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:57,570
What's your hundred pound
to Kettlebell that whatever.

2675
02:40:57,571 --> 02:41:01,350
Bragging to me about one oh six one
else. There you go. There you go.

2676
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:05,490
One Oh six but the 70 and the
72 the gorilla one or whatever.

2677
02:41:05,490 --> 02:41:09,190
Those in my opinion, have the most
like play universal usage. Yeah.

2678
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,960
University what you said. Yes. Yeah,
those are great. I agree. Yeah.

2679
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:15,540
Plus the Darth Vader. I mean, come on
man. That's the ultimate one I think,

2680
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:16,980
but they should've, they
should've made the old,

2681
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:21,660
they should've made the dodge Vader
like a a hundred at least over a hundred

2682
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:25,890
pounds in my opinion. Maybe Jason,
you're the star wars expert. Yeah.

2683
02:41:25,891 --> 02:41:28,130
You should definitely be the
heaviest. Who's the most?

2684
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:31,860
Who's the most powerful character
in star wars? Darth Vader.

2685
02:41:32,730 --> 02:41:36,100
This doesn't seem like he's kind
of a Trump. Some no negative. No.

2686
02:41:36,101 --> 02:41:39,430
You'd think the emperor may be,
but it starts Vader. Darth Vader.

2687
02:41:39,710 --> 02:41:43,530
Your matching you're about
to get. Yeah, I mean,

2688
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,780
I don't know. You know,

2689
02:41:45,781 --> 02:41:50,580
Darth Maul was pretty Dang bad ass is
like the get chopped up pretty quick.

2690
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:53,790
Who would, I mean Darth
Vader lost their theater.

2691
02:41:54,690 --> 02:41:59,180
Lost to Luke Skywalker who cobbled
immediately, by the way. Yeah.

2692
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:03,810
Later on. Say start the later,
man. I think it starts later. Yeah.

2693
02:42:03,811 --> 02:42:04,650
I like Vader.

2694
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:08,940
The real leader lifts people up.

2695
02:42:08,941 --> 02:42:12,280
You ever see that meme and
Darth Vader's holding that

2696
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:19,530
[inaudible]. That is so funny, but
guy fader went through the whole arc.

2697
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:24,330
He was good, bad, good. Boom. You
don't know what I'm thinking. Well,

2698
02:42:24,390 --> 02:42:27,380
I'm sure all the people dog side,
unless yes, I got that Kettlebell.

2699
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:29,490
There's a lot of good
stuff. There's these,

2700
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:33,770
there's these electrolyte minerals
that are part of my daily daily Manga

2701
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,880
meetings with the discipline. Nonetheless,

2702
02:42:35,881 --> 02:42:39,510
go in there on it.com/jocko and
check out some stuff on there.

2703
02:42:39,511 --> 02:42:43,650
Some really good stuff. All right.
Some books weigh the warrior kid three.

2704
02:42:44,370 --> 02:42:45,930
The book is called where there's a will.

2705
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:49,080
There's a good message to talked
about it already. Check that one out.

2706
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:54,110
It is available now also where the warrior
kid one and to Mark's mission is to

2707
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,640
number one his way of the warrior kid.

2708
02:42:57,930 --> 02:43:01,380
Check those out for your kid to
teach your kid these lessons,

2709
02:43:01,470 --> 02:43:06,470
these lessons that Jason I just talked
about for two plus hours are broken down,

2710
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,650
simplified and,

2711
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:17,040
and sprinkled sprinkled throughout these
books so that your kid is gonna read

2712
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:21,340
when your kid is going to
save things to you. Like Dad,

2713
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:24,580
I think your, that might be your ego talk.

2714
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:30,790
That's so that the idea of ego gets
introduced in way the warrior kid three,

2715
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:34,540
that's where it gets introduced
for the first time. So why?

2716
02:43:34,570 --> 02:43:37,690
Because I wish somebody would
have told me about my ego.

2717
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:42,700
I wish somebody would have explained to
me that I was resentful. I was jealous.

2718
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,010
I was, I was

2719
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:46,580
okay

2720
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:50,440
whining. No one did. Hm.

2721
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:55,290
Or if my dad did, I didn't listen
cause I was a young punk. So, uh,

2722
02:43:55,370 --> 02:43:57,830
get those books. Also, if
you've got a younger kid,

2723
02:43:58,010 --> 02:44:01,460
you can get Mikey and the
dragons as well. Which again,

2724
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:05,180
this is the thing where your
kid gets taught a lesson. Hey,

2725
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:10,130
I didn't listen to my dad. Oh
my, I didn't listen to my mom.

2726
02:44:10,370 --> 02:44:13,820
Jason didn't listen to his mom.
Jason didn't listen to his dad.

2727
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:18,020
I've been sitting around
with a bunch of like real,

2728
02:44:18,980 --> 02:44:19,250
okay,

2729
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:22,160
really squared away
people, business people.

2730
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:26,120
And we start talking about kids and,
and then I say, Hey, wait a second.

2731
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:28,340
Who here? Listen to their parents.

2732
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:31,880
No one raises their hands like very few.

2733
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:36,620
There's the one occasional to occasional
uh, Eddie Haskell's. Do you ever? Yeah.

2734
02:44:36,890 --> 02:44:41,590
Yeah. I always listen to my heart. No,
you didn't liar most mostly, but you,

2735
02:44:41,780 --> 02:44:44,780
what, what happens is when they
hear it from another angle,

2736
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:47,560
they listened to it and go,
Oh okay, I understand that.

2737
02:44:47,561 --> 02:44:51,700
And they think it's cool. It's uncle
Jake. It, it's not my dad cause your PR,

2738
02:44:51,730 --> 02:44:54,640
your kids want to rebel against you
because they know they have to leave the

2739
02:44:54,641 --> 02:44:56,740
nest. They got to set up
some kind of a barrier.

2740
02:44:57,640 --> 02:45:01,270
So they need someone to give them
advice. Let that someone be uncle Jake,

2741
02:45:01,510 --> 02:45:06,040
let that someone be the king in Mikey
and the dragons. So there you go.

2742
02:45:06,130 --> 02:45:11,130
That's that also we got obviously
disciplinary treat them field manual.

2743
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:13,070
Yeah.

2744
02:45:13,070 --> 02:45:15,830
If you're an adult and you need to know
how to get on a path and stay on the

2745
02:45:15,831 --> 02:45:18,560
path to just get that book and put
it by your bedside and read that.

2746
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,480
Read a page in the morning.

2747
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:25,160
Have you ever had a book that will get
you out of bed? No. Okay. Discipline.

2748
02:45:25,161 --> 02:45:28,510
It was freedom field man. Who put it
next to your bed. Yeah. You'll be like,

2749
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:30,860
I'm getting out of bed.
I'm going to go get some.

2750
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:34,570
So then there's extreme ownership
in the dichotomy leadership piece.

2751
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:39,620
Are there books about leadership written
by me and my brother Leif Babin about

2752
02:45:39,651 --> 02:45:43,160
the lessons that we learned overseas.

2753

2754
02:45:44,961 --> 02:45:48,440

2755
02:45:48,850 --> 02:45:49,683

like the monster as your first monster?

2768

Jason? How'd you like it?
Wow, that was amazing.

2769
02:46:39,410 --> 02:46:43,460
Don't you wish you got to go to
that when you were 25 years old?

2770
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:46,820
Yeah, years old. I was
super impressed by it.

2771
02:46:46,850 --> 02:46:49,910
There were people that had
their kids there. Yeah. Yeah.

2772
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:53,060
That's not normal or right. It, I
mean when you say there was people,

2773
02:46:53,061 --> 02:46:57,950
there was probably okay. And by,
by kids there were, I'm talking to,

2774
02:46:57,951 --> 02:46:59,750
there was one 13 year old that was there,

2775
02:46:59,751 --> 02:47:03,680
but there was a quite a few like
teenagers and high school age.

2776
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:09,500
Yeah. I would say 16 to 21 there'll be,

2777
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:14,200
there'll be a good amount, maybe a dozen.
Right. And then, but there's, yeah,

2778
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:15,320
there was one 13 year old,

2779
02:47:15,321 --> 02:47:17,690
the warrior kid that was just
straight getting after it.

2780
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:22,250
He was coming home early morning
PT the other way doing it.

2781
02:47:22,570 --> 02:47:25,660
He didn't mentioned that warrior kid
rash card. If you want to get that.

2782
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:30,950
Anyways, that's the monster. They always
sell out. The next one is in Denver.

2783
02:47:31,010 --> 02:47:36,010
It's 19th and 20th of September and
it's going to sell out to Sydney,

2784
02:47:38,181 --> 02:47:41,750
Australia, December 4th and
fifth it's going to sell out.

2785
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:46,340
We've got people in Australia.
Yes we do. When I went to Brizzy,

2786
02:47:46,760 --> 02:47:49,250
there was people from all over
Australia coming to hang out

2787
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:55,700
home of David Hackworth Brisbane.
That's where we moved. Take it. Yeah,

2788
02:47:56,980 --> 02:48:01,190
and if you want to come to that code,
extreme ownership.com get on early. Yeah.

2789
02:48:01,191 --> 02:48:02,024
If online,

2790
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:06,230
if you can't come to the monster or
you can't bring your entire company,

2791
02:48:06,350 --> 02:48:07,970
the muster cause the musters expensive,

2792
02:48:09,470 --> 02:48:13,460
then get go to ETF
online.com and what that is,

2793
02:48:13,461 --> 02:48:14,570
it's leadership training,

2794
02:48:15,230 --> 02:48:17,510
but the thing is leadership
training is not an inoculation.

2795
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:19,820
You can't just go to leadership training
one time and then you're like, oh cool,

2796
02:48:19,821 --> 02:48:22,880
I've got extreme ownership now. I'm
good to go. Doesn't work like that.

2797
02:48:22,881 --> 02:48:25,940
Just like you can't go to ones you did
two class or even one week's worth of

2798
02:48:25,941 --> 02:48:29,360
Jujitsu class, you can't go to a two day
Jujitsu seminar now you're good to go.

2799
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:33,370
No, you need to keep training. And
that's what happens here as well. So you,

2800
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:35,150
it's not a, it's not an inoculation.

2801
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:40,100
You gotta get it repeatedly and
that's what e f online does.

2802
02:48:40,101 --> 02:48:43,550
Or if you can't make it to the monster,

2803
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:48,320
go to [inaudible] dot com
and also e f Overwatch,

2804
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:54,100
taking proven leaders from Spec ops
in combat aviation and putting them in

2805
02:48:54,231 --> 02:48:58,850
companies in the civilian sector that
need leaders that you might think,

2806
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:02,120
well, they don't have any experience
in my industry. Cool. They'll learn it.

2807
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:05,720
That's what we do. Hire
for their character,

2808
02:49:05,721 --> 02:49:08,970
hire for their leadership capability.
Then teach them the industry specifics.

2809
02:49:08,971 --> 02:49:12,120
They'll pick up and they will fill in
the leadership holes that are causing you

2810
02:49:12,121 --> 02:49:12,954
problems

2811
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:19,640
and if you want to hear more about

2821
02:50:05,041 --> 02:50:07,740
everyone else out there
right now in the fight.

2822
02:50:07,741 --> 02:50:10,950
Thanks for protecting our way of life.

2823
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:16,070
You got any other closing
thoughts? Nothing further.

2824
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:17,820
Group check

2825

the first responders.

2828
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:35,190
Thank you all for keeping
us safe here at home

2829
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:41,160
and remember that we all make mistakes,

2830
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:47,430
but the mistakes that you can't recover
from are the ones that you don't own,

2831
02:50:47,431 --> 02:50:49,350
the ones that you don't admit.

2832
02:50:51,740 --> 02:50:56,540
So step up, admit your
mistakes, and own your mistakes,

2833
02:50:56,600 --> 02:50:58,880
and then no matter what,

2834
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:02,420
keep getting after it.

2835
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:05,740
And until next time,

2836
02:51:06,310 --> 02:51:10,780
