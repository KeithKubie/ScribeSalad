00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.190
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.140
Milk does a body, something something.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:15.289
But even if you GOT it, do you WANT it?

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.580
Television has run commercials asking if we
have milk and if we are drinking milk for

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.860
our strong bones, but science is starting
to look at this and say, "hold up."

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.280
A study from Uppsala University in Sweden
looked at how the amount of milk consumed

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.710
can affect health in the long term, and according
to their results, mo milk, mo problems.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.470
Their study, which followed over 100,000 men
and women aged 39 to 79 years.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.540
The women were followed for 20 years, and
then men for 11, on average.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.880
Overall, their results found that people who
drank three or more glasses of milk per day

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.230
died at almost TWICE the rate of those who
drank less than one.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.180
So… that's huge.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.250
The study, published in BMJ, says the reason
for the increase in death MAY be because galactose

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.799
// which SOUNDS like an awesome bad guy from
a 90s comic book, but it's not, it's a simple

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.090
sugar found in milk.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.729
They picked that sugar because of a separate
study, where galactose was given to animals

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.540
and they died faster thanks to oxidative stress
and inflammation.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.969
Basically, according to their findings, the
risk of death rose 15 percent for every glass

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:29.179
of milk consumed per day, and for women it
actually INCREASED bone fractures, not decreased.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.029
BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT AND DUMP YOUR DAIRY.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.630
Cheese and yogurt and stuff might be okay.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.220
They have little or no galactose.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.920
Their study also found women who ate fermented
cheese products were LESS likely to die.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.429
All this aside, the researchers ended their
study by saying one of my favorite phrases:

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.219
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.420
I quote, "People should not change their dietary
habits because of this study."

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.340
It's correlation, not causation.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.770
This got me thinking, why do we even drink
moo juice in the first place?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.299
We're not the ONLY species on the planet to
drink another species milk.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:18.079
There are nursing baby animals that drink
milk from adopted lactating parents, but the

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.800
thing is… they're all babies.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.730
Most animals stop drinking milk and lose the
ability to digest it as they age.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.950
However, another study, also from Uppsala
University // the Swedes drink a lot of milk,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.849
I guess // reports ancient Iberian DNA might
indicate why we drink milk at all!

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.750
The enzyme that allows us to drink milk, lactase,
only evolved in the last 10,000 years, a blink

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.480
of an eye in biological time.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.110
The reason it evolved is because of disaster
-- a famine.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.650
It was either, adapt or die, and somehow the
human body was able to form lactase persistence

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.850
-- or the ability to digest lactose as an
adult.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.739
The drinking of milk would have allowed humans
to gather vitamin D and absorb calcium, keeping

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.319
them alive and healthy -- similar to the newer
study, they also say cheese and yogurt are

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.379
better, mostly because they're easier to consume
due to lower levels of lactose due to fermentation.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.400
Bottom line, maybe think about cutting down
on milk servings and substitute it for some

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.489
yogurt or cheese instead.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.480
too much dairy can cause health risks like
weight gain, diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.630
It can also cause acne, digestive distress,
allergies, asthma and more!

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.909
Dairy is controversial, simply because so
many of us love it, but also because it's

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.040
popular consumption in the US is driven by
lobbyists.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.239
You have to make your own decisions, so read
the science and let us know what you think!
