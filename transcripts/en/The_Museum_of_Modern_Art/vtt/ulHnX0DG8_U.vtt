(drums)

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.017
Ann: Marcel Duchamp had
been trained as a painter.

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:07.752
He was a very capable painter in

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.095
the impressionists style.

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:11.603
A very terrific painter
in the cubists style.

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:14.615
At the end of 1912, Duchamp decided,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:18.207
"Painting is dead. I'm going
to turn to different things."

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.559
1913 was the year that Duchamp
made his first ready made

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.304
by putting an ordinary
store bought bicycle wheel

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:30.104
atop an ordinary store
bought kitchen stool.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:33.647
What Duchamp said is, "It
is my power of choice."

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.764
"It is my deed of making a selection

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:39.622
that makes a work, a work of art."

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.747
And one of the things that he did in 1913

00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:48.234
was re-imagine how long a meter could be.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.979
He did so with the work of art behind me

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.096
called, 'The Standard Stoppages'.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.294
He called The Standard
Stoppages a ready made

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:58.226
because it was a ready made idea

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:01.018
that a meter is a given thing.

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:03.831
So, he was making a new meter.

00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:06.389
It was just a Duchampian meter

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:07.849
and here's how he made it.

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.098
He decided to cut three
threads, a meter in length,

00:01:12.098 --> 00:01:14.488
and then to stand with the three threads

00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:17.186
a meter above three canvases.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.852
He then proceeded to drop each thread

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:24.715
to the canvas below and he
fixed each of the threads

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:27.851
on the canvas. Cut down
the canvas into a rectangle

00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:30.514
and pronounced these the new standard.

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.855
It was a work that was
beautiful in it's concept.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.129
If you're going to make a new meter stick

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:43.474
you should use it, right?

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.379
It shouldn't just be an abstract tool

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.514
that you have sitting around.

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:48.893
The way Duchamp decided to
put The Standard Stoppage

00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:51.597
he made to use was on an old painting

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:54.500
that he had made several
years ago and abandoned.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.392
Tracing with his
templates that he had made

00:01:57.392 --> 00:02:00.152
from the way the threads
fell on the canvases,

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:02.899
these very beautiful curvy shapes

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.017
to grow, kind of like, this weird coral,

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:10.092
calling the picture,
'Network of Stoppages'.

00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:14.171
Duchamp remains, 100 years later,

00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.627
one of the most daring
challengers of ideas

00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:20.404
that a century on, we
still hold pretty dear

00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:22.685
about what a work of art could be.

00:02:24.303 --> 00:02:26.144
