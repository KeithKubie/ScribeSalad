00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.003
Richard Davidson:<i> The invitation
in all of this work is that</i>

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.974
<i>we can take more responsibility
 for our own brains.</i>

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:13.246
<i>And shape our brains wittingly
in a more intentional way</i>

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.482
<i> by cultivating healthy
 habits of mind.</i>

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.184 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:21.720 line:0%
<i> I'm a psychologist and
neuroscientist by training.</i>

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.623
And at the very
beginning of my career

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:28.261
I was captured by one
fundamental question

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.497
which still motivates
all of our work today.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:33.867
And the question is
a very simple one

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.303 line:0%
And that is, when we look
around at the people we know

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:41.941 line:0%
what we see is great
diversity in how people respond

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.111
to life's slings and arrows.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:49.415
Some people are resilient
in the face of adversity

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.984
and other people are challenged

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.021
and decompensate
quite rapidly, vulnerable.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.526
What are the clues to
understanding those differences

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.993
and most importantly

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.997
how can we nudge people
along this continuum

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:08.868
to nurture increased
resilience and well-being

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:13.673
to facilitate a more adaptive
response to adversity.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:17.376
So, I did a lot of research
on the brain mechanisms

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.879
and the bodily changes

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.849
associated with these
differences among people.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.253
And then my life went through
what a dear friend of mine calls

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.121
an "orthogonal rotation."

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.423
( Audience laughter )

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:34.727
And that orthogonal rotation
occurred in 1992 when

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.663
I met the fellow who is sitting
next to me in this picture.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.898
<i>His Holiness the Dalai Lama
 invited me</i>

00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:43.169
<i>to come meet with him at his
residence in Dharamsala, India</i>

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.271
<i>because he was interested in</i>

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.374
<i> catalyzing serious
 neuroscientific research</i>

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.778
<i> on the minds and brains
 of Tibetan practitioners</i>

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.980
<i> who spent years
 cultivating their mind.</i>

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.251
And in fact, on that...
momentous day in 1992

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.487
he was quite stern in a
way and challenged me.

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:06.992
And he said, "You've been using
the tools of modern neuroscience

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:12.899
to investigate depression and
anxiety and stress and fear.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.168
Why can't you use
those same tools

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.303
to study kindness
and compassion?"

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.140
And, for me it was
a wake-up call.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.610
I didn't have a very good answer
other than that it's hard.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.145
( Audience laughter )

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.315
When we first began to study
fear and anxiety

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.749
that was hard, too.

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.653
And I think most scientists
would agree that

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:38.091
the scientific community
has made good progress

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:41.093
in a better understanding
of the brain mechanisms

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.297
and the bodily correlates
of fear and anxiety.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.066
So, what I'd like
to do now is to

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:53.406
segue into a consideration of
four themes in modern science

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:58.344
that enable the work that I'm
describing to go forward.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:02.081
<i> So, the first theme
 is neuroplasticity.</i>

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.350
<i>Neuroplasticity simply means</i>

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.753
that the brain changes in
response to experience

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.589
and in response to training.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.592
Most of the time the brain
is changing unwittingly.

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.762
Most of the time there
are forces around us

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.299
which are shaping our
brains continuously.

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:23.669
The invitation in all
of this work is that

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.806
we can take more responsibility
for our own brains.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:32.845
And shape our brains wittingly
in a more intentional way

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.148
by cultivating healthy
habits of mind.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.352 line:0%
<i> This guy is an
 amazing human being.</i>

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:43.389 line:0%
<i> Matthieu Ricard,
 French by nationality.</i>

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.893 line:0%
<i> He's been a Tibetan
Buddhist monk since 1967.</i>

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.429 line:0%
<i> And he also has a
PhD in Molecular Biology.</i>

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:54.667
So, he comes to the table
with remarkable credentials

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.102
and I think, it's
fair to say that

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:00.606
there is no other person on the
planet quite like Matthieu

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:04.844
and he has been willing to
subject himself up the wazoo

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.180
<i> for the sake of this
 kind of science.</i>

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.650
Matthieu has been in the
scanner many, many times.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.352
We've recorded his brain
electrical signals and

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.222
he has been poked and probed
in many different ways

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.594
to investigate how long
term meditation practice

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.828
may influence the brain.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.398 line:0%
<i>What I'm showing you here
 is actually a figure</i>

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:28.901 line:0%
<i>from a single participant
 in the study</i>

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.304 line:0%
<i> and it illustrates brain
 electrical activity.</i>

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:35.374
And you can see that
there is a difference

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:37.510
between the resting
period on the left

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.112
and the meditation
period on the right.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:44.150
What you see here
is the expression

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.487
of high amplitude
gamma oscillations.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.488
These gamma oscillations

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:52.024
when they are seen in
normal human beings

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.593
are typically very, very brief.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.830
Less than one second in duration

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.434
and we observe them
continuously at high amplitude

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.203
in these long-term
meditation practitioners.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.706
These are oscillations,
which are associated with

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:11.811
states of focused attention,
as well as periods of insight.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:16.582
When different elements
of a percept, or an idea

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:20.018
come together in a kind
of momentary insight

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:23.255
you see a burst of
gamma, which again

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:25.557
typically lasts about a
quarter of a second.

00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:29.495
<i>The second theme is epigenetics</i>

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:34.133
<i> which is the genomic
equivalent of neuroplasticity.</i>

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:38.604
We are all born with a fixed
compliment of base pairs

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.773
which constitute our DNA.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.045
That for the most part, except
under very extreme circumstances

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.613
is not going to change.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.184
However, what will change
is the extent to which

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:55.021
different genes are
turned on or turned off.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.225
We can think of genes as
having little volume controls.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:02.061
And the forces
around us influence

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.564
the extent to which different
genes are expressed

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:09.468
the extent to which they are
turned on or turned off.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:15.207
For example, there's very good
hard scientific data to show

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:19.011 line:0%
that the way a mother
treats her offspring

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:23.916 line:0%
<i> will induce epigenetic
changes in specific genes</i>

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.252 line:0%
<i> as a consequence of
 that maternal behavior.</i>

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.354 line:0%
<i> And those changes
 in gene expression</i>

00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:33.158 line:0%
<i>persist for the entire duration
of the life of the organism</i>

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:36.128 line:0%
<i> and in fact, very new
 research indicates</i>

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:38.931 line:0%
<i>that these epigenetic changes</i>

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.368 line:0%
<i>can be passed down for at least
 a couple of generations.</i>

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.972
Now, ten years ago this
was complete heresy.

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:49.808
And this is not fringe
science, folks.

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:52.445
This is published in the very
best scientific journals.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.849
So, these findings along with
other similar findings suggest

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.552
that there's a lot
more malleability

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:01.954
a lot more flexibility

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:06.125
in what we once thought
was a very closed system.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:11.430
Now, up until now the only
way that epigenetic changes

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.898
can be studied in the brain

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:15.834
is to actually
biopsy brain tissue

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.905
which obviously we cannot
do in a human being.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.007
It's unsafe and unethical.

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:26.812
And so, we now have, for the
very first time, a technology

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:30.082
which allows us to
actually look at

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.752
epigenetic changes in
human brain tissue

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.919
for the first time.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.755
And the way we do it is
we can take a blood cell

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:41.294 line:0%
<i>and we can convert that cell
into a pluripotent stem cell.</i>

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.464 line:0%
<i> And once it's converted
 into a stem cell</i>

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.032 line:0%
<i> we can turn it into any
 other kind of cell.</i>

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:50.235 line:0%
<i> And one of the things
 that we do in a dish</i>

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:53.305 line:0%
<i> is we can turn it into
 any kind of neuron</i>

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:55.907 line:0%
<i>that we find in the brain,
 and we can then look at</i>

00:07:55.907 --> 00:07:58.878 line:0%
<i> gene expression in
 that neuronal stage.</i>

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.513
And so, this is
going to usher in

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:04.449
a whole new era of investigation

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.553
that enables us to look
with much greater specificity

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.723
than has ever been
looked at before

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:14.660
in terms of how these
kinds of mental exercises

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.564
can, can infiltrate, if
you will, and penetrate

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:21.033
down to the level
of gene expression.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.836
<i> The third is the
bi-directional communication</i>

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:27.539
<i> between the mind and
 brain and the body</i>

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:33.412
underscore the notion that
there is a connection between

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:36.315
our psychological well-being
and our physical health.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:39.251
<i> Can you envision a time
 in the future when</i>

00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:42.254
<i>mental exercise is engaged
 in the same way</i>

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:44.857
<i>that physical exercise is today.</i>

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:48.126
<i> And can you envision the
impact that that might have?</i>

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.063
Healthcare utilization
should go down.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:54.166
Prescription drug
use should go down.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.869
And therefore, healthcare
costs would go down.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:01.340
<i> Now, one snippet
 of data came from</i>

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.009
<i> the first randomized
 controlled trial of</i>

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.345
<i> mindfulness based
 stress reduction.</i>

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.514
And, we did it in
participants who

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:12.752
worked at a hi-tech corporation
in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:19.124
And it was taught onsite and
the study was designed so that

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:22.161
the training occurred,
beginning in September

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:26.465
and that coincides with the
onset of flu season.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:30.102
And the time when individuals
typically will get flu vaccine

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.404
if they get a flu vaccine.

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:34.240
So, what we did is we gave

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.676
all of the participants
in the meditation group

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:41.880
and all of the participants in a
control group a flu vaccine.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.284
The only difference
in how we did it

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.486
compared to how it would
be done clinically is that

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:52.024
we took blood samples before and
after the flu vaccine was given

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:55.894
that allowed us to quantify
the antibody titers

00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:58.296
mounted in response
to the vaccine.

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.766
This gives us a
quantitative index of

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.736
how effectively the vaccine
actually is working.

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:05.670
<i> These are the data
 from that study.</i>

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.709
<i>And it's really quite remarkable
after two months of training</i>

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:14.880
<i> the meditators
 actually show a boost</i>

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.284
<i> in their antibody titer
 response to the vaccine</i>

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.885
<i>compared to the controls.</i>

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:25.524
And these data show that
if these participants were

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:28.561
exposed to the same level
of flu virus those who

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:32.298
went through the eight weeks
of mindfulness meditation

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:36.168
would have more protection
against the virus.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:39.738
The virus-- the vaccine
would be more effective.

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:45.110
<i> The fourth theme here is
 innate basic goodness.</i>

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.647
It doesn't mean that the
negative stuff isn't there.

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:52.184
It simply means that if
we are given a choice

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.253
we will choose the good.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.823
So, I'm going to show you
two short video clips.

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.692
They were actually shown live,
what's in the clips

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:02.828
to six-month old babies.

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.330
And then I'll explain to you

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.733
what was done
in this experiment.

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:44.637
( Audience laughing )

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.074
Those little...

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:52.945
puppets were then offered to
the six-month old babies.

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:54.880
One is the elephant
with the yellow

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.282
and the other is the
elephant with the orange.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:59.885
And by the way, the colors were
all randomized across babies.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.689
Which do you think the
babies preferred?

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:05.691
Woman in audience:
<i> The helping elephant.</i>

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.726
Dramatic. Dramatic!

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:12.498
The preference rates
dramatically skewed...

00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:16.035
The babies at six months show

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:20.873
a clear and unequivocal
preference for cooperation

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.377
compared to the hindrance.

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:31.116
And there are a number of other
strong empirical findings

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:33.151
which are consistent with this

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:37.689
in showing that we indeed
come into the world

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:40.426
with this quality of
innate basic goodness.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.495
And one of the reasons
why these data

00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:46.364
on innate basic goodness are
so interesting is because

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.966
in the contemplative traditions

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:52.304
from which these practices
are derived they suggest that

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:57.075
when we cultivate kindness and
compassion, we are not trying to

00:12:57.075 --> 00:13:00.212
create something de novo
in the human mind.

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:05.717
What we're doing is nurturing
seeds which are already present.

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:09.754
We all know that human beings
are endowed

00:13:09.754 --> 00:13:11.757
with a capacity for language.

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:16.495
And in fact, there are some
case studies of feral children

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:18.263
who were raised in the wild.

00:13:18.263 --> 00:13:20.599
And, when they're raised

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:23.402
in the absence of a normal
linguistic community

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:26.071
they do not develop
proper language.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:30.476
And in the same way, we reason
that kindness and compassion

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.545
are qualities that are
present from the start

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:36.347
but they require... nurturance.

00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:39.350
They require a loving, caring,

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.621
kind, compassionate community

00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:45.691
for those seeds to be nurtured.

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:49.461
And so, the practices which
strengthen these qualities

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:51.897
are practices which are said to

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:55.935
nourish and cultivate qualities
which are already there

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:58.771
but simply need to be
nurtured and strengthened.
