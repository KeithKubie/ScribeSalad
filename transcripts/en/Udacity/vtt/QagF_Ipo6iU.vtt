00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.434
Let's look at different equation then. One like this one. Y equals X squared

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:08.887
plus 6x plus three. Now we can't factor this. Know that the only factors of 3

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:13.119
are 3 and 1, and they don't add to equal 6. So we're going to need to come up

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.459
with a different way, a different method, of figuring out where this curve

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.580
touches the x axis. I'd like you to write this Right side of the equation in

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.588
completed square form. So, in other words, complete the square on the right

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:29.568
side. However, this time, don't move the 3 over to the left-hand side. Keep it

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:33.350
on the right side and just play with the first two terms here to complete the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.243
square. Once you've completed the square with these two, tack the 3 on to the

00:00:37.243 --> 00:00:41.267
end again and simplify. Fill the new expression you have on the right-hand side

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:42.035
into this box.
