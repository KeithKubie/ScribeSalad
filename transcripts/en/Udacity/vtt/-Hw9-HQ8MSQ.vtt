00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.460
Every linear program,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.340
it turns out, has a dual program which
mirrors the behavior of the original.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.770
In this lesson we'll
examine this phenomenon.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.340
To give us a chance to apply some of
the knowledge we gained about linear

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.420
programs.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.370
As well as to deepen our understanding
of some of the other problems that we've

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.970
already studied.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.050
See if you can guess which
problems as the lesson goes along.
