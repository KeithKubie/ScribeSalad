00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.462
Voiceover: What I've
drawn right here is an

00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:05.138
inverted oil futures curve.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.387
So if the futures curve looks
like this, it just means that it's

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:13.052
more expensive to buy oil
today than to agree to buy

00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:15.802
oil at some future date,
two months from now,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.135
four months from now or
eight months from now.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.435
There's a couple of reasons
why this might happen.

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:22.770
The most common reason
might just be there might be

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.601
some type of shortage
right now for whatever

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.886
reason, maybe ... maybe there's
a war going on and all of a

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:32.305
sudden we need a lot more
fuel to support all of the

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:36.326
crazy machinery and all of
that or maybe some oil got

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:39.288
destroyed, maybe some oil
wells are burning. Who knows?

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:40.993
There might be some type
of shortage, so people are

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:44.326
willing to pay a premium
for oil right now.

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:48.137
The other reason why you
might have an inverted oils

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.992
future curve and this will
actually gel a little bit more

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.219
with kind of what we're going
to talk about in this video

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.259
is that people expect the price
of oil in the future to not

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.471
be that different than the
price of oil today. If you were

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:04.993
to go out there and survey
everyone who might be a seller

00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:07.659
or buyer of oil in the
world, which is obviously not

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.201
possible, but if you were to ask them,

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.326
"What is the expected price
of oil in eight months?",

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:15.903
they might say, "Hey, okay we
might even have a little shortage

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:20.551
"right now, but we expect
the price of oil to be $100."

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:23.403
and so you might say, "Wait.
If everyone expects ...

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:27.269
"If everyone expects the
price of oil to be $100,"

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:30.205
"why are there some people
in the futures markets today"

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.559
"who are agreeing to
sell the oil for $50?"

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.675
"They're agreeing to sell it
below the expected price."

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:39.673
And the reason why they
might be willing to, maybe

00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:43.426
their oil producers and oil
is such a volatile price and

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:46.005
because they are dependent
on oil revenues to support

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.401
the people who live in that
country or whatever else.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.339
They're essentially, in order
to guarantee the price and

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:55.201
and not be susceptible to the
volatility, they're willing to

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.342
sell it at a discount, to this
theoretical expected price.

00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:03.070
So either way, this could lead
to an inverted futures curve.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.986
Now, in kind of common lingo
when people see an inverted

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:09.982
futures curve like this,
they'll often use the word

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:14.453
"backwardation", backwardation.
They'll say that the

00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:18.121
future ... that this futures
market is in backwardation,

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.388
so backwardation and what I
want to be clear is, is that

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.386
that's what most people
are talking about, inverted

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:27.053
futures curve but that's not
exactly right if you we want

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:30.719
to give the precise academic
definition. The precise

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.387
definition is not just an
inverted curve, the precise

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:36.601
definition is and this is
actually the theory of normal

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.352
backwardation. It came from
Keynes and that is, is that

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.933
the sellers are willing to sell
in the future at a discount

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:47.185
to the expected price because
of the volatility, so that

00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.721
they could lock in their
price. So the theory of normal

00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.652
backwardation is actually
this phenomenon right here.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.454
But this is actually not
observable because you can't go

00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:58.549
and survey everyone
and figure out what the

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.933
actual expected price is
and you can see that they're

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:03.253
often one and the same. The
expectant price was here.

00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:06.708
You had an inverted futures
curve. That's why they called

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:10.601
this curve that or this
market in backwardation.

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.517
The one way that you can
kind of observe it, is if you

00:03:13.517 --> 00:03:17.985
see, so over here, this is our
spot price. This is our spot

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:20.388
price and now we're moving
over time and you can see

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:23.101
the spot price isn't changing
much and because it's not

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:27.008
changing much, this cheaper
futures price, as we move

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:29.892
closer and closer to its
delivery date, it has to

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:32.853
converge with the spot price.
As this one right over here

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:36.966
it starts at $75, as you go
further and further in time,

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.002
it has to converge to the
spot price and so when you see

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:44.477
the futures price moving
up towards the spot price,

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:47.919
over as it gets closer and
closer to its delivery date,

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.521
that's maybe the most
observable way that you could

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.719
say that the market is
experiencing ... is experiencing

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.670
backwardation.
