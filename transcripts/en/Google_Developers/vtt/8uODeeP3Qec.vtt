MANO MARKS: Hi, I'm
Mano Marks.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.340
I'm a developer advocate on
the Google Maps API team.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.000
This screencast takes a look
at Autocomplete, which is a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.140
part of the Google Maps
API Places library.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.360
Autocomplete allows you to
do something simple.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.150
As users type in input, you
suggest results to them.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.140
These results can be addresses,
restaurants, cafes,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.300
landmarks, cities, states,
anything that is included in

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.685
our places library or our
geocoding service.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.030
So why would you use
Autocomplete?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.040
Autocomplete has
two main uses.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.280
One is for people who are not
sure what they're actually

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.460
looking for.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.180
So as they type in things that
suggest things that sound

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.099
like, or look like what they're
looking for, and are

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.780
architecturally relevant to
the location that they're

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.290
looking at.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.900
And the other is, if you are on
a mobile device, you have

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.570
very few keystrokes to get to
the result that you need.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.570
Now if you've ever used a
mobile phone, typed in

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.850
something, tried to get a
result, you know that it can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.670
be much more laborious than
using the keyboard.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.260
So Autocomplete helps you
solve that issue.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.210
Now, the Autocomplete API is
part of our JavaScript API,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.740
but we also have a web service
that can be used in a variety

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.940
of formats on the server side
or on a mobile device.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.440
So I'll invite you to check that
out, and there will be a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.430
link to the documentation at
the end of this video.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.680
Let's take a look.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.920
So this is a map of
San Francisco.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.940
And as I start typing in, you
can see that it's starting to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.820
give me results that
are contextually

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.890
relevant to San Francisco.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.970
I typed in T-E, and I get a
variety of things in San

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.260
Francisco and Berkeley--
which is nearby--

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.280
that might match that query.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.700
And as I click on one of them,
I'm going to say look at the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.710
Tenderloin.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.870
Tenderloin's a neighborhood
in San Francisco.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.850
I click on the marker, and
there's some additional

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.860
information.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.180
With a few lines of code, I've
added this powerful search to

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.850
my application.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.370
I'll go ahead and close
that window.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.880
Now, say I were to go
looking for pizza.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.060
Pizza's the traditional demo
of choice for maps.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.200
I'm going to type in Z-A-C, and
you'll see I get Zachary's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.770
Chicago Pizza.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.680
I'm doing this because Zachary's
is a popular pizza

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.940
joint in the San Francisco Bay
area, but it's in Oakland.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.920
So I'm going to go over there,
and we'll look at that.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.750
Click there, and I've got some
more information, and even a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.310
link to the Google place page
for Zachary's Chicago Pizza.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.710
Now if I were to take a look
again, and start typing in

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.650
T-E, you might notice that the
results are actually different

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.220
than they were for when I
was in San Francisco.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.080
Now, the application
hasn't changed.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.560
The only thing that's changed
is that the map has changed

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.240
focus to Oakland instead of San
Francisco, and you'll see

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.700
I get contextually relevant
results to Oakland.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.260
I can also search directly
for addresses.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.930
So, say I wanted to type in
1-6-0-0 A-M. I get 1600

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.175
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
View, California--

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:58.580
it's Google's address.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.020
You can see here that this is
a very powerful tool that

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.130
allows your users to interact
directly with our places and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.340
geocoding services without you
having to write more than a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.310
few lines of code.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.410
And then once that result is
returned to your application,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.690
you can display it on the map,
or you can pull up additional

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.880
information about it if we have
it in our places library.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.900
The last feature I want to
mention is that you can

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.660
restrict the results returned
to either a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.440
establishment or a geocode.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.160
So if you do want to just have
an address search, or just

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.280
have something that searches
for businesses on your map,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.100
then you can certainly
do that as well.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.504
So that's Autocomplete.

00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:47.120
A few lines of code, you're
up and running in no time.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.410
Take a look at the
documentation.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.160
You can click on this link in
the video, and it'll take you

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.410
right there.
