I'm going to be talking about the
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.250
I'm going to be talking about the
assessment portion of international

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260

benchmarking in the last presentation

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
benchmarking in the last presentation
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750
benchmarking in the last presentation
that was in here we heard the word

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
that was in here we heard the word
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.510
that was in here we heard the word

noun we're using benchmarking more as a
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.340

is the definition of benchmarking that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
is the definition of benchmarking that
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.059
is the definition of benchmarking that
we might be working within the context

of this presentation benchmarking is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
of this presentation benchmarking is
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.990
of this presentation benchmarking is
generally more of a business term so I

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
generally more of a business term so I
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.620
generally more of a business term so I
got a lot of recognition and research

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630
got a lot of recognition and research
 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.420
got a lot of recognition and research
early on and it was about defining

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
early on and it was about defining
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.490
early on and it was about defining
processes about defining processes that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
processes about defining processes that
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.560

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
organization and looking to see how one
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.800
organization and looking to see how one
compares to another organization it can

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
compares to another organization it can
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.729
compares to another organization it can
be for identifying where one stands

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
be for identifying where one stands
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.470
be for identifying where one stands
relative to other people it can be as a

popular definitions up here I'm UNESCO

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
popular definitions up here I'm UNESCO
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.009
popular definitions up here I'm UNESCO
and definition of benchmarking I liked a

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019
and definition of benchmarking I liked a
 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.479
and definition of benchmarking I liked a
standardized method so we do like to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489
standardized method so we do like to
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.780
standardized method so we do like to
standardize things so that we have some

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
standardize things so that we have some
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.250
standardize things so that we have some
confidence in the comparisons that we're

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260
confidence in the comparisons that we're
 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.250
confidence in the comparisons that we're
making and if the standardized method

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
making and if the standardized method
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.600
making and if the standardized method
for collecting and reporting the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610
for collecting and reporting the
 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.090
for collecting and reporting the
critical data in a way that enables the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
critical data in a way that enables the
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220
critical data in a way that enables the
relevant comparison so it's obviously

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230
relevant comparison so it's obviously
 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.140
relevant comparison so it's obviously
about comparison making comparisons

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
about comparison making comparisons
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.530
about comparison making comparisons
figuring out where we stand relative to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
figuring out where we stand relative to
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.470
figuring out where we stand relative to
whatever we're interested in wherever

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480
whatever we're interested in wherever
 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.900
whatever we're interested in wherever
we're interested in going comparisons of

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
we're interested in going comparisons of
 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.120
we're interested in going comparisons of

international assessments that we use
for benchmarking don't know how much of

that process we think we get at we tend
 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.529
that process we think we get at we tend
to end up looking just at test scores

international benchmarking what
 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.550
international benchmarking what
assessments are out there I'm sure most

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560
assessments are out there I'm sure most
 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.379
assessments are out there I'm sure most
people are probably familiar with the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389
people are probably familiar with the
 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.000
people are probably familiar with the
major assessments there have been some

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010
major assessments there have been some
 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.420
major assessments there have been some
changes in additions in recent years and

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430
changes in additions in recent years and
 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.529

want to make sure that people are aware

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539
want to make sure that people are aware
 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.060
want to make sure that people are aware
of them and then talk about where we

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070
of them and then talk about where we
 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.020
of them and then talk about where we
think assessments need to go the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030
think assessments need to go the
 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.500
think assessments need to go the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020
 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.740
obviously the other panelists here okay

who is familiar with four of them okay

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849
who is familiar with four of them okay
 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.370
who is familiar with four of them okay
three at least two yeah most people are

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380
three at least two yeah most people are
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.170
three at least two yeah most people are
at least two we're going to talk briefly

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180
at least two we're going to talk briefly
 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.409
at least two we're going to talk briefly
about what all of them are and Pearson's

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419
about what all of them are and Pearson's
 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.270
about what all of them are and Pearson's
involved in all of these so we're going

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280
involved in all of these so we're going
 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.529
involved in all of these so we're going
to talk a little bit about our

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539
to talk a little bit about our
 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.420
to talk a little bit about our
involvement in them and then how we're

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430
involvement in them and then how we're
 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.050
involvement in them and then how we're
trying to push them forward as well why

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060
trying to push them forward as well why
 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.730
trying to push them forward as well why
do we do these international assessments

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
do we do these international assessments
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.320
do we do these international assessments
like we said with the definitions of

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330
like we said with the definitions of
 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.779
like we said with the definitions of

states of practice right we want to know

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560
states of practice right we want to know
 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.030
states of practice right we want to know
where

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040
where

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.980
stand relative to everybody it's because
of the global competition out there it

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990
of the global competition out there it
 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.080
of the global competition out there it
is important for us to know how we stand

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090
is important for us to know how we stand
 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.330
is important for us to know how we stand
globally much more so than it ever has

jobs it is an international world we
 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.650
jobs it is an international world we
need to start looking at where we stand

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660
need to start looking at where we stand
 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.580
need to start looking at where we stand
with students in elementary school in

with students in elementary school in
 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.870
with students in elementary school in
order to make sure that we are going to

order to make sure that we are going to
 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.700
order to make sure that we are going to
be globally competitive we also need to

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710
be globally competitive we also need to
 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.350
be globally competitive we also need to
identify the models to follow I who are

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360
identify the models to follow I who are
 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.230
identify the models to follow I who are
the leaders why are they the leaders and

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240
the leaders why are they the leaders and
 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.310
the leaders why are they the leaders and
do we think that the assessments are

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320
do we think that the assessments are
 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.930
do we think that the assessments are
measuring important things do we want to

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940
measuring important things do we want to
 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.110
measuring important things do we want to
go to follow the models that the the

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120
go to follow the models that the the
 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.730
go to follow the models that the the
leaders the people who are doing the

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740
leaders the people who are doing the
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.460
leaders the people who are doing the
best on these assessments are what

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470
best on these assessments are what
 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.390
best on these assessments are what
they're doing in their countries and

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400
they're doing in their countries and
 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.760
they're doing in their countries and
then progress monitoring just as the

then progress monitoring just as the
 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.140
then progress monitoring just as the
