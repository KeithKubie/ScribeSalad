00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.740
Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics.
My name is Adriene Hill

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.569
Jacob: And I’m Jacob Clifford, and today
we’re going to talk about good intentions,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.889
and how they can go wrong. Price controls
can derail markets. And subsidies can distort them.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.960
Adriene: And “deadweight” isn’t just
a good description of your ex.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.800
[Theme Music]

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Jacob: Let’s say Craig becomes president
and he caps the prices of all consumer goods.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
He argues that the lower price will help everyone
-- the poor, the middle class, small businesses,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.960
everyone. Maybe a few people might fall for
this policy, but not you.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.570
You watch Crash Course Economics, which means
you're funny and smart and attractive, and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.870
you understand why this is a horrible idea.
This example seems far fetched, but it actually

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.230
happened...not the part of Craig being president.
Instead it was President Richard Nixon.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.150
In the early 1970s, Nixon established a 90
day price and wage freeze designed to fight

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.720
inflation. The general public supported the
idea, but economists were skeptical. In fact,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.000
Milton Friedman called the freeze “one of
those ‘very plausible schemes…with very

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.739
pleasing commencements, [that] have often
shameful and lamentable conclusions’.”

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.840
Economists call this idea of the government
setting prices, price controls. Now, there's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
two types and we're gonna look at both of
them in the Thought Bubble.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.250
Adriene: When the government sets a maximum
price for a specific good or service, that’s

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.290
a price ceiling. Let's say the government
forced gas stations to charge a dollar per

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.390
gallon for gas. This might seem like a good
idea, right? Mandated lower gas prices mean

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.340
we all benefit. Not really. Society is actually
made worse off. When the gas prices fall consumers

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.740
will want to buy more, but producers will
no longer find it profitable to sell gas.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.990
The lower price will decrease the amount of
gasoline produced, and we've got a shortage.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.189
A price floor is a law that sets a minimum
price in a specific market. The idea is to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.560
help by keeping the price artificially high
and not allowing the price to fall down to

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.110
equilibrium. Let’s make up an example using
corn. Assume the government set a price floor

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.259
for a bushel of corn at $7 when the actual
equilibrium price is $4. The higher price

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.159
would give farmers an incentive to produce
more, but, at that high price, consumers would

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.959
go buy substitutes -- things like wheat or
rice. Instead of cornflakes they'd buy rice

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.529
krispies. The point is, the farmers wouldn’t
necessarily be better off. They could sell

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.999
corn at the higher price, but they wouldn’t
have as many customers.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.919
In terms of actually helping consumers and
producers, the vast majority of economists

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.689
consider price controls counter-productive.
But there is one notable exception: minimum

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.559
wage. The minimum wage is a really complex
issue that we’re going to address in a future video.

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.620
Jacob: Thanks Thought Bubble. Let’s look
at both these policies again using the supply

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.689
and demand graph. Assume the equilibrium price
for gas is $3 and the government sets a price

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.169
ceiling here, at only $1. At that low price,
consumers would want to buy more, so the quantity

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.369
demanded is gonna be here. The producers have
less incentive to produce gas so they're going

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.059
to make less, so the quantity supplied is
right here. The end result is that the quantity

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.749
bought and sold is going to fall resulting
in a shortage. The amount of gas society wants

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:03.529
is where supply meets demand. Producing any
quantity less than that will result in something

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.230
that economists call deadweight loss. So the
quantity produced at the price ceiling is

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.699
not allocatively efficient. We're not producing
enough. The lower the price ceiling, the more

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.290
the deadweight loss and inefficiency. Keep
in mind that the price ceiling only has an

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.040
effect on the market when it's below the equilibrium
price.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.400
Adriene: Many countries still use price ceilings:
take Venezuela. In recent years they have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.669
been experiencing high inflation, so the government
decided to impose price controls on consumer

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.579
products like basic foods, medicine, and toilet
paper. But, the new price is so low relative

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.439
to the cost of production that farmers and
factories can't make money. As a result,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.260
they've reduced or halted production of many goods,
causing long lines, shortages, and empty shelves.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.319
Rent control is another type of price ceiling.
Many cities, including New York and San Francisco,

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.349
put a cap on monthly rent for some apartments.
Again, the idea is to increase affordability

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.309
for tenants, which enables long-term tenants
to stay in their homes when real estate prices

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:05.299
rise. Meanwhile, the lower rent discourages
renovation and new construction, reducing

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.019
the quantity supplied. The result is a shortage
of apartments with landlords that have few

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.079
incentives to maintain their buildings or
be responsive to their tenant’s needs.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.600
Economists are not at all split on rent control.
Pretty much all of them think that price ceilings

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.650
on rent reduce the quantity and quality of
the housing that's available.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.300
Jacob: Now, how about a price floor? Well,
look at corn with an equilibrium price of

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.910
$4 per bushel and a price floor at $7. The
higher price will give farmers an incentive

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.680
to increase the quantity supplied. But, consumers
don’t want to pay those higher prices so

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.540
the quantity demanded's gonna fall. The result is
a surplus and deadweight loss, so society's worse off.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.640
Now one argument for a price floor on corn
is that if farmers can’t get a high enough

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.140
price, they'll stop producing. Then we will
run out of food and die. Economists (except

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.680
for Malthus) are not fans of starvation so
they recognize that the government needs to

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.180
get involved sometimes to preserve our food
supply. But they don't use price floors.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.100
Let’s talk about agricultural subsidies.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.580
Adriene: A subsidy is a government payment
given to individuals or businesses. And they're

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.070
often designed to offset costs to advance
a specific public goal.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.430
Let's say the government subsidizes farmers
that produce strawberries. This encourages

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.700
them to increase supply and the result is
more strawberries and a lower price. At first

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.970
glance, this sounds like a great idea. Prices
for consumers fall, farmers get more money,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.260
and the market remains at equilibrium. There
is no shortage or surplus. Proponents of farm

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.580
subsidies say they can help provide a stable
living to farmers, limit food price inflation,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.060
and make sure we grow enough food to feed
everyone.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.580
But before you go out and become a lobbyist
for farm subsidies, keep in mind that economists

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.690
don't like them. For one, many farmers these
days are not poor. By some estimates they

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.850
make more than non-farm families. Farmers,
economists argue, have the income they need

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.120
to handle price shocks. Economists also think
that subsidies might discourage farmers from

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.740
innovating and rethinking how they farm because
they have guaranteed income from the government.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.620
A survey of economists found that 85% think the
United States should eliminate agricultural subsidies.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.000
But what do economists have against farmers?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.340
Jacob: Economists don’t have it in for anybody.
Except maybe physicists, because they have

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.660
unbreakable laws and perfectly controlled
experiments. Man I wish economics was a science!

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.080
Economists recognize that market prices are
set for a reason. If corn prices are down

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.230
because demand has fallen, then it's inefficient
and wasteful to spend money on subsidies.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.870
That said, if there is a drought or other
natural disaster affecting farmers then some

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.030
sort of short-term aid might be needed to
keep farmers on their feet. But today, farm

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.270
subsidies in the US were not about giving a little money
to help ma and pa make it through a tough season.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.580
Adriene: In the US, agricultural subsidies
have been around since the Great Depression.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.580
They were meant to help prop up farm prices
and farmers. The Agricultural Adjustment Act

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.030
of 1933 paid farmers not to grow crops on
some of their land. The government also bought

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.560
up excess crops. For decades after, farmers
of crops like corn, wheat, cotton, and soybeans

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.920
received government help. In the late 1990s
Congress added new farm programs, including

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.430
what are called direct payments. Basically,
the government handed out checks to farmers

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.950
based on land ownership and historical production
levels. Farmers got them regardless of the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.600
market price for crops or how much they produced.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.230
According to The Washington Post, “In 2005
alone, when pretax farm profits were at a

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:31.790
near-record $72 billion, the federal government
handed out more than $25 billion in aid…”

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.880
That was almost 50% more than it paid to families
on welfare. The Washington Post also found

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:44.030
the government gave over 1.3 billion dollars
to people that didn't farm at all.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:50.220
In 2014, the government eliminated this system
of direct payment subsidies. Farm subsidies

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.570
still cost the government $20 billion dollars
a year, but a large portion goes to helping

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.490
farmers pay for crop insurance.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.270
But economists don't like this much either.
Some argue that any form of government assistance

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.710
distorts the market, resulting in unintended
consequences. For one, it guarantees farmers

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:14.380
an income, and perhaps encourages them to
take more risks, like planting on less fertile land.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.510
Jacob: So is it ever appropriate for the government
to give a subsidy? Well, let’s look at the

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.010
supply and demand graph again. A market's
going to produce the equilibrium quantity

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.400
and, in most cases, that is exactly the amount
society wants. But what if the amount society

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.590
actually wants is much greater? What if there
is something special about this product that

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.760
buyers and sellers aren’t factoring in?
In this case, the amount being produced is

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.900
less than the amount society wants. The result
would be deadweight loss. The inefficiency caused

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.660
by the underproduction of this product. A subsidy
would make society better off and improve efficiency.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.080
Adriene: Let’s look at renewable energy technology.
Some economists like government subsidies

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.500
for research and development in energy. They argue
that things like solar panels would be underdeveloped

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.940
and underproduced without government action
and that subsidies reduce deadweight loss.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.339
Other economists point out that businesses
already have an incentive to innovate, and

00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:06.550
that subsidies create false demand. In essence,
they argue that there is no deadweight loss,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.160
and even if there is, markets will adjust.
The takeaway from this debate is that subsidies

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.420
aren't inherently good or bad, it just depends
on the values of society and markets in question.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.960
Just think, because of NASA, we have things like
scratch-resistant lenses, memory foam, Moonbase Alpha.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.319
Jacob: So we stand by our claim, markets work.
They help us to determine the quantity we

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:32.459
should produce and help us to use our resources
efficiently. Now, government policies like

00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:36.050
price ceilings and floors often fail to make
all of us better off.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.450
Adriene: Sometimes, markets fail. And that's
when the government needs to step in.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.220
