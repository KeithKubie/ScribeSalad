00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.380
[music playing]

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.380
NARRATOR: Although mainstream
science widely dismisses

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.210
the concept of reincarnation,
leading academic institutions,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.830
such as the University of
Virginia, Duke University,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.880
and the University
of British Columbia,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.540
have entire departments
devoted to its study.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.040
And according to their research,
a mounting body of evidence

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.710
suggests that the
ability of some

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.040
to vividly recall past lives may
in fact be a real occurrence.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.710
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: You
have thousands of reports.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.880
So one has to wonder whether
there is something behind that.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.380
There are studies that have
been made on these things,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.000
and I wonder how long
it'll be until mainstream

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.710
science agrees with
the idea that something

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.500
happens to us after death.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.960
The basic idea
of reincarnation

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.040
is that upon your death,
your soul departs your body.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
You go to your
version of heaven.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.290
And then you come
down into a new body.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.960
An easy way to understand this
is that you can upload files

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.120
from your computer to the
cloud and then download

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.290
files to a new computer.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.540
NARRATOR: But while scientists
are just beginning to entertain

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.210
the notion that reincarnation
may be a real occurrence,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.120
the idea of a soul
leaving one human body

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.670
and entering another can be
traced back thousands of years,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.420
to the very beginning of
Egyptian civilization.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.250
Turin, Italy-- on display
at the Egyptian Museum

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.500
is the Turin King
List, or Royal Canon,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.330
which dates back to
the 13th century BC.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.500
The papyrus includes
a list detailing

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.620
the ancient Egyptian
rulers, extending back

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.750
to the very start of
Egyptian civilization.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.120
We see all the timelines,
and all the kings were there.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.000
But the first two groups
of names on that list

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.960
were gods, the gods of
Egypt, who they believed

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.500
ruled before the kings.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.790
NARRATOR: Although scholars
fully accept the chronology

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.380
from the rule of
King Menes onward,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.960
they discount the
time before his reign,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.830
around 3,000 BC, a
time when these alleged

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.210
gods ruled over Egypt.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.210
One of the first names
to be found on the list

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.120
is the god Osiris.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.750
WILLIAM BRAMLEY: Osiris was
depicted as a human-like god.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.080
He had human features.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.540
But one of the most
curious things about Osiris

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420
is that he was shown
with green skin.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.210
WILLIAM HENRY: Osiris is thought
to have come from the star

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.580
system Orion
originally and was part

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.040
of a group of extraterrestrials
that came to Earth.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.500
What's interesting about
the ancient Egyptian gods

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.920
is they could also die.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.000
They weren't
necessarily immortal.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.920
And when the god Osiris
died, centuries ago

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.420
according to Egyptian
mythology, he was

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.210
reborn as his own son Horus.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.040
And Horus became a physical
incarnation on Earth.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.960
And it is believed by
the ancient Egyptians

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.210
that all the pharaohs
became gods incarnate.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.540
And once one particular
pharaoh died,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.960
the spirit would then go
into the next pharaoh,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.040
and so on, and so on.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.460
So that this cycle of
reincarnation continued.
