00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.220
Religion and evolution mix like water and
oil-covered cats; they just don’t seem to

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.220
get along.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:14.040
But is it possible we evolved to have religion?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.370
Hey believers and skeptics, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.680
Recently a study published in the journal
Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.630
examined how a certain part of the brain is
linked to belief in God.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.650
The study used 39 college undergraduates who
were all religious and politically moderate.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.340
They were split into two groups, the first
group had their posterior medial frontal cortex,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.679
or pMFC, temporarily inhibited with pulses
from a transcranial magnet, and the second

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.500
group got a similar treatment but with the
magnet turned down so it didn’t actually

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.969
affect how their brain worked.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.989
The participants were first primed with a
discussion on death and then asked whether

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.730
they believed in various aspects of a religion:
the devil, hell, God, heaven.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.559
Those who had their brain inhibited reported
believing in all that almost a third less

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.339
often than the students in the uninhibited
group.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.030
The conclusion the researchers drew is religion
could be a method for overcoming an ideological

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.030
problem.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.540
You see, according to the researchers the
pMFC they were tinkering with is used for

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.750
solving concrete problems, like figuring out
the best way to climb over a fallen log.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.640
It perceives a problem, determines the threat,
and decides a course of action.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.740
So the scientists from the University of York
and UCLA wanted to see if the same hardware

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.350
was implemented when a person is confronted
with the knotty problem of death.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.810
Death is scary and inevitable, so our brains
need a way to cope with that.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.310
This echoes what some other scientists believe
about religion.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.700
In 2008 the prominent atheist Richard Dawkins
was asked if religion must give humans some

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.340
evolutionary advantage, considering how ubiquitous
it is across culture and history.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.850
Dawkins responded that he did indeed believe
that humans had evolved to believe in God,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.259
but that it was the byproduct of mental machinery
that was advantageous in some other way.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.499
He compared it to a moth’s tendency to fly
into a candle flame because they evolved to

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.369
use bright but distant light sources like
the moon to navigate, and a candle confused

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.100
what had been useful for their survival for
millions of years before artificial light.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.330
Self immolation is clearly a bad survival
strategy for a moth, so it’s easy to write

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.640
that off as some other biological function
being coopted.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.240
But it’s possible believing in a higher
power helps our species.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.640
In a 2006 study published in the journal of
Developmental Psychology,Psychologist Jesse

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.230
Bering devised an experiment where he challenged
children to play a game that was impossible

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.030
to win without cheating.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.780
For a third of the children, each child played
by themselves with no supervision.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.280
For another third a researcher stayed in the
room with them.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.900
And the last group were told that there was
a magical invisible princess who would be

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.450
there watching them play.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.960
The result was the unsupervised children cheated
way more.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.320
And the ones who believed a presence was there
cheated about as often as when an actual adult

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.000
was sitting right behind them.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.890
Bering repeated the experiment with adults,
although presumably he didn’t tell them

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.320
a magic princess was there, and the results
were about the same.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.630
The thinking goes that if we believe we’re
being watched and judged, we all benefit.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.850
Professor Domenic Johnson of the University
of Edinburgh liked it to riding the subway:

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.450
in order for the subway to function, we all
have to pay.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.150
If one person cheats and doesn’t pay, sure
they have given themselves a little advantage.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.820
But if too many people do it, the whole system
collapses.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.000
It’s possible there are other explanations
for why dialing down the posterior medial

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.970
frontal cortex made participants say they
were less religiously inclined.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.340
The same study also found that those with
their brains inhibited were more accepting

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520
of immigrants criticizing their country.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.390
A 2011 study in the Journal of Neuroscience
found that similarly inhibited participants

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.080
conformed to social norms less, and another
study in the journal from earlier this year

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.490
showed that the pMFC keeps us making choices
that are consistent with ones made in the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.490
past.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.850
So maybe this part of the brain, along with
helping us solve problems, preserves how we’ve

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.290
learned to solve them before and so keeps
religious beliefs rigid.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.610
To quote the researchers of the original study
themselves, “more research is needed.”

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.680
Like it or not, religion is an essential part
of the human story.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.490
You’ve got your own story too, and no domain
extension will help you tell it like a DOT

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.790
COM or DOT NET domain name from Domain Dot
Com.

The topic of God and science is a great one,
there’s so much to talk about we couldn’t

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.470
possibly do it in one episode.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.010
So Trace devoted an entire week to discussing
it over on Test Tube Plus.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:36.840
Check it out right here.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.280
This is normally the part where I’d say
something to get you involved and talking,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.300
but I know for this episode I don’t have
to.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.620
Just remember to keep it civil, even if you
believe there’s no higher power watching.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.730
We’re all human beings people, let’s work
together for the benefit of the species.
