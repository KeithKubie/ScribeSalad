00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.740
You know, there's
this idea floating

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.545
around which I totally buy.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.655
And it's this notion that
we are already cyborgs.

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:21.389
People are so
dystopian when they

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:22.930
think about the
future of technology.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.900
But what they fail to realize is
that we have been in a feedback

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
loop, in a
self-amplifying feedback

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.010
loop with our technology
since the origin of language

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.850
and stone tools, for Chrissakes.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.540
We use our
technologies to extend

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060
the boundaries of what we are.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.310
Our tools are our exoskeletons.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.820
They are scaffoldings extending
our thought, reach, and vision,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.030
as Andy Clark says.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.910
There's a book by Andy Clark
called Natural Born Cyborgs.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.320
And him and David Chalmers,
they coined the extended mind

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.116
thesis, which is this idea
that we're literally extending

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:54.150
the boundaries of the human
mind with these technologies.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.840
Our Smartphones are
extensions of our cognition.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.470
They are examples of
distributed intelligence.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.420
iPhone, therefore I am.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.180
I mean, literally, this
idea that our second skin

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.230
is our technology.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.300
It's our turtle shell.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.360
It's our exoskeleton.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.319
It sort of blurs the boundary
of saying that there's nature

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.485
and then there's technology.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.475
And that in fact, it's
all on a continuum.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:17.050
And we, just smack in the
middle between the born

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.350
and the made, as
Kevin Kelly says.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.646
But even Nietzsche used to say,
man is a bridge and not an end.

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.970
We are a means towards
self-extension.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.550
Our technology has
become part of our skin.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.200
We must get over
our skin bag bias,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.020
the biological skin bag
is just one membrane.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.590
Our cells have membranes, too.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200
But our body's
still a part of us,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.560
and our tools are a part of us.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.630
We transcend membranes.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.645
We extend ourselves.

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:41.470
That's what we do.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.660
We are already cyborgs.
