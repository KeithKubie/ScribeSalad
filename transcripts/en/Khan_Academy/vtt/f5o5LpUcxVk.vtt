00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] So we have two different

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.870
economies depicted here.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.470
On the left, we have an economy

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.460
where its short run equilibrium output

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.340
is above its full employment output.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.810
And so it has a positive output cap.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.030
And it might seem like a good thing

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.530
that your economy's just
doing really, really well,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.860
even more than what is
actually sustainable,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.790
but there could be
negatives here, as well.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.040
You might be depleting resources
in an unsustainable way.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.400
You might start having
uncomfortable levels of inflation.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.460
And so in these situations,
if you don't have your

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.360
self-correcting mechanisms
happen to get us back

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.440
to our full employment output,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.010
a government might want
to do contractionary,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.720
And it also might be because

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.320
the contractionary
fiscal policy could undo

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.570
some expansionary fiscal policy
that was done in the past.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.220
And we'll talk more about that.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.840
But what are examples of
contractionary fiscal policy?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.700
Well, contractionary fiscal policy,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.810
you could raise taxes.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.010
That would decrease aggregate demand.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.010
Or, you could decrease spending.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.960
And if you think about what
it would do to these curves,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.120
it would shift our aggregate
demand curve to the left.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.850
The goal would be to get back
to our long run equilibrium.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.900
So you would want to get to

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.070
this aggregate demand curve two

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.890
through your contractionary fiscal policy.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.990
Now if you look at the right,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.040
we have the opposite scenario.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.150
Here, we have a negative output gap,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.210
sometimes known as a
recessionary output gap.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.130
And governments tend to get more worked up

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.860
about the recessionary output gap

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.520
because now people are out of work.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.920
Things are not good.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.384
And so what would a
government want to do if the

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:57.700
self-correction mechanisms
aren't happening?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.350
Well, they might wanna do
expansionary fiscal policy.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.650
And so they would wanna shift
this aggregate demand curve

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.650
to the right so that it looks
something more like this.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
So we'd get back to our full
employment level of output.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.260
So that would aggregate demand two.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.460
And what are examples of
expansionary fiscal policy?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.830
Well, it's gonna be the opposite.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.290
You could lower taxes

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.760
or you could increase spending.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.130
So let's focus on this, the
expansionary monetary policies

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.920
and actually dig a little
bit deeper into the numbers.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.780
Let's say we have an economy

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.780
where our marginal propensity
to consume is 0.75.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.060
And let's say that we have

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.350
a negative output gap right over here

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.860
of a hundred billion dollars.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.350
So we have one hundred
billion dollar negative,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.290
or recessionary, negative output gap.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.960
Let's first think about the
increasing spending lever.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.770
How much would we have
to increase spending,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.780
given this marginal propensity to consume,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.110
to close a one hundred billion
dollar negative output gap.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.060
Pause this video and try to solve that.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.970
Well, let's just think
about our multiplier.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.440
Our multiplier is going to be equal to

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.860
one over one minus the MPC.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.960
So that's one over one minus 0.75.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.680
Well that's one over 0.25,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.400
which is going to be equal to four.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.144
And so if you want to close

00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:50.670
a hundred billion dollar spending
gap, or sorry, output gap,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.680
so that's your output gap you wanna close.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.080
That's going to be equal
to your spending increase.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.550
So spending increase
times your multiplier.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.060
So in this case, it is times four.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.390
So if you divide both sides by four,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.390
you get your spending increase
is going to need to be

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.680
hundred billion divided by four

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.330
is going to be 25 billion dollars.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.163
Makes sense.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:27.110
If you spend, if the government
spends 25 billion dollars,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.440
because of the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.840
you have a multiplier four,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.840
so you have a hundred
billion dollars of more

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.600
of total spending that is
going to happen in the economy

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.640
because of that initial
government spending

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.390
of 25 billion dollars.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.180
But what if, instead, the
government wanted to do it

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.880
by lowering taxes?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.840
What would be the amount

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.090
that they would need to lower taxes?

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.060
Once again, based on this
very simplified model,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.040
in order to close this output gap.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.500
Well here, we wanna think
about the tax multiplier.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.690
Our tax multiplier is equal

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520
to our marginal propensity to
consume times our multiplier.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.020
So in this case, it's
actually the negative of that

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.960
because if you increase taxes,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.920
then that is going to decrease
spending and vice versa.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.140
And so this is going to be equal

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.730
to negative 0.75 times four,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.910
which is equal to negative three.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.970
And so one way to think about it is

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.350
if we wanna close a hundred
billion dollar output gap,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.190
that is going to be equal to delta t,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.330
how much we increase taxes,
times negative three.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.130
If we wanna solve for delta t,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.830
we divide both sides by negative three.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.330
And we get delta t, so let's
put a little arrow here.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.550
Delta t is equal to 100 billion dollars

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.720
divided by negative three,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.720
which is approximately equal
to -33 billion dollars.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.120
Once again, why is this negative?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.630
Well, this is your increase in taxes.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.510
So if that's negative,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.290
that means you lowered
taxes by 33 billion dollars.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.290
So lower taxes by 33 billion dollars.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.540
Now there's a couple of
interesting things here,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.320
other than just the
mechanics and the numbers.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.320
Notice that this number and
this number are not the same.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.920
And that's a common misconception

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.220
that they would be the same,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.720
that they would be equivalent

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.540
if you're trying to close the same gap.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.070
Notice they aren't.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.690
In general, if we assume
everything we just assumed,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.010
if you're trying to close
the same output gap,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.120
you would have to change
your taxes by more

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.410
than you would have to change
your government spending.
