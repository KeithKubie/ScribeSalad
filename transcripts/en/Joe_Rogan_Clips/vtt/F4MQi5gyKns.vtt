1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
I think within the last year or so for Max Holloway or like when Max Holloway's

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.030
face goes up on the screen,
people,
people go nuts cause they know he throws down.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.590
Yeah,
I think it was the Ortega fight.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.440
I really think that Ortega fight made him a superstar.
I really do.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.280
Although one's definitely helped them.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.490
The bad tabak although ass weapons and then Art Ortega,

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.710
one thing that was different,

8
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:24.711
those or Tayga had a big following or Tayga was the young beautiful lion lion

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.750
with fantastic Jujitsu's handsome guy.
Cool.
Smooth talker.
Looks like a champion.

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.400
Yep.
Fucking everybody up.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.330
So he had a lot of fans coming in there and they went to war.

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.020
They went to war and Max came out on top.
And I think Max,

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.070
a lot of those pm because they were so cool with each other during,

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.480
before and after,

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.470
people loved it to Max is he loses better than anyone on the fucking planet.

16
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.670
We'll loses or wins.
He just goes,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm just going to get better.

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
He doesn't lose a lot.
He doesn't know.
I mean he lost to Connor.

18
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.290
He lost very first ever,
you know,
but I 20 years old.

19
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.990
But I also think Max is because we've always said,

20
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.980
I think both of us had been an agreement where if a guy is cutting a ton of

21
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.190
weight and kill himself,
go to the next weight class.
I've always said that,

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.660
whether it was a Darren till,
whether you know,
uh,
Chris Weidman,

23
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.570
Luke Rockhold,
Jon Jones,
like,
dude,
go up a weight class dominate.

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.490
And then this is kind of the first time we've seen a guy where it's like,
hmm,

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.500
it's not that easy because Mac taller we went up,

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
but you could see the power wasn't there.
Like he might've,
he and he did,

27
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:33.870
he landed more than a dozen play.
But when Dustin had landed it,

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680
you could see that it fucking counted.
Dustin is big dude.

29
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.330
He's big [inaudible] 45 [inaudible] 45 and really struggled there.

30
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.530
Um,
but at 55,
he's found a spot and you look at him,

31
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.600
he almost looks like a welterweight.
I mean,
he's big.

32
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.230
He looks like Tyron Woodley size and he cuts a shitload of weight and Max

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.780
Hallway in that fight.
Just looked like they didn't look like the same.
No,

34
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.910
just play like fucking well and you've got to give credit to pour your too

35
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.470
because if you look at the two of them,

36
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:04.500
like after the fight there was a big difference between the amount of damage,

37
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.030
the poor Atlanta,
big difference.

38
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.790
He was hitting him with big shots and it wasn't just big shots,

39
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.240
it was shots period.
He was hitting him with really clean,

40
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.710
well time shots with great head movement,
great movement about that knee dude.

41
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.280
Everything split open his head,
everything.
He did everything great.

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.930
I mean he really,

43
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.890
that was a coming out party for Dustin Poirier in a lot of ways for the common

44
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:26.820
fan.
Well yeah.

45
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.570
Well the people that knew him from the gauge you fight knew him from the Eddie

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.930
Alvarez fight.
They knew that man,
he beat these two really good guys.

47
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.350
But Max Holloway might be one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world

48
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.880
and I think is I think is to Max hallways the greatest one 45 of all time.
Yes.

49
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.770
I think he's a damn good.
50 fiver but,
but 55 could be tough for Max.

50
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.430
Well this is a great example of what we've always said about the differences

51
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.870
between the size of people.
And this is,
it's,
it's first of all,
I mean,

52
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.200
all credit to,
uh,
Dustin Poirier cause he put on a phenomenal performance.
He got,

53
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.890
you know,
he got tested in that fight.
He came through.
Let me see.

54
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.230
We've talked about in the post fight interview that he got hurt in the third

55
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.770
round.
He came through and just super impressive.

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.550
Think about as striking a pennys Anthony Pettis,

57
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.330
world champion [inaudible] world champion,
Eddie Alvarez,
world champion,

58
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.540
Max Holloway,
World Champ Pedis one though.
Wasn't that an injury?

59
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.970
I feel like Penn has got injured and they stopped the fight.

60
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.680
Like did he break his hand?
Is that what happened?
No.

61
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.420
Feel like the pet,
it's one was an injury.
He had the issues with Eddie Alvarez.

62
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.810
Right.
Which was a no contest.
Yeah,
I think,

63
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.370
well there was one fight where Dustin Poirier no.
Yeah,
I think,

64
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.270
I think that was it.

65
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.490
There was one fight with Pettis were Pez broke his hand at Duke.

66
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.910
Roufus stopped the fight.
Remember that Ferguson was the 21st Tony Ferguson.

67
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.780
You're right.
You're right.
But I think that was a great frown.

68
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.480
Maybe it was an injury.
Oh,
is a rib member.
I was a right.
That's right.

69
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.330
That's right.
Dustin got on top of him and hurt his wrist.
Right,

70
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.870
but still look at plays.
Wins,
man.
Yeah.
Well that's a weird one too.
Right?

71
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.120
It's cause like what was that rib injury from it pouring a body shot.

72
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.500
What was that from?
Or is it from the takedown?
Like what was it?

73
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.290
Something happened.
I don't remember.
That's right.

74
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.540
But he's more like a Tko.
Yeah.
You look at portrays his list,
man.

75
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:17.920
The guy's who's fighting,
who's lost too.
It's so impressive and poor is the guy.

76
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.970
Same thing with when Michael Bisbing one I always root for those guys,

77
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.550
those guys who have been around forever and they fight the best of the best.

78
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.410
They might lose one or two here,
but they've been around for so long.

79
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.350
You just hope there's a title at the end of their career.
Yeah.

80
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.270
You just hope and it sometimes doesn't look like it's going to happen.

81
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:37.240
Then when it does happen,
I just,
I'm just so happy for this.

82
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:41.140
Such a good guy to Dustin poetry guy.
He's a great guy.
He's smart.

83
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.510
He's ambitious.
Seal Vons.
Favorite fighter.

84
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.300
Works hard to how lyricists that scene,
those two guys together.

85
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.140
That was hilarious.
Called them the right.
Both went the same whole school.

86
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.660
How about Theo was yelling instructions.
I'm going to,

87
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.630
I seem to mind king of steam.
I'm going to roast the shit out of him.

88
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.200
Did you yell at take off down.
I went.
What?
What is happening right now?

89
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.150
Why does this happen?
Yeah.
Shouting instructions.

90
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.310
UFC provides me with a headphone.
I was hoping you'd,
you had to turn around.

91
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.270
I'm like,
dude,
what are you doing?
I'd love to,
you know,
he's the best.
Yeah,

92
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.200
just character.
Unique kid.
He was so happy.

93
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.300
He was so happy me made him bet.
Well,

94
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:18.650
I just bet because obviously him and you thought,
um,

95
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.550
that I thought did you think was going to be a great fight?

96
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.390
I thought Max at 55 if everything was and carry with them,

97
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.910
I thought Max would probably get it done by noon,
was going to be good fight.

98
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.450
I was just spending field because Theo is boys with Dustin from the same area,

99
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.020
so it's just a friendly bet.
I would never bet against us in boy,

100
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.440
look at these fools.
Hilarious.
That's amazing.

101
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.710
How about a few fields?

102
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.960
Never been in a fight before and he texted me halfway through goes,
dude,

103
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.530
I can't believe you did this shit.
I go,

104
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.670
maybe a little respect now around king the staying right.

105
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.070
You're a little fucking respect,
bro.
Yeah.

106
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:58.400
He was looking at it as a complete outsider is no idea.
I told him,
I said,

107
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:02.530
it's super intense,
man.
You're seeing for the best fighters on planet earth.
