[Narrator] Hi class, this is homework assignment #6 on SLAM,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we're going to practice some more questions about the graph SLAM algorithm,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I will ask you something new about how to make graph SLAM more efficient

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
towards the end of this homework assignment.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There's 3 questions and 1 new thing,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which comes with additional questions and a programming assignment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's dive in.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In this example, picture a robot that starts at initial position 5.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This robot which lives in 1D, even though I'm drawing this in 2D,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sees a landmark with a relative measurement of 2.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It then moves to coordinate X1 by taking a step of 7.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It now sees a different landmark, L1, with a measurement value of 4.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Finally, it moves again with a motion 2,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and now it sees the same second landmark, not the original one,at a value of 2.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Obviously, when I work it out and solve this,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you find that the best coordinates over here are 12 and 14,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with landmark coordinates of 7 and 16,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but none of the numbers I just told you will be inserted in the question I'm about to ask.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Picture the matrix omega and the vector C.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I want you to add all these constraints into omega

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
with a caveat that for the initial constraint I assume the strength is just 1,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
so enter it the way you're used to.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now let's assume the motion update has a sigma of 1,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but the measurement update--the sigma for measurements has a value of 0.5,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and remember we weigh those updates with 1 over sigma,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which in the measurement case would therefore be 2.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I want you to fill in the values for sigma and for C for this specific example.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I gave you some of the sigma values and some of the C values,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and I want you to fill in the missing values over here.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You can check whether you got them correct by verifying that I got those numbers correct,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and you can also solve for omega minus 1 times C,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and out should come the right positions shown in the diagram over here.
