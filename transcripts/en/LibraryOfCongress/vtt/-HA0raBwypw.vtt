00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.600
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.800
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.130
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's Concert Office.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.780
Tonight we welcome John Szwed

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.560
for a lecture called
"Painting Jazz".

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.400
We are very fortunate
to have Mr. Szwed

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.580
at the Library this spring.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.020
He's in residence with
us now as a Library

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.400
of Congress jazz scholar through
the generous support of the Reva

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.590
and David Logan Foundation,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.510
which is also underwriting
tonight's concert

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.500
by Steve Coleman
and Five Elements.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.630
This week in the Music
Division we've had the pleasure

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.490
of sharing with him some of
our remarkable jazz treasures

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.450
from the collections here.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.560
Author, journalist, and
critic, John Szwed is admired

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.700
for a terrific series of
brilliantly perceptive books,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.750
to date eighteen,
including acclaimed portraits

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870
of major figures in jazz.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.520
Their books both
authoritative and provocative

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.000
that exhibit an enviably
comprehensive knowledge

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.510
and a very personal
experience and expression.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.520
These include "So What: The life
of Miles Davis", "Alan Lomax:

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.970
The Man Who Recorded the
World", and "Billie Holliday:

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690
The Musician and the Myth".

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.940
He has a distinguished academic
background, receiving Guggenheim

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.790
and Rockefeller Foundation
Awards, and teaching at a number

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.860
of prestigious universities.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.260
At Yale, John Szwed was
John M. Musser Professor

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.910
of Anthropology,
African American Studies,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.650
and Film Studies for 26 years.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.860
He was also Louis Armstrong
Professor of Jazz Studies

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.710
at Columbia University, and
editor in chief of the website

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.750
"Jazz Studies Online".

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.290
And I wanted to be
sure to mention,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.180
given the Library's
historic connection

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.730
with Jelly Roll Morton, that
he won a Grammy for Dr. Jazz,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.080
a wonderful book published

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.680
with the landmark
Rounder Records box set,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.180
"Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete
Library of Congress Recordings".

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.510
So please welcome John Szwed.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.310
[ Applause ]

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.300
&gt;&gt; John Szwed: Thank you,
Anne, for that generous,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.200
over generous introduction
and thank you all for coming.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.640
I don't take that lightly.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.550
What I'd like to do, what I'd
like to accomplish is to first

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.320
of all, suggest that
there's a tradition between,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.460
tradition that involves
both jazz and painting

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.740
which is much richer and deeper
than is normally thought,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.190
and that there's an affinity
between these two arts

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.260
that is not usually
paid attention

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.110
to by either of the arts.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.110
And I'm fascinated by the idea
of one art affecting another,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.060
but that's never been a popular
subject for anyone to write

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.150
about particularly, a
comparative aesthetics,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.520
whatever you want
to really call it.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.110
How literary people,
for example,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.880
respond to painting
and so forth.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.220
But that's part of my interest.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.850
I'd also like to get
across the idea that,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.190
that I have to keep reminding
myself that the high arts

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.600
and the low arts, whatever
they are, or they used

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.980
to be quaintly called,
often share far more

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.510
than they're differentiated by.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.220
And the other point, I
suppose, would be to simply say

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.580
that the enormous effects that
African-American aesthetics,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.600
and painters, and artists had
on modernism itself is enough

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.710
to call, you can call it
Afro-modernism if you wanted to.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.430
And that's my plan.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.030
I came on this subject
when I heard people talking

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.280
about museums having jazz events

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.480
and they were saying something
like, "Well, there's the death

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.490
of the jazz if it's
going into a museum".

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.490
On the other hand, they would
be saying, "They're just looking

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.120
for new demographics".

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.900
Well, I knew that was wrong but
I didn't know how wrong it was.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.620
For example, starting in 1940,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.000
the Museum of Modern
Art had concerts

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.910
and presentations
on jazz every year.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.080
And as far as I know,
has continued

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.890
through all those years.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.810
Going further back, 1936, San
Francisco Museum had courses

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.920
in jazz, and lectures.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.280
And several of the leading
authors of books on Picasso

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.050
and Duchamp were also
people who wrote about jazz.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.350
I'm thinking of Rudy
Blush [assumed spelling]

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.650
and Harriet Jenis
[phonetic spelling].

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.950
But it goes further.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.400
Well, let's see how far do
we want to go with this.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.060
Dr. Barnes of the Barnes
Foundation, in 1928,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.370
was lecturing on Picasso
and his relationship

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.940
to African-American music.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.520
And I don't think
he was saying --

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.870
although who knows because
nothing exists from that.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.400
I don't think he was saying that
one was affecting the other,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.810
but that they were
sharing something.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.110
Maybe he was saying it.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.410
I don't know.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.090
I shouldn't even try to
pass by so quickly on that.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.750
But, you know, I think
it's even further back,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.170
even before the first
record that we call jazz

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.590
and that itself is probably
a wrong idea to try to figure

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.100
out which one the first one is.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.320
Even before the first jazz
record, at the Armory Show

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.730
in New York in 1913, we have
the evidence of Stewart Davis,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.520
the youngest painter
who was in that show.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.480
And in reading what he said
about it shortly afterwards,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.320
I think he was only nineteen or
something like that and he was

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.690
in suddenly in Gauguin,
and Picasso, and the like.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.910
I remembered that Nudes
Ascending a Staircase,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.370
which was the thing that got
all the attention that year,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.120
was standing alongside of
"Alexander's Ragtime Band"

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.530
which was a monster hit that
was changing dance, dress,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.830
everything else in sight.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.300
It was overpowering music.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.040
Anyway, this is what Stewart
Davis, the young artist,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.870
said later, "My objective
was to make paintings

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.630
that could be looked while
listening to a jazz record

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.950
at the same time without
incongruity of mood".

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.180
And when he saw the Gauguin
and Matisse paintings, he said,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.310
"There was an objective
order of those works

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.480
which I felt was
lacking in my own.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.430
It gave me the same
kind of excitement I got

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.380
from the numerical precisions
of the Negro piano players

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.460
in the Saloons of
Hoboken and Newark.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.280
And I resolved that I
would quite definitely have

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.710
to become a -- and he puts in
quotes -- a "modern artist".

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.310
And it's among his first
paintings are figurative

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.140
paintings of those very
piano players and orchestras

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.280
that he talked about, the
very dark tones of gray,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.150
and charcoal, and the like.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.020
It should be, I suppose, no
surprise that jazz, modern art,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.950
modern dance, and motion
pictures should share something

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.150
because they all grew
up at the same time.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.300
And you can, without too much
trouble, find your way in.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.800
And for example, the
other day in upstairs

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.520
in the wonderful music
collection I find the great

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.240
drummer, Max Roach, talking

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.370
about how all the
beboppers were going to see

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.080
"Fantasia" over and over again.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.140
[ Laughter ]

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.750
And he was so detailed
about that.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.310
And why not?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.610
I mean -- .

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.760
Oh, he also says, "When
we heard [Inaudible],

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.420
we said, 'He's one of us'.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.460
We weren't playing wrong notes".

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.760
I loved it.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.730
[ Laughter ]

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.830
Anyway, the word jazz at
the time, and we're talking

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:44.110
about back into teens and 20's,
had a patina of, that was not,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.840
it had a, it reverberated
a kind of modernism

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.140
that was beyond music.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.190
And, in fact, it was often used
in such a way that didn't refer

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.140
to music and there's some
documentation that's pretty

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.820
severe about this showing
just how far this went.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.170
People would put
up signs at a bar

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.770
that said jazz, it had no jazz.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:07.640
And they also put up escalator,
sex appeal, cocktails,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.920
gramophone, would be just
cool, you know, this is it.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.220
This is the modern stuff.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.290
But I can remind you that
certain rappers started

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.280
to be known as jazz
including Jay-Z.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.580
I don't know why
he changed that.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.970
Maybe for some reasons that
we don't want to know about.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.340
But at any rate, there
was the word had this kind

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.910
of symbol of modernity.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.130
And when it appeared in its
earliest forms of ragtime,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.260
the talk about the music
became a kind of obsession,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.560
or at least an obsession
[inaudible] backward

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.240
over that, a major controversy.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.870
If you ever have the curse
to read everything written

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.850
about jazz before
1930, which I've done,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.950
in English at least,
you'll be astonished.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.080
It was everywhere and
everyone was arguing.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.950
And it had to do not
just with the music.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.250
That sometimes disappeared.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.140
Had to do with what
clothing you were wearing,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.310
and how long a woman's
hair should be,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.860
and whether you'd
smoke cigarettes.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.490
You get some of that in F. Scott
Fitzgerald, and particularly

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.540
in his [inaudible],
what's it called?

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.210
The end of the jazz era where
he's really nasty about -- .

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.650
Did anyone read that anywhere?

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.560
But he's telling you how it was
awful and we were awful people.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.490
And he says, "One doesn't want
to know anyone who says, 'Yes,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.180
we have no bananas,' anymore".

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.480
[Inaudible].

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.700
But beyond the fashionable, you
might ask what was it about jazz

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.780
that led to its particular
impact in painting?

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.610
I don't think it escapes
the painters that,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.020
especially in America,
that jazz was an art form

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.600
that was not coming from Europe.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.120
It was quintessentially
American.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.540
It was not coming
from the Mozarts.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.950
It was not one of the
so-called pure traditions of art

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.540
and it was wide open
for them to use.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.740
And the Europeans who
picked up the same kind

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.150
of influence were coming
from a different place

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.720
but they didn't --
how can I put this?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.290
They situated their paintings
in the United States.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:06.050
I'm thinking of Piet
Mondrian and Francis Picabia.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.720
Their paintings on jazz are all
situated in the United States,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.000
and I'll come back to that
in a second, and not in Paris

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.530
where they might
have heard it first.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.450
And I think once painters
understood that improvisation

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.750
and playing in the moment
was the essence of jazz

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.740
that that seemed to
resonate as an idea

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.850
that might tone something
for their own practices,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.970
particularly among those
who were interested

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.810
in esoteric things or surrealism

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.920
where the subconscious was
presumably allowed control

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.220
over work.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.820
And jazz could be particularly
attractive in that way.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.750
Some even spoke of jazz
musicians as performing

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.490
under spirit possession.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.440
Then there was the impact
of rhythm which was as hard

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.900
to grasp how much it turned
heads around at that moment.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.940
It was no longer something that
was underneath or behind music.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.570
It was pushing forward
and front.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.630
And some picked up the fact
that rhythm was itself melodic

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.450
which they could have gotten
from any number of cultures,

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.980
Latin cultures for that matter,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.550
but they weren't looking
there at that time.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.460
So that this was a new
way of approaching things.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.230
And the drum set, for example,
in Europe became an art object.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.370
Jean Cocteau declared
himself a jazz drummer

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.840
for about three weeks, I guess,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.590
and then said he
was all over it.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.490
Francis Picabia and Darish
[Inaudible] both bought drum

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.640
sets and said they
were jazz drummers.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.600
Man Ray had himself
photographed as a one-man band.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.840
But rhythm was more than
what the drum was about.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.790
It was, in early jazz especially
there was something going

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.490
on that was unheard of before,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.410
at least to me it
seems unheard of.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.730
One is simultaneous
collective improvisation

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.380
where musicians are all
playing in their own style

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.120
and they're all improvising
at the same time

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.600
around a minimal theme and
amazingly enough never clashing,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.820
or at least in our ears today.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.200
That was pretty astonishing
in itself.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.000
I think in broadest sense rhythm
made people think about space,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.300
and perspective, and -- .

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.020
Listen to this excitement
of discovery

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.160
in a 1933 article titled
"No More Perspective"

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.240
by the French designer and
arts writer Rene Gruyere

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.590
[assumed spelling].

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.430
"In jazz all elements are
brought to the foreground.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.740
This is an important law that
can be found in painting,

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.770
in stage design, in films, and
the poetry of this period,"

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.230
1930's, "Conventional
perspective with its fixed focus

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.180
and its gradual vanishing
point has abdicated.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.020
In jazz it's not
the accompaniment

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.700
in song that's similar to a
figure against a background.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.480
In jazz everything works.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.290
There's not a solo instrument
against the background orchestra

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.240
and each instrument solos while
participating in the whole.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.460
Each person plays for
themself in general ensemble.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.280
The same law applies to art.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.390
The background is
itself a volume,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.180
that is to say a three
dimensional self."

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.780
A decade later Sergei Eisenstein
is [inaudible] summarized

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.810
that same article by noting

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.840
that jazz had multiple
perspectives instead

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.590
of a single fixed perspective
and had erased the strict lines

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.250
between foreground
and background.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.260
But then he added, "We've only
to glance at cubist paintings

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.720
to know we've already seen
this in jazz records".

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.020
This is strong talk.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.730
I don't know how it strikes you

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.490
but this is people reaching
right across the arts

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.020
and saying something's happening
here that's much bigger

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.920
than we've been perceiving
at this point.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.350
Well, some of this jazz
painting connection, well,

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.910
I don't think we'll
go into this.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.040
You can talk about sociological
aspects but the fact

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.980
that in New Orleans virtually
every jazz musician was also a

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.020
house painter, a carpenter,
they still are for that matter.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.280
And I've seen some of their
business cards and they're kind

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.780
of interesting to see.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.510
They'll say things like --

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.010
I don't know what
you call [inaudible].

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.970
What is a person who
sculpts in plaster,

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.010
does woodwork in plaster?

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.460
[ Inaudible ]

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.600
[ Laughter ]

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.900
Well, whatever.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.860
That kind of thing.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.570
And then down at the bottom

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.950
of the card it will
say, "clarinet player".

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.910
So you can use the same
card for multiple purposes.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.500
That kind of thing brought
together people who were good

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.130
at several arts at once.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.320
But you would see the same thing
happen in the 1950's at places

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.560
like Stanley's Bar, or the
Cedar Bar, or the Five Spot

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.990
where artists and
musicians were talking

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.730
about these things
in various ways.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.000
And it's not surprising, I
guess, to see that the number

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.020
of painters like Franz Kline, or
Frank Stella, and Norman Lewis,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.670
both the de Kooning's would have
oblique references in paintings

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.490
that aren't exactly --

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.070
there will be a word maybe in
one painting or just a title,

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.670
Five Spot, or something.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.630
They're memorializing
this particular encounter

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.930
they're having.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.800
Now there's a long history, and
complex history, of comparison

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.400
between music and painting.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.570
And many attempts at
turning, making sound visible.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.370
But even if we limit ourselves
to considering only the subset

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.200
of these people who were
inspired enough by jazz

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.630
to render it into
painted images,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.530
the variety of what they
did is very impressive.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.880
And now what I want to do
for the rest of time is talk

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.470
about a few of these painters.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:35.170
Francis Picabia, Arthur Dove,
Piet Mondrian, Stewart Davis,

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.890
Harry Smith, Jeff
Schlanger, and Robert Ryman.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.880
And when I can, I'm
using musical examples

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.300
that we know they were listening
to when they painted it

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.940
and actually said it was
part of the painting.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.620
That's kind of hard to
find but I've found a few

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.870
and we'll reel up as they can.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.590
One of the first -- .

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.660
Let's get going here.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.440
One of the first is a
painting done by Picabia.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.260
Just had a big show in New York.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.800
And he, very colorful fella
who was supposed to be

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.280
over here making
deals with the Cubans.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.550
Or he was on his way to Cuba
to make deals to get sugarcane

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:17.460
for sugar for World War I,
but he put it off for months

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.090
and stayed in the Village where
he was drinking, and carousing,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.320
and listening to music, and so
forth til his wife wrote him

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.760
that he was about to
be court marshaled.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.060
That would mean he'd be shot

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.470
because he never did what
he was supposed to do

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.100
in the Army and he went on.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.270
He's remembered today
as a collector

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.420
of 120-some cars and so forth.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.760
But I'm fascinated by
the fact that he went

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.070
to a Harlem cabaret during his
first week in New York in 1913,

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:47.100
when his own show was on and
this painting is one of the two

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.400
that resulted from it.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.740
It's called "Chanson Negre".

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.390
This is number one
and the other is two.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.210
We don't know what he's
listening to except it was

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:59.920
about a singer at that cabaret
he said, which moved him deeply.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.660
When he was asked by a "New York
Times Herald Tribune" reporter

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.670
to explain the principles
of abstraction, he says,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.320
"Does the musical composer
attempt the literal reproduction

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.650
of the landscape scene, of
its details of form and color?

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.950
No. He expresses
it in sound waves.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.590
And is there absolute
sound waves?

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.110
So there are absolute
waves of color and form".

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.380
Now abstractions
of music that were

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.830
as a subject is no surprising
thing and not a big thing.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.130
And, you know, you go back

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.640
to the nineteenth century
Walter Peters' insistence

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.680
that all great arts will
aspire to the status of music

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.920
and that kind of thing has been
floating around a long time.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.880
I'd only add here that written
music is itself already an

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.180
abstraction of music.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.870
And when you get to jazz
when people are playing off

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:56.840
of just chord indicators,
it gets even more abstract.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.000
While in New York, Picabia met
the young American painter,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.170
Arthur Dove, and they found
they were using similar forms

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.660
and repeated arcs in their
work to suggest rhythm

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.380
in their music paintings, as
well as some of the colors.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.870
Arthur Dove in the 20's
did paint from recordings

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.560
and daringly attempted
to produce works

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.690
that were the visual
equivalent of the feelings

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.420
and sensory qualities involved
in the acts of playing music,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.370
recording it, and listening
to it all on a single canvas

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.190
and that meant that in some

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.750
of his paintings you can
actually see the playback

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.760
machine, you can see sound
waves, and you can see some kind

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.060
of rendering of music.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.390
He's trying to do
it all at once.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.310
Let me go to this one which
is "Rhapsody in Blue".

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.400
He was at the premier of
"Rhapsody in Blue" in 1924,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.700
very excited about it.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.330
It was Paul Whiteman's orchestra

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.430
and George Gershwin
on the piano.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.110
And when the recordings came
out, which is, if I'm right

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.770
about this, it was a two-sided
78 abbreviated recording

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.720
of what had happened.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.430
So that was going
to be the basis

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.790
of the two paintings he would
make, side A and side B.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:08.330
And this is side A, or
part one, as he called it.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.670
He spent days of listening
and painting, he said,

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.080
turning the record over
and over as he worked.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.200
He said his painting
will make people see

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.980
that the so-called abstractions
are not abstract at all.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.950
It's an illustration.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.340
I'm not sure what
he was up to there,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.920
whether he's saying
abstract is too scary.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.530
I don't want to drive
people away.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.610
I don't many people would
see "Rhapsody in Blue"

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.910
in that painting, though.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.930
But he certainly heard it.

was listening to at the time.

And there's something -- .

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.540
Let me go back to that.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.340
There's something odd
about this painting.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:51.400
Right here is a aluminum, or it
seems to be an aluminum hook.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.810
And then a watch spring is
unraveling down there, in fact,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.110
it [inaudible] watch spring.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.910

It's funny, you know, I'm
not an artist for sure

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.470
and I don't quite understand the
language but they seem to worry

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.000
about was that really the
clarinet being [inaudible]

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.720
rising up or was it really
the crank of the phonograph

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.240
which had a spring in it?

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.650
Well, it beats me.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.260
I mean, it's abstraction, right.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:28.120
So you go with that.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.350
Mm. Mondrian had
already heard jazz played

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.900
by Black American servicemen
in Paris after World War I

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.440
and learned some of the new
dances that had accompanied it.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.750
He was apparently a bad
dancer, but he insisted

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.190
on doing it publicly
all the time.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.980
In 1927, he wrote an essay
called "Jazz in the Neoplastic,"

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.040
in which he spells out
not only his plan to paint

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.760
in the purest form possible,
that is with straight

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.190
and horizontal lines, square
and rectangles, primary colors

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.770
and no colors, but
it's fascinating to me

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.320
that he conceived of this purest

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.020
of the pure art while
he was listening

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.780
to what many White
Americans at the time thought

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.850
of as the most debased
of musics, jazz.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.030
"But jazz," he says,

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.260
"now realizes an almost
pure rhythm thanks

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.440
to its greater intensity
of sound.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.370
Its rhythm gives the illusion
of being open and unhampered

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.260
by form," and form and
tone were his big issues.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.000
"Jazz, above all, creates
the nightclub's open rhythm.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.660
It annihilates form.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.060
It frees rhythm from form.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.640
The nightclub is a
haven created for those

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.490
who would be free of form."

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.660
[Laughs]. I love it.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.790
When he first came to New
York, he surrendered to jazz.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.200
He'd spend nights
dancing with Lee Krasner

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.510
and Peggy Guggenheim
at Cafe Society.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.570
For those of you interested
in trivia, the connection

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.050
to Jackson Pollack through
Krasner is interesting here.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.560
You know, there was always a
question if he really liked jazz

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.530
or was he really painting
to it, but whatever.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:57.130
It seems to have been
someone there before him.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.530
This is my latest discovery.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.020
He was also in Harlem at
Minton's, an afterhour club

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.170
that I believe didn't open
til about four in the morning.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.470
Larry, is that right
[inaudible]?

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.230
You didn't take that
casually, you know,

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.930
[inaudible] there was
some seriousness in mind.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.530
And he befriended, or was
befriended by, Thelonious Monk.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.570
And this is the time when bebop
was beginning to take over.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.380
And Monk often, according to
people, some Dutch writers

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.180
who were there said, often
referred to his own music

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.440
as if it was like
Mondrian's paintings.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.880
This is getting really
fascinating to me.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.390
That's as far as
I've gone with that.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.240
So let's look at the most
famous of his paintings,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.540
Broadway Boogie-Woogie.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.770
And this they fortunately
have lots of pictures --

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.660
I don't have them here -- but
lots of pictures of his studios

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.330
and they were pretty Spartan,

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.530
very white with these
basic colors in play,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.790
and then there easels, and
very neatly laid out things,

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.530
and a huge pile of
boogie-woogie records

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.180
that he played all the
time he was working.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:07.170
He thought, despite this
connection to bebop,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.780
that's another thing I've
got to find out later,

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.840
he loved boogie-woogie,
especially as played

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.680
by the piano trio of Albert
Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.260
and Pete Johnson at Cafe Society
was the quintessential form

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.890
of the music.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.820
I don't know why he said that
exactly, although it seemed

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.640
to me that that kind of music
always had a kind of form

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.700
that seemed to have no
beginning, middle, and end.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.920
It was just rolling out like
a train through the night

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.030
with no particular
ending in sight on it.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.520
His 1942 and '43 painting

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.630
of Broadway Boogie-Woogie
was associated with one

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:51.560
of those records Ammons,
Johnson, and, and whoever.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.860
I'm blocking it out now.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.790

Stewart Davis, we
mentioned before,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.160
he had painting jazz musicians
in New Jersey when he was a kid.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.150
He became very close to Duke
Ellington, to Earl Hines,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.450
to [inaudible] Pete Johnson.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.730
He actually named his two sons
Earl for Earl Hines and George

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.000
for George Wettling, a
drummer who he liked,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.670
and Wettling became
a painter himself

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.660
of some quality later on.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:32.790
And if you look at his
work before he was really

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.200
into the jazz work, you get this
kind of thing which has hints

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.810
of pop art to come,
and so forth.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.730
These are actually, it's
two separate paintings

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.540
which he presented together
like that under the title

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.590
of A House and Street 1931.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:52.670
And I bring this up because when
he did this painting in 1945,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.460
and kept working
on it until 1951,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.190
he had in mind over-painting
the previous paintings.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.050
So if you go back and you
look to the brick walls

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:07.900
on the far side and the color of
the side over on the other side,

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.720
it must be the L or something
over there in the yellow

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.670
and building colors, you can see
it still operating on the left

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.190
and right side of this.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:19.920
Only here, now he's
gotten into a thing

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.580
where he writes cool
things on his paintings.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.880

like the 60's, right,
but the mellow pad was,

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.690
he said he was somewhere
deep into this

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.030
and he was doing it for years.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.140
He said, "What I needed was
Punch Miller's trumpet,"

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.510
and that's what I've got here.

Usually these songs is
to me kind of remarkable,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.330
but I'm not ready to say
how I think that worked

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.820
out in the paintings
exactly yet.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.150
For this I'm turning to Harry
Smith, more famous as a person

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.560
who changed how folk
music was thought about,

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.450
a very strange man I'm trying

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.270
to write a book about
at the moment.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.710
And this is a kind
of mandala and it's,

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:52.180
if a mandala is supposed to
be about the entire universe,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.690
this is about an entire record

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.330
and the record is Dizzy
Gillespie's 1947 record,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.330
"Lover Come Back to Me".

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:05.480
Now the way he operated with
this painting was to put it

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.590
on the floor using mirrors
it reflected to the side

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.810
and he would follow the,
show you what the things were

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.140
in the painting as
he went along.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.850
Now the only person
alive who seemed

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.780
to have paid close attention
to this was Jordan Belson,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.600
the filmmaker and painter.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.640
And he drafted out a
kind of schematic of this

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.000
but it's really a
very minimal in trying

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.660
to figure out what it what.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.570
You can sort of see that it
began, it says [inaudible]

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.100
on the side but it also seems
to be coming from the top,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.030
and it says, "slow trumpet,"
and then it starts around,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.970
going clockwise and you
could see first solo,

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.270
second solo, and so on.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.570

bit of that music.

that's not the word.

He's trying to translate,
to make a total translation

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.430
from one form to
another one that way.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:00.670

is a little different.

Jeff Schlanger who
calls himself --

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.960
what does he call himself
-- the music witness.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.540
And he paints live
performances in live time,

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.670
that is he starts the second
the performance starts.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.420
He stops when they stop.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.410
And he operates on the
assumption, I think he told me

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.950
that music was the fastest means

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.120
of communicating
information on earth.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.170
Oh, I'm not going to argue.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:29.110
And that if it takes
fifteen seconds

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.340
to play, it takes to hear.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.960
So if he's painting, it takes
fifteen seconds to paint.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.880
This is Cecil Taylor.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.550
It's a painting called
Art [Inaudible].

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.660
And you can sort of vaguely see

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.860
to the left a pianist
[inaudible] figurative stuff

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.950
there, but the rest

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:52.460
of it involves him not exactly
throwing paint, but moving it

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.420
and then shifting
that he's working

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.950
with so it flows
in various ways.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.440
No one else has tried
this and it's,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.560
to me at least, very
interesting.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.490
Well, let's see, with the
little time I've got left I want

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.510
to touch on Robert Ryman.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:12.320
Ryman was a musician who came
to New York in the 1950's

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.350
after being in the Army to
study with Lennie Tristano,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:20.330
a very cultish, not
well known pianist.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.910
I say not well known, but,
you know, "Time Magazine" used

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.370
to mention him and they've
called him the Bartok

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.880
or the Schoenberg of jazz.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.350
It made no sense but
they'd throw it in.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.220
And Elvis actually encounters
him in "Jailhouse Rock"

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.240
where he's out of prison and
he's being taken to a house

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.630
where a bunch of college
professors are discussion how

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.180
jazz has gone too far, and
how Brubeck is too far out.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.700
And then someone
brings up Tristano

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.080
and said he went over the edge.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.590
And the professor turns
to Elvis and says,

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.890
"What do you think, young man?"

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.590
And he says, "Frankly, I
don't know what the hell you

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.890
talking about".

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.510
[ Laughter ]

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.220
So minor, yes, and out
of it, well, you know,

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.520
and he had some kind
of importance.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.790
Now when Ryman got to New York,
bebop was the form of music

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:11.470
that was in operation
and it was, you know,

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.740
it was a singularly,
what can I say?

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.730
It was aiming to be unpopular,
let's put it that way,

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.030
at least much of it was.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.580
It was not about, it was
musical effrontery in a sense.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.280
It was self-consciously and
relentlessly demanding skills

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.660
and approaches that were not
in that particular genre.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.080
And one of the things
they did was to -- .

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.510
By the way, they often
dressed as artistes,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.780
in full artiste with, you
know, berets and what have you.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.080
Dizzy Gillespie especially.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.750
And they would throw words
around like anthropology,

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.510
and epistrophe, and ornithology.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:51.900
And it was really exciting
music to a group of ex-soldiers,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.200
and those who never served

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.530
because they never
knew the war was on,

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.790
and those who were traveling
one place to the other.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.530
And there were experiences of
discrimination, and dislocation,

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.010
and strikes, and war time.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:07.690
But bebop melodies and rhythms
were singularly asymmetrical

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:08.990
and jagged.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.630
And then added to that was
the use of altered chords

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.240
which they often
left unresolved.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.860
As one older musician who didn't
like that music said to me,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.530
"It's like somebody's wash is
out on the clothesline flapping

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.280
in the wind and it
never stops flapping

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.580
and that's what that is like.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.970
It doesn't resolve, you
know, it didn't go anywhere".

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.500
Previously jazz musicians
had picked up tunes,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.620
played you the tune at the
beginning, and at the end,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.240
and in between they did
variations of the theme

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.770
so the audience would
know what they were doing.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.760
These people were going
in a different way.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.730
You would find the
harmonic structure

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.460
of a song overlaying
with another song.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.880
So "Sweet Georgia Brown" could
be turned into Coleman Hawkins'

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.380
"Hollywood Stampede",
or Thelonious Monk's

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.350
"Bright Mississippi", the old
subliminal melody shimmering

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.700
underneath this new one.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:04.010
It's what the musicologists
would call a contrafact,

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.130
often a form of homage
or parody.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.410
But in bebop these
ghostly surfaces

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:13.670
with something shimmering
through it opened up attention

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.670
that looked like new
possibilities were involved

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.970
with it.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.270
Now people that didn't like
this music would call it

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.570
Chinese music.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.470
And I was fascinated with what
the same people were calling

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.400
abstract expressionism
Chinese painting.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.440
Why is it Chinese are taking
the bulk of this, I don't know.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.430
It's like someone
said of, I know,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:33.980
it was said about John
Coltrane who spent a lot

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.280
of time studying Indian music,

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.260
"Shouldn't they have said
Indian music and not Chinese?"

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.170
Anyway, Ryman was studying
this music and then he gave it

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:48.150
up after becoming a
security guard at the Modern

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.640
and seeing a lot
of painters' work.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.910
And the way you, what he chose
to do, if you know his work,

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.900
nearly all of it is pure white.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.140
He spent 40, 50 years
of painting white.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.410
He said his paintings weren't
abstractions of anything.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.880
They weren't about
anything except paint,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.860
if you can picture this.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.700
So he's concerned with brush
strokes and the way white works.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.000
And there's a joke
in here somewhere

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.310
but I'm not going to go into it.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:20.820
But at any rate, whenever he
was talked to by arts people,

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.750
he would try to answer
as a musician

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.400
and it would take
him off the subject.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.110
So I went back and looked up
so here's some of the -- .

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.680
"I came from music
and I think that type

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.020
of music I was involved
with, jazz or bebop,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.600
had an influence on my painting.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.820
We played tunes.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.160
It's all songs nowadays,
telling stories very similar

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.270
to representational painting
where you tell a story

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.570
with paint and symbols.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.080
But bebop is a more advanced
development than swing.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.530
It's like Bach.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:45.830
You have the chord structure,

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.320
you use that to develop
in many ways.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.840
You can play written
compositions

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.240
and improvise off those.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.500
So you learn your instrument,
you play within a structure.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.420
It seemed logical to be
in painting that way.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.240
I wasn't interested in
painting a narrative

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.700
or telling a story
with a painting.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.700
Right from the beginning
I felt that I could do

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.880
that if I wanted to, but
it wouldn't interest me.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.980
Music is an abstract medium

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.870
and I thought painting should
also be just what it's about

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.080
and not about other things, not
about stories or symbolism."

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.950
And then he said, "There must be
something about the relationship

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.100
between art and music that
makes the transition from one

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.770
to the other easy and natural.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.670
Maybe it's the patterns
and deviation.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.520
Maybe it's the same way a jazz
player plays the melody straight

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.670
the first time and
then rewrites it.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.320
Good art sets up a structure
that everyone's familiar with,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.530
square mounted on a wall,
paint on it, and then departs

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.280
from the expected tune and
inspires you to go home

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.370
and think, or blow your
horn, or something."

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.010
What he went so far as to
say that he wasn't going

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.880
to title any of his paintings

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.560
because a title would
suggest something

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.700
when it's just about paint.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.000
Paint is paint.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.200
And he spends a lot of
time working with paint.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.050
He said, "It would be disastrous
to put a title on it."

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.350
But that wasn't quite true.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.770
I found as I was
looking at his paintings,

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.720
for ten years he kept
putting in musical titles

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.020
which he somehow
wanted to forget later.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.190
"Love Lines" which was the name
of a Lennie Tristano piece based

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.700
on "Fooling Myself," a song
associated with Billie Holiday.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.320
And "Untitled" and then
behind the "Untitled" is

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.660
"Background Music" in 1962,

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.470
which a Warne Marsh
composition based

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.270
on harmonic structure
of "All of Me".

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.490
So what I'd like to do
is show you the painting

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:28.550
as a concluding operation here.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.040
Now the problem with this,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.860
with his white paintings is you
can't see what it is he wants

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.030
you to see which is what's
underneath the white.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.190
But can you see a
little bit of it?

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.670
The [inaudible] coming through.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.970
Let me go back now.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.310
[ Music ]

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.510
That's Billie Holiday
and "All of Me".

00:38:53.510 --> 00:39:00.230
[ Music ]

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:05.510
And this was a favorite musician
she worked with [inaudible].

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:42.530
[ Singing ]

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.890
And this is "Background
Music" which is built

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.760
on the harmonic structure
of that piece.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:40:24.380
[ Music ]

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.890
Now we don't have his comments
on this but we do have comments

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.790
on another painting,

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.320
mainly because it was the
only painting he ever did

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.620
with real color.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.850
And in an interview in London
when this was being shown there,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.340
they said, "Well,
what's happening here?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.490
I mean, this is the only
thing you really untitled,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.930
'Orange Painting'".

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.240
He said, "Well, I don't
remember the process.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.560
There are probably all kinds
of things going on there.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.010
It didn't start off
orange, I'm sure of that".

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.310
[ Laughter ]

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:53.140
And then he pointed
to the edges,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.700
particularly the upper right and
to all around, but particularly

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:03.510
up there, and he said,
"That's important".

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.090
[ Laughter ]

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.090
On another occasion he said more
clearly, "They are not white

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:11.440
or monochromatic paintings".

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.000
Because people were
saying, "It's always white.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.840
I mean, you know, come on".

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.950
Because of the surfaces
functioning as a second color

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.820
in contrast to the
white of the paint.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.290
And then he'll spend a
little time talking about,

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.140
which I don't need to
go into, but about, no,

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.040
here's one more I'll give you.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.120
"It was a matter of making
the surface very animated,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.630
giving it a lot of
movement and activity.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.840
This was done not just with
the brush work and the use

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.660
of quite heavy paint,
but with color

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.580
which subtly creeping
through the white".

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.430
So he's rather modest
about his work

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.060
and about what he's
done with his stuff.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.780
And it seems to me he's
creating the visual equivalent

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.460
of the form and organization of
a certain type of jazz and one

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.490
that was originally developed
in interaction with other people

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.390
through performance rather
through in solitary composition.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.980
And that raises the question of
why would you listen to records

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.430
when you do these things

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:07.010
if you're not actually
going to copy them?

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.100
I'd like to suggest without any
more evidence than my guessing

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.620
that it puts you in interaction
with the musicians in some way.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.010
So you see this in
Jackson Pollack's,

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.340
almost dancing, swirling.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.750
But there were other more
simpler ways to do that just

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.140
with brush strokes and the like.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.940
This kind of music I'm talking

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.190
about which is learned
while you're playing

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:34.930
with others primarily rather
than in solitary composition,

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:38.440
creates a kind of an
aesthetic through performance

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.550
and the music is something of
an ethic as well as an aesthetic

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.310
because you're dealing
with other people.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.170
And I think Ryman is alluding
to that ethic in this work

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:50.650
and that may also tell us
why he paints listening

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.540
to music like he does.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.840
Well, that's the
general argument.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.820
I'm running out of time and I
thought I could summarize this

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.320
but instead of summarizing it,
I'll just give you an anecdote

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.640
which won't quite handle
what I'm talking about

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.480
but nonetheless it's this.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.820
Elaine Kooning, Elaine Kooning

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.030
and Willem Kooning were big
jazz fans to start with.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.190
She did a painting of, actually
a charcoal of Ornette Coleman

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:22.180
which was quite realistic for
her, quite clear is what it was,

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.260
and signed it, and
gave it to Ornette.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.050
My wife and I were at a
party at Ornette's once,

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:29.410
probably a New Year's
Eve or something,

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.700
and he gave out copies
of this to everybody.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.000
It was just great to have

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.840
because there was only
one of them out there.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.480
But he had erased her
name and put his name in.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.340
And when asked about it, he
said, "It was my picture".

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.670
[ Laughter ]

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.430
But, do any of you
know this story

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.030
about Rauschenberg
erasing de Kooning?

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.420
Robert Rauschenberg got the idea
as a young guy it would be cool

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.320
to erase something of
one of his seniors.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.060
So he went to de
Kooning and said,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.550
"Have you got a drawing
I could erase?"

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.640
And de Kooning thought he was
nuts, you know, this is crazy.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.050
So he just kept badgering him,

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.660
"It's just something I
could do something with".

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.370
So he gave him one,
and by the way,

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.380
it's not completely erased but,
you know, it's mostly there.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.500
And then he signed it
Robert Rauschenberg.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.930
Well, I suppose this is
getting with, from both sides

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.540
of the Rauschenberg
thing coming back to -- .

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.950
So my point again is the role
of these arts and interacting

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.040
with each other which I don't
think has been properly dealt

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.560
with, the role of
African-Americans at the base

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.280
of this music, and whatever
else you get out of it.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.080
Thank you very much.
