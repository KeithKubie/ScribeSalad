00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.880
I want to do a quick video on
something that you're likely

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.960
to see in a statistics class,
and that's the notion of a

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.210
Type 1 Error.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.280
And all this error means is that
you've rejected-- this is

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.310
the error of rejecting-- let
me do this in a different

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.300
color-- rejecting the
null hypothesis even

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.550
though it is true.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.890
So for example, in actually all
of the hypothesis testing

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.390
examples we've seen, we start
assuming that the null

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.980
hypothesis is true.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.960
We always assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.150
And given that the null
hypothesis is true, we say OK,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.670
if the null hypothesis is true
then the mean is usually going

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.710
to be equal to some value.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.620
So we create some
distribution.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.310
Assuming that the null
hypothesis is true, it

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.060
normally has some mean value
right over there.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.160
Then we have some statistic and
we're seeing if the null

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.260
hypothesis is true, what is
the probability of getting

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
that statistic, or getting a
result that extreme or more

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.230
extreme then that statistic.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.220
So let's say that the statistic
gives us some value

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.530
over here, and we say gee, you
know what, there's only, I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.620
don't know, there might be a 1%
chance, there's only a 1%

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.410
probability of getting a result

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.570
that extreme or greater.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220
And then if that's low enough of
a threshold for us, we will

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.440
reject the null hypothesis.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.150
So in this case we will--
so actually let's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.720
think of it this way.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.680
Let's say that 1% is
our threshold.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.820
We say look, we're going
to assume that the null

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.660
hypothesis is true.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.700
There's some threshold that
if we get a value any more

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.860
extreme than that value, there's
less than a 1% chance

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.670
of that happening.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.680
So let's say we're looking
at sample means.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.920
We get a sample mean that
is way out here.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.260
We say, well, there's less
than a 1% chance of that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.900
happening given that the null
hypothesis is true.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.020
So we are going to reject
the null hypothesis.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.620
So we will reject the
null hypothesis.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.510
Now what does that
mean though?

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.540
Let's say that this area, the
probability of getting a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.580
result like that or that much
more extreme is just this area

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.100
right here.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.250
So let's say that's 0.5%, or
maybe I can write it this way.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920
Let's say it's 0.5%.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.950
And because it's so unlikely to
get a statistic like that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280
assuming that the null
hypothesis is true, we decide

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.260
to reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.890
Or another way to view it is
there's a 0.5% chance that we

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.470
have made a Type 1 Error in
rejecting the null hypothesis.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.150
Because if the null hypothesis
is true there's a 0.5% chance

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.240
that this could still happen.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.500
So in rejecting it we would
make a mistake.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.460
There's a 0.5% chance we've
made a Type 1 Error.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.700
I just want to clear that up.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.130
Hopefully that clarified
it for you.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.920
It's sometimes a little
bit confusing.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.010
But we're going to use what we
learned in this video and the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.980
previous video to now tackle
an actual example.
