00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.870
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.900
I'm Anne McLean from the
Library's Concert Office.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.630
My colleague, David Plylar
and I have the great pleasure

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.200
of talking with Kristian
Bezuidenhout tonight.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.500
Welcome back to the Library.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Thank you.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.520
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It's exciting
for us to have you here again.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.840
The program we had him here,
fortunately, the last time,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.930
maybe one or two
of you heard it,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.790
was with the [foreign
language] an all-Haydn evening.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.250
And I think you created that.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.290
Right? You put it
together with part songs.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.590
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.040
And it was a kind of dramatical
program that was the kind

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.810
of narrative of part songs, solo
keyboard sonatas and solo songs,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.480
originally mixed in
with readings as well.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.590
But we didn't do the
readings, I guess,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560
in the concert version here.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.640
It was a wonderful program.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.180
It ended up being a
wonderful program.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.480
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It was.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.780
I was listening it.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.080
We have a recording of it.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.380
I was just checking
it out the other day.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.680
Very special.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.820
Tonight you will be performing
both Haydn and Beethoven.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880
So, everyone on our
staff has been watching

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820
over the years since that time.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.620
The raves that Kristian has
been receiving as a master

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.570
of three instruments,
harpsichord,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.070
forte piano, and piano.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.830
The London Times calls
you the most brilliant

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.050
of today's forte pianos with a
claim for a consummate command

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.840
of the possibilities of
the instrument really.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.180
And critics comment
that he creates magic.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.550
So, we're looking forward now
to chatting with you about some

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.530
of your magical skills.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.410
Your prestidigitation.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.180
And learning a little bit about
the works we'll here and also

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.900
about the instrument
we'll hear tonight.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.120
So, with that, maybe since
probably several of us have some

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.030
of your Mozart recordings, maybe
we could start by talking to you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.720
about this multi, multi-volume
set that you've made

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.520
and your obsession with Mozart.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.050
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
People often ask me

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.350
where this comes from.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.090
And over the course of
many interviews I've had

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150
to just really admit,
quite honestly,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.600
that for me the big
watershed moment,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.880
was Amadeus, the film actually.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.310
I must have seen it
when I was about 8 or 9.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.680
Nine probably.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.030
Because I remember very
distinctly that some

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.190
of the scenes my
parents shielded me from.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.740
The first scene where
Salieri tries to kill himself.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.920
But I still think it's
the greatest film made

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.930
about a composer,
regardless of any

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.560
of the historical
quibbles one might have.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.060
I think it's arguably the
greatest film about a composer.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.660
Because Peter Shaffer was
absolutely insistent on the fact

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.410
that one of the central
characters

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.860
in the film would be
Mozart's music, in fact.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.520
And I think unlike any
other film about a composer,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.690
the role the music plays
in that film is portrayed

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.890
with such honor and reverence,
in a sense, and also the taste

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.400
that went into choosing
the best moments,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.250
musically speaking,
in that film.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.960
I look back now and
see the film,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.380
and I realize that's what
really struck me about it.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.110
And just this -- the music
somehow spoke to me so deeply,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.590
very subconsciously,
unconsciously.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.890
[Inaudible comment] Yes.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.910
I realized at the time that my
parents had played a huge amount

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.010
of music in the house when I
was 2, 3, 4, 5, really at an age

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.710
when I wasn't able to say, oh,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.350
that's the Mozart
big g minor symphony.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.930
Or that's Figaro cosa
[assumed spelling] e.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.990
But hearing this
music in the film,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.850
you realize that your
childhood memories ingrained

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.710
in you then come to the surface.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.780
It was a very strong moment
of connection on that level.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.730
And after that, I was
completely obsessed.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.210
I wouldn't listen to
anything but Mozart.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.150
My parents loved Bach
and Beethoven, as well.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.680
But I was very single minded.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.120
[Laughter] And around
that time Phillips brought

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.460
out the complete Mozart edition
in time for the 91 celebrations.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.080
And that was, I mean, that
was the only thing I cared

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.330
about in my whole life
was having that set.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.630
And of course, my
parents realized

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.130
that it was ridiculously
expensive.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.870
But it -- the man and the music
and the myths surrounding him

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.060
and the fact that it was
the celebration year.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.570
I also discovered quite a lot
of recordings of his music

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.140
at that time that changed
my life forever, as well.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.290
And it was a sort of perfect
storm of timing and a situation.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.800
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Your first
recording was actually

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.100
an all-Mozart.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.400
Just outside the Harmonia Mundi.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.700
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's right.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.000
It was huge.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Not many people know
about that album.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.570
It was a volume of old
Mozart keyboard works,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.780
and specifically old
Mozart in minor keys.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.230
I wanted to -- the disc
is called [inaudible]

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.570
and I was 20 years old.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.910
And just had the mad idea
about how this thing would go.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.440
I recorded the disc in one day.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.020
Which I don't know how --

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.090
I really don't know
how I did that.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.530
I would die now, I think,
if I had to do that.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.900
But the idea was
it had a red cover.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.280
Every piece was in a minor key.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.620
I was trying to portray
a Mozart who was inspired

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.440
by the [foreign language]
movement of the middle

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.650
of the 18th century, even

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.340
if you don't think that's
a real musical movement.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.540
It's very clear that something
is in the water around that time

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.320
that inspires people like Haydn.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.990
And later, I think, Mozart
emulating Haydn to write music

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.400
of uncommon stress and violence
and rhetorical extremity.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.950
And, you know, it can't
be any coincidence

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.520
that they're all doing this
somewhat at the same time.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.200
They're choosing pieces in --

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.510
writing pieces in keys
like G minor consistently.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.310
And this very angular,
somewhat tempestuous music comes

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.170
out of these guys and is later,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.990
I think Mozart then later
replicates this style

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.290
in honor of that.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.310
But I wanted to show a
side of Mozart's character

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.730
that was the furthest
thing away from this kind

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:13.610
of genteel elevator music
that his music can turn into,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.730
particularly his keyboard
music if not treated

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.140
with the right kind of
combination of intensity

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.360
and unlocking, maybe let's
say, hidden layers of meaning

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.390
or detail that are not
necessarily conveyed

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.410
by the specificity
of the notation.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.710
I put it that way.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.010
But, yes, that's right.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.690
That was the very
first album, David.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.160
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Though
you develop

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.530
in your [inaudible] conveyed

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.210
by the specificity,
that's interesting.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.780
So, are you thinking of just
each player, what he brings

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.930
to the instrument
itself each time

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.300
or about convention no
ornamentation or treatise?

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.330
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Its -- at the end of the day,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.840
it's much more a
question of understanding

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.520
that the exasperating fact
about playing any music,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.430
particularly music from the 18th
century, is that my feeling is

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.790
that the difference between the
blue print that you're given

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.670
as the text, the black and
white dots on the page,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.400
which convey rhythm and
pitch, and all this stuff.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.530
The difference between
that and the end result,

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.830
is I would argue some of the --
a larger gap than possibly --

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.040
well, this is probably very
contentious what I'm going

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.340
to say.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.910
But I think, I believe
in the case of Mozart,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.730
that gap is possibly the
largest of any composer I play.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.950
In the sense, that Mozart's
music is the least --

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.250
well, here's some examples.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.920
When you play Bach, for
example, there's a huge amount

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.030
of abstraction that happens in
the presence of interpretation.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.480
Which is not necessarily
conveyed in the notation.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.030
But the notation doesn't
need to have it there.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.890
With Mozart, the trouble is, if
you treat his music like that,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.530
it sounds very boring.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.630
Bach can be played a Moog
synthesizer and there's a kind

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.030
of incredible delight and magic

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.540
that happens as a
result of that.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.810
But yes, we recognize the
dance references in his music.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.040
The incredible symmetry, the
incredibly refined counterpoint.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.230
Mozart sounds absolutely
unlistenable on midi.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.690
And I think composers who
do require a lot more care

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.120
and effort and charm
and love and attention.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.620
I think the 18th century
idea of what it means

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.520
to play a piece means to graft
your personality onto it.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.170
I mean, this is why people
like Mozart and Haydn

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.170
and Beethoven veer
so dramatically

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.000
from their forefathers,
from Handel and Bach.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.110
And that is, the act of
composition and performance

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.650
and reading the text
becomes a kind of triangle,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.320
a trinity of acts, text
and acts, and performance.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.590
And none of that is
really in the notation.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.570
I mean you know what
articulations to play

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.210
and sometimes what
dynamics to play.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.870
But really, to get to the heart

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.460
of the conveying the
rhetorical message

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.870
of the music is what
18th century --

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.960
late 18th century music
is all about, I think.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.850
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: In
reconcile just a little bit.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.390
One thing that I hadn't
mentioned is that you used

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.750
to play on multiple
keyboard instruments.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.380
And if you trace, say,
across the lifespan of Haydn,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.500
where he's writing for
specifically different types

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.330
of instruments over time,
his level of specificity

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.340
in his notation does
increase, I think.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.640
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.330
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: How
does that interface

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.630
with what you were just saying.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.050
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: That's
such a good question, David.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.140
Because I think what you see --

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.390
well, what David
says is so true.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.210
Haydn has a career,
possibly the largest span

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.360
of any keyboard career,
in a sense.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.350
Haydn is writing clearly
for the clavichord,

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.700
in certain repertoire.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.720
Absolutely, he knows
the harpsichord.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.430
He is also greatly
enamored of this piano.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.780
He writes specifically the
chances [assumed spelling]

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.630
instruments were his absolute
favorite, over the kind

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.930
of south German, Viennese
style, five-octave instrument

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.730
that Mozart and Haydn knew at
this time, and also Schubert

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.400
in the early part of his career.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.910
Then, of course,
Haydn goes to London

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.880
and plays the new-fangled
instruments in that city,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.680
which are dramatically different

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.980
from the Viennese
instruments he knew.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.000
I think what happens
with Haydn, for example,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.380
you see in the London sonatas of
the early 19th century of Haydn,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.710
that he starts, I think, writing
dynamics and articulations

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.410
that possibly indicate
in his mind,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.410
what a Viennese player
must think of and do

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.910
when they're playing these
pieces on a London piano.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.840
So, he writes lots of wedges.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.100
And very interesting kind

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.550
of quite kooky instructions,
in a sense.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.960
Incredibly weird and strangely
specific dynamic markings

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.850
that you very rarely see
in other Haydn pieces.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:08.060
Then, at time, when you go back,
let's say 30 years and look

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.890
at works that might have been
conceived of and/or performed

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.690
at the clavichord, Haydn is
strangely lazy about details

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.060
of articulation in a way
that Mozart is never.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.810
I mean, to the end of his days
Mozart will lavish attention

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.570
in matters of articulation

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.180
and become incredibly
lazy with dynamics.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.730
And you see these different
priorities surfacing

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.990
at different times for
both of these guys.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.610
I've never thought
of it quite like that

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:41.200
but it does really document
Haydn's current obsession

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.040
with that said keyboard
instrument that's

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.340
in front of him, perhaps.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.640
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Do you
think it has anything to do

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.630
with their playing styles
or performance styles.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.990
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Very much so.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.120
I still don't know exactly
how to put that into words.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.220
I think someone like Tom Baggen
[assumed spelling] would be able

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.150
to explain that really
eloquently.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.380
But I think those connections,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.050
the way the notation
is reflected,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.660
the way the notation
reflects composes relation

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.930
to his keyboard instrument
at that time.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.410
This is one of those sort
of secrets, Holy Grail,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.160
elements of performance practice
that's yet to really be --

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.450
really brilliantly shown.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.210
Because it's such a personal
covenant between player

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.130
and instrument, especially
now in this configuration

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.530
where we are playing in 2016-17,
on old instruments and trying

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.750
to recreate what we
know about the style.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.370
And yet, it's a very,
very post-modern thing

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.410
that we're doing now,
playing these old instruments

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.710
in modern times.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.420
But it's become so trendy
to hear performance of music

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.080
of the 18th century played

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.380
on period instruments
in modern times.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.550
It's all just -- it's
kind of messy in a sense.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.110
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, this for a
follow up further on the Haydn.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.120
This is an unusual
piece that you're doing.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.620
The variations.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.450
How did you put this
program together

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.500
and how does it relate
to the Beethoven?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.210
Also, David has some comments
on the octave writing in Haydn,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.100
which is very unusual.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.630
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Absolutely.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.810
This is a clear anomaly for
Haydn, this sub variations.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.490
It's strange on so many levels.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.360
Structurally, it's odd because
Haydn has this melancholy

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.430
wistful theme presented
in F minor.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.320
And then a new theme,
binary theme,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.270
which he presents immediately
after it, in F major.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.000
And I think this is one
of those cases, times,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.960
when you really realize
that people like Mozart

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.020
and Schubert were so deeply
impressed by Haydn's ability

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.770
to go back and forth between the
minor mode and the major mode

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.190
without any preparation.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.330
And it becomes a real
trope at this time,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.160
in the late 18th century.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.530
That aside, Haydn chooses the
key of F minor for this piece,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.490
which is a hugely
unusual choice for him.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.340
I mean, we know he writes
symphonies in F minor.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.300
F minor is described differently

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.770
by different theorists
at the time.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.510
But the basic -- I think
the basic thing that you get

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.900
from F minor from almost
everyone is a sense

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.960
of loneliness and despair.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.740
A kind of melancholy tragedy.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.440
It's not the realm of C minor
or G minor, which for Haydn,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.540
I think, and also for
people like Mozart,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.420
have a much more brutal
kind of fate knocking

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.720
on the door characteristic.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.980
This is music of unbelievable
introversion and introspection.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.390
Curiously, then, you go along
with the set of variations,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.660
which is very intimate
and kind of timid

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.010
and yearning and sorrowful.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.900
And then Haydn does something
that you'll see later

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.450
in Schubert, for example,
in the A major sonata 959.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.250
Where you have this
ostensibly very quiet, sad,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.630
intimate structure or mode, or
rhetorical style established.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.740
And then he just goes mad.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.350
The music kind of
stops, as it were.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.330
And descends into
complete fantasy.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.900
Fantasy madness.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.640
It goes into strange key areas.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.810
It goes into D flat major,
which is a relative --

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.030
it is the relative
major of G flat major.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.780
It's -- sorry, the
dominant of G flat major.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.430
And then all of a sudden, you
have this outburst of kind

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.270
of tragedy and virtuosity.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.560
Which then dies down again.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.550
And then we return to
the barebones structures

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.760
of the original,
albeit, slightly altered.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.240
It's a very -- it's kind of a

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.260
like a scenic kantarto,
this piece.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.410
It reminds me a lot of
Arianna A Naxos, actually.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.580
In the sense that that
it's charting kind

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.610
of mental breakdown
but then returns

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.410
to some order of semblance.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.820
And it can't be any accident
that Arianna a Naxos starts

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.190
in E flat major, has an
aria in D flat major,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.120
an aria in F major,
and by the end

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.730
of the piece it's in F minor.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.260
And documents Arianna,
who is stuck on Naxos

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.470
and spends 20 minutes just
complaining about the fact

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.850
that her lover rejects
her and leaves her there.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.260
That it ends in F minor in
this kind of world of madness

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.680
and feminine scorn and fury.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.410
And I think F minor is very
deliberate choice for Haydn

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.130
in that sense, in this piece.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:24.570
What I wanted to do as well,
was get these guys together

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.320
in way, Beethoven and Haydn.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.490
Because Haydn goes to Vienna
and studies with Beethoven --

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.680
sorry, other way around.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.690
Beethoven goes to Vienna and
studies with Haydn for a while

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.840
but it's not a great
relationship.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.370
And it's very clear that
Haydn knows instantly

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.070
that this is an enormous
talent but, I think,

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.570
he feels very slighted
about the fact

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.920
that Beethoven never
really publicly acknowledges

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.730
that he is Haydn's student.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.810
He dedicates music to him but
there isn't this sense of,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.860
let me present a public
concert in your honor

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.120
or let me really
publicly acknowledge you

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.870
as my mentor and teacher.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.330
And I think, in that sense,
when Beethoven studies

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.790
with Albrechtsberger he realizes

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.200
that he's got someone he
can control a lot more.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.280
And Haydn doesn't really
do that for Beethoven.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.000
I think it's very clear
that they have a kind

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.690
of jealousy towards each other.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.950
Because they both know that
they do the same thing so well,

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.410
in a sense, and that is that
they have this uncanny ability

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.580
to take sometimes
the most banal,

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:28.490
kind of ridiculously crude
material and spin these motives

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.200
out in such ingenious
ways, often at the expense

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.460
of sophisticated
material to begin with.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.280
I mean, I think sometimes
both Hayden and Beethoven,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.740
if you really talk to them and
say, if you took to this kind

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.540
of material, let's say this
motive to your compositions,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.020
[inaudible] said look I've
got this fabulous figure.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.820
It's going to be the
source of inspiration

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.720
for the following 20, 5
to 10-minute movement.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.220
They would all say,
well, that's madness.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.060
This is not going to work.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.030
On the other hand,
someone like Mozart,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.670
goes to his composition
teacher and presents them

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.590
with five themes and they're all
just excruciatingly beautiful.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.580
And the problem becomes, well,

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.880
maybe choose two of
them but not five.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.620
And Mozart says, well,
no I'll write a rondeau

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.140
and I'll have five
themes that are just

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.230
of this incredible
characteristic beauty

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.530
and brilliance.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.540
I think for both Haydn
and Beethoven the idea

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.270
of writing a melody that
can just sit by itself

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.740
and be completely at home
with itself, rhythmically

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.430
and melodically, is something

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.230
that exasperates
them a little bit.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.330
And also, really
find counterpoint.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: As opposed
to your talking about Mozart

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.190
when he was able to do that.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.490
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Exactly.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.790
That's my theory.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.250
I mean there's this amazing --

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.430
496 is a trio, a
piano trio of Mozart.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.230
And he writes a variation
movement.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.970
And then I think the second

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.100
to last variation is a
[inaudible] variation

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.680
with invertible counterpoint
in it.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.820
And Beethoven copies
this variation many times

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.720
with great exasperation,
you can tell.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.650
Because he's sort of
saying like, ye Gods,

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.470
how is it possible that someone
like Mozart can absorb the style

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.910
of Handel and Bach
of having to getting

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.800
to know it sort of about 1782.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.300
And immediately absorb
this deeply,

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.210
deeply sophisticated
contrapuntal possibility

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.510
into his own writing.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.820
I mean, he does struggle
with it a little bit

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.230
in the Haydn quartets.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.530
Interesting somehow.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.810
That's sort of ironic, I think.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.640
But Haydn and Beethoven don't --

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.100
they are jealous of
different things.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.590
They're jealous of the
things they don't have.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.090
And Beethoven is jealous
of what he sees in Mozart,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:40.330
which is this effortless,
lyrical grace and counterpoint.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.070
And, I think, this is my theory

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.150
and I think people will
argue with me a lot.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.140
But I think Mozart is the --

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.630
is hands down the master
orchestrator of his time.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.920
I think he gets a lot of
great ideas from Haydn.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.500
And Beethoven does as well.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.490
But I think the palette of
19th century orchestral sound

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:08.410
that we have, that really became
the standard sound is almost all

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.640
set up by paradigms that
Mozart establishes basically

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.590
from scratch, actually.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.910
This idea of what the
wind band can sound like.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.210
[Inaudible response] Absolutely.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.090
I mean, Mozart comes up
with these ideas seemingly

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.860
from nowhere.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.870
He starts writing for
the clarinet in this way

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.950
that is now completely
idiomatic to us.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.170
But is really -- it really
comes out of nowhere.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.710
He decides to write for
very specific instrumental

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.910
combinations like flute
and clarinet without oboes,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.430
in the material piano concertos.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.380
Questions of balance
and timbre between flute

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.880
and bassoon, for example.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.010
And then vis a vie the
clarinet and oboe groups.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.270
The way those groups interact
with the string sound.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.790
This level of sophistication
is something that you see

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.940
in every single genre that
Mozart writes in, in the sense

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.160
that the orchestration
possibilities of every one

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.360
of those genre is
unsurpassed and seemingly

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.360
without previous [inaudible],
with the possibility

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.520
of a string quartet and
the symphony, obviously.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.480
But from Haydn -- I'm
rambling here a little bit.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.780
You should stop me.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.080
[Laughter]

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.450
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I want to come
back to something later about --

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.330
just more about the
program at large.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.790
But speaking of your -- the
use of the word orchestration

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:32.020
and Haydn, in particular, I
know that you speak eloquently

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.230
about the way that one can
approach the fortepiano.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.460
But I want to bring up
one technical aspect,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.400
that I think is an example
of Haydn orchestrating

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.210
for his instrument,
in this case,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.920
and that's the crossed hands.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.690
And then that type of --

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.030
we'll see that in
several pieces tonight.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.130
It strikes me thought, as I'm
used to hearing more of this

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.390
on modern piano, personally.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.300
But it strikes me
as being much more

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.270
of a significant
gesture in that world.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.460
Maybe you could speak
to that a little bit.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.760
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Absolutely.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.600
The hand crossing
thing is a big thing.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.520
Put it this way, in music for --

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.800
in music like sonatas
which is designed to played

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.710
in small settings,
i.e. not in public.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.180
You see that composers
like Mozart and Haydn tend

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.480
to be quite conservative

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.310
in the technical demands they
play -- place on players.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.120
Mostly because these
sonatas are not --

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.950
they don't imagine
these sonatas as works

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.410
for the future in a sense.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.710
This is music that's designed

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.460
to be eaten up, devoured
by amateurs.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.500
Very good players technically.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.530
But Mozart doesn't write a
keyboard sonata with the idea

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.490
of playing it in public.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.070
But the one thing that
he does always play

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.870
in public is sets of variations.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.560
I'm just trying to highlight
the difference between public

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.860
and private in the 18th century,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.940
which was an incredibly
strict divide.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.360
Keyboard sonatas were
not played in public.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.290
The fact that Mozart
played a violin sonata

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.910
with Regina Strinasacchi
at a public concert

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.330
in the 1780s is incredibly
unusual.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.730
The fact that he plays the
quintet for piano and winds

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.340
at a public concert, to
which people buy tickets,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.610
is super strange.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.360
But at every one of these public
concerts, Mozart, for example,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.640
who we know especially in his
blockbuster period from sort

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.770
of 1780, let's say, 3 to
6, always played a piece

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.580
of pure improvisation
in a concert.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.840
Whether a fantasy, which is a
piece that has various themes

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.760
and sections strung together
or of said variations

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.960
on a well-known tune or an
original melody by Mozart.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.910
And he would really do these
on the spot, institute live,

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.680
in front of an audience.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.100
And then we're lucky enough
that he wrote them down.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.340
But hand crossing, you only
see in Mozart variations sets

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.400
and in Mozart piano concertos
because these are pieces

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.350
that are designed
for himself to play.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.860
So, they necessarily contain
the most virtuosic music

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.350
that you'll see in his career.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.680
And I can tell you that the
technical demands versus,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.630
from the variation sets
compared to the sonatas,

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.760
are enormously different.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.150
And hand crossing, there's a
visual rhetoric involved in this

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.470
as well, which is what
David is bringing up.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.770
Which I think is wonderful,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.360
is that you actually see
the hands crossing over.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.890
Which is something that 18th
century audiences, I think,

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.930
would have found absolutely
outrageously crazy to look at.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.950
So, you've got the
visual element.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.780
But the other thing is, if you
listen to a program like this,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.610
bear in mind that the
five octave fortepiano

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.090
of the 1780s was seven keys
has very different sound

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.150
characteristics in
each register.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.870
Because the striking
point is different

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.170
in every part of the piano.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.390
So, the place where the hammer
hits the sting is very different

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.200
in the base, compared
to the tenor,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.580
compared to the upper treble.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.400
So, you've got this
kind of geography

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.110
and topography then established
by visually seeing the fact

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.820
that the hands are playing
in different places.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.860
So, you can actually see
that they're doing that.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.210
Which I think, really underlines
or underscores the fact

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.340
that the sound of those
registers is so different.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.210
So, the left hand will be
doing its thing in the tenor.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.780
And the right hand will
go to the extreme base

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.080
and then extreme treble.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.280
And I think that's a real
kind of masterclass or expose

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.240
in how different those
areas of the piano sound.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.260
So, you can hear it and
see it at the same time.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.170
I mean, the idea of
Haydn to do that is so --

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.430
it's such a mind bender
because it's a variation set.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.390
Which is ostensibly a public
genre for technical display

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.970
but it's in F minor
and it's andante.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.440
And yet there's these tools
of virtuoso showmanship

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.490
that are incorporated into it.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.510
Really fascinating
example of that.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.560
[ Inaudible question ]

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.370
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat
the question?

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Would he have
played that ever himself?

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.510
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.470
I think probably --
I don't really know.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.970
I'm very -- I'll admit that I
don't have a very strong sense

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.720
of Haydn, the person performer,
when I'm playing his music.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.030
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I don't either.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.140
You don't read much about it.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.440
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: No.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.310
It's very hard to
know exactly what --

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.020
which of these pieces
he was playing.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.320
Which of them he
sort of designed

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.720
for himself to play privately.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.050
Pieces like the London Sonatas,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:25.220
they were clearly not
meant for his performance.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.100
Haydn is one of those guys
who is not really fettered

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.870
by the realities of playing.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.440
A little bit like
Beethoven in the sense.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.410
Where Mozart is deeply,
deeply concerned

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.180
with what's possible
on instruments.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.690
Haydn doesn't really care.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.020
And so, as a result
creates these kind

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.020
of fantasy realms
of possibility.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.150
Which, again, I think,
why Beethoven is obviously

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.760
so attracted to Haydn's music
and the kind of deliberate way

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.340
in which it just
says, you know what,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.730
your technical concerns
are of no interest to me.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.020
We will make your instrument
do what I want it to do.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.800
And you see this
in Beethoven, too.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.530
On every on instrument,
in every genre.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.810
The symphonies, if you talk
to period instrument players,

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.150
who play the symphonies
regularly on period instruments,

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.320
there is not a night
that they play a concert

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.680
of Beethoven symphonies that
goes by that they don't end

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.530
and say, it's an enormous
struggle to play this music.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.830
[Inaudible response] Yes.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.130
It's not just that
it's physically tiring.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.060
There's this sense that
Beethoven asks you to do things

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.870
that require kind of
super human concentration

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.510
and physical coordination.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.760
And if you hit, you hit
right out of the park.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.960
But if you don't, it can
end in tragedy and disaster.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.750
[Laughter] And Mozart
never, ever does that.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.940
I have never once played a
Mozart piano concerto or sonata,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.600
or a set of variations
where I have the feeling

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.170
that he's kind of taunting you.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.120
And both Hayden and
Beethoven do that.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.370
A lot. Possibly not deliberately

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.240
at the same time
but they both do it.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Can I
come back to something

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.920
that you were saying just a
little bit earlier, about --

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.920
you didn't say exactly this
but, basically, motivic parsing

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.150
versus say, spun melodies?

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.120
The pieces that we have
tonight, there's --

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.060
we have a lot of rondeaus
and literally rondeaus.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.060
But also, different
types of development,

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.130
that I think are interesting.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.940
And what I think -- I don't
know that this is worth talking

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.610
about differences or if
this is even important,

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.100
the notion of ornamentation
as a form of variation

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.330
versus other types of
developmental variation

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.750
that you might see in a sonata.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.280
And of course, we
do have two sonatas

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.830
that we'll be --
well, three, I guess.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.510
Haydn also called his a sonata.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.790
[ Inaudible response ]

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.510
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Just
in general or should we just .

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.270
. . Is that better?

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.570
&gt;&gt; Much.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.870
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Okay.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.170
So, we just need to
talk more into them.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.470
Is that right?

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.940
This speaks -- it's a very
deep and serious question.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.540
This speaks to a little bit
to what I was saying earlier.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.470
This idea of trying to reframe

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.950
in one's mind what
people are doing

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.360
when they're playing publicly
in the late 18th century.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.620
For the reason that we
know that there are tons

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.100
of really gifted professional
pianists at this time.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.980
I mean, Mozart has
lots of students,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.420
like Barbara Ployer,
for example.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.940
These are very good players.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.340
They can play anything
perfectly.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.500
What sets them apart from
people like Mozart, particularly

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.410
and Beethoven 10 years later,
is that Mozart and Beethoven

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.290
and famous because they
are gifted improvisors.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.610
So, they grew up with
contrapuntal training.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.910
They can write fugues.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.210
They can play continually.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.070
They can improvise
fantasy, variation sets.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.550
And that's what they're
being tested

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.240
on when they play in public.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.140
Not if they can play perfectly.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.030
And I think that's the first
thing, you have to understand

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.720
that that is the only reason --

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.470
the reason that Beethoven
becomes the celebrity pianist

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.990
of his generation.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.800
And the reason that Mozart
becomes the celebrity pianist

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.210
of his generation.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.510
There are others, of course.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.810
There are people like Clementi,

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.490
who is also a similarly gifted
improvisor but when it comes

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.560
down to it those names really
emerge for very strong reasons.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.560
So, you have to understand
that when Beethoven --

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.350
let's say that when Beethoven
is playing a piano concerto

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.610
in public, this is the first
time the Viennese public has

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.010
heard this piece.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.570
And we also know that
what he's playing from,

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.160
the physical product in
front of him is a kind

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.710
of chicken scratch thing.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.350
It's a few pages with very,

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.280
very rudimentary sketches
of what's going on.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.220
And crucially, we know

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.720
that basically his brain knows
what's going on thematically,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.780
clearly but the actual details
of the figuration in the moment

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.650
of performance are
left to that moment.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.550
If you look at a piece,
like the 3rd piano concerto,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.290
the way the piece has come down
to us in the source material,

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.970
it's complete and utter mess.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.600
The same thing with
the B flat concerto.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.010
There were wrong notes.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.960
The passage work veers off
into strange directions

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.350
that haven't been corrected.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.980
And I think the trouble is
we're hamstrung now by tradition

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.970
of word text perfection of
trying to get the source

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.670
in the best possible
state possible.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.310
And I think in certain
repertoires that's kind

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.610
of impossible.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.910
One of them being
a piano concerto.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.160
It's very clear, if you look
at Mozart piano concertos

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.480
that the level of specificity
that he uses in writing a piece

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.750
that he prepares for
publication versus one

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.350
that doesn't get published, is
a difference of maybe 30 to 40%.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.310
And it's my contention that
when you look at a piece,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.150
a late piano concerto of
Mozart that he doesn't publish,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.110
the level of information that
he can raise in the notation is

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.900
by its nature almost
half as detailed

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.120
as anything I think was going
on in one of those concerts.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.630
It doesn't just mean that
he's improvising the cadenza

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.570
but the level to which he's
improvising ornamentation

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.440
on the spot, the level to
which he's changing figuration

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.100
from night to night, I think,
was a great, great deal greater

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.400
that what we're used to.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.760
Even by period instrument
performers

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.540
who are really well
versed in the style.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.290
So, the thing is you have
three things happening.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.230
You have this piece of
paper in front of you,

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.010
which they're literally
playing from.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.920
Mozart and Beethoven are
not playing piano concertos

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.220
by memory.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.380
I think, they have some kind of
text that they're looking at,

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.220
interpreting, and
reading in a sense.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.520
It's not a very detailed text

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.960
but it's providing
them information.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.950
They have the text, you
have a composer reading

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.370
and playing the text,
and then you have the act

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.770
of actually bringing that
over to the audience.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.860
And I think what David is
saying, which is fantastic,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.470
is that ornamentation
is not seen

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.610
as a kind of optional extra.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:42.050
It's a sort of emotional element
in the rhetoric of performing.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.440
In the sense that
when the emotion

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.900
of the music becomes too
strong, you are forced

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.430
to ornament and decorate.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.660
And that's why you see
in a Mozart piano sonata

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.730
when he prepares it for
publication, and he's got lots

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.350
of time on his hands, he'll
write out the ornaments

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.180
because he cares so
much about the quality

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.430
of that ornamentation being
conveyed to the amateur

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.560
out there who doesn't
know how to do it.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.920
So, ornamentation becomes a
kind of structural element

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.200
in the actual emotional
content of the music.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.420
And not a kind of, like glitter,
that you throw on one's stuff

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.630
to make it more beautiful.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.970
So, as a result,
it really speaks

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.550
to how different these
guys are in their thinking.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.540
I mean, I think I think Mozart
to his dying day, a melodious.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.640
In the sense that he's thinking
of melodies as being presented.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.440
And then altering those themes
or presenting other themes,

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.590
or making themes go
in curious directions.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:51.480
Whereas Beethoven and Haydn
really are masters at this idea

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.620
of just taking the tiniest
building block, sometimes,

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.530
as I said earlier, when
it's presented to you kind

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.650
of grotesquely simple.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:05.210
But what becomes so
fascinating is how,

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.420
especially you see
this in Mozart a lot.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.480
You'll have these incredibly
tiny development sections

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.800
and then in Haydn and Beethoven
the development becomes this

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.110
place where they can really
show their genius in a sense.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.080
Mozart sometimes suffers from
this problem where he says

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.110
to himself, well, my
themes are so fabulous,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.780
what should I do here
in the development?

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.480
Okay, I'll just put three lines,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.110
got through various
cord progressions.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.260
I'll just take -- curiously
what Mozart does sometimes,

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.610
which is very strange,
he'll just take one kind

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:37.080
of virtuoso figure that he's
presented in the exposition

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.890
and he'll just circle it
through the circle of 5ths

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.720
or through some other kind of
interesting harmonics sequence

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.160
that he finds fascinating.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.680
And it'll be very quick.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.660
But then you see,
with Beethoven,

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.780
that he'll take this
very banal theme

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.410
and spend a long
time subjecting it

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.910
to a very intense development.

00:34:55.910 --> 00:35:03.640
And I don't know to what
extent that was present

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.940
in the improvisations.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.950
Because you see that
when Beethoven is writing

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.580
out improvised music, like
his cadenzas, they're sort

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.750
of kind of, 5-minute fantasies.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:21.980
They're not that kind of
incredibly detailed motivic,

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.670
departures or explorations.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.200
They're kind of free wheeling
virtuoso style fantasies

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.990
that present different sections,

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.610
much like a Mozart fantasy
or CPE Bach fantasy.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.210
But I'm not getting
around to the question.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.190
What was it, David?

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.390
[Laughter]

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.690
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No, no.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:41.990
This is more -- honestly,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.260
you are hitting at
it from all sides.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:51.140
Which is ornamentation as
a form of -- I don't know.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.240
Maybe it's the intersection
between ornamentation

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.770
and recognition that a
rondeau has a built in,

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.600
kind of formal grounding point.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.560
Yet, there's ways in
which it's buried often

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.410
with each occurrence and
then there's other ways

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.710
in which it's developed.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.290
And what a sonata, look
at it as a development

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.700
but also there's this
developmental process that seems

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.450
to be going on each
of these works.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.980
And it seemed like ornamentation
is also built into it.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.240
And of course, it's built into
it even more carefully in the --

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.590
like in the pathetique.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.170
You know.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.470
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout: Yes.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:37.400
It's -- they do -- everything
happens sort of at the same time

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.700
but sort of differently.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.950
You see that for Beethoven
-- look, put it this way.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.400
For example, the
Beethoven rondeaus

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.830
that begin this program,
possibly the most perfect themes

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.780
that he writes in the
span of his career.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.660
You see this very curiously when
Beethoven is writing rondeaus.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.210
It's the same thing
with the two romances

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.050
for violin and orchestra.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:01.050
They are possibly the most
exquisite melodies of their kind

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.440
from Beethoven's career.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.360
And I think it's very true that
he's trying to replicate a sort

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.050
of apollonian Mozartian
melody style in those pieces.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.990
And I'm sure, that if you really
sat down with blindfold and put

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:20.080
on something like the F major
violin romance, you would not be

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.190
at fault if you said, gosh,
that sounds like a theme

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.490
that Mozart would write.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.090
And it's true of both of
these rondeaus as well.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:29.240
There have been unbelievably
refined late 18th century grace

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.540
to them.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.960
So, then you see that
Beethoven is at great pains

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.830
to write ornaments that are
incredibly sophisticated.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:41.040
And I think, Mozartian in their
level of melodic, kind of,

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.020
horizontal beauty in a sense.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.380
Some are like Haydn,
is interesting,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.860
because the ornaments tend
to be very like kabuki-esque

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.160
if I could put it like that.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.870
They have tiny, tiny imports.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:59.170
They are trills, and then kind
of very tiny triplet materials,

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:05.080
hand crossing with sort
of little mini trills,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.190
[foreign language] of five
notes in the right hand.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.880
They're not very
melodic in a sense.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.540
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And that
get's reinterpreted so that,

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.060
say those groups of four
or five notes, are then --

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.020
instead of being part of a
turn or something like that,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.320
they become part of the run.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.620
And so they have a certain
resonance that goes beyond.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.530
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
That's true.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:29.060
They become kind of
structural harbingers

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.650
of some kind of thing.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.670
And then that's why, I
think, Haydn says, well,

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.520
I've been going through
this variation structure,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.190
and I've been introducing
these discreet,

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.820
quite polite ornaments.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.480
I mean, every variation set
in the 18th century goes

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.690
on the basic premise that
you present a variation

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.080
and you sort of exploit
one thing.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.040
It's like, okay, here's
the trill variation.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.090
Now here's the variation
with syncopations.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.530
Now here's the variation
with hand crossing.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.880
Now here's the variation
with whatever.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.680
And then Haydn says,
okay, I've presented all

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.550
of these ideas discreetly.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.000
And now I'm going to merge or
take myself into this world

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.150
of fantasy where all of
this stuff is presented

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.670
and then taken one stop further.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.080
And he then introduces
new textures

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.610
that you simply haven't
seen anywhere in the work.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.500
Mozart doesn't really do --
that's actually not true.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.800
Mozart does two things.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.360
He'll do variation
sets where he does

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.660
like correct, correct, correct.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.040
Variation after variation.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.840
And then you just get
the theme at the end.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.500
And then sometimes he'll do --
now that I'm thinking of it.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.540
He does this thing where he has
this sort of chord variation.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.220
Which is much longer
and very virtuosic.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.270
And often a capitula
[assumed spelling] as well,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.770
where he'll stop
writing in bylines

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.360
and it'll become a
written out fantasy.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.030
Probably that was -- who knows.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.140
Haydn was an enormous
fan of Mozart.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.440
This is very clear.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.970
I mean, the respect between
these guys is something that --

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.970
between two people is
really deeply touching.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:06.420
So, Haydn was probably at some
of these concerts in Vienna

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.820
and could have heard Mozart's
improvisatory abilities.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.030
And was, obviously,
deeply impressed by that.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:16.660
But it's true ornamentation
has this extra role,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.400
added significance at this time.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.520
It's not just something that you
read about in the [inaudible]

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.010
as a sort of optional extra.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.500
It's something that the great
masters had to really do

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.220
in order to show their
incredible understanding

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.750
of the structure as well.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.050
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: This
is fascinating.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.410
You know, it's at a level that
you don't usually get into,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.710
these kinds of comments.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.450
And it relates to this
rhetorical fantasy finale,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.490
that's what David described
it as, in the Haydn piece.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.790
[Inaudible comment] Sorry.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.850
To leave that for moment but
to talk about the instrument.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.540
Maybe it's a good time to
spend a little time talking

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.420
about how an instrument,
like we'll hear tonight,

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.740
allows you to bring
these to life

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.190
in your own way as a virtuoso.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.070
But, you know, specifically
this piano is a copy

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:05.010
of a Shantz piano
from around 1800.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.370
And it very much is
appropriate for this repertoire.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.040
And If you could talk a
little bit about this one.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.690
And also, a comment I read,
that you said, you're able --

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:20.380
if one is relaxed, one
can manage to bring

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.860
out an extraordinary degree
of lyricism in the fortepiano.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.000
Which that's fascinated me.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.810
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
These pianos, yes, look --

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.750
these pianos live or die on
the tiniest, tiniest control

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.180
of what's going on at the key.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.200
Let me just explain that.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.740
because the fact is that all of
these Viennese style instruments

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.490
at this time, have a hammer

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:46.470
that is literally
attached to the key.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.880
And so the activity of
the hammer is always,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.970
always being controlled by
exactly what's happening

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.870
at the base of the key.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.120
Now that's very, very different
from the leverage system

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.360
that was adopted in English and
French pianos at the beginning

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.430
of the 19th century, where the
increased weight and tension

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.110
of the instrument
meant that they needed

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.990
to find a leverage system
in order to cope with that.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:09.640
So, the hammer is operated
then by an intermediary system

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.020
between what's going
on at the key

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.650
and what's directly being
transferred to the hammer.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.180
And Viennese piano at this
time or a Shantz or anything,

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.260
you can take the
hammer out and the --

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.150
the key out and the
hammer is on it.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:24.420
And everything that you do
at the key is transferred

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:29.210
without any delay or any lack of
focus or clarity to the hammer.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.250
And I think that's why these
people, like Haydn and Mozart,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.430
and also Beethoven, were so
obsessed with the immediacy

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.730
of Viennese instruments.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.910
Is that there is no middle man.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.630
Everything that you do is clear.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.810
But it means, you've also got a
key that is remarkably shallow,

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.150
more than the modern piano.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.730
And it takes much less physical
pressure to lower these keys.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.920
But if you play with the
sound at the bottom of the key

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.880
with richness and
focus, not like banging,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:01.180
but just very intense and
focus, like boney finger,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:06.240
it can produce a very warm
and rich and focused sound.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.960
But it's a little bit like
playing Schroeder's piano

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.430
from Peanuts at first.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.720
It feels like you're
playing a computer keyboard.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.550
It's a little bit
like the harpsicord

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.850
as well, when you're nervous.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.440
It just feels very
surfacy and skatey.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.040
But when you can relax,
you find that the sound,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.720
that you can draw the sound
out from the instrument.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.840
Rather than imposing
you're shoulder or kind

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.130
of late 19th century
physique on the instrument

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.740
to sort of make the sound.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:43.630
The other thing is, there's a
kind of built in transparency

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.730
to this sound where there is
a marked decay that's present

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.030
in each note.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.470
Which produces this sense
of space around the sound,

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.380
which allows you to
play faster tempos.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.870
But not just that, it
makes the whole palette

00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:03.310
of articulation much more dental
and speech like and rhetorical

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:10.430
and incised in a way, versus
this very cantabile idea

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.300
that we've become used to
with projection and density

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.750
of the modern piano sound.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.080
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You
said something about you

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.830
like the ways these pianos
speak rather than sing.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.130
I love that phrase.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.430
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:
Thank you.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:22.730
Well, they do.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:28.580
It's a highly -- you know, it's
really no accident that people

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.910
like Mozart, especially,
are obsessed

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.630
with small scale
articulation in this period.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:37.370
You see Mozart fussing endlessly
about how long slurs are,

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.250
where dots go, wedges
and all this stuff.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.660
Haydn to a lesser extent.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.260
Not because he's
not interested in it

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.630
but I think he's a bit
lazier about writing it down.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.290
Beethoven is similarly
obsessed but you start to see

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:54.550
that the length of slurs
becomes ever longer.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:45:00.090
But these guys have a set of
equipment that lets them do,

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.130
really, small scale
articulations really well.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.770
So, their articulation
style, the house style is

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.710
by its nature, therefore very
short slurs, groups of two

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.520
to three, four, five notes.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.140
None of the kind of
phrasing slurs that you see

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.150
in Schumann or Chopin later.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.950
And these pianos do that
really well I think.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.760
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well, maybe
one question or comment

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.900
about the pathetique
chords and then I know

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.310
that you need a break
to get ready.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:30.390
This piano seems ideally suited
in a way to those opening chords

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.690
of the adagio movement.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.200
Can you perhaps say a little
bit about why that might be?

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.500
&gt;&gt; Kristian Bezuidenhout:

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.950
Beethoven writes seven note
chord in the pathetique,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.250
the first chord of this piece.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.760
And it crucially, very
unusually for the period,

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.770
contains both a third and
a fifth in the left hand,

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.140
in addition to the octave.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.740
So, you've got a full note
chord played forte in the base.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.310
Now anyone who's played a
piano of any kind realizes

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:58.720
that you do not write chords
of four notes with a third

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.880
and fifth in that part
of the instrument.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.440
It sounds like murky,
swamp water, basically.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.350
So, you see people
writing fifths,

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.920
sometimes isolated
thirds like that.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.380
Normally, just octaves.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.870
Mozart very, very rarely
writes chords like that.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.880
and if he does, he normally
puts a line through them

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.370
or notates them in
his weird way,

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.860
that shows that he wants them
to be played arpeggiated.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.510
Now it could be that's also
what Beethoven had in mind

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.970
with a chord like this.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.050
We know that Beethoven is very
lazy about something like that.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.020
And from his student
journey it's clear

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:38.020
that he expected certain chords
always to be arpeggiated.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.520
And it's becoming clearer
that one of the cases

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.660
in which that's always
true is chords

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.330
like with thirds and fifths.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:51.080
And that it becomes a kind
of emblem of the fantasy.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.790
But on this piano, unlike
the Steinway, where I have

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.860
to be really careful
about voicing a chord

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.760
like that, not too loud.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.290
Otherwise, it sounds
like amateur pianism.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.590
Here I can just literally wallop
that chord with all the force

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.360
that I want and wait
for it to decay

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.620
because there's a strong
decay in the sound.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.920
And then you can move on.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.540
And I think that's part of the
characteristic of this piece.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:17.410
It's just trying to up end what
happens in a keyboard sonata.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.800
You're starting this
C minor sonata

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.770
with a French inspired overture,
kind of tragic and depressing,

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:28.500
in C minor with this hideously
inappropriately chord.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.750
This is Beethoven, the kind
of grotesque, defiant one.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:37.820
And I think it's a gesture
of disorder, and delight

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.540
and disorder, and descent,
and revolutionary quality.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.020
And on this piano it
really sounds like,

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.440
this piano is about to break.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.300
It can't take the import and
the intensity of what I'm

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.600
about to write for it.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.650
And that sense of these
instruments being required

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:57.940
to life or death like, live
or die, on what they're asked

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.740
to do is such an important
aspect of this style.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.590
And something that gets a
little ironed out, I think,

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.970
in the kind of utopian perfect,
everything uniform ideal

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.870
of the Steinway that we've
become used to in this music.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.220
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's something
to look forward to for tonight.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.540
The extraordinary
sound that we'll hear.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.580
And I think we have
to stop here.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.170
But thank you so much, Kristian.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:21.970
And we appreciate it.
