00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.673
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We've done a lot so far. We know how to graph lines using tables, and using

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:07.493
slope intercept form. Let's look at one last method. We're going to use x and

00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:11.143
y-intercepts to make our graph. And you might be wondering, why all these

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:15.071
different methods? Well, some ways are easier than others, and you might find

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:19.154
that graphing using the intercepts will be more quick than solving for y. This

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:24.227
is one of those cases. So for this equation, what's the x-intercept, and what's

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.077
the y-intercept? Put the coordinates here.
