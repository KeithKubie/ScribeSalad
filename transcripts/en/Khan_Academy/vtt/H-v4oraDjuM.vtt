00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.280
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.250
is get some practice taking
derivatives with the power rule.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.565
So let's say we take the derivative

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:10.660
with respect to x of one over x.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.410
What is that going to be equal to?

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.563
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.347
So at first, you might say,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:18.520
"How does the power rule apply here?"

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.730
The power rule, just to remind ourselves,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.950
it tells us that if we're taking

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.780
the derivative of x to
the n with respect to x,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.150
so if we're taking the derivative of that,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.500
that that's going to be equal to,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200
we take the exponent, bring it out front,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.540
and we've proven it in other videos,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.460
but this is gonna be n times x to the,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.120
and then we decrement the exponent.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.700
So, n minus one.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.760
But this does not look like that,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.390
and the key is to
appreciate that one over x

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.000
is the same thing as
x to the negative one.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.380
So, this is going to be the derivative

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.890
with respect to x of
x to the negative one.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.540
And now, this looks a lot more

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.150
like what you might be used to,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.960
where this is going to be equal to,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.370
you take our exponent, bring it out front,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.840
so it's negative one,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.690
times x to the negative one minus one,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.230
negative one minus one.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.610
And so, this is going to be equal

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.870
to negative x to the negative two,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.020
and we're done.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.330
Let's do another example.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.720
Let's say that we're told that f of x

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.750
is equal to the cube root of x

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.890
and we wanna figure out what
f prime of x is equal to.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170
Pause the video and see if
you can figure it out again.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.357
Well, once again, you might say,

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:33.427
"Hey, how do I take the
derivative of something like this,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.067
"especially if my goal or
if I'm thinking that maybe

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.430
"the power rule might be useful?"

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.820
And the idea is to rewrite
this as an exponent,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.820
if you can rewrite the cube
root as x to the 1/3 power.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.780
And so, the derivative, you take the 1/3,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080
bring it out front, so it's 1/3

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.840
x to the 1/3 minus one power.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.950
And so, this is going to be 1/3

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.340
times x to the 1/3 minus one

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.500
is negative 2/3,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.140
negative 2/3 power, and we are done.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.140
And hopefully through these examples,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.700
you're seeing that the power
rule is incredibly powerful.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.560
You can tackle a far
broader range of derivatives

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470
than you might have initially thought.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.500
Let's do another example,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.060
and I'll make this one
really nice and hairy.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.210
Let's say we wanna
figure out the derivative

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.176
with respect to x of the cube root

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:33.040
of x squared.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.550
What is this going to be?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.383
And actually,

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:36.800
let's just not figure out
what the derivative is,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.480
let's figure out the
derivative at x equals eight.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.010
Pause this video again and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.930
Well, what we're gonna do

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810
is first just figure out what this is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.530
and then we're going evaluate
it at x equals eight.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.010
And the key thing to appreciate
is this is the same thing,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.730
and we're just gonna
do what we did up here

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.350
as the derivative with respect to x.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.140
Instead of saying the
cube root of x squared,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.810
we can say this is x
squared to the 1/3 power,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.830
which is the same thing as the derivative

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.610
with respect to x of,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.758
well, x squared, if I raise
something to an exponent

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.480
and then raise that to an exponent,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.560
I can just take the
product of the exponents.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.120
And so, this is gonna be x
to the two times 1/3 power

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.150
or to the 2/3 power.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.750
And now, this is just
going to be equal to,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.930
I'll do it right over here,
bring the 2/3 out front,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.560
2/3 times x to the, what's 2/3 minus one?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.590
Well, that's 2/3 minus 3/3

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.443
or it would be negative 1/3 power.

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:39.210
Now, we wanna know what
happens at x equals eight,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.810
so let's just evaluate that.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.650
That's going to be 2/3
times x is equal to eight

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.660
to the negative 1/3 power.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.690
Well, what's eight to the 1/3 power?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.580
Eight to the 1/3 power is
going to be equal to two,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.830
and so, eight to the
negative 1/3 power is 1/2.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.630
Actually, let me just
do that step-by-step.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.330
So, this is going to
be equal to 2/3 times,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.080
we could do it this way, one
over eight to the 1/3 power.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.910
And so, this is just one over two,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.443
2/3 times 1/2,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.533
well, that's just going to be
equal to 1/3, and we're done.
