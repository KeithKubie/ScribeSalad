00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.700
[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC, WATER
BUBBLING]

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.800
[birdsong]

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.133
KENNY BROAD (VOICEOVER):
There's an alien world

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.467
right beneath our feet.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.133
[GAS HISSING, EQUIPMENT
SQUEAKING]

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.533
[water burbling]

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:28.233
As you drop into this blackness,
you have no sense that you're

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.567
still on this planet anymore.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:45.367
[breaths hissing]

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:48.834
[breaths bubbling]

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.200
It can be completely
disorienting.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.867
You're spun around,
and which way

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:01.567
is up, which way is forward,
which way is backwards?

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.734
These underwater caves are
one of the least understood

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.700
parts of our planet
because of the dangers

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.233
of going down into them.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.367
