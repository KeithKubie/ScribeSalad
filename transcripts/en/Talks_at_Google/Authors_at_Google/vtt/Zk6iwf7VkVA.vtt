[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:07.670
BARRY MICHELS: So I'm going
to start with a story.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.640
This couple walks
into my office.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.300
Marty.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.140
Susan.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.490
They seem like a nice couple.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.860
They're seeking
psychotherapy because they're

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.840
having trouble with their
teenage daughter, Ashley,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.400
who is spending too
much money on clothes.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.830
I'm thinking this is going
to be a pretty easy case.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.115
I'll just teach them
how to set some limits.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:29.240
They'll probably blow it
the first couple of times,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.489
but then they'll come back in.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.350
We'll work with them,
and we'll be done.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.010
Maybe a month.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.820
Maybe a month and a half.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.280
So Susan starts the action off.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.260
She turns to Marty
and she says, I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.820
promised Ashley I wouldn't
tell you what she did.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.190
Marty says, see, Doc.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.080
This is the problem.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.820
I want to solve the problems.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.800
She just wants to
hide the problems.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.960
Solve problems?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.040
You are the problem.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.410
Your temper is the
reason I had to promise

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.250
Ashley I wouldn't tell you
she stole money from my purse.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.590
Our daughter is
turning into a criminal

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.690
and you keep it
a secret from me?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.750
This is why a whole
house is out of control.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140
He says he doesn't
want any secrets.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.600
But every night, he goes
out to the card clubs

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.500
and gambles away
our life savings.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.530
And what are you doing at night?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.940
Dragging a tub of ice
cream out of the freezer.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.740
I only started
gambling, so I wouldn't

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.550
have to watch you
stuff your fat face.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.800
So this was going to be a
tad more difficult than I

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.260
had initially anticipated.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.850
Everybody in the family had
a problem with self-control.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.910
Marty had a temper, gambler.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.760
Susan had an eating problem,
couldn't stop herself

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.950
from confiding in her daughter.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.570
And their daughter,
Ashley, was really

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.140
falling through the cracks.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.960
I mean, she was
spending too much money.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.270
She was also lying and stealing.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.340
So things were
beginning to fall apart.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.780
So why am I telling you all
of this besides the fact

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.690
that I need practice
on my accents?

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm telling you this
because everybody

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
in this room, everybody
in the entire world,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
has a problem
experiencing impulses

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.700
that they can't control.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.730
Yours might be updating
your Facebook page,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.645
or mine is checking political
news every five minutes.

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.870
It might be buying stuff
that you don't need.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170
Or your impulses might come
in the form of reactivity,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.210
like flipping people
off in traffic

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.810
or overreacting when
somebody disses you.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.850
Now, what I'm going to
do today is teach you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.570
a tool that will
enable you to restrain,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.755
to control your impulses,
whenever they come up.

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:44.260
An in order to learn the
tool what I want you to do

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.590
is pick an impulse
that you generally

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.580
have a hard time with.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.280
So just close your
eyes for a moment

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.060
and pick an impulse that
you typically give in to.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.920
It's hard for you to resist.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.420
It might be eating sweets,
texting while you're driving,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.160
calling an ex-lover
when you're lonely.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.060
Whatever it is, just
pick one for right now.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.000
And recreate the
impulse right now as

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.620
if it's happening in real time.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.610
And feel the impelling
quality of it.

00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:32.560
And you can open your
eyes when you're ready.

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:36.500
So I'd just like you
to share with me,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.588
what impulse did you choose?

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:41.830
Yeah.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.170
AUDIENCE: When I come home into
the garage, my son's there.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.204
And there's this ash
tray full of cigarettes.

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:50.620
And he's telling
me about his day,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.880
how great he's doing in school.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.830
And instead of acknowledging
it, the first thing

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.760
I can think of that ash
tray is driving me crazy.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.790
Can he just throw that away?

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.480
And then I realize, I should
have listened to him more,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.525
acknowledge what he
has to say to me.

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:10.785
And this [INAUDIBLE] minor
thing, smoking cigarettes.

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:12.160
BARRY MICHELS:
And how about you?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.650
Is there an impulse
that you actually

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.019
experience where you have a
hard time controlling yourself?

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.149
AUDIENCE: That was it.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.180
BARRY MICHELS: Oh, these
were your cigarettes?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.780
AUDIENCE: No, his cigarettes.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.810
And that I'm reacting
to him impulsively.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.560
BARRY MICHELS: Oh.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.110
It's really hard for you
to restrain your reaction?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.680
Got it.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.540
OK, thank you for clarifying.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.990
And what is the price
that you pay when

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.700
you give in to that impulse?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.492
Does it create an
argument between the two?

00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:40.116
AUDIENCE: No, never
create an argument.

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:41.340
It just shuts him down.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.494
Like, I want to talk to my dad
about how great school is going

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:45.910
and he's talking
about cigarettes.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.470
BARRY MICHELS: Got it.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.310
So you're kind of hitting
him with something negative

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.420
when he's trying to--

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.170
that's great.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.072
That's a great example.

00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:53.530
And it's also a
really good example

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.857
of how despite the price--

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:57.940
and you kind of know because
it's happened before,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.520
we still give in
to these impulses.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.100
AUDIENCE: My daughter has severe
ADHD and emotional issues.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.540
So we've done lots of
training and therapy.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.790
But still, it's pretty hard
with some of her behavior,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.550
like when she starts
yelling at her brother.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.445
Or sometimes, we're
out at a restaurant

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:20.890
and she can't sit
still to the point

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.400
where drinks get spilled
and things like that.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.080
It's really hard for me not
to impulsively race my voice,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.592
or impose consequences,
or something like that

00:05:31.592 --> 00:05:32.625
as [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.000
BARRY MICHELS:
Doing the program?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Right.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.060
Should I repeat that?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.560
OK.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.460
So his daughter has ADHD.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
Sounds like it's
difficult. She's impulsive.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.920
She gives into her
impulses easily.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.770
And he has a problem
containing his own impulse

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.760
to get down on her and to punish
her or impose consequences

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.670
when he should be following
the program that the therapy is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.780
recommending.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.900
And what is the
price that you pay

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.280
for giving into that impulse?

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.696
AUDIENCE: So one
price is it's not

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.870
productive in terms
of helping her.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.860
But another is that, of
course, a little bit later I

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.094
realize that I'm doing it and
I don't feel very good about--

00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:15.260
BARRY MICHELS: You feel bad.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.900
AUDIENCE: --my parenting.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.650
BARRY MICHELS: Right.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.150
OK.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.520
So the price is he's
not getting the results

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.090
that he wants because it's
not effective with an ADHD kid

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.280
to come down on them that hard.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.650
And then, he also
feels bad about himself

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.050
for giving in to the impulse.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.640
Those are great examples.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.220
And most of us all
are aware of the price

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.360
that we pay for impulses.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.740
If you overeat, you
endanger your health.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.420
If you party too much, you
wake up exhausted the next day

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.160
and you can't get much done.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.410
And almost all impulses
carry with them

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.300
the price that you
pointed out, which

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.450
is when we give in
to them, very soon

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.930
afterwards we feel
terrible about ourselves.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.460
Because it's kind of like, why?

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.210
Why couldn't I control myself?

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.090
I know that's the
wrong thing to do.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.650
I don't know if any
of you have ever

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.540
had the experience of
getting drunk at night,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.430
and then the next
morning it's like, oh,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.770
I hate myself kind of thing.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.540
It's very classic.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.330
So what I want to point
out is that there's

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.270
also a more subtle price that we
pay for giving in to impulses.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.730
See?

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.730
In the case of a donut,
or a cookie, or whatever,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.760
we typically think,
what's the harm?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.790
I mean, one extra slice of
cake isn't going to kill me.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.260
And there's truth to that.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.860
Obviously, one extra slice of
cake is not going to kill you.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.800
However, the pattern of
giving into one harmless

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.990
urge after another has a
serious effect on your life.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.460
What it really does is it
diminishes your future.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.360
Now, that might seem
like an exaggeration,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.620
but think about it.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.530
Everybody in this
room has things

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.440
that they want to
accomplish in the future.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.110
They have dreams
and aspirations.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.230
Anything that you want to
accomplish in the future

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.130
requires you to delay
gratification in the present.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.634
So I treat a lot of
Hollywood screenwriters.

00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:25.050
If you want to
write a screenplay,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.330
you have to not switch
over to the internet

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.400
and look at cute cat videos.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.980
If you want an
intimate relationship,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.070
and build a relationship
that's really honest and open,

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.669
you have to not secretly
whack off to pornography.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.770
If you are in a race
to create a startup

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.270
and you're getting
drunk every night

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.730
and the other guy isn't,
he's going to win the race.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.060
All right.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.000
So to put the whole
thing another way,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.720
the pattern of
giving in to impulses

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.860
is dangerous because no
one impulse looks like it's

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.800
going to destroy your future.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.210
But what you're really
doing is making your life

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:09.450
about self-gratification rather
than about self-actualization.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.114
Actually bringing your
ambitions to fruition.

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:13.530
If you want to say
it another way,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:19.170
self-indulgence is kind of an
invisible acid that eats away

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.280
against your aspirations.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.800
So given the price that
we pay, why do we give in?

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.220
And this is a question
that's always interested me.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.200
I'm a smart person.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.230
I know that sugar cookies
are not good for me.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.310
They don't do
anything good for me.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.450
And yet, when I want one, I
take one despite that knowledge.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.100
You want an even better example?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.950
Anthony Weiner, a guy with
140 or 150 IQ, who despite--

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.990
he must have known that
he was going to destroy

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.990
his political future.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.370
And yet, he gives in and
texts pictures of himself

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.760
to a young woman.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.560
It's kind of crazy that
impulses have the power

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.190
to override our rational mind.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.690
So what is it that gives
impulses so much power?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.160
Well, the answer is going
to sound a little strange,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.000
but just keep an open mind.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.129
Every human being has an
emptiness inside of them.

00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:22.920
I'm not talking about
a physical emptiness,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.160
but I'm talking about
a psychic emptiness,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.680
like a psychological emptiness.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.100
A feeling of incompleteness.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.260
Some of you may have
been aware of it,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.340
at least in adolescence or
young adulthood, where you just

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:43.050
felt like you weren't enough and
you needed validation, friends,

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.110
hits on your social media
page, money, whatever it was,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.220
to fill you up inside and
make you whole and complete.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.410
Does that make sense to you?

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.010
So either way, whether you're
aware of this inner emptiness

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.390
or not, it's this
inner emptiness that

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.280
makes us give in to impulses.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.700
What we're really trying
to do is fill ourselves up

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:19.270
in the outside world to fill up
this hole that's inside of us.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.510
If you don't-- and by
the way, think about it.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.790
If there weren't
this inner emptiness

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.810
that I'm talking about, we
wouldn't feel impelled--

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.730
note the same route as impulse.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.520
We wouldn't feel impelled
to get what we want.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.460
It would just be a choice
rather than an impulse.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.250
It would be like, I can
take it or leave it.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.580
Now, if you don't believe
me, watch a little kid

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.420
who's been told he can't
have something that he wants.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.140
Whether it's a sugary drink, or
a toy that he wants, or another

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.820
ride on your back.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.340
When a little kid gets "no"
for an answer, he falls apart.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.670
The angst, and the
grief, and the sadness,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.540
and the panic, and the anger,
and the frustration, that's

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.190
his way of saying, I
need this to fill me up.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.720
I must have it.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.120
I'm not going to
live without it.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.190
Now obviously and
fortunately, adults

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.970
have learned to
repress that reaction.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.080
It would be unfortunate
if we didn't.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.040
But it's still down there.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.080
And if you don't believe me,
try some time to stop yourself

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.290
from getting something
you really want

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.210
and not letting
yourself have it.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.530
And just use it as a
self-exploration exercise.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.960
You'll see those
little kid feelings

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.360
of frustration come up.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.630
And that's evidence of
that inner emptiness.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.210
So the takeaway
from all of this is

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:53.360
we are impelled to get or to
do things in the outside world.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.300
Again, impelled to do
them, because we're trying

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.110
to fill something up inside.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.570
And by the way, with all due
respect for Nancy Reagan, who

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.600
I'm sure was a
really nice person,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.120
that's why just saying no is the
stupidest public public policy

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.440
prescription I ever heard of.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.740
Just say no?

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.810
Are you kidding?

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.080
If just say no were
enough, we wouldn't

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.280
have a weight loss industry
that's worth over $175 billion.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.700
We'd all just start saying
no and put it out of business

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.560
right away.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.470
Impulses have a
tremendous power that

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.950
completely overrides
that rational "just

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.650
say no" attitude.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.760
OK.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.330
Any questions so
far, by the way?

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.076
Please feel free
to interrupt me.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.008
Yeah.

00:13:48.008 --> 00:13:49.406
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.356
Also, this idea of
living in the moment,

00:13:56.356 --> 00:14:03.244
of adding up those moments of
pleasure to have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:07.456
If you always have
a long-term goal

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.400
to which you're
delaying gratification,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.834
do you ever live in the moment?

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:13.250
BARRY MICHELS: My
answer to that--

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.280
and I'm going to get into this
much more deeply later on.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.800
There is living in the present
and living in the present.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.920
In other words,
living in the present

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.850
doesn't have to mean that
you give in to every impulse

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.280
you get in the present.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.790
Part of your responsibility,
living in the present,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.050
is choosing which impulse
or instinct you're

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.740
going to follow in the present.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.610
Some of those impulses you just
know are really bad for you.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.940
Others may be creative
ideas or instincts that

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.950
will create something
in the future,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.030
but that give you pleasure
doing it in the present.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.400
I mean, I love public speaking.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.510
I would never indulge
my impulses right now,

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.390
but I love what I'm doing
because I'm sort of fulfilling

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.380
my life's purpose.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.210
And I'm totally in the present.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.690
I'm not even thinking about the
future, even though doing this

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.710
may build my prospects in
the future in some way.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.590
Does that make sense to you?

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.660
You can live in the
present without giving

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.280
in to your impulses
in the present.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.750
If you want to put
it another way,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.480
part of your responsibility
living in the present

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.910
is to work on yourself and to
be aware of what you're doing

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.650
and whether it works
in your interests

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.790
or not in your interests.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.090
Any other questions?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.740
Yeah.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.810
AUDIENCE: The emptiness
that you're referring to,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.407
is it correlate with the
person's frequency of engaging

00:15:38.407 --> 00:15:40.920
in whatever impulse is?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.630
BARRY MICHELS:
Everyone has some sort

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.190
of emptiness inside of them.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.520
I've never met anyone who
doesn't in some sense.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.430
Obviously, we do a really
good job of covering it over,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.450
all of us.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.250
Even from ourselves.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.570
But I do believe--

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.290
because I have treated
hard hardcore addicts who

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.970
have spent their entire
lives filling that emptiness,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.360
that they have a bigger hole
because they've been trying

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.750
to fill it in the wrong place.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.930
The more you try to fill
it in the outside world,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.900
the deeper and the more
empty you feel inside.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.440
And if you've ever met a
really hardcore addict,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.249
it's so sad because what
initially they thought was

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:19.790
going to give them
so much pleasure--

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.250
and did for maybe the first
time or the first five times,

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.080
or whatever-- has
now just become--

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.790
it's just enslaved them.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.210
They have nothing inside.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.170
Given that impulses are
fueled by this compulsion

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.670
to fill ourselves up inside,
how the hell do we control them?

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.900
I mean, they have this
tremendous power behind them.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.660
Well, let's just talk
about what doesn't work,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.370
which is the way we normally
try to control our impulses.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.630
We get into a power struggle,
essentially with ourselves.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.410
I want it.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.230
I can't have it.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.730
I want it.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.650
I can't have it.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.150
I want it.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.850
I'm not going to
let myself have it.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.170
OK.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.790
Notice that that approach
keeps us focused on the thing

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.480
that I want.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.180
Let's say a sugar cookie.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.230
And I either succeed in
controlling myself or I fail.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.790
But even if I succeed and I
don't have the sugar cookie,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.040
I haven't dealt with
the hole inside of me.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.900
So very likely, if
you're me, the fact

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.660
that I've succeeded this time
means the next sugar cookie

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.060
I'm going to say,
now I get a reward

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.820
because I was so good last time.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.630
OK.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.750
So long term, this
does not work as a way

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.980
of controlling yourself.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.640
Sheer willpower-- I have
nothing against willpower,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.177
but it doesn't work
as a program for truly

00:17:43.177 --> 00:17:44.260
controlling your impulses.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:52.440
So what would happen if instead
of struggling over the sugar

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.590
cookie, I said, I give it up?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.690
It's never going to
fill me up inside.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.850
After all, it never has.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.224
If I have one on
Tuesday, I still

00:18:01.224 --> 00:18:03.530
want one on Wednesday,
and Thursday, and Friday.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.640
So what if I just gave up on
the outside world, anything

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.130
in the outside world,
ever filling me up inside?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:15.220
And instead, what if I shifted
my focus inside and just

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.800
stared into the emptiness?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.960
I know that sounds very weird.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.900
And probably, a little
scary or depressing.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.480
But that's where
the magic starts.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.490
Because it turns out, if you
stare into the inner emptiness

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.410
long enough, it's not empty.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.590
There's stuff in there.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.070
In fact, there's
so much in there

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.780
that you can start getting
filled up from the inside.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.420
Now, I know this makes no
logical sense whatsoever.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.650
So what I'd like to do
is have you actually

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.450
try to experience
it, because that's

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.510
the best way to start to
actually believe these things.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.120
So try this.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.420
Close your eyes.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.200
And just like in
the last exercise,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.890
pick an impulse that you
feel really intensely.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.770
And imagine feeling
it right now.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.030
One that's hard to resist.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.179
Again, sweets,
checking your email,

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:16.970
running a red light
when you're in a hurry.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.590
Now, imagine that you
are absolutely prohibited

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.800
from getting what you want.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.050
You just simply can't have it.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.840
And make the feelings of
deprivation as intense

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.270
as you can, just like
those little kid feelings

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.320
we talked about before.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.530
Now, let go of the
thing that you want.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.000
Forget about it completely.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.100
It's as if it does not exist.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.220
And as you do, imagine that
the entire outside world

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.060
disappears.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.160
It's never going to gratify you.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.170
And instead, shift your focus
inside and just visualize

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.500
a vast, empty space.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.462
Stay calm.

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:14.295
Remember to breathe.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:23.350
Resist the temptation to look
back into the outside world.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.186
And if anything, just be
curious about what's down there.

00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.832
And you can open your
eyes when you're ready.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.840
Most people,
interestingly enough,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.564
actually start to sense
some movement down there.

00:20:51.564 --> 00:20:53.480
Now, even if you didn't,
don't worry about it.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.790
If you do this a number
of times, you'll see.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.670
You'll actually start to
feel like, how strange?

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.260
There's something down there.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.690
Frederick Nietzsche said,
if you stare into the abyss

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.704
long enough, it will
stare back into you.

00:21:05.704 --> 00:21:07.370
It's like, there's
something down there.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.610
Which raises the question,
how can nothingness

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.880
turn into somethingness?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.434
Yes.

00:21:18.434 --> 00:21:19.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.450
BARRY MICHELS: Yes.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.970
Yeah.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.680
I mean, I didn't
get it from that,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.090
but it is consistent with
the notion that there--

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.100
let me explain it
my way, and then I

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.320
think you'll see the
connection to Buddhism, which

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.210
is-- because a more
Western way to explain

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.660
it is it's consistent with
our notion of the unconscious.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.050
Think of the unconscious as a
realm that has things in it,

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.290
but you're not aware of it.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.840
When we think of our
unconscious, we can't see it.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.100
We can't taste it, smell it.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.630
We don't know what's down there.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.580
And yet, we know
that it's down there

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.990
because when we go to sleep
at night, it produces dreams.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.947
When we're creatively
frustrated and we

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.780
try to work at something,
work at something,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.210
work at something,
suddenly something appears.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.010
It comes from the unconscious.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.810
So this idea of something
coming out of the nothingness

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.600
is completely
consistent with the idea

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.900
that there are parts of
ourselves that we don't know,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.410
but that can actually feed us
and fill us up with things.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.390
Now, that's really
important because if you

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.110
can tap into this
unconscious resource

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.970
that you have inside of
you, then you're free.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.020
Then, you don't have to just
deprive yourself of the things

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.220
that you want.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.740
You won't really
need them that much.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.200
You'll feel whole and
filled up from inside.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.700
Go ahead.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.199
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious, how good

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:49.960
is human nature in terms of
meditating into the inner self

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.936
conditionally?

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:53.790
Because certain
things, for example,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.540
like [INAUDIBLE] for a
dessert or maybe anger issues,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.400
things like that, which you
need to stop all-- meditate,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.980
like the suggestion
that you gave.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.670
And you assume that [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.460
But then, for example, a student
who is not getting good score--

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.300
BARRY MICHELS: A student?

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.966
AUDIENCE: Who is not
getting good score,

00:23:14.966 --> 00:23:18.540
or say somebody who's
not happy [INAUDIBLE],,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.505
they just pause and
say, OK, maybe I

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:23.413
don't want to constantly
think about it

00:23:23.413 --> 00:23:26.514
and just be happy in
what I do or what I have,

00:23:26.514 --> 00:23:30.670
then there is really no growth
as a person [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.690
BARRY MICHELS: Got it.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.820
Let me make sure I'm
understanding your question,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.710
because the question seems to
have to do with motivation.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:42.170
If you're always satisfied
with what you have right now,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.350
I think what you're
asking is, will that

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.130
remove my motivation
to create anything

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.890
in the future for myself, or
to fulfill any ambitions that I

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.690
have for myself?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:52.315 --> 00:23:54.482
There are certain cases
where this has to be applied

00:23:54.482 --> 00:23:56.523
and there are certain
cases where this should not

00:23:56.523 --> 00:23:57.710
be applied, right?

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.600
So I'm just curious,
in general--

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.403
BARRY MICHELS: Yes.

00:24:00.403 --> 00:24:01.944
AUDIENCE: --are
people good at really

00:24:01.944 --> 00:24:04.090
do it on a conditional
case-by-case basis?

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.210
BARRY MICHELS: In my experience,
people are not only good at it.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.070
They know it instantly.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:15.100
They know pretty much instantly
that having a donut every day

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.890
is not going to help them
fulfill their ambitions.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.460
Or smoking, or
texting constantly

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.020
when they should
be buckling down

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.250
and concentrating on something,
or distracting themselves,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.010
or overreacting to
somebody, because they're

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.770
aware that they're paying a
price for those things that

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.550
actually thwarts their
long-term ambitions.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.660
You're right that
to some degree,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.980
we use impulse power
to fuel our motivation.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.840
And I think you're
right about that.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.680
But in my experience-- and I've
been doing this for 35 years--

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.070
when I teach someone to control
their worst impulses, what

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.200
really happens is
they get in touch

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.160
with some part of themselves
that wants to achieve.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.060
It doesn't necessarily
feel compelled to achieve,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.686
but it just wants to.

00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:07.930
It wants to create
something new in the world

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.370
or fulfill itself in some way
through art, or whatever it is.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:17.520
It's not that we are devoid of
motivation without impulses.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:25.480
It's that we're devoid of that
must-have quality that really--

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.540
in a way, it kind
of defies reality.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.190
I mean, you can
say "I must have,"

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.160
but you can't always
get kind of thing.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.834
Or the getting can really
be destructive for you.

00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:37.750
Does that answer the--

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.375
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:39.940
BARRY MICHELS: OK, great.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.700
So let me say it again,
this is really important.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.840
If there's a way of converting
the emptiness into something

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.640
that can fill you up inside,
then you're really free.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.110
Again, it transforms an
impulse into a choice.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.220
It's like, I'm not
compelled to get the cookie.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.630
I can take it or leave it, which
is a much nicer way to live.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.360
All right.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.665
Did you have a question?

00:26:09.665 --> 00:26:10.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.831
I was wondering, so when you
do this exercise and everything

00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:17.750
that you want sort of disappears
and you have this emptiness,

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.188
do you encounter situations
where individuals,

00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:21.313
something negative appears?

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:24.496
It gets filled with
something negative?

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:26.120
BARRY MICHELS: That's
a great question.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.030
Does it ever happen when
you stare into the emptiness

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.810
that something negative comes up
instead of something positive?

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:38.270
Sometimes, what comes up is
just feelings of insecurity,

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.660
of incompleteness, of emptiness.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.790
What I'm going to
do is teach you

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:49.370
a tool that has a specific
procedure that essentially

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.300
negates that.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.830
It prevents that from
happening, in essence.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.080
But what you're asking
has larger connotations,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.130
which is, when you work
on curbing or controlling

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.130
your impulses, a lot
of times what comes up

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.650
are just real childlike
feelings of like,

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.040
wanting and not being able to
have things, that we haven't

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.050
really been aware of,
either because we've

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.050
given in to the impulses
or because we've

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.680
repressed those feelings.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.590
And those feelings, you
have to own those and not

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.410
act on them, essentially.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.920
Or explore them if they
have other implications

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.100
in your life.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.600
OK.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.600
Does that make sense?

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.350
OK, good.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:36.010
So in order to construct
a tool that would actually

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.040
help people control
their impulses, what

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.170
my co-author and I
had to do was come up

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.260
with a symbol for
this fullness that

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.100
comes up from the
emptiness inside of you.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.600
And the symbol that we chose
was a symbol of a black sun.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.860
It's just the sun at the moment
of a total solar eclipse, where

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.640
the moon has passed in front of
the sun, so the disk is dark,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.840
but you can see the corona.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.670
You can see the sun shining
from the corners of the disk.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.405
And I'll explain after I teach
you the tool why we chose that

00:28:11.405 --> 00:28:11.905
as a symbol.

00:28:11.905 --> 00:28:15.160
It's probably obvious, but
I'll explain that more.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.900
But just so you know, that's
what the tool is about.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.800
So close your eyes, and I will
walk you through this tool.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.630
This is a tool that you're
going to use whenever you feel

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.200
impelled to act on an urge.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:40.180
So start with the little
kid feelings of deprivation.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.040
You want something really badly
and you simply can't have it.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.230
You're going to
deprive yourself.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.300
And feel those
feelings of deprivation

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.520
as intensely as you can.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.760
Then, let go of the
thing that you want.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.670
And with it, let the entire
outside world disappear.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.070
It's just no longer
available to you as a source.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.900
And turn your attention
inside yourself.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.110
Now there's no deprivation.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.720
There's just this
inner emptiness.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.340
Just like we did
before, stay calm.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.080
And just stare into the void.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.330
Now from the deepest
part of the void,

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:43.860
imagine that a black sun begins
to ascend, expanding slowly.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.260
It begins to fill you up with
warm and limitless energy.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:30:01.470
Let it keep coming up until
you become one with it,

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.290
and then turn your attention
back to the outside world.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:10.470
And as you do, imagine that
the black sun energy overflows

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.500
and bursts out, shining
on everyone and everything

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.442
around you.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.010
Just spend a little bit
of time in this state

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.590
where the black sun energy
is coming up inside of you

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.230
and just pouring out of
you, out into the world,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.070
it's almost, in a sense,
like you have become the sun.

00:30:52.775 --> 00:30:54.650
And you can open your
eyes when you're ready.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.011
Any questions or
comments on that?

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.850
Could you feel it?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.410
Anybody skeptical?

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.321
Feel free, because
I was completely

00:31:12.321 --> 00:31:14.070
skeptical of this stuff
when I learned it,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.690
like 30, 35 years ago.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.867
I thought it was
a crock of shit.

00:31:19.867 --> 00:31:20.367
Yeah.

00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:22.658
AUDIENCE: I have a question
of how you came up with it.

00:31:22.658 --> 00:31:25.487
The story behind this imagery.

00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:26.320
BARRY MICHELS: Yeah.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.855
So let me talk about that next.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.310
Let me go through the
tool, in fact, step by step

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.949
and explain each step,
just to reinforce

00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:39.990
your understanding of it.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.365
When I get to the
black sun, I'll

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:44.170
explain why we came up with
that particular imagery.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.520
Because that's unusual.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.370
It's like, I wouldn't have
expected that if I were you.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.350
So the first step of the tool
is always to deprive yourself.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:59.320
Always to say no to the thing
that you feel impelled to get.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.420
If you're unwilling
to deprive yourself,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.890
what you're really saying
is, I can't live without it.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.560
It's the only thing that's
going to fill me up inside.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.030
If you want to say
it another way,

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.600
you're kind of
refusing to grow up.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.160
You're giving in to those little
kid feelings of deprivation.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.030
So the first step
is always to say no.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.940
The second step
is to turn inward,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.720
is essentially to give up on the
outside world ever filling you

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.410
up.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.590
And instead, have the courage
to face the emptiness that

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.730
exists in every human being.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:36.850
Now, if you're patient
and you can just

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.690
stay calm, what starts to
happen is this black sun

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.090
begins to ascend
from the depths.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.440
Now, why the sun?

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.300
And why is it black?

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.570
We chose the sun as
a symbol because it's

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:55.960
a symbol of infinite
energy, light, and life.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.410
If you were the sun, essentially
what you'd be aware of is,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.710
I'm just giving energy out and
I don't expect anything back.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.200
I'm only getting back
my own reflected light.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.220
So it has this quality
of infinite potential,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.720
infinite energy.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.200
Something that can fill
you up from the inside.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.710
We decided to make it
black to remind you

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.030
that you have essentially
eclipsed this sun for most

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.360
of your life because you've
constantly looked for what you

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.790
need from the outside world.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.100
Essentially, you've
allowed the outside world

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.130
to eclipse this sun.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.570
It's not to make
you feel guilty.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.640
It's just to remind
you, oh, yeah.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.300
This is a resource that I
constantly forget about.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.770
I've plunged it
into the darkness.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.510
And as the black sun rises,
it suffuses you with warmth.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.690
Warmth is actually a very
significant and underused

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.960
symbol in modern life.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.030
Coldness means you're alone.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.720
Alone in a completely
mechanistic universe.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.330
Warmth means there's
something inside of you

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.352
that has life in it.

00:34:05.352 --> 00:34:07.810
There's something inside of
you that can actually help you.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.949
You are not alone trying
to control your impulses.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:15.580
So the warmth just gives you
that feeling of, oh, there's

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.889
help, essentially.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:23.330
The overall arc of the tool
is very, very important.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.159
Because think about it.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.650
Think about how the tool
starts, and then how it ends.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:31.639
What it does is it reverses
the flow of your energy.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:35.360
You start the tool by
wanting to take something in.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.409
You end the tool by
putting energy out.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.239
This is really
important because it

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.310
reveals a secret of
human nature, which

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:49.980
is that the solution to our
endless quest to get more

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.360
is actually to give more.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.730
To give more of ourselves.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.530
In 12-step groups,
which are really

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.410
the most successful groups
in curbing addiction,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:03.520
they codify this principle
in the idea of service.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.340
They ask their members to
be of service to one another

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.725
and to the larger community.

00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:09.100
Because what they
have discovered

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.840
is the more I give to
others, the less I need.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.750
The more I'm filled up
from within essentially.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.810
So that's another very
important principle

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:24.310
in the tool is we're shifting
from an incorporative,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.860
materialistic mode
of I'm incomplete

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.330
and I need more,
more, more, more,

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.360
to I actually don't need more.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.299
To the extent that I
get more, it's great.

00:35:33.299 --> 00:35:34.840
I'm not going to be
unhappy about it,

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.540
but I don't need
it kind of thing.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.290
And that's the key to taking
the sting out of impulses.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.640
Now, I have a couple of tips
for just getting the most

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.470
that you can out of the tool.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.770
First, obviously, you have
to kind of memorize it

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.250
before you try to use it,
or else you'll forget.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.660
Especially in the
face of an impulse.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.210
So it doesn't take long.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.250
You can buy the
book "Coming Alive."

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:06.050
Or if you email us, we can
send you a handout to it.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.090
But it's easy to learn.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.750
You practice it a bunch of
times, and then you can use it.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.850
And you want to use
it as soon as you're

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:15.720
subject to an impulse.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.210
So I want the sugar cookie.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:21.260
I want to overreact, whatever it
is, that's when I use the tool.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.990
Now, start with
small temptations.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.200
If you're an over-eater, you
don't want to use the tool

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.660
for the first time in front
of an all-you-can-eat buffet

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.150
because you're just setting
yourself up for failure.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.680
Start with little things.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.890
I started with just
imaginary temptations.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.640
Things that I imagined I
would be subject to or would

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.730
want an hour from now,
or tomorrow, or whatever,

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.670
just to build up my
facility with the tool.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.430
Another tip.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.860
Tools don't always
work the first time.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.410
There are some
impulses that are so

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:01.060
powerful that I have to use
the tool five times in a row

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.170
to stop myself.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:03.700
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.140
That's not a failure.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.360
If you use it 10 times in
a row and stop yourself

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.080
to giving in to an
impulse, that's a victory.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.720
And finally, even
then, even if you

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.080
become an expert practitioner
of the black sun tool,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.330
it won't work 100% of the time.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:26.450
There is nothing that works
100% of the time with impulses.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.090
But if you can even
use the black sun

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.840
tool over the next month
and give in 50% less

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.970
than you do now, you'll see
huge changes in your life.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.920
And what I'd like to do
is spend the next bit

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.660
of time just talking about
the benefits of self-control.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.130
So what can you
expect to get if you

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.740
learn this level
of self-restraint

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.690
that I'm talking about?

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.600
Let's just remind ourselves
that we don't usually think

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.280
of self-control as rewarding.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.490
We think of it as
the best I can hope

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.770
for is I feel really
frustrated that I didn't get

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.630
what I wanted kind of thing.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.880
We end up feeling deprived.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.710
The black sun tool teaches
us something different.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:15.530
It's saying that there is
so much potential energy,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.460
lightness inside of us,
that we won't actually

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.630
end up feeling deprived.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.390
We'll actually end
up with benefits.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.580
We end up feeling
more fulfilled.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.160
And I want to talk about
three specific benefits.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.590
The first is a sense of freedom.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.040
The second is a
sense of confidence.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.010
And the third is
leadership, which I'm simply

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.480
going to define as the ability
to have a positive impact

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.500
on the people around you.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.400
So let's talk about
freedom first.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.870
Self-restraint sets you free.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.430
Now, I know that sounds like
a zen koan, or some neologism

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.950
from Orwell's "1984."

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.150
You know war, is peace.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.290
Ignorance is strength.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.400
But it's true.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.910
Self-restraint sets you free.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.550
Now, why does it
sound so strange?

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.590
Because we think of freedom as
we get to do whatever we want,

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.270
whenever we want to.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.340
Essentially, we think
of freedom as freedom

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.240
from outer rules
and restrictions.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.230
Anyone who's ever gone 90 miles
an hour on the way to Vegas

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.480
knows this feeling.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.990
It's I'm free.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:27.190
I mean, it's fabulous.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.090
OK.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.010
The problem is you
might get killed.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.010
You could get incarcerated.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:37.440
But even worse, next time
90 ain't going to do it.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.270
You've got to go 95.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.240
And the time after that,
you got to go to 100.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.420
This is the strange,
demonic paradox

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.370
of that type of freedom,
which is it doesn't end up

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:51.930
creating a sense of freedom.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.380
It actually ends
up enslaving you.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.490
Think of a drug addict.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.820
It starts off like, I
can do anything I want.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.350
Ends up, I just need
it every fucking day.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.730
So this is the strange paradox
of the way we think of freedom,

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.070
because we've misdefined it.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.750
Real freedom is not freedom from
outer rules and restrictions.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.150
Inner freedom is inner.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.500
It's the freedom from impulses.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.465
Think about what an impulse is.

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:28.670
It is a compelling force that
tells you you must do something

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:31.100
or must have something.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.830
Well, if you must,
then you're not free.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:39.530
So as strange as it sounds, the
more self-control you exercise,

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.582
the freer you actually feel.

00:40:42.582 --> 00:40:44.790
If any of you are interested
in philosophy like I am,

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.330
there's philosophical
precedent for this

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.390
in Frederick Nietzsche's,
the German philosophers,

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.000
concept of the ubermensch,
which was horribly

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.190
mistranslated into
the "superman"

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.010
and made for some bad
times in Nazi Germany

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.580
when it was misappropriated
and exploited terribly.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.670
But if you read Nietzsche in
the original, what he really

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.980
meant by the
ubermensch was someone

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.120
who could master the
lowest parts of himself.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.610
Someone who could overcome
the worst aspects of himself.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:20.630
And in the freedom that he
gained from his own lower

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:25.840
parts, he could become the
person he was meant to be.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.510
It was inner freedom,
inner mastery.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:34.870
Now, closely related
to the idea of freedom

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.250
is the idea of confidence.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.400
Let me demonstrate
that this way.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.060
It's almost the
first of January.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.560
January first, New Year's.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.920
We all make resolutions
on January first.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.870
Let's say my New
Year's resolution

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:54.160
is I'm really going to cut down
on sugars and carbs this year.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.659
This year, this is the year.

00:41:56.659 --> 00:41:57.700
I'm going to lose weight.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.280
I'm really going to
watch what I eat, OK?

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.710
And let's say on January
fourth, I have a donut.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.060
And on January fifth,
I have five donuts.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.150
And by January seventh, I've
forgotten the whole resolution,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.120
which is usually what happens.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.630
How confident can I be?

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.220
Think about it.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:23.230
A big part of confidence
is self-credibility.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:29.000
Do I believe the commitments
I make to myself?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.150
If the answer is yes,
if I make a commitment,

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.340
I am going to carry it through.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.530
I will be confident.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.130
But most people,
sadly can't say that.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.680
If they're honest with
themselves, they'll admit,

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.930
I make a commitment to myself.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.940
I'm good for a day,
maybe two days.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.130
By day three, I'm
already cheating.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.580
And by day five, I've forgotten
I even made the commitment.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.310
It is mathematically impossible
to have confidence in yourself

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.640
if you can't even carry
out the commitments you

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.810
make to yourself.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.510
And it's impulses that
erode your ability

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:14.820
to carry out those commitments
because they stop you.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.630
I have a couple
of quotes on this

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.370
that I think are
particularly pithy about it.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.980
Leonardo da Vinci
said, "You will never

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.080
have a greater or
lesser dominion

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.050
than that over yourself.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:34.510
The height of a person's success
is gauged by his self-mastery.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:39.580
The depth of his failure
by his self-abandonment."

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.160
So it's mastery over self,
mastery over impulses.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:49.090
Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism,
said it even more succinctly.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.270
"He who conquers
others is strong,

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:56.420
but he who conquers
himself is mighty."

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.540
That's the true strength.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.640
And finally, leadership.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.970
Again, I'm going to define
leadership as just the ability

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.850
to have a positive impact
on those around you.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:12.000
Whether it's your family, your
coworkers, or the community

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.190
at large.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.030
And I'm going to give
you a micro-example

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.230
and a macro-example.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:23.400
The micro-example brings
us back to Susan and Marty,

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.202
the crazy couple that
I introduced you to

00:44:26.202 --> 00:44:26.910
at the beginning.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:30.660
These were parents who were
trying to get their daughter

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.950
to control her
impulses when every day

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.890
she saw them giving
in to their impulses.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.100
So obviously, they could
not be good leaders.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.820
So as a therapist, I said, we're
not working on your daughter.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.730
I'm sorry, but we're
working on you.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.010
You have to use the
black sun tool, Marty,

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.750
to control your
temper and to control

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.870
your gambling You, Susan,
have to use the black sun

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:58.710
tool to control your
eating and your confiding

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:59.722
in your daughter.

00:44:59.722 --> 00:45:01.930
And fortunately, with their
daughter's life at stake,

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.710
they worked really
hard on themselves.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.720
So pretty quickly, they
actually gained some control

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.950
over themselves.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.560
That also enabled them
to talk to one another

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.210
without constantly
getting into an argument.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.820
And then, they could
agree on limits they

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.490
could set with their daughter.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.550
And their daughter could
feel that they were actually

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.680
credibly setting those
limits because they

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.520
weren't reactive or impulsive.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.590
They were simply, look.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.880
This is the rule.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.840
If you steal money, you
spend too much money,

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.300
your allowance disappears.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.400
You know, or whatever
the limits were.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.510
So they became leaders
within their family.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.310
And you don't have
to have a family

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.600
to witness this happening.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.880
I recommend that you
use the black sun

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.090
tool every single time
you have an impulse

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.880
and watch the people around
you over the next two

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.810
weeks or four weeks.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.550
You will see them paying
more respect to you.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.980
And you'll even see
them emulating you,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.650
even if they have no idea
that you're using this tool.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:02.760
They'll just get the vibe of a
person who has more authority.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.500
I've seen it over
and over again.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.770
Now, let me give
you a macro-example.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:14.680
This is an example of a
movement that because it

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:18.990
had an extraordinary
degree of self-restraint

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.100
was actually able to
have a tremendous impact

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.080
on the whole society.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.800
I'm talking about the
early civil rights

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.004
movement of the late
'50s and early '60s.

00:46:29.004 --> 00:46:30.420
I've studied this
because I've met

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.753
with one of the leaders of
that movement, Reverend James

00:46:32.753 --> 00:46:36.990
Lawson, who brought Gandhi
and nonviolent techniques

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.490
to the civil rights movement.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:39.990
He basically taught
those techniques

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.570
to Martin Luther
King and John Lewis.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.940
And what's amazing
about that movement

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.860
is that its success was because
it was incredibly disciplined.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.150
There were absolutely no
spontaneous demonstrations.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.470
Every single demonstration
was meticulously planned.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.990
Participants were vetted.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.740
And sometimes, rejected or
moved to other positions

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.060
if they couldn't
control themselves.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.060
The goals of the movement
were kept very limited.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.980
Of course, they wanted to
desegregate the entire South,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.930
the schools, the neighborhoods,
the government, everything.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.650
Instead, they picked
one lunch counter

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.580
in one department
store in one town

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.030
and decided to have
a sit-in there.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.430
And they picked the department
store based on the fact

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.835
that a lot of blacks shopped
at that department store,

00:47:34.835 --> 00:47:36.210
because they knew
they were going

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.390
to end up having to boycott
that department store.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:43.560
So very limited, targeted
goals that then they were

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.410
able to expand to other goals.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.080
And the most dramatic
example of self-restraint

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.500
was that they trained
themselves to not

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.720
respond to physical
and verbal assaults.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.320
Not only from white bystanders,
but from the police.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.390
They remained polite and
soft spoken at all times.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.480
You want an even more
dramatic example?

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:14.850
Gandhi's movement in India,
an entire national movement

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.230
of millions.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.510
Most of whom had
never met Gandhi

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:22.110
remained, for the most part,
peaceful and nonviolent.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.010
And they brought down
the British empire.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.870
The bottom line
here is if you want

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:32.550
to have an enduring impact
on the people around you

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:37.140
your family, your coworkers,
or the society at large,

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.900
you must practice
self-restraint.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.650
You must learn to
control your impulses.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.950
And when you do, you not
only improve your own life.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:52.020
You actually send out a rippling
wave of self-contained energy

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.010
to those around you who
want to emulate that.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.880
Now, I want to
spend a little bit

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:04.230
of time just about our
society and where we're at.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:09.030
Because let's be honest, impulse
control is at an all-time low.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.700
I shouldn't laugh, but
it is kind of ridiculous.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.100
I mean, in preparation
for this workshop,

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.780
I tried to think of one
single major cultural

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.840
or governmental
institution that hasn't

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.280
been infected with the
disease of self-indulgence.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.970
And I couldn't think
of a single one.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.050
Organized religion.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.380
You've got Catholic
pedophilia scandals.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.230
Sports.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.460
You've got doping,
Penn State pedophilia,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.370
violence against women.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.900
Banking.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.610
I remember when I was growing
up in the '50s, bankers were

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:46.110
like--

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.390
I thought they were the
most conservative people

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.180
in the world.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.940
I mean, if I'm going
to start a rock band,

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.370
I'm calling it Wells Fargo
and the wolves of Wall Street.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.640
It's crazy.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.320
Government.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.750
It's just a cesspool.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:00.870
It's a cesspool.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.920
And whatever you think of Trump,
he cannot restrain himself from

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.630
these early morning tweets, even
when they defeat his own cause.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.630
That's lack of impulse control.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:15.450
I'm not sure why anyone ever
looked up to the entertainment

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:18.710
industry, but the entertainment
industry is, again,

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.730
a kind of a cesspool.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:21.740
The press.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:27.720
There been sexual harassment
scandals at Fox, NBC, NPR.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.340
I didn't even know they had
sex at NPR, which is like,

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.260
who would think of it?

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.740
My point is that
every institution

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.150
that we might want to
look up to as role models

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.790
is already infected
with the disease.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.930
It looks like we're going to
have to be the antibodies.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:54.390
Clearly, the change isn't
going to come from top down.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.360
In a sense, the change
has to come from us

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.810
or as Gandhi said it,
we must be the change

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.600
we wish to see in the world.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.990
Now, the good news is,
if you believe Carl Jung,

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.340
we are all connected
to one another.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.510
This is inherent in his notion
of a collective unconscious.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:15.540
That there's a realm
in which all of us

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.190
sort of share the same
mythologies, the same imagery,

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.460
the same sense that
we're all connected,

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.230
which means that if we can
work really hard on ourselves,

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.390
we may actually affect
the rest of the society.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.770
What Margaret Mead said about
this, by the way, is that--

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.410
never doubt that a small
group of committed citizens

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:40.080
can change an entire society.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.250
And she added, it's the
only thing that ever has.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.950
So just as an end
exercise here, I

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:50.220
want to give you a taste
for what we, as a group,

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.170
could create in terms of the
spirit of self-restraint.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:58.710
So close your
eyes, and I'm going

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.590
to run you through the black
sun tool one last time.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.120
And then, I'm going to
add some stuff at the end.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.460
So once again, start with
the feeling of deprivation.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.550
Those little kid feelings of
not getting what you want.

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.940
And feel them as
intensely as you can.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.250
Now, let go of the
thing that you want.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:26.040
And with it, let the entire
outside world disappear.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.220
And redirect your
attention inside yourself.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.380
Face the void.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.350
Be calm.

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:38.640
Just be curious about it.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.360
And imagine the black sun begins
to ascend from the deepest

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.837
part of the void.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:57.700
Expanding slowly, it fills you
with it's warm and limitless

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.200
energy.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.940
Now, redirect your attention
back to the outside world.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:08.520
And let the black sun
energy surge out of you

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.526
in a flow of infinite giving
to everyone around you.

00:53:18.234 --> 00:53:20.400
Now I'd like you to imagine
that everyone around you

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.920
is also using the tool.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.320
So they're generating
light, encouraging

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.580
you to shine brighter.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.660
And your light is encouraging
them to shine brighter.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.130
And what I'd like
you to imagine next

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:40.140
is that the light coalesces.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.900
And essentially,
forms a sun rising

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.650
above the center of the room
more powerful than anything

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.380
that we could create,
each of us, on our own.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.090
And imagine that that sun
can reach beyond this room

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:58.229
and shine on the entire society.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.800
In a few minutes, we'll disperse
and go our own separate ways.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.840
But imagine that the
power of this sun

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.110
remains available
to all of us as we

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:18.630
battle our own individual
impulses on our own.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.780
In a way, it reaffirms
an enduring truth,

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.938
which is we are never
completely on our own.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.712
And when you're ready,
you can open your eyes.

00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:41.920
Thank you so much for coming.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.520
I really appreciate it.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.020
Thank you.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.070
[APPLAUSE]
