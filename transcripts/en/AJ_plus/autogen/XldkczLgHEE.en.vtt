journeyman rental plantings he didn't
and that means that they're not going to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
and that means that they're not going to
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.679

have a harvest when the rainy season

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
have a harvest when the rainy season
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
country is in a rainy season 60% of the
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800
country is in a rainy season 60% of the
roads of the country is not accessible

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
roads of the country is not accessible
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990
roads of the country is not accessible
by Road so the only way to reach them is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
by Road so the only way to reach them is
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.539
by Road so the only way to reach them is
by air and there's no way to even land a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
by air and there's no way to even land a
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130
by air and there's no way to even land a
plane so we just have to actually drop

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
plane so we just have to actually drop
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140
plane so we just have to actually drop
the food out of the plane and then have

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
the food out of the plane and then have
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910
the food out of the plane and then have
people on the ground to collect it and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
people on the ground to collect it and
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.350
people on the ground to collect it and
we're very concerned that if the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
we're very concerned that if the
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.780
we're very concerned that if the
fighting doesn't stop that the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
fighting doesn't stop that the
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179
fighting doesn't stop that the
conditions could really get much more

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
conditions could really get much more
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.319
conditions could really get much more
quickly so it's going to take sustained

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329
quickly so it's going to take sustained
 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.880
quickly so it's going to take sustained
humanitarian interventions over the next

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
humanitarian interventions over the next
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340
humanitarian interventions over the next
six months to make sure that these areas

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
six months to make sure that these areas
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.940
six months to make sure that these areas
don't slide into the famine

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
don't slide into the famine
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.009
