00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.650
- [Gary Greff] It takes me about six years

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.400
to do a sculpture.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.313
Six years to do one.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.598
So, I try to work on it daily,

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.960
but, sometimes Mother Nature tells me

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.423
what I'm going to be doing.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.533
I was born and raised
in Regent, North Dakota.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.540
When I was growing up,
my dad ran the elevator

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.110
and was a farmer

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.710
and I just went to
school as normal kids do,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.615
graduated from high school,

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.970
decided that I would go to college.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.200
I then was in education for roughly

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.580
around 18 years,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.260
was looking for the different job.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.296
I came home and I saw that
the town of Regent was dying.

00:00:56.296 --> 00:00:59.040
And that's when I started figuring

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.870
how can I help Regent stay alive?

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.287
and I came up with the Enchanted Highway.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.720
I had no art experience,
no welding experience.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.790
Okay, long and short of it.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.880
The first sculpture I did

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.083
was the world's largest tin family.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.460
You'll see that tin family

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.470
is all made out of tanks.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750
Oil well tanks make up the body.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.042
Fuel tanks make up the legs and arms,

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:32.240
and somebody gave me some
green paint for the boy.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.920
I thought while green and yellow

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.770
would be a perfect color
for the boy's shirt.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.770
Not realizing green and yellow
is the Green Bay Packers.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.100
Most of North Dakota is Vikings fans.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.080
So I get grief on that one all the time

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.050
because I painted them the wrong color.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.920
There's citizens in Regent

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.443
that don't believe in the project,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.840
feel it hasn't helped or whatever.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.140
But regardless, I know it's
helped and they always say

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.410
that you're not accepted
in your own community.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.163
So, that to me will always be.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.686
And now, pheasants on the prairie.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.850
My sculptures are all made
out of reusable metal.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.490
I don't use new metal.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.340
I usually go to a junkyard, get beams,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.290
get whatever I can get,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.880
take it from there, flatten
it out with a tractor

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.213
and that's where I get most of my metal.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.570
I don't have a shop.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.282
Everything I build is so large

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:53.967
that I can't, I don't
have a shop big enough.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.590
This is the knight here.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.180
He'll be about 40 some feet tall.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.421
He's standing here. There's his body,

00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:04.920
there's his legs, there's his feet.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.690
Then over here is the head of the knight.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.373
The knight will be
holding a 30-foot sword.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.130
You're seeing it covered with snow, so

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.780
I work out in the snow and rain
and whatever I've got to do.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.340
It goes all the way to here, the sword,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.230
it goes all the way to
here, goes all the way

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.250
and you've got a 30-foot sword.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.840
Okay, the Enchanted Castle,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.330
the reason I decided to start that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.610
was because I figured

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.240
at the end of the Enchanted Highway

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.160
we need to have a hotel.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.420
And I went to banks

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.697
and said, let me,

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:43.180
"Would you loan me
money to build a hotel?"

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.760
and they laughed at me.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.590
And I don't blame them because they said

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.787
"We're not gonna build a
hotel in Regent, North Dakota,

00:03:49.787 --> 00:03:52.140
town of a hundred people."

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.182
Long and short of it,

00:03:53.182 --> 00:03:56.928
the school then came up for bids.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.030
This used to be the old high school.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.150
I started teaching. I started
here, I was not teaching,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.780
I was playground supervisor,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.240
annual staff advisor, bus
driver when I started here.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.863
But I did graduate from here.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.880
This was the superintendent's
office, principal's office.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.130
This is the high school gymnasium.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.563
It's got two eight-man hot
tubs in the locker room.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.898
Why the Medieval theme?

00:04:26.898 --> 00:04:28.460
Everybody in town sort of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760
wanted to stay as a school theme.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.760
I felt that didn't tie in

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.670
with the Enchanted Highway.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.390
What ties in with the Enchanted
Highway besides a castle?

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.330
Okay, in North Dakota,
I felt there couldn't be

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.430
a Disneyland castle, but a Medieval castle

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.430
would fit the area of the
North Dakota that we have.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.920
This is right where I sat

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.970
when I graduated from high school.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.500
When I graduated, I was 18 years old

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.980
thinking, "Wow, I can't wait to get out

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.860
to a party, to get out of
school, get out of this school."

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.360
And never once thinking that
I would ever, ever, ever

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.627
have turned it into a tavern.

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:24.890
My closing words is that,
is to come in to Regent

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.630
and Enchanted Highway

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.633
and basically see what one man

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.970
that never laid a bead
of weld in his life,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.450
never had an art class.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.949
With one man can do this,
it's proof that you,

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.826
that you can do whatever
you set your mind to do.
