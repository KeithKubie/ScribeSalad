00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.700
Thanks to my diet of tacos and skittles, my
weight constantly fluctuates, which is yet

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.490
another thing I have in common with the kilogram.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.880
Hey killer grams -- which is what I call my
grandma when she’s lookin’ fly -- Jules

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.060
here for DNews! How much does a kilogram weigh?
Well...it’s a kilogram, right? But how do

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.519
we know how much that is? Maybe a better answer
is: 1000 grams. A gram was originally defined

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.480
as the mass of one cubic centimeter of water
at the melting point of ice, and well, that’s

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.790
something we can actually measure, rather
than some ephemeral idea of “a kilogram”.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.800
So, now we can say “a kilogram is 1000 cubic
centimeters of water at the melting point

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.800
of ice3”. That’s almost dead on accurate,
but that’s not how much a kilogram weighs.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.330
The real answer is that a kilogram is defined
by the weight of one single object in the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.350
entire universe: Le Grand K, or “the Big
K”.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.740
On the outskirts of Paris, in the basement
of the International Bureau of Weights and

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.640
Measures, is an environmentally controlled,
impenetrable safe, in which is the official

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.210
definition of the kilogram4. It is called
the International Prototype of the Kilogram

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.150
or IPK4,. It is a cylindrical piece of metal,
a platinum alloy to be specific, about the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.890
size of a film canister or a golf ball, and
it weighs exactly one kilogram4. And there’s

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.280
no way it can’t, because the official metric
definition of a kilogram is equal to whatever

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.311
Le Grand K weighs. So if you sneak into the
Pavillion De Breteuil where it’s kept, and

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:34.570
shave one gram off the top, every single “formerly”
one-kilogram weight in the world will now

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.090
officially be one gram heavier than a kilogram.
I cannot stress this enough: the entire world’s

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.090
scientific understanding of what a kilogram
is, is based on the exact weight of a physical

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.310
object stored in a French basement. And it’s
been this way since 1889.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.600
Now, that’s not to say that the IPK isn’t
a fairly reliable source. It is made up of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.350
90% platinum and 10% iridium10, making it
super hard, resistant to oxidation, nearly

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.479
twice as dense as lead, and not very susceptible
to magnets. There are a number of exact copies

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.380
all around the world to allow for comparison
and calibration.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.810
Now, it's great that they’re going to such
lengths to make sure that nothing happens

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.930
to the IPK, because if something were to happen
to it, science would change -- mostly physics.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.849
Think about how often we use the kilogram,
and how much of physics is built on itself.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.980
Take, for example, the newton, which is defined
by the amount of force necessary to move a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.450
kilogram at one meter per second squared.
Then, take the pascal, which is defined as

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.170
one newton per square meter, or one kilogram
per meter per second squared. The kilogram

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.260
is a base SI unit, so it affects any measurement
that uses mass in kilograms.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.530
And that’s a really bad precedent. Already,
despite every precaution, the IPK is changing.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.500
Since 1889 there have only been two other
verifications of its weight, in 194817 and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.190
1989. What they found is that the Le Grand
K has lost a petit amount of weight. Roughly

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.210
50 micrograms, or 50 billionths of a kilogram.
Worse yet, scientists don’t know why that’s

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.601
happening 17. So, does this change in mass
means that now all our calculations have to

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.430
be redone?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.551
Of course not, but it did force the people
who make those sorts of decisions, The General

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:18.680
Conference on Weights and Measures, to try
and figure out a better system of defining

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.410
the kilogram, rather than something you can
accidentally lose in the washing machine.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.230
In 2011, they generally agreed to redefine
the kilogram based on Planck’s constant.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.099
Planck’s constant is a number representing
the relationship between the energy of a particle

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.980
and its frequency. You don’t really have
to understand how that works, except that

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.580
it never changes, and it relates to energy.
That’s useful, because we can then relate

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.330
energy to mass thanks to Einstein’s E=mc2
equation. This means we can define mass, and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.510
therefore, the kilogram, using a constant
figure.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.070
But the Conference on Weights and Measures
decided to postpone the decision to make that

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.459
change until 2014, and in 2014 they postponed
it to 2018. Which means that if you’re having

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.870
trouble losing weight, you still have a year
or two to fly to France and stick a piece

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.840
of gum on the Grand K. A heavier kilogram
means a smaller you!

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.400

And make sure you subscribe to Seeker VR.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.770
So now you know how much a kilogram really
weighs, but how long is a second, really?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:54.050
We have a video all about that here.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.160
So what do you prefer, kilograms or pounds?
