00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.577
And with that, we are
done with this course.

00:00:02.577 --> 00:00:04.910
Making a server and a client
communicate with each other

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.009
isn't that hard, but doing
it correctly, efficiently,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.169
and securely is a
much more complex task

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.490
than it might seem.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.594
We have covered a lot
of topics in this course.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.509
We've taken a look at
the request and response

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.134
cycle, where the
browser and the server

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.629
get connected with each other.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.019
Then we looked at HTTP's
verbs, headers, REST,

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.489
and performance issues.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.299
Lesson 3 was on HTTPS,
TLS, and cryptography.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.609
In the last lesson,
we look at HTTP/2

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.759
and all the amazing benefits
it brings to the web ecosystem.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.980
In this lesson, we looked
at security precautions

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.250
with the same origin policy,
way to get around that policy,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.259
and then some
vulnerabilities like CSRF

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:41.778
and cross-site scripting.

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:44.070
We covered a lot of techniques,
but the important thing

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.689
to keep in mind
throughout all of this

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.286
is keeping your user secure.

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:49.619
Thanks for joining us on
this journey of client server

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:50.519
communication.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.580
We'll see you later.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.129
Bye.
