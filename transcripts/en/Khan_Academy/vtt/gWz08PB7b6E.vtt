00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:03.447
- [Voiceover] Let's try to show that 0.5

00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:05.323
is equal to one half.

00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:08.468
We often hear people use
these interchangeably.

00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:09.858
They use them back and forth.

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.533
Maybe someone would say,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.607
I have a 2.5 pound rat

00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:14.881
and then someone would say back to them,

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.146
wow, a two and a half
pound rat, that's enormous.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:21.046
If we get past thinking about
how enormous that rat is,

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:24.635
what we can notice is they first said 2.5

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:26.956
and then they changed
it to two and a half.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.384
They use them interchangeably
because they're equal

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:30.477
and that's fine.

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:31.724
You can use these back and forth

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:34.054
because they are equal to each other.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.304
.5 and one half are equivalent or equal

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:40.995
but let's not just accept
that that's true, let's see,

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.057
let's see if we can prove it.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:43.581
Let's try to show that.

00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:44.848
So the first way we can show it

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:47.298
is down here with a number line.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:51.415
We have a number line
that goes from zero to one

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:55.034
and it's divided into
one, two, three, four,

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.867
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10 equal pieces

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.049
so that means each of these pieces

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.632
is one of the 10 equal
pieces or one tenth.

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:10.556
So looking back at this decimal up here,

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:13.556
this five is in the tenths place

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.639
so we can also say 0.5 is five tenths

00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:20.201
is another way to read that decimal

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.534
or we could say five tenths.

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:27.120
So if this distance here is one tenth,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.037
if we travel another one,
we've gone two of the tenths,

00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:32.312
two of the 10 equal spaces.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:33.731
So to get to five tenths,

00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:37.713
we're going to travel
one, two, three, four,

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:39.875
five of the tenths

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.875
and right here, we have five tenths.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.033
We could write is as a fraction

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.410
or we could write is as a decimal.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.539
So we found five tenths
on this number line

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.303
but let's see if that really
is the same as one half.

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:57.303
This distance here from zero to one,

00:01:58.354 --> 00:02:01.207
if we were to block that off,

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:03.122
going to mark it off,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.671
this point right here
where we said five tenths,

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:10.226
this distance, this whole
distance that we traveled

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.316
is this much

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:14.387
and we can see here that this is in fact

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.595
half of the distance between zero and one.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.412
This is halfway.

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.829
So 0.5 and one half are at the same point

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:25.356
on a number line

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:28.870
so that's one one to
show they're equivalent.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.137
Another way we can show

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:31.977
that five tenths and one half are equal

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:33.977
is with a fraction model.

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:35.850
So here we have a rectangle

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.487
and let's try to show one half.

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:39.673
Let's start with one half this time.

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:42.959
So if we split this rectangle in half,

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.106
here we're trying to show half.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:47.207
One out of two equal pieces.

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:49.498
So we'll shade one half,

00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:51.380
one of the two pieces.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.375
So this is one half and now,

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:57.425
let's try to show that this
is equal to five tenths.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:01.199
Remember, this five is in tenths place.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.036
So now, instead of halves,

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.957
we're going to divide our
rectangle into tenths,

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:06.957
five tenths,

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.282
so let's do that.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:12.574
Here we go.

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:15.311
So we'll make 10 equal pieces for tenths

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.244
and we will shade five of them.

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:21.222
We want to see five of the tenths

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:22.811
so let's do that.

00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.144
One, two, three,

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.516
four and five.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.516
Here, we've shown five tenths

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:35.355
and we can see that it
is equal to one half.

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:39.377
One half and five tenths
cover the same amount

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:40.866
so they are equal.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:42.093
So we've shown two ways now.

00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:44.300
One half and five tenths
were at the same spot

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.140
on a number line which means they're equal

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.496
and they cover the same amount of area

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.838
which is another way
to show they're equal.

00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:54.421
So one half is definitely equal

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:57.709
to 0.5 or five tenths.
