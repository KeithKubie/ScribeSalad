00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.157
y = negative one-half x + 8.

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:09.105
When an equation has
more than one variable,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.300
you can solve that equation for
one of the variables.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.110
Remember that a variable
represents a number.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.480
So you can do the same operations on
variable terms, so add, subtract,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.210
multiply and divide,
that you can do to numbers.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.110
Let's look at the steps to solve for y.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.782
And remember that when solving for
a variable, we're trying to get that

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:36.161
variable alone on one side of
the equation with a coefficient of 1.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:42.340
I'm going to subtract 2x to move the 2x
to the other side of the equation.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.257
And I get 4y + 0 = 32- 2x.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:55.469
Or just 4y = 32- 2x.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.940
I want the coefficient in
front of the y to be 1.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.438
So let's divide it by 4 and

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:07.317
then we get y = 32- 2x all over 4.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:12.949
We can simplify this, 32 / 4 is 8,

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:17.060
and 2x / 4 is one-half x.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.170
By convention, terms with variables
will go before constants.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.520
So this is actually negative one-half
x + 8, but both are correct.
