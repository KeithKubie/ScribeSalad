I think you're on a roll. Let's do one more example. Same page as before,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.450
but with one small optimization. We have

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.640
an asynchronous script. Let's see if figure out

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.980
the critical rendering path metrics just by

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.300
looking at the HTML. Of course, you're welcome

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.420
to draw the diagram yourself, but I'm guessing you won't need it. Give it a try.
