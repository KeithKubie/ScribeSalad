00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.400
THE UNICORNS OF THE SEA!

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:09.300
They're a real thing and they make me so excited
I might pee myself.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.669
Hello hello friends Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.540
No new studies for you today, just a loving
celebration of another neato animal in the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.060
sea: the narwhal.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.160
This is a rare whale that lives in Arctic
waters with a long horn-like tusk that juts

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.080
from the head -- a tusk that can grow to be
10 FEET LONG!

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.710
In addition to "the unicorn of the sea" the
narwhal has also been referred to as "the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.130
corpse whale" because its spots kind of look
like livor mortis - that patchy discoloration

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.320
that can happen after death.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.610
Although, as the narwhal ages, it gets more
and more white.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.440
For centuries the narwhal has been famous
not for its color but for that TUSK, which

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.170
has been the source of all kind of folklore
and legends.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.010
It may have been the original inspiration
for the beloved fictional unicorn and people

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.450
believed the tusk had magical healing powers.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.261
They believed it so strongly, in fact, that
in the Middle Ages, the tusk of a narwhal

00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.280
was worth 10x its weight in gold!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.261
The high demand has posed a threat to the
species actually, so....that's not cool.

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:07.110
The source of the Narwhal's fame, the tusk,
is actually A TOOTH.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.060
Craziest tooth you'll ever see my friends,
and it's the only tooth the Narwhal grows.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.230
Although, very rarely, a second tooth will
grow.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.900
This tooth is grown by most males and only
about 15% of the females....it grows directly

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.180
through the whale's upper lip and spirals
to the left.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.890
Always to the left, possibly because it helps
maintain a more durable structure.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.990
And it's not super hard either, the tusk is
bendy, it can bend about a foot in any direction.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.870
What's interesting about the narwhal's tooth
is that it's anatomy is basically an inside-out

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.460
version of a human tooth.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.970
While humans have the hard stuff on the outside
protecting the soft sensory tissue on the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.240
inside, the narwhal has the hard stuff on
the INSIDE with the sensitive layers on the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.280
outside.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590
There's a reason for this madness.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.930
The sensitive layer is covered with millions
of tiny holes which act as a sophisticated

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.110
sensor for the whale.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.570
These holes lead to the nerves which allow
the narwhal to sense the water's pressure,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.070
temperature, how salty it is.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.930
Good things to have for survival, which is
why it's not clear why female narwhals are

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.430
less likely to have one.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.060
The function of the tusk is still being studied
because they're pretty mysterious creatures

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.130
that are hard for scientists to observe.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.689
The scientific consensus at this point is
that the tusk is a sexual trait, kind of like

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.689
a lion's mane.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.159
It may be there to attract a mate, to display
dominance, or perhaps even for communication.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.969
Narwhals do touch tusks...but it's not in
a violent way.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.300
That would probably hurt anyway, given how
many nerve endings cover the tusk.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.010
Can you imagine banging up a sensitive organ?

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.110
NO THANKS.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.599
So folks, what's your favorite animal in the
sea?

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.819
Tell me about it and maybe we'll throw a little
lovefest for them here on DNews.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.859
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.
