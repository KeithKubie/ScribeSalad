00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.160
What's the Difference Between Green and Black
Tea

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.940
Both black and green tea is harvested from
an evergreen, tree-like shrub known as camellia

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.940
sinensis.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.110
Most likely originating in China, the camellia
sinensis is thought to have first been used

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.200
to brew a medicinal elixir during the Shang
Dynasty (1600 BC to 1046 BC).

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.930
By the Qin Dynasty in the third century BC,
it had become a relatively popular drink using

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.480
only the leaves from this plant, rather than
mixed with other things as seems to have been

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
common when used medicinally.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
As for the plant itself, camellia sinensis
can grow as tall as 30 ft if left untended,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.430
but is generally kept significantly shorter,
usually only 3-6 ft tall, to make it easier

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.570
to harvest the buds and leaves.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.320
It is those that are then processed to become
green or black tea, among other types.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.570
The difference between these teas is achieved
via different processing methods.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.329
Manufacturers create green tea by picking
the leaves off the plant and then heating

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.350
them immediately afterwards.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.720
This is commonly done by pan firing the leaves
or steaming them.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.920
Sufficient heat stops the leaves from oxidizing,
allowing them to maintain their green color.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.390
Leaves that are going to be used for black
tea are allowed to ferment, or oxidize, completely.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.830
The general process here is to roll, tear,
or crush the leaves to help along the oxidation

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.340
process (similar to why the inside of an apple
turns brown when you expose it to air).

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.799
The leaves are then dried out, sometimes in
the Sun or otherwise using machines.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.340
As the leaves oxidize, they gradually turn
from green to black.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.260
Other common types of tea include white and
oolong.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.420
Oolong is initially generally processed in
the same way as black tea, but isnâ€™t allowed

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.990
to oxidize for as long.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.409
Once the desired oxidation level has been
reached, which varies quite a bit by type

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.030
and manufacturer (some oolong tea is closer
to green tea, while others is closer to black

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.250
in oxidation levels), the leaves are fired
similar to green tea to stop the oxidation

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.140
process at that point.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.340
White tea is made by picking the leaves and
buds early in the year while the bud is still

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.340
closed.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.169
From here, the leaves may be placed out to
dry in the Sun or may be dried out in some

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:38.239
other fashion, in either case attempting to
minimize oxidation during this process.
