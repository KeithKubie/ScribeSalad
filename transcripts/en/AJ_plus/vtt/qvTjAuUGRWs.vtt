00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.760
From hashtags to vigils, the world continues
to mourn the victims of the Paris attacks.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.480
But some responses have been a bit...
misguided.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.280
Here are 3 reactions you should
think twice about.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520
Roughly half of U.S. governors are vowing
to close their states to Syrian refugees

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.720
following the Paris attacks.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.600
This, despite the fact that it remains unclear
if any of the attackers were refugees.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.640
What we do know is that the Syrian refugees 
are fleeing the same violence that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.600
devastated Paris.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.480
As President Obama said:

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400
"It is very important that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.680
we do not close our hearts to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
these victims

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.160
of such violence

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.360
and somehow start equating the issue of
refugees with the issue of terrorism."

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.000
Even though the majority of all ISIS victims are 
Muslim and the majority of all Muslims

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.320
don't support ISIS, over the weekend we
saw a backlash against Muslims.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.599
Right-wing protesters stormed a vigil for
the victims, screaming "expel Islamists," and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.720
throwing firecrackers. But they were
ultimately chased away by hundreds of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.520
people yelling, "Go away fascist."

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.000
And in the past few days, we've seen even
more examples of ant-muslim sentiment.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.240
In Scotland, an Islamic cultural center
was firebombed.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.360
In Canada, a mosque was set on fire and
a Muslim woman who was picking up her

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.720
kids from school was assaulted by two men 
while they yelled anti-Muslim profanities at

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.200
her.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.000
The media has also perpetuated the sentiment 
that Muslims-as a whole- should

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.320
be held accountable for the attacks, like these 
CNN hosts berating a spokesperson

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.440
for an anti-Islamophobia group in France.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.520
And here in the U.S. you've got presidential
candidate Donald Trump who said he'd

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
monitor mosques and possibly even
shut them down.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.960
Many pundits used the attacks to push the
line that there's a global war between Islam

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.800
and the West.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.840
Fox News presenter Andrea Tantaros said
President Obama is being delusional when

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.280
he said "Muslims and Christians are not at war."

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.560
The reaction to the Paris attack was global.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.680
World leaders rushed to issue statements,
monuments around the world lit up in the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
French colors, and people expressed their
sadness and solidarity on social media.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.120
Facebook let you put up a French flag on
your profile picture with one click, and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.520
turned on Safety Check - a service that lets
users tell their friends that they're okay.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.440
The solidarity has been heartening, but none of 
that happened when the same

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.360
group killed 43 people in Lebanon the day
before Paris, or when they killed 97 in

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Turkey a few weeks earlier.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.400
Frequent  ISIS attacks in Syria and Iraq rarely 
ellicit the same type of international

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.840
reaction Paris got.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.840
Maybe the disproportionate coverage is
because these things aren't expected to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.040
happen in European or North American cities. 
But that doesn't make the suffering in

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.960
Beirut or elsewhere any less real.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.200
Downplaying that suffering is what helps
misguided reactions against refugees and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.640
entire religious communities to spread.
