00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:04.646
&gt;&gt;Joseph: The collaboration with
the teachers fuels our students,

00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:08.956
they get interested and
engaged and work on projects.

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.416
It just makes education real.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:19.646
&gt;&gt;John: There are no
walls between departments.

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:22.866
The collaboration between the
academic and the vocational is one

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.646
of the core pieces of
what makes High Tech work.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:30.026
&gt;&gt;Joseph: We accept students based
on interest, such as performing arts

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:34.176
or science, and with that goes
the hope that their interest

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:38.046
in their vocational program will drive
their interest and accomplishments

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.546
in their academic programs.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:45.816
The integration between broadcasting and
the social studies started this year.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.586
Mister Jefferson said, "I'd like to
bring my students into this studio.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.596
Mister Pluchino, your
students could run the studio."

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:56.566
&gt;&gt;John: John and I sat down and
talked about doing a history show,

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:59.126
something where we can
invite the students.

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:02.496
The first week that I offered
the students the opportunity,

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:06.206
we could either sit here and do the
regular stereotypical history class,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.946
or we could do a year's
worth of radio shows

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.146
and still learn the same
stuff, it was ten out of ten.

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.086
Everyone wanted to do the radio shows.

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:18.046
&gt;&gt;Good morning, welcome to another
episode of the Jeffersonian Show.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.236
Today we'll be talking about Vietnam,

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.906
so let's talk about the protest
side of the Vietnam experience.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.486
What are some of the protest songs
that stick out with some of you ladies?

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:32.666
&gt;&gt;Kelsey: There was one particular song
where it caused a lot of controversy.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.946
It was, "You're old enough
to kill but not for voting."

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:40.096
In 1971, the US Constitution was amended

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.246
and they lowered the age,
the voting age to 18.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:48.826
So music is not only a way to express
yourself, it's a way to make it change.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:53.006
&gt;&gt;I'm just going to call
it really awesome.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:56.766
My major is broadcasting and
now that I can combine history

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.686
and broadcasting together, it's a
very different approach to learning.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.296
&gt;&gt;John: You think that the war was a
good idea to fight in the first place?

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:09.036
&gt;&gt;Student: The war was good to those
who were in the arms creating factory,

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:11.676
the bomb making, but as a country
it was bad, because we went

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.086
in blind and we lost a lot of men.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:18.356
&gt;&gt;John: We have a planning session at
least once a week before we do the show.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.936
John goes over the background
of the show.

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.266
The kids have to go home and research.

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:26.186
I want them to come informed,
you know, we just don't want,

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:27.536
"Yeah, I heard about that."

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:28.916
That doesn't make a show.

00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:35.756
&gt;&gt;John: We'll have a goal and then
we'll backfill on how to reach the goal.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:39.656
Thursday is the radio show and
Wednesday is the team teaching prep day

00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:40.826
with John Pluchino.

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:44.496
The Monday and Tuesday, we'll
usually spend on instruction.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.296
&gt;&gt;How should we open the show?

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:48.646
&gt;&gt;Student: We could lead up to
the Watergate scandal in the end.

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:51.196
&gt;&gt;John: They'll come to me with ideas,
so they'll read things on their own

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:52.906
and they'll bring me
articles that they've found.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.726
They'll come up with bullet points
and things that they want to hit on

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:58.686
and we'll build a discussion
around those things.

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.296
&gt;&gt;Michael: We step away from the
textbooks, which is refreshing.

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:04.976
I like to bring what I've learned and
what I've exposed myself to the show.

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:07.846
&gt;&gt;Help prevented North and
South Vietnam from unifying,

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:10.006
because they didn't want them
both to become Communist.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:14.476
A year after the war ended, the entirety
of Vietnam became Communist anyway.

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:19.406
&gt;&gt;John: The way we prep non-broadcasting
majors is we try to be basic

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:21.616
and simple, how to talk into the mic.

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:26.026
Learn how to listen to each
other, let the knowledge

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:28.426
that you have drive your communication.

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:33.816
&gt;&gt;John: The big thing with the skill
sets is not so much learning how

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:36.546
to operate the mechanics
of the broadcasting,

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:40.836
but how to be comfortable talking
to an audience that you can't see.

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:46.286
&gt;&gt;John: I consider the radio
station a great learning laboratory.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.516
So it allows them to take the
next step with their studies.

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:53.386
&gt;&gt;Joseph: We have a collaboration
that gets the students more excited,

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.286
because they have a perspective
from two different areas.

00:03:57.346 --> 00:04:01.346
&gt;&gt;John: Instead of just
writing book reports and tests,

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:03.666
they now can express
what they've learned.

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:08.976
I told the students, it's
larger than your grade.
