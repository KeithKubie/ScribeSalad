00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.360
This right here is our
derivative intuition module.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.210
And it was a module that was
contributed by Ben Eater,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.862
and it's a pretty interesting
module, one, it's graphical

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:09.570
and all the rest.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.280
But what's really
cool about it is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.219
it really helps to conceptualize
what a derivative is all about.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.110
And all it really
is is the slope

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.170
of the tangent
line at any point.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.800
So in this exercise
right over here,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.020
they've graphed f of x is
equal to 2x to the third power,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.580
so this is 2x to the third
power right over here.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.150
And what we need to do is move
these orange dots up and down,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.220
so these orange dots
right now show a line.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.280
So when I highlight
on that orange dot,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.770
you saw this line down
here became orange.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.760
And right now that
orange dot is 0

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.740
because the slope of this
line right over here is 0.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.620
But we see that that line right
now is definitely not tangent,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.750
or the slope at that point
in our curve 2x to the third,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.180
is definitely not 0.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.020
So what we need to do
is we need to move this,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.860
so it becomes pretty close, as
close as we can kind of eyeball

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.150
it, to the slope of
the tangent line.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.870
And so that looks about-- right
about there looks about right.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.170
That looks pretty
close to the slope

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.300
of the curve at that point.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.840
And you could even see
while I do it, up here,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.210
you see DDX of f of negative 2.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.772
So the derivative at f
is equal to negative 2.

00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:24.730
So that's just saying
that when the function is

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.350
equal to negative 2, what
is the derivative there?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.150
That's the slope.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.780
So by putting it
all the way up here,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.280
I'm saying that the slope is
equal to 24 at that point.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.310
So that's a pretty good
approximation just eyeballing

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.400
it like that.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.930
Now, let's do this
point right over here.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.050
So it looks like the slope
is decreasing a little bit,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.800
but it's still very positive.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.180
So the slope looks maybe it's
close to around 14 or 15.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.250
And then over here,
once again, our slope

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.680
has decreased bit it's
still reasonably positive.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.860
The slope looks
like it's about 5,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.482
so the slope is a decreasing.

00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:58.940
Right over here
the slope does look

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.550
like it's about 0
right over here.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.600
This looks like an
inflection point actually.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.080
So our slope is 0 right there.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.900
And you see the
derivative at f is

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.940
0 is 0, which just means
this is fancy notation

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.690
to say that the slope
of the tangent line,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.860
or you could say the slope of
the curve at that point, is 0.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.600
It's flat there, and you
see it really is flat.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.580
And then you go
over here, and we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.890
want to find the
derivative at f of 1.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.660
And so once again, it looks like
the slope is now increasing.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.110
So this is interesting.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.780
Up here, the slope
was very positive,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.870
but it was decreasing
as we went here.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.640
Notice, it's getting
flatter and flatter.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.400
Then it goes to 0, and now the
slope starts increasing again.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.490
So at this point, we
want to make it tangent.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.190
And so now notice
the slope has gone

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.770
up relative to
when we were at 1.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.450
So that looks like the
slope right over there.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.380
And then we do the
slope over there.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.100
And if we get
pretty close, it'll

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.720
actually draw the curve
of the derivative.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.670
So there you go.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.620
And so what's neat
about here, we

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.040
didn't find the derivative
at every point in the curve,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.320
we found it at just add
the special points that we

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.110
were able to move
these orange dots for.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.610
But since we got the
orange dots close enough

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.540
to the actual derivatives,
just by eyeballing it,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.750
just trying to find the--
trying to look at what

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.799
the slope of this
tangent line is, it said,

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.340
OK, you've done it
right, and it drew

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.024
the whole slope
of the derivative.

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:22.440
And what this entire derivative
is saying is at any point,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.023
this is the slope
of the tangent line.

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:28.050
So even though we didn't move
a dot around at negative 0.5,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.060
if you go right up here,
that looks like it's around--

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.250
this is 2 and 1/2, so this
would be a little bit over 1.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.890
It looks like that would be
the slope of the tangent line

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.750
right over there.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.202
Or if we went all the
way to negative 2.25,

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:43.660
the slope of the
tangent line looks

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.262
like it's approximately
30 right over there.

00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:48.720
So once you have
the curve, you now

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.080
have the slope of
the tangent line,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.538
or you have the
slope of the curve,

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:53.690
at every point that
we see over here.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.341
So this is just, I thought,
a pretty neat exercise.
