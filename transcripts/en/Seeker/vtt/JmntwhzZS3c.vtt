00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:06.290
Female foam-nesting tree frogs build frothy
nests at the ends of tree branches that extend

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.290
over small bodies of water.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.450
They do this by secreting a watery substance
and whipping it up with her hind legs, which

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.990
quickly gains the attention of nearby males.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.789
It’s in this foam bath that a male will
copulate with the female.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.789
Oh!

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.190
Did I say male?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.740
I meant MALES - up to 20 additional males
will join the party in quick succession, earning

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.770
female foam nesting frogs the title of ‘most
promiscuous’ females in the vertebrate world.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.360
The males and the female will all continue
the leg-pumping, frothing action, which serves

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.090
to increase the size of the nest.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.480
The lengthy orgies are generally peaceful,
and the majority of a female's’ eggs are

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.170
fertilized and well-protected in their foamy
environments.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.410
But in addition to taking a LOT of energy,
it seems that having such promiscuous sex

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.149
could be downright dangerous for female foam-nesters.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.389
The possibility of competition between males
or the potential for injury to the female

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.149
seem like they could be major factors here.

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.990
Why would these females take the risk?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.200
Foam nesting frogs live in stochastic South-Eastern
African environments.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.560
This means that the environmental conditions
are both unpredictable and also quite severe.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.969
By allowing each of her egg clutches to be
sired by a variety of males, a female ensures

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.509
that her offspring will be genetically diverse.

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.419
This diversity will allow at least some of
her babies to survive, regardless of the environmental

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:36.139
conditions that they will have to endure.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.969
In this way, when mom acts like a supertramp,
she is actually making sure to maximize her

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.369
own genetic blueprints in future generations.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.390
Who are we to judge?

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.539
