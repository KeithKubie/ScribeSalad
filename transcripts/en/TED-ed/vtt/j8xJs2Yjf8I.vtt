00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.855
We all start life as one single cell.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:11.673
Then that cell divides and we are two cells,

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:12.461
then four,

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:13.294
then eight.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:14.630
Cells form tissues,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.839
tissues form organs,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.811
organs form us.

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:19.720
"So, how did you guys decide, like,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.477
what style to use when animating this video?"

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.553
"I, originally, when I was reading the script,

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:30.036
I was thinking a lot about food."

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:30.978
"Were you hungry?"

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:34.684
"I was hungry probably because I always am.

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:36.938
But, yeah, I was thinking about healthy food

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:42.149
and thinking of how can I use material,

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319
how could I actually materialize that cell,

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:47.485
the cancer cell and the healthy cell.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:52.869
So, I decided to use grain and seeds for healthy cells

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.329
and, then, for the cancer cells, actually,

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.658
we decided to use candy.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:59.833
We did a little short animation before this

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.752
when we were using different color jelly beans

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:03.921
to animate bacteria,

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.428
so I thought, 'Oh, well, we can use that.'

00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:08.102
But, then, the jelly beans were actually, like,

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:11.939
a little too big to construct this cell.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.193
And, so, I decided to go with something smaller,

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:16.736
and we found Nerds.

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:18.697
Lisa can actually tell you a little more about

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:21.742
how she designed each cell."

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:23.827
"Yeah, when we were, we had a whole collection

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:26.495
of seeds and candy Nerds in front of us.

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.463
So, we actually ended up using

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:32.168
buckwheat and lentils for the healthy cells.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.299
And then for the candy Nerds,

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.717
they were really a perfect size.

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:37.221
We got to play with the colors

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.704
and switch them around to make those cells

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.700
look a little more alive like they were constantly changing.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.961
So, it really had a more erratic look

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:45.661
than the seeds, which were natural colors,

00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.536
but that would also stay consistent throughout."

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:49.500
"Are these actually?"

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.870
"Those are the actual things.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.350
So, those, as you see, probably, like, come in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.879
pink, orange, yellow, green, all these colors.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.343
So, I wanted to create the image of a cancer cell

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:03.060
as something that is bad.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.474
So, we actually shot these things as they are

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:09.525
and then changed the hue in the computer

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:13.356
so they appear more neon blue and toxic in a way."

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:14.964
"And it wasn't just food, right?

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:17.204
There were also other materials that you guys used?"

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:17.971
"Right."

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.970
"There was, so there was a part in the video

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.741
that talked about tissue and organs

00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.947
and I stayed within that same idea

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:28.331
and thought like, 'Which natural material I can use

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.543
to construct these objects?'

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:33.253
And then I think for the tissue,

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.207
we used something that was like a lacy pattern,

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:37.880
and then for the rest of it,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.767
it was mostly knitted yarn

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.608
or crocheted yarn.

00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:42.985
So, those were the materials.

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:44.946
So, we will see in the human body,

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:48.324
because we do not really have the skills or the time

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:50.243
to actually crochet these things,

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:53.844
our artist, Celeste, actually crocheted her organs

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:54.902
in Photoshop.

00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:57.375
So, we would take these patterns from some stock

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:58.620
that we found online,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.962
and she did step-by-step

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:04.283
and she actually, like, made it into the shape of an organ.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.201
So, those were the materials we used."
