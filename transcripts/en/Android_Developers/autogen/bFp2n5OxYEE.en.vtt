the recommended way to involve the user
 

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.500
the recommended way to involve the user
is to use the notification API you're

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.510
is to use the notification API you're
 

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.750
is to use the notification API you're
all familiar with the only thing to

all familiar with the only thing to
 

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.810
all familiar with the only thing to
remember is the set full screen intent

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:27.820
remember is the set full screen intent
 

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.820
remember is the set full screen intent
API which allows you to set an intent
