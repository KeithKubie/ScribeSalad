00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.020
Earlier we had code like this, where
we say renton equals new MarkerOptions.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.670
We passed it a latitude and a longitude
and we set the title as a string.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.670
Now this code set the position and
title for the pin.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.500
But we can customize this further
with another property which is

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.400
the .icon property.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.620
Here's an example.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.650
Now you can see I have the same
position I have the same title, but

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.130
I'm now using the .icon property, and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm setting that to
a BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.299
And as you may recall from
Android fundamentals,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.890
when you use
a BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.420
you can then define
a resource as an R.drawable.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.990
And I'm just using the basic
R.drawable.ic_launcher.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.190
Which is the default icon that comes
with Android Studio projects, and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.650
it's an icon of a little
android himself.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.980
So just to keep things simple, I'm not
adding a new icon to this application.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.240
I'm not adding a new
icon to this sample,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.310
I'm just using one of
the ones that is built in.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.690
You can, of course, add your own
graphics as drawable resources and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.860
use them here, and
in fact I would recommend it.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.099
Because using the little
Android icon is a pain,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.340
as you'll see in a moment, isn't
the most user friendly way of doing it.
