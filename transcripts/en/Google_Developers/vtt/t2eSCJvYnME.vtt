TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.023
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.023 --> 00:00:05.942
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:08.400
The primary change in the latest
release of the Google Play

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.480
services SDK is the introduction
of the new task and GoogleApi

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.910
based APIs to replace the
GoogleApiClient access pattern.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.770
Check out the post linked in the
description below for a summary

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.090
and code to get started
with the new pattern.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.830
Understanding how
people find your app

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.690
and what they do once
they've installed

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.960
it is crucial to helping
you make the right product

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.610
and marketing decisions.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.190
To help you obtain more
accurate and reliable data

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.130
about your installs, we're
introducing the Google Play

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.760
Install Referrer API,
which is a reliable way

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.210
to securely retrieve
install referral content.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.980
For details and code,
check out the post.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.030
We're cutting the price of
NVIDIA Tesla GPUs attached

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.580
to on-demand Google Compute
Engine virtual machines

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.860
by up to 36%.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
Lower priced GPUs, together with
Custom VM shapes and Sustained

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.120
Usage Discounts allow you
to run highly parallelized

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
compute tasks on GPUs with
strong performance, all

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.200
at a great price.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.980
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.290
Machine learning and
data driven analysis

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.720
can help unlock
valuable insights,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.590
but it's not always easy to
know where or how to start.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.620
To help with that, we're
hosting Cloud OnAir: the Journey

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.520
from Big Data to AI on
December 5 in the Americas

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.220
and December 6 for
the rest of the world.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.100
It's a global online
event, so everyone can

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.170
join no matter where you are.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.870
Links to view the breakout
sessions and register

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.980
are on the post.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.060
We're excited to announce
multi-database support

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.250
in your Firebase projects, which
makes scaling your Realtime

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.987
Database a lot easier.

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:47.820
