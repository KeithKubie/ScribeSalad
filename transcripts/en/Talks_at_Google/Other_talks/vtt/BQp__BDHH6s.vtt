moderator: Thanks everyone f-for coming to
another Authors@Google SF. Today we've got

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.430
Paolo--and you know what, I'm just gonna be
honest. I’m not gonna try to butcher your

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.430
last name.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.430
[audience laughter]

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.010
moderator: But Paolo is going to be talking
about The Windup Girl as long--as well as

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.510
his--his former collection of short stories.
The Windup Girl was named one of the best

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.050
novels of the year by TIME Magazine, Publishers
Weekly, Library Journal, a number of other

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.039
prominent publications.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.529
It was nominated for the very prestigious
science fiction Hu--Hugo Award, and recently

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.649
won a Nebula Award for best novel. And what's
special about that is that this is his first

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.600
novel. And I believe it was Gibson--William
Gibson you said, is the only other science

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.590
fiction author who has won a--a--a Nebula
for their very first novel.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.050
So Hugos and Nebulas, very prestigious awards.
But a--a special honor to get it for his first

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.859
novel. He is also a Theodore Sturgeon award-winning
science fiction author and fantasy writer

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.059
from Colorado. His fiction has appeared in
a number of magazines, including The Magazine

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.000
of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, Asimov's Science
Fiction, a number of other publications.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.380
His short fiction, the work before this, was
collected in Pump Six and Other Stories. And

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.549
I have personally been reading The Windup
Girl. I'm absolutely immersed in the disturbingly

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.829
relatable future that Paolo paints.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.680
A semi-distant future where the fundamentals
of--of society have changed much less than

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.759
we would hope, which I feel adds an undertone
of--of even more haunting realism. So I' think

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.770
you're gonna enjoy it. Certainly we're gonna
enjoy the talk by Paolo. Thanks.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.449
[audience clapping]

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:49.299
&gt;&gt; And if all video conference offices can
make sure to mute for the entire talk.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.409
Paolo: Okay. Can--can people hear me okay?
I can't really judge levels. I can see heads

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.520
nod or something like that [laughs]. Okay,
great. This isn't actually my natural mode

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.030
to be standing in front of people.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.240
So this is a little more—-I'm supposed to
be behind a computer hiding out in a dark

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.590
room somewhere [audience laughter], not--not
in front of all of you. So it's a little bit

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.372
nerve wracking, but I'm gonna try not to be
crazy up in front of you.

00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:22.700
Yeah, my name is Paolo Bacigalupi [laughs].
That's--and yeah, I live in a w—-small town

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.390
in Western Colorado. I've been writing for
about 15 years. And while this is my first

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.490
novel that's sold, it's not actually my first
novel.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:42.110
I originally started writing when I was about
23 years old. And I was sure that I was gonna

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.200
be some wunderkind amazing writer who'd have
my first novel sold by 25 and I'd be rich

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.959
and famous and all these other things.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.250
And so I--I actually did quit my day job when
I was 23 to--to sit down and write my first

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.069
novel. And I told everybody I was gonna do
it, because I didn't want to back out. I was

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.830
gonna write this novel and I quit my job and
I did all this research and I wrote this novel

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.470
and I got myself an agent.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.079
And we sent it out to publishers and it was
promptly rejected by everyone. And I thought,

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.019
"Well, okay. That's—-that's fine. That's--that's
my first novel. I'm gonna try again here though,

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.689
'cause I think I've learned some things this
time around." And so I wrote another novel,

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.799
and I sent it to my agent and he sent it out
to all these publishers. And they all rejected

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:25.799
it again.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.450
And-and so at that point I thought, "Well,
okay. Now I've definitely learned some stuff."

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.879
And--and so I sat down and I wrote another
novel. And each one of these takes me about

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.650
a year, a year-and-a-half to write. And--and
so I'd written another novel. And I’m getting

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.599
halftime jobs on the side and stuff, and my
wife is like being really supportive but also

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.321
like trying to believe that I'm not crazy.

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.450
[audience laughter]

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.900
Paolo: And--and I write that third novel.
And--and I--I write it. I sent it to my agent.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.990
And this one my agent actually rejects out
of hand. He just says, "This is crap."

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.630
[audience laughter]

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.090
Paolo: Okay, so now I think I'm really--I--I'm
learning here. I was try, fail, learn, try,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.030
fail, learn. Okay. And so then I sit down
and I go, "Okay. I can--I can do this. I'm

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.659
gonna write another novel." And-and I do.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.819
And I write my fourth novel. And I sent it
my—-to my agent, and he gets really excited.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.440
He's like, "This I can sell." And he sends
it out to all the publishers, and they all

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.910
reject it again. And so at that point I know
I'm crazy. Even though my wife hasn't told

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.670
me I'm crazy, I know I'm crazy.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.790
And-and I really can't take the--the idea
of being rejected anymore. And I really can't

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.850
stand the idea of writing for a year-and-a-half
to write a novel that's gonna fail anyway.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.660
And so I started writing short fiction instead.
I still liked writing, but I just--the--the--that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.940
process of--of putting everything in and then
seeing nothing come out was just--just too

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.940
much.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.200
So I started writing short fiction instead
and--and figured, "Well, I guess writing's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.330
gonna be a hobby. I'm not gonna be anything
at all, but that's fine. And [laughs]-

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.330
[audience laughter]

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.730
Paolo: -at least I get to write. And writing
makes me less crazy than when I'm not writing.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.980
So I--I started writing short fiction. And
everything sort of changed for me at that

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.881
point. The first story that I wrote after
that was called The Fluted Girl and it was

00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.290
selected in Science Fiction for several different
years' best anthologies.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.810
The next story that I wrote after that was
called The People of Sand and Slag, and it

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.730
was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards.
The story after that was The Calorie Man.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.660
And that one won the Theodore Sturgeon Award
for best science fiction short story of the

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.590
year, as well as being nominated for the Hugo
Award.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.030
And it kind of kept going like that. And so
suddenly I started thinking, "Wow, maybe I'm

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.200
not crazy after all. I should write another
novel [laughs]."

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.630
[audience laughter]

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.560
Paolo: And--and this time I was like, "I really
have learned some things. I'm gonna write

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.220
this in a year. I know what I'm doing." And--and
so I sat down and I started working. And I

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.330
started to build out this story.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.820
And the more I worked on the story, the bigger
it got. And so one year became two years,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:05.200
and two years became three years. And I suddenly
had this monster of a novel that oh, had gone

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.020
off in all sorts of different directions.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.580
And when I finished it, or sort of finished
it, I was--I was actually thinking, "This

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.870
book needs to die. This is bad. This is really
bad, and I know how to fix it though." And

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.360
my wife is like, "No, don't touch it. You
can't touch it, send it out."

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.820
And so I sent it out, and my agent took it.
And--and she sent it out to publishers. And

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.800
every single one of them rejected it again-

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.500
[audience laughter]

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.600
Paolo: -except for th--this time there was
a small press publisher in San Francisco called

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.790
Nightshade Books. And where there hadn't been
that kind of a resource before, Nightshade

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.790
was willing to take a risk on a dark dystopic
science fiction novel about crushing environmental

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.440
issues, and--and say that that was actually
worthwhile to publish.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:07:00.560
And--and I think much to all of our surprise
it actually started to sell. And [laughs]

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.050
what--what was interesting to me about that
is like writing science fiction almost automatically

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.000
in--in commercial sense is a bad idea. And
you know that because any time you walk up

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.490
to anyone on the street and say, "Hey, I write
science fiction," they say, "Step the fuck

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.490
away."

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.490
[audience laughter]

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.270
Paolo: [Laughs]And--did I just say that on
streaming? Shit. [laughs]

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.470
[audience laughter]

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.680
Paolo: And--and science fiction just isn't
respected. Science fiction, when you say the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.741
word science fiction people already look at
you and say, "I don't read science fiction."

00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:30.691
You say, "Well, but there's good stuff in
science fiction. There's really interesting

00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:31.901
ideas here in science fiction."

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:37.591
And--and what you find is you've got that
wash of the assumptions about science fiction

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:43.210
are oh you write Star Trek, oh you write Star
Wars, oh maybe you write Avatar, Aliens, something

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.650
like that. Or even worse it's Barbarella.
And it's rocket ships and old amazing stories

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.300
babes on the covers and scantily clad. And
that's sort of what science fiction means

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.300
to people.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.780
And--and it's really weird, because to me
science fiction is--is--is so much more than

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.830
that. And I'd actually like to read something
from my short story collection actually, that

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:15.930
sort of illustrates a little bit of what I
think is interesting about science fiction.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:23.440
And this is from a story of mine called Pop
Squad. And I'm sorry for all of you who are

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.510
eating at the moment.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.170
[audience laughter]

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.680
Paolo: The familiar stench of unwashed bodies,
cooked food, and shit washes over me as I

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.830
come through the door. Cruiser lights flicker
through the blinds, sparkling in rain and

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.539
illuminating the crime scene with strobes
of red and blue fire. A kitchen. A humid mess.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.500
A chunky woman huddles in the corner, clutching
closed her nightgown. Fat thighs and swaying

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.120
breasts under stained silk. Squad goons crowding
her, pushing her around, making her sit, making

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.880
her cower. Another woman, young-looking, pretty
but pregnant and black-haired, is slumped

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.339
against the opposite wall, her blouse spackled
with spaghetti remains. Screams from the next

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:06.079
room: kids.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:10.390
I squeeze my fingers over my nose and breathe
through my mouth, fighting off nausea as Pentle

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.680
wanders in, holstering his Grange. He sees
me and tosses me a nosecap. I break it and

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.160
snort lavender until the stink slides off.
Children come scampering in with Pentle, a

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.050
brood of three tangling around his knees--the
screamers from the other room. They gallop

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.199
around the kitchen and disappear again, screaming
still, into the living room where data sparkles

00:09:29.199 --> 00:09:33.470
like fairy dust on the wallscreens and provides
what is likely their only connection to the

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.470
outside world.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.670
"That's everyone," Pentle says. He's got a
long skinny face and a sour small mouth that

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:45.060
always points south. Weights seem to hang
off his cheeks. Fat caterpillar brows droop

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.240
over his eyes. He surveys the kitchen, mor--mouth
corners dragging lower. It's always depressing

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.029
to come into these scenes. "Well, they were
all inside when we broke down the door."

00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:01.709
I nod absently as I shake monsoon water from
my hat. "Great, thanks." Liquid beads scatter

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:05.200
on the floor, joining puddles of wet from
the pop squad along with the maggot debris

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.579
of the spaghetti dinner. I put my hat back
on. Water still manages to drip off the brim

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:15.110
and slip under my collar, a slick rivulet
of discomfort. Someone closes the door to

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:20.580
the outside. The shit smell--smell thickens,
eggy and humid. The nosecap barely holds it

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.990
off. Old peas and bits of cereal crunch under
my feet. They squish with the spaghetti, the

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.749
geologic glares of past feedings. The kitchen
hasn't been self-cleaned in years.

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:35.550
The older woman coughs and pulls her nightgown
tighter around her cellulite and I wonder,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.060
as I always do when I come into situations
like this, what made her choose this furtive

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.470
nasty life of rotting garbage and brief illicit
forays into daylight. The pregnant girl seems

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.290
to have slipped even further into herself
since I arrived. She just stares into space.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.600
You'd have to touch her pulse to know that
she's alive. It amazes me that women end up

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.589
like this, seduced so far down into gutter
life that they arrive here, fugitives from

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:02.819
everyone who would have kept them and held
them and loved them and let them see the world

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:04.139
outside.

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:08.769
The children run in from the living room again,
playing chase: a blond, no more than five;

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:13.730
another, younger and with brown braids, topless
and in makeshift diapers, less than three;

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.120
and a knee-high toddler boy, scrap diaper
bunched around his little muscle thighs, wearing

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.230
a T-shirt stained with tomato sauce that says
"Who's the Cutest?" The T-shirt would be an

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.839
antique if it wasn't stained.

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.999
"You need anything else?" Pentle asks. He
wrinkles his nose as new reek wafts from the

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:31.600
direction of the kids.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.999
"You get photos for the prosecutor?"

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:37.709
"Got 'em." Pentle holds out a digicam and
thumbs through the images of the ladies and

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:42.050
three--and the three children, all of them
staring out from the screen like little smeared

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.819
dolls. "Do you want me to take 'em in now?"

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:49.269
I look over the women. The kids have run out
again. From the other room, their howls echo

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:55.459
as they chase around. Their shrieks are piercing.
Even from a distance they hurt my head. "Yeah,

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:57.610
I'll deal with the kids."

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.970
Pentle gets the women up off the floor and
shuffles out the door, leaving me standing

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.339
alone in the middle of the kitchen. It's all
so familiar: a typical floor plan from Builders

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:11.850
United. Custom undercab lighting, a black
mirror tile on the floors, clever self-clean

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.389
nozzles hidden behind deco trim lines. It's
all so much like the stuff Alice and I have

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:21.420
that I can almost forget where I am. It's
a negative image of our apartment's kitchen:

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:28.140
light vs. dark, clean vs. dirty, quiet vs.
loud. The same floor plan, everything in it

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:35.499
the same, and yet nothing is. It's archeological.
I can look at the layers of gunk and grime

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:39.529
and noise and see what must have underlain
it before, when these people worried about

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:41.550
color coordinating and classy appliances.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.680
I opened the fridge (smudgefree nickel, how
practical, hmm). Ours contains pineapples

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.110
and avocados and endive and corn and coffee
and Brazil nuts from Angel Spire's hanging

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:58.290
gardens. This one holds a shelf cluttered
with ground mycoprotein bars and wadded piles

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.110
of nutreshen--nutrition supplement sacs like
the kind they hand out at government reju

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:07.040
clinics. Other than a bag of slimy lettuce,
there isn't anything unprocessed in the fridge

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.379
at all. No vegetables except in powder jars,
ditto for fruit. A stack of self-warming dinner

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:16.351
bins for fried rice and laap and spaghetti
just like the one still lying on the kitchen

00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:20.100
table in a puddle of its own sauce, and that's
it.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.670
I close the fridge and straighten. Here's
somethin' here in the mess and the screaming

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.209
in the next room and the reek of the one kid's
poopy pants, but I'm stumped as to what it

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:33.911
is. They could have lived up in the light
in the air. And instead, they hid in the dark

00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:39.709
under wet jungle canopy and turned pale and
gave up their lives.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:43.779
The kids raced back in, chasing each other
all in a train, laughing and shrieking. They

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:48.910
stop and look around, surprised, maybe that
their moms have disappeared. The littlest

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:55.380
one has a stuffed dinosaur by the nose. It's
got a long green neck and a fat body. A brontosaurus,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:02.050
I think, with big cartoony eyes and black
felt lashes. It's funny about the dinosaur,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:08.240
because they've been gone so long, but here
one is, showing up as a stuffed toy. And then

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.399
it's funny again, because when you think about
it, a dinosaur toy is really extinct twice.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:17.019
"Sorry kids, mommy's gone."

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:22.259
I pull out my Grange. Their heads kick back
in successive jerks, bang bang bang down the

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:26.379
line, holes appearing on their foreheads like
paint and their brains spattering out the

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:31.699
back. Their bodies flip and skid on the black
mirror floor. They land in jumbled piles of

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:36.309
misaligned limbs. For a second, gunpowder
burn makes the stench bearable.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.269
[pause]

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:48.660
Paolo: All right. So the thing I like about
science fiction is the opportunity to take

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:55.889
what looks normal and then to twist it, to--to
take an idea and stretch it out into some

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:59.829
unreasonable place where you think that the
world is going to be safe and stable, and

00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:04.309
then to rip the floor out from underneath
you and drop you into something else.

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:08.319
Ideally that process is a bit like stretching
a rubber band. You pull somebody out into

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:12.180
a different world, and then you let the rubber
band snap. And when people come back to this

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.560
world they're going to look at our pl--our
place now, the present, with a different lens

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.671
as well. And that's really the thing that
excites me about science fiction.

00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:24.649
And it's a tool in science fiction that you
really don't get to use in another genre or

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:29.569
any other style. It's what science fiction
does best and it's what I love. So despite

00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:33.050
the fact that science fiction is sort of scorned,
this is the place where I get to play with

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.470
the tools that give me an opportunity to talk
about the world in some really interesting

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.470
ways.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:46.889
The--the--the thing I'm sort of looking for
is that opportunity to help people see what

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:53.519
they thought was normal is abnormal. And the--the
best personal description I have of this is

00:15:53.519 --> 00:16:00.589
a time when I was a--a--I was a student in
China. I'd gone over to China to study Chinese.

00:16:00.589 --> 00:16:02.290
I'd done an immersion program.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:07.472
And while I was over there I spent, I guess
about six months. And I came back to the states.

00:16:07.472 --> 00:16:11.870
And I was at my college and I was sitting
out in the--in the quad, in the park. And

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.800
there's trees and everything. And it was really
beautiful. And it was like the first time

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.059
I'd been around greenery in a long time, it
was really beautiful.

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:23.740
Except for that there were all these rats
running around in the--in the quad. And--and

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.470
I kept looking around at all these rats. And
I saw them and there's a rat and there's a

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.829
rat and there's another rat. And nobody else
seems to care at all that there are these

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:34.589
rats running everywhere. And then I suddenly
realized they were squirrels.

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:35.949
[audience laughter]

00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:40.990
Paolo: [laughs]And--and I was--and then I
was like they're squirrels. Okay, they're

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.389
squirrels. And I am still thinking, "Do people
really let these rodents run around [audience

00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:49.160
laughter], really? Why do they feel okay with
this? Why don't they kill them? Why don't

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.050
they--I mean, this has to be bad."

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.709
And it was that moment where the place I'd
been for a while didn't have squirrels running

00:16:56.709 --> 00:17:00.619
around, and so they just disappeared as a--as
a natural element of what we consider our

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.490
sort of pseudo natural urban surroundings.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:09.630
And so coming back into that suddenly that
was alien. And--and so normal became alien

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.130
and--and that's the moment when you can actually
start looking at the--our customs and habits

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:18.290
and saying, "Well, why do we do this? Why
do we live this way? Why do we have this kind

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.580
of a world?" And all things can be up for
grabs and all things can be questioned. I

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.730
think that's really interesting.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.220
The other thing that I'm really interested
in, in science fiction, is the process of

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:36.130
extrapolation. And for me the--the quote that
sort of sums that up is William Gibson's comment

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:42.100
that "the future is here, it's just not evenly
distributed", which I love.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.780
And being in some place like Google where
you guys are actively sitting around in your

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.711
computers building the next ver--iteration
of the future that's going to be evenly distributed,

00:17:50.711 --> 00:17:54.130
or more evenly distributed, is really interesting
to me.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:18:00.030
You guys are seeing nodes of future that could
come into being. And--and in science fiction

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.360
that--that idea is really powerful. And so
I’m really interested in looking at--at

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.900
little data nodes and sort of saying, "Well,
if this is the future that's becoming more

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.250
evenly distributed what does that more evenly
distributed look like?"

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.100
And so that applies to all sorts of things.
I think about like sort of cell phone networks

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.160
in Japan and what cell phone culture looks
like in Japan, and does that become more evenly

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.220
distributed? You look at something like the
iPad coming out and you say, "Oh, is this

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.371
gonna be more evenly distributed?"

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:31.310
But there are other kinds of interesting aspects
of that too, because you can look at something

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.430
like the country of Afghanistan and say, "Oh,
here's a place where the future hasn't been

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.320
evenly distributed." You know, women's rights
are severely curtailed, life spans are short.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.930
There's all sorts of parts of our future that
theoretically could be more evenly distributed

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.190
over there.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.270
The thing about that is that it also demands
that we sort of understand what the narrative

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:59.020
is. That we understand that--which data points
are creating the dominant narrative, and that

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.250
we understand where the story lines are going.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.230
If I'm George Bush and I say that democracy
is an ascendant storyline for the last 250

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.080
years, then applying it in Iraq makes a lot
of sense because I know the storyline. This

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:21.610
is democracy. Democracy goes everywhere. But
if we look at that from another lens, if I

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:28.260
go back and I look at something like--like
Afghanistan or like Bangladesh. Bangladesh

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.310
is really interesting to me.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:34.640
If I look at a place where there's resource
scarcity and I'm looking at a country that's

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.190
dealing with resource scarcity, then I start
to wonder well what does resource scarcity

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.511
look? And if resource scarcity is the story,
it's going to become more evenly distributed.

00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:47.500
What does that tell us also about other kinds
of cultural imports? Do we become more and

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.810
more set in our ways as there's more scarcity?
Do we fight up against each other more?

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.460
Is there some point where Republicans Dem--and
Democrats take to the streets and just shoot

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.490
each other because we just stopped getting
along at some point and we want to take the

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:04.810
territory? Those are the kinds of things that
I sort of spin out in my head and I ask, "Well,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.520
what story is gonna be the dominant one?"

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.000
When I look at some place like Bangladesh--I--I
was just recently became enamored of ship

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.750
breaking yards, the Chittagong Ship-breaking
Yards. And if you've never seen these, these

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.110
are amazing.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:22.040
There's a photographer named Edward Burtynsky
who's taken some fantastic photos of this.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.080
And there's actually a film called Manufactured
Landscapes which documents some of this. And-and

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.860
you see a landscape of--of where our stuff
goes to die.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.760
But what you also see is that Bangladesh isn't
just--just the place where we're dumping these

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.500
things because they've got crummy labor laws,
and crummy environmental controls. The other

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.450
thing is, is that for--for Bangladesh ships
are a resource. They aren't recycling those

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.040
ships, they're mining them.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.880
And that's really interesting. I think, "Oh,
there's something that tells me about resource

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.860
scarcity." Is here our--our manufactured objects
are resources. So what does that look like

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.380
down the road? If resources are scarce, what
do we do with our resources and how do we

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.830
treat them? And what does Bangladesh have
to tell me about what would an America look

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.650
like with a resource scarcity problem?

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:14.500
So there are things like that that I'm really
interested in. But again it just kind of keeps

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.690
bunk--back--keeps coming back to that question
of what data points we like to look at. And

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.330
so in science fiction I'm sort of a--I'm sort
of an outlier, because not many people are

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:29.640
particularly interested in writing in sort
of environmental issues. But that doesn't

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.480
really make me right, it just marks me sort
of one line of thought.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.270
And so what you'll see is that science fiction
will touch on anything. Robert Sawyer's gonna

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.920
write about a different set of storylines
and data points than Charlie Strauss is gonna

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.120
write a different set of data sets--data points
than Neal Stephenson. You're going to see

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.681
that divergence of what we look at.

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:50.110
And we're all sort of feeling the elephant
blind. I'm grabbing onto the leg and claiming

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.620
that this is really a tree that we're looking
at in the future. And somebody else is grabbing

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.420
the trunk and claiming it's a snake. And good
luck, we're trying to figure that out.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:06.490
But one of the things that's really interesting
to me about how we go about looking at those

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:16.210
trends is that--well, okay. [Heavy sigh]I
guess when I--I tend to look at a certain

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.600
set of data points that don't seem to show
up in the news a lot. I guess that's the thing.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.750
And--and a lot of those data points tend to
be about distributed sort of topics, or distributed

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.610
issues.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.510
I'm really interested in why is this small,
furry mouse in the Sierras going extinct?

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.941
And it's not gonna get a lot of news and so
it's not a big data point.

00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:39.040
And I’m trying to figure out whether or
not that data is actually maybe the most telling

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.870
piece of information about where we're going.
More telling than North Korea and South Korea

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:49.390
getting into a huge fight, more important
than whether or not the iPhone OS or Android

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.170
OS is gonna win, more--more telling than any
of those things.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:00.851
And--but it's interesting that we--we sort
of have a hard time looking at those. I'm

00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:06.210
gonna read another section here. This is from
a short story called The Tamarisk Hunter.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.240
[pause]

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:17.580
Let's see--yeah, if I can find it right--sorry.
All right.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.650
[Heavy sigh]

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.900
A big tamarisk can suck 73,000 gallons of
river water a year. For $2.88 a day, plus

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.210
water bounty, Lolo rips tamarisk all winter
long.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.190
Ten years ago, it was a good living. Back
then, tamarisk shoulder up--shouldered up

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.120
against ever riverbank in the Colorado River
Basin, along with cottonwoods, Russian olives,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.730
and elms. Ten years ago, towns like Grand
Junction and Moab though they could still

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.540
squeeze life from a river.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.160
Lolo stands on the edge of a canyon, Maggie
the camel his only companion. He stares down

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.910
into the deeps. It's an hour's scramble to
the bottom. He ties Maggie to a juniper and

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:58.460
starts down, boot-skiing a gully. A few blades
of green grass sprout neon around him, piercing

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.750
juniper--tagged snow clods.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.540
In the later winter, there's just a beginning
surge of water down in the deeps; the ice

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.790
is off the river edges. Up high, the mountains
still wear their ragged mantles of snow. Lolo

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.560
smears through mud and hits a channel of scree,
sliding and scattering rocks.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.390
His jugs of tamarisk poison gurgle and slosh
on his back. His shovel and rockbar snag on

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:23.160
occasional junipers as he skids by. It'll
be a long hike out. But then, that's what

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.300
makes this patch so perfect. It's a long way
down, and the riverbanks are largely hidden.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.350
It's a living; where other people have dried
out and blown away, he has remained: a tamarisk

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.290
hunter, a water tick, a stubborn bit of weed.
Everyone else has blown off the land as surely

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.390
as dandelion seeds, set free to fly south
or east.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.710
Or most of all north to where watersheds sometimes
still run deep and where even if there's no

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:52.340
more lush ferns or deep fish--deep cold fish
runs, at least there's still water for people.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:58.980
Eventually, Lolo reaches the canyon bottom.
Down in the cold shadows, his breath steams.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.260
He pulls out a digital camera and starts shooting
his proof. The Bureau of Reclamation has gotten

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.310
uptight about proof. They want different angles
on the offending tamarisk, they want each

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.290
one photographed before and after, the whole
press--process documented, GPS'd and uploaded

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.220
directly by the camera. And they want it done
on-site. And then they still sometimes come

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.170
out to spot check before they calibrate his
headgate for water bounty.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.460
But all their due diligence can't protect
them from the likes of Lolo. Lolo has found

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.360
the secret to eternal life as a tamarisk hunter.
Unknown to the Interior Department and its

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.240
BuRec subsidiary, he's been seeding new patches
of tamarisk, encouraging visher--vigorous

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.220
brushy groves in previously cleared areas.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.290
He has hauled and planted healthy root balls
up and down the river system in strategically

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.850
hidden and inaccessible corridors, all in
a bid for security against the swarms of other

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:53.240
tamarisk hunters that scour these same tributaries.
Lolo is crafty. Stands like this one, a quarter-mile

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.460
long and thick with salt-laden tamarisk are
his insurance policy.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.230
[Music plays]

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.150
Documentation finished, he unshafts a folding
saw [laughs], along with his rockbar and shovel,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.390
and sets his poison jugs on the dead salt
bank. He starts cutting, slicing into the

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:12.310
roots of the tamarisk, pausing every thirty
seconds to spread Garlon 4 on the cuts, poisoning

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:17.680
the tamarisk wounds faster than they can heal.
But some of the best tamarisk, the most vigorous,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.750
he uproots and sets aside for later use.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:25.260
$2.88 a day, plus water bounty.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.380
It takes Maggie's b--rolling bleating camel
stride a week to make it back to Lolo's homestead.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.360
They follow the river, occasionally climbing
above it onto cold mesas or wandering off

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.020
into the open desert in a bid to avoid the
skeleton sprawl of emptied towns.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.390
Guardie choppers buzz up and down the river
like swarms of angry yellowjackets, hunting

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.910
for porto-pumpers and wildcat diversions.
They rush overhead in a wash of beaten air

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.930
and gleaming National Guard logos.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.350
Lolo remembers a time when the guardies traded
potshots with people down on the riverbanks,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.940
tracer-fire and machine-gun chatter echoing
in the canyons. He remembers the glorious

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.080
hiss and arc of a Stinger missile as it flashed
across redrock desert and blue sky and burned

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.560
a chopper where it hovered.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:09.760
But that's long in the past. Now, guardie
patrols skim up the river unmolested. Lolo

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.570
tops another mesa and stares down at the familiar
landscape of an eviscerated town, its curving

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.390
streets and subdivision cul-de-sacs all sitting
silent in the sun.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.910
At the very edge of the empty town, one-acre
ranchettes and snazzy five-thousand-square-foot

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.650
houses with dead-stick trees and dust-hill
landscaping fringe a brown tumbleweed golf

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.450
course. The sandtraps don't even show anymore.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.940
When California put its first calls on the
river, no one really worried. A couple towns

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.150
went begging for water. Some idiot newcomers
with bad water rights stopped grazing their

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:46.680
horses, and that was it. A few years later,
people started showering real fast. And a

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.460
few after that, they showered once a week.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.580
And then people started using the buckets.
By then, everyone had stopped joking about

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.740
how "hot" it was. It didn't really matter
how "hot" it was. The problem wasn't lack

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:03.500
of water or an excess of heat, not really.
The problem was that 4.4 million acre-feet

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.080
of water were supposed to go down the river
to California. There was water; they just

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.390
couldn't touch it.
They were supposed to stand there like dumb

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.610
monkeys and watch it flow on by.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.610
"Lolo?"

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.520
The voice catches him by surprise. Maggie
startles and groans and lunges for the mesa

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.080
edge before Lolo can rein her around. The
camel's great padded feet scuffle dust and

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.350
Lolo flails for his shotgun where it nestles
in a scabbard at the camel's side. He forces

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.420
Maggie to turn, shotgun half-drawn, barely
holding onto his seat and swearing.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.650
A familiar face, tucked amongst the juniper
tangle. "Goddamnit!" Lolo lets the shotgun

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.770
drop back into its scabbard. "Jesus Christ,
Travis. You scared the hell out of me."

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.370
Travis grins. He emerges from amongst the
juniper's silver bark rags, one hand on his

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:51.820
gray fedora, the other on the reins as he
guides his mule out of the trees. "Surprised?"

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.330
"I coulda shot you!"

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.330
"Oh, don't be so jittery. There's no one out
here 'cept us water ticks."

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.830
"Yeah, that's what I thought the last time
I went shopping down there. I had a whole

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.490
set of new dishes for Annie and I broke them
all when I ran into an ultralight parked right

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.580
in the middle of the main drag."

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.910
"Meth flyers?"

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.490
"Beats the hell out of me. I didn't stick
around to ask."

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.000
"Shit. I'll bet they were as surprised as
you were."

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.550
"They almost killed me."

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.070
"Well, I guess they didn't."

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.300
Lolo shakes his head and swears again, this
time without anger. Despite the ambush, he's

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.580
happy to run into Travis. It's lonely country,
and Lolo's been out long enough to notice

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.600
the silence of talking to Maggie.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.730
They trade ritual sips of water from their
canteens and make camp together. They swap

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.060
stories about BuRec and avoid discussing where
they've been ripping tamarisk and enjoy the

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.260
view of the empty town far below, with its
serpentine streets and quiet houses and shining

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.890
untouched river.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.740
It isn't until the sun is setting and they've
finished roasting a magpie that Lolo finally

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.650
asks the question that's been on his mind
ever since Travis's sun-baked face came out

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:55.120
of the tangle. It goes against etiquette,
but he can't help himself. He picks magpie

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.640
out of his teeth and says, "I thought you
were workin' downriver."

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:05.050
Travis glances sidelong at Lolo. And in that
one suspicious uncertain look, Lolo sees that

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:10.940
Travis has hit a lean patch. He's not smart
like Lolo. He hasn't been reseeding. He's

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.210
got no insurance. He hasn't been thinkin'
about the head about all the competition,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.900
and what the tamarisk endgame looks like,
and now he's feelin' the pinch.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.830
Lolo feels a twinge of pity. He likes Travis.
A part of him even wants to tell Travis the

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:30.190
secret, but he stifles the urge. The stakes
are too high. Water crimes are serious now,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:34.830
so serious Lolo hasn't even told his wife,
Annie, for fear of what she'll say. Like of

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:39.260
the most shameful crimes, water theft is a
private business, and at the scale Lolo works,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.610
forced labor on the Straw is the best punishment
he can hope for.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:48.840
Travis gets his hackles down over Lolos invasion
of his privacy and says, "I had a couple of

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.960
cows I was runnin' up here, but I lost 'em.
I think something got 'em."

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.600
"It's a long way to graze cows."

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.180
"Yeah, well, down my way even the sagebrush
is dead. Big Daddy Drought's doin' a real

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.360
number on my patch." He pinches his lip, thoughtful.
"I wish I could find those cows."

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.480
"Oh, they probably went down to the river."

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.230
Travis sighs. "Well, then the guardies probably
got 'em."

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.800
"Probably shot 'em from a chopper and roasted
'em."

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.210
"Californians."

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.270
They both spit at the word.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.470
[audience laughter]

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:23.150
The sun continues to sink. Shadows fall across
the town's silent structures. Rooptop-rooftops

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:27.240
gleam ruby, a red cluster decorating the blue
river necklace.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.680
"You think there's any stands worth pullin'
down there?" Travis asks.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.610
"Well, you can go down and look. But I think
I got it all last year. And someone had already

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.260
been there through before me, so I doubt much
is comin' up."

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.060
"Shit. Well, maybe I'll go shopping. Might
as well get somethin' out of this trip."

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.030
"There sure isn't anyone to stop ya'."

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.110
As if to emphasize the fact, the thud-thwap
of a guardie chopper breaks the evening silence.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.650
The black-fly dot of its movement barely shows
against the darkening sky. Soon it's outta

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.510
sight and trick--cricket chirps swallow the
last evidence of its passing.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.240
Travis sighs. "Remember when the guardies
said they'd keep out the looters? I saw them

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.020
on TV with all their choppers and Humvees
and them all saying they were gonna protect

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.550
everything until the situation improved."
He laughs again. "You remember that? All of

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.000
them drivin' up and down the streets?"

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.250
"I remember."

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.721
"Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't have fought
'em more."

00:32:17.721 --> 00:32:23.950
"Annie was at Lake Havasu City when they fought
there. You saw what happened." Lolo shivers.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.850
"Anyway, there's not much to fight for once
they blow up your water treatment plant. If

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.880
nothin's comin' outta your faucet we might
as--you might as well move on."

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.770
"Yeah. Well sometimes I think you still gotta
fight, even if it's just for pride." Travis

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.300
gestures at the town below, a shadow movement.
"I remember when all that land down there

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.750
was sellin' like hotcakes and they were buildin'
shit as fast as they could to ship in the

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:49.770
lumber. Shoppin' malls and parking lots and
subdivisions, anywhere you could scrape a

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.140
flat spot."

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.910
"Yeah. Well, we weren't callin' it Big Daddy
Drought, back then."

00:32:54.910 --> 00:33:00.850
"Forty-five thousand people. And none of us
had a clue. And I was a real estate agent."

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:05.750
Travis laughs, a self-mocking sound that ends
quickly. It sounds too much like self-pity

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:11.340
for Lolo's taste. They're quiet again, looking
down at the town wreckage.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.310
"I think I might be headin' north," Travis
says finally.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.840
Lolo glances over, surprised. Again he has
the urge to let Travis in on his secret, but

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.570
he stifles it. "And do what?"

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:26.710
"I dunno, pick fruit maybe. Maybe somethin'
else. Anyway, there's water up there."

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.050
Lolo points down at the river. "There's water."

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:36.400
"Not for us." Travis pauses. "I-I got to level
with you, Lolo. I went down to the Straw."

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.450
For a second, Lolo is confused by the non
sequitur. The statement is too outrageous.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:46.510
And yet Travis's face is serious. "The Straw?
No kiddin'? All the way down there?"

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.910
"All the way there." He shrugs defensively.
"I wasn't finding any tamarisk, anyway. And

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:56.150
it didn't actually take that long. It's a
lot closer than it used to be. A week out

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.450
to the train tracks, and then I hopped a coal
train, and rode it right to the interstate,

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:00.450
and then I hitched."

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.860
"What's it like out there?"

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.830
"Empty. A trucker told me that California
and the Interior Department drew up all these

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:12.609
plans to decide which cities they'd turn off
when." He looks at Lolo significantly. "That

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:17.609
was after Lake Havasu. They figured they had
to do it slow. Worked out some kind of formula:

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:21.450
how many cities, how many people they could
evaporate at a time without ta--making too

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:25.359
much unrest. Got advice from the Chinese,
from when they were shuttin' down all their

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:30.299
old communist factories. Anyway, it looks
like they're pretty much done with it. There's

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:34.509
nothin' movin' out there except highway trucks
and coal trains and a couple truck stops."

00:34:34.509 --> 00:34:35.509
"And you saw the Straw?"

00:34:35.509 --> 00:34:41.730
"Oh Sure, I saw it. Out toward the border.
Big old mother. So big you couldn't climb

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:46.950
on top of it, flopped out on the desert like
a damn silver snake. All the way to California."

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:48.369
He spits reflexively.

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:51.669
"They're spraying with concrete to keep water
from seeping into the ground and they've got

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:56.519
some kind of carbon-fiber stuff over this
top to stop the evaporation. And the river,

00:34:56.519 --> 00:35:02.109
it just disappears inside. Nothin' but an
empty canyon below, bone-dry. And choppers

00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:06.230
and Humvees everywhere, like a goddamn hornets'
nest. They wouldn't let me get any closer

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.869
than a half a mile on account of the eco-crazies
trying to blow it up. They weren't nice about

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:11.220
it either."

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.319
"Well, what did you expect?"

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:17.779
"I dunno, it sure depressed me, though. They
work us out here and toss us a little water

00:35:17.779 --> 00:35:22.640
bounty and then all that water next year goes
right down that big old pipe. Some Californian's

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.049
probably fillin' his swimmin' pool with last
year's water bounty right now."

00:35:27.049 --> 00:35:32.009
Cricket-song pulses in the darkness. Off in
the distance, a pack of coyotes starts yipping.

00:35:32.009 --> 00:35:36.730
The two of them are quiet for a while. Finally,
Lolo chucks his friend on the shoda--shoulder.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.990
"Ah hell Travis, it's probably for the best.
A desert's a stupid place to put a river,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:46.349
anyway."

00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:57.499
So, that sort of future doesn't have to exist.
It's based on an extrapolation of the way

00:35:57.499 --> 00:36:04.450
that we currently run water rights. And some
pretty immutable laws about how water is organized.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.839
Phoenix has lower water rights than California,
and that's just the way it's going to be.

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:13.019
Theoretically with water rights when there's
scarcity what happens is the least important

00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:16.920
holder of the water right will lose their
right so that the next most important holder

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.050
can get all of their right. And so there's
a cascade of people getting--having their

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.650
water turned off. And you see that happening
in major drought times.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.839
The thing that's interesting is that Lake
Powell and Lake Mead are having a hard time

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:34.130
refilling right now. The Colorado River Basin
is having a hard time refilling itself right

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:39.940
now, even as our population's increased. We
are moving towards scarcity. And how we decide

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.730
to adapt to that is sort of up for grabs.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:48.900
The thing that's interesting is that that
hasn't stopped Phoenix from growing. It hasn't

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.509
stopped any of us from growing, and it hasn't
stopped us from--from making the assumption

00:36:52.509 --> 00:36:59.160
that we can sort of duck around our essential
resource inputs.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:05.690
And so what I hope--what--what's--what I hope
is that I can write a story that gives a person

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.749
a visceral experience of something that's
actually fairly abstract. We've known for

00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:14.790
a long time that the Lake Powell isn't refilling.
In fact, it's lower every year. But what does

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.660
that mean? It's just abstract. It doesn't
really do anything.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.930
And so I want to run out an extrapolation
that sort of says, well this is kind of what

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:28.390
it looks like. And so that's--that's sort
of my attempt to--to use science fiction to

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:33.610
talk about some specific issues. And--and
to look at a certain set of data points that

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.009
aren't really in the news particularly.

00:37:35.009 --> 00:37:39.269
Oh, what's the water level of Lake Pow--Lake
Powell? Really, who gives a shit? And maybe

00:37:39.269 --> 00:37:43.930
we should, though. And so that's sort of what
I'm interested in.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.609
One of the other sort of interesting data
points that's just kind of come up is the

00:37:47.609 --> 00:37:53.289
Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf, which
isn't really interesting to me as an environmental

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:56.930
tragedy. It's, okay we've got another oil
rig that blew up and whatever.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:04.910
What's really interesting to me actually is
how we as a society react to that data point.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:12.349
And so--because there are things we can extrapolate
from it. And--and the--the thing that really

00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:19.380
strikes me about Deepwater Horizon, that oil
rig, is that it was an ultra-deepwater drill

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.220
rig, which means that it could drill in depths
up to 10,000 feet of water.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:30.339
And it actually set the record for drilling
by drilling down 36,000 feet into the earth.

00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:36.640
It's--it can drill down six miles. And it
can do it in deep water. And you don't build

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:44.450
a drill rig like that. You don't create that
sort of technological gee whiz thing. I mean,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:50.210
this is high tech. And you don't do that unless
all the easy stuff is gone.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:54.539
That's what Deepwater Horizon--the existence
of Deepwater Horizon as an object tells us

00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:59.140
that we're running out of cheap easy access
oil. We're running out of our cheapest, easiest

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.310
energy source. That's what's most interesting
about Deepwater Horizon. It's not that it

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.990
blew up. It's that it exists at all.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:11.569
And--and so that's sort of--when I look at
that, that's--there's a data point there that's

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:14.501
saying something really interesting that we
aren't really grappling with in the news.

00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:19.119
Again, because of it's sort of distributed
kind of intangible nature. What is--what is

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.119
a loss of cheap energy look like?

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:26.530
The other thing that's sort of interesting
to me about Deepwater Horizon is how we interact

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:32.000
with that explosion in terms of we make fun
of it a lot. I've actually been watching the

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.180
Twitter feeds where--there's a couple of awesome
Twitter feeds out there. One of which is--let's

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:42.220
see, let me find it 'cause it-BP Global PR
is the Twitter feed, which is hilarious.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.790
I mean--and this is where they sort of pretend
to be the-the CEOs of BP ad make all sorts

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:51.230
of snide comments like, "We think the ocean
looks slimmer in bap--in black," [audience

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.960
laughter]and things like that. And it's--it's
awesome. It's a--a lotta--a lot of fun. And

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.380
there's a tag BP Cares, which is a lot of
fun too.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:06.769
The thing is, is we poke fun at them and we
scorn them. But--but basically BP is just

00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:12.049
a dog that we sent out to fetch. And now we're
blaming it because it didn't get the bone.

00:40:12.049 --> 00:40:15.609
I mean basically you send out a dog, you say,
"Go fetch that. Go get that bone." And it

00:40:15.609 --> 00:40:17.660
comes back and you say, "Oh good dog, here's
a treat."

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.721
And that's what we do with BP. We say, "Go
get us some oil. Come back, we'll give you

00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:25.130
some money." And, so they were just doing
what we asked them to do. The fact that they're

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.859
failures at it, well you know that's--that's
when we start scorning them. But we would

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:33.109
have been perfectly happy tossing them little
treats as long as they kept doing it anyway.

00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:34.549
We were trying to send them out.

00:40:34.549 --> 00:40:38.240
And that's another thing that's interesting
is we don’t really engage very well with

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.660
what our supply chains are. Where--where--how
far we reach. We like our--our--our sort of

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.799
consumer objects to not have a history.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:50.739
And right now when we look at Deepwater Horizon,
suddenly the gas in my tank has a history.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:53.791
And what do I do? I actually don't actually
say, "Well, I was sticking gas in my tank,"

00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:58.460
which is asking BP to go hunt there. I actually
just say, "Oh, you suck over there." And that's

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.239
really interesting to me, because I think
we've do that in a lot with our consumer objects.

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:05.520
And it's another one of those sort of hidden
data points about how we engage with our world.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:13.060
If I look at something like the iPad, it's--it's
a historyless object. It--it lacks any--any

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.499
history. I don’t know whether there's lithium
or nickel or copper in there. I don't which

00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:18.210
mines that might have come out of.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:22.230
I don't know anything about the object. It's
supposed to come to me pristine. It's like

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:28.800
virgin birth sort of. And--and--and I'm supposed
to love it just for itself. And then it's

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.710
gonna disappear, and it's not gonna have any--any
afterlife either 'cause I'm not gonna know

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.819
about that either.

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:39.619
And our sort of like--the--I feel like when
I see something like the--the Deepwater Horizon

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:42.790
explosion, for just this brief moment that
we've sort of lifted the curtain and we're

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:47.270
looking at the full extent of our--our supply
chain. Where drilling is happening, what happens,

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.980
people die doing it. And that's actually true
all the time, it's just not a big enough news

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.400
story for us to really care.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.680
The last thing that's really interesting to
me about Deepwater Horizon is how we characterize

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:05.880
it as an environmental t--catastrophe. And--and
this actually goes back to how we look at--at

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.430
data points that might be important to us.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:12.140
And we look at Deepwater Horizon and we say,
"Oh my God, all that oil is washing up on

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.369
all of these wetlands." But the reality is
we were just gonna burn it out our tailpipes

00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:22.020
anyway. So we're just pissed off that we didn't
get to do the polluting.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.020
[audience laughter]

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:29.579
Like, I mean that's it. That's it, they got
to it first. I mean, so they dump it all over

00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:32.869
there. "Goddamn it, I wanted to burn it and
send it into the atmosphere. That's what I

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:35.950
wanted to do. I wanted to use that for global
warming instead of just poisoning some little

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.619
wetland over there. I had a big plan for this."

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:39.859
[audience laughter]

00:42:39.859 --> 00:42:45.519
So, at that moment you--there's this--there's
this thing where you have this weird sort

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:50.499
of response to environmental catastrophe.
We respond really well to point source catastrophes

00:42:50.499 --> 00:42:54.359
like this. We can see it, we can respond to
it, we understand it, we can engage with it.

00:42:54.359 --> 00:42:57.630
We actually probably will eventually plug
that well [laughs].

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.930
[audience laughter]

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.970
But we aren't gonna stick anything in our
tailpipes, not really. And I know that 'cause

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.970
I just got on a plane to fly out to talk to
all of you guys. So like [laughs]-

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:08.970
[audience laughter]

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:12.710
-there's the hypocrisy right there. And so
hating this kind of pollution while sort of

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:17.269
engaging in a daily set of behaviors that
are fundamentally destructive, that's a really

00:43:17.269 --> 00:43:18.819
interesting human capacity that we have.

00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:23.359
And--and that's something that I'm really
interested in my fiction, because I sort of

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:28.690
feel like again, where this spice--space where
the--the catastrophes that face us are distributed.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:34.690
They're not tangible. They're long term. And
they're really unclear. And there's a lot

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.690
of uncertainties in them.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:40.989
And so I hope that when I write science fiction
and sort of look at drought or look at how

00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:46.410
chemicals might disrupt our endocrine systems
and turn us all into stupid people. Or how

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:51.569
agricultural companies with their IP and their-and
terminator genes might actually really change

00:43:51.569 --> 00:43:52.930
the way that we interact with food.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:57.289
But those are ideas that we can spin out and
kind of look at and play with. And maybe interact

00:43:57.289 --> 00:44:02.720
with in a more tangible, visceral way than
we would otherwise.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.590
It's really--that's--and--and so like there's
this point where I--I just sort of have to

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:12.640
say, "Yes, I want my characters to be interesting.
Yes I want my stories to be fascinating and

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.240
gripping. And yes, I actually am this evangelist
banging on my pulpit trying to get people

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.910
to pay attention to some things that are pretty
interesting and fundamental. And that we mostly

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:26.150
spend our time not looking at. And that we
prefer not to."

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:37.460
So anyway, that's pretty much sort of my shtick
[laughs]. So do you have any questions about

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.460
any of this?

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:46.800
moderator: Actually, if you can use the mic,
it's for our YouTube audience, that'd be great.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800
[pause]

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:55.230
male in audience #1: So, it was--it was actually
very interesting what you were saying about

00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:02.390
Deep Horizon. And I was sort of like trying
to think a--as an analogy, kind of Google

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:08.180
and kind of what we do. And one of the things
I was thinking about is Deep Horizon it's

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:14.029
not just that it's the cheapest--or the--all
the cheap oil, sources of oil, are used up

00:45:14.029 --> 00:45:15.609
so we're moving to that.

00:45:15.609 --> 00:45:20.940
It's that even though it's expensive, it really
does it at scale. Right? You can get a lot

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:26.520
of oil out of that thing, which you may not
be able to do in cheaper sources. And I wanted

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.660
to--I wondered if you had thought in kind
of coming here, if you had thought about kind

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:38.880
of Google and kind of what our--what our role
is. How we did--not in oil obviously, but

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.130
with information and etcetera.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:49.569
Paolo: Yeah, I've thought about it. I actually--I--I
actually have these really complicated sort

00:45:49.569 --> 00:45:57.089
of feelings about--about big companies generally.
Because they--they sort of seem to be both

00:45:57.089 --> 00:46:00.279
promise and peril all wrapped in one.

00:46:00.279 --> 00:46:04.210
But yeah, with Google the things that stand
out to me. I mean, on one level you're doing

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:12.700
some really interesting things with sustainability.
On the other hand, Google exists as a commerce

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:18.720
engine basically. It exists off of advertising.
It lubricates consumption.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.900
And if there's anything that we understand
about sort of our impacts on the world, lubricating

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:31.849
consumption is probably bad. And so there's
a certain number of things that you can do

00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:39.200
because you're well financed by my bad buying
habits.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.270
So it's sort of like you're standing in the
middle of that stream of consumption and plucking

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:47.930
out a certain number of fish. But--but at
the same time, that stream of consumption

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:52.529
and--and enabling that stream of consumption
is--is probably leading us in unsustainable

00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:54.349
directions.

00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:58.010
And so I'm not sure if you get to a point
where you can get enough benefit from the

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.900
stream of consumption that you can actually
sort of offset the damage of the extreme of

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:07.950
consumption. So I'm not sure really how you
balance that. That's sort of my quick and

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:08.950
dirty take.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:09.950
[pause]

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:20.819
male in audience #2: Hi, and thank you for
coming. One thought I had about the--just

00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:25.609
what you had described is the stories that
interest you. That--it seems like another

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:30.640
common factor of them is that they're very
slow. They take years to happen, instead of

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.819
happening over the course of a day or a week
or so forth.

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:40.489
And this puts in mind an idea that's been
floating around very recently, which is about

00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:50.390
how people of--in their 40s and 50s think
of urban centers as--as very high crime, because

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.579
in the 70s when they were young, they were
very high crime. But in fact violent crime

00:47:54.579 --> 00:48:00.339
is way lower than it's been since then, yet
we still have these sort of memories of that.

00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:04.349
And so we still treat them as that. And we
helicopter our kids and so forth and so on.

00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:11.880
And so it's like is there a sort of--like
our resource consumption habits. Do they also

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:19.119
sort of follow from our--our childhood experiences
of the world? And what other habits do we

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:26.180
have that can't move forward or get locked
into a--into a mindset from decades past and

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.160
are hard to move forward. Do you have any
thoughts on that?

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.249
Paolo: Yeah, actually I think we--we--especially
in the United States, I sort of feel like

00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:37.489
we--we actually have--we start out with a
really high level comfort level of consumption.

00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:41.529
I’m seeing that in my kid right now, where
he's got a certain number of toys in his room.

00:48:41.529 --> 00:48:45.150
The fact that he has his own room is actually
really interesting too. I mean there's--there's

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:49.850
like these--the things that we take for granted
as just the assumed level of an adequate prosperity.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.009
Not--not crazy prosperity, but an adequate
prosperity are so ingrained in us at this

00:48:54.009 --> 00:48:55.009
point.

00:48:55.009 --> 00:49:01.020
I assume that a decent living is having a
three bedroom home and a small plot of land

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.069
in Paonia, Colorado. I mean, which is exurb
and sprawl and a whole bunch of other things.

00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:10.509
I--I can just go off on that too.

00:49:10.509 --> 00:49:13.829
But--but--but basically, I mean when you grow
up saying that three--three bedrooms is the

00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:20.009
norm, then that means that scaling back is
a really tough thing, because we do perceive

00:49:20.009 --> 00:49:24.970
loss in that. And--and when we grow up with
those assumptions is that's our human right

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.010
essentially. That's really interesting.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.470
And I spent a bunch of time in China. My wife's
family comes from India actually, and so we

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.910
spent a bunch of time over there. And seeing
the--the difference of assumption about what

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:40.320
prosperity looks like and--is really interesting,
because prosperity is really this moving target.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:46.220
It's--it's actually a--it's actually not--not
this absolute thing will make you happy. If

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.930
I just have three bedrooms, that's always
the happiness thing, or if I have one bedroom

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:50.930
that's the happiness thing.

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:56.750
I mean, there's a family that I used to stay
with in China. And they had a--a two bedroom

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.819
apartment that was about the size of my living
room in my current house. And we were all

00:50:00.819 --> 00:50:06.099
packed in there together, but nobody was sitting
around saying, "Oh, life is so hard." They

00:50:06.099 --> 00:50:09.289
were actually hanging out with each other
and being convivial.

00:50:09.289 --> 00:50:14.529
And--and so there was--there was a weird moment
when I went back to our very empty house in

00:50:14.529 --> 00:50:18.460
the United States and thought, "Huh, what
do we do with all this space?" And then my--my

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.769
stepmother at the time was really pissed off
that I was even at the house at all. She felt

00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:24.400
like I was just crowding her too much.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.920
We could be on different levels of the house
and totally different parts. I’m like, "You

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.039
can't even see, hear or smell me. Like really,
I'm so far away. This is like," but she--I

00:50:32.039 --> 00:50:36.359
was still invading her gigantic bubble that
she had for space. And I'm thinking my God,

00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:39.880
I was--I was shoulder--to--shoulder with people
and they weren't bothered by me. Like, and

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.859
here this is like--so yeah, so those habits,
yeah.

00:50:42.859 --> 00:50:47.819
And it makes it hard for us to have a rational
conversation about what--what actual cons--what

00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:51.079
our needs really are. Our needs versus our
wants, and being able to separate those out.

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:55.910
And probably that's really connected to sustainability.
So-

00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:00.970
&gt;&gt; Well, again thank you for coming. And despite
all the talk about need versus want, you should

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:03.019
want to buy this book. It's a--it's an excellent
read.

00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:04.019
[audience laughter]

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:05.019
Paulo: Yeah, so kill more trees for me.

00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:10.839
moderator: Yeah [laughs], and I think you'll
all enjoy it. Paolo Bacigalupi, thank you

00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:11.839
very much for coming to Google.

00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:12.839
Paolo: Thank you.

00:51:12.839 --> 00:51:12.841
