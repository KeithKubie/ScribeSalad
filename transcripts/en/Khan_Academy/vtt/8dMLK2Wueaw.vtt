00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.800
I've talked a lot
about using polynomials

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.525
to approximate functions, but
what I want to do in this video

00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:08.080
is actually show you that
the approximation is actually

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.000
happening.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.690
So right over here-- and I'm
using WolframAlpha for this.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.750
It's a very cool website.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.250
You can do all sorts of crazy
mathematical things on it.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.020
So WolframAlpha.com-- I got this
copied and pasted from them.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.610
I met Steven Wolfram at a
conference not too long ago.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.360
He said yes, you
should definitely

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.660
use WolframAlpha in your videos.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.410
And I said, great.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.914
I will.

00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:28.580
And so that's what
I'm doing right here.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.371
And it's super useful,
because what it does

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:31.786
is-- and we could
have calculated

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.160
a lot of this on
our own, or even

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.493
done it on a graphic calculator.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.410
But you usually can do it just
with one step on WolframAlpha--

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.092
is see how well we can
approximate sine of x using--

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:46.400
you could call it a
Maclaurin series expansion,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.570
or you could call it a
Taylor series expansion--

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.030
at x is equal to 0 using
more and more terms.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.320
And having a good
feel for the fact

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.610
that the more terms we add, the
better it hugs the sine curve.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.110
So this over here in
orange is sine of x.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.640
That should hopefully look
fairly familiar to you.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.450
And in previous
videos, we figured out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.860
what that Maclaurin
expansion for sine of x is.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.260
And WolframAlpha does
it for us as well.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.210
They actually calculate
the factorials.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.884
3 factorial is 6, 5 factorial
is 120, so on and so forth.

00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:23.300
But what's interesting
here is you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.560
can pick how many of
the approximations

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.970
you want to graph.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.820
And so what they did
is if you want just one

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.562
term of the
approximation-- so if we

00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:32.770
didn't have this whole thing.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.610
If we just said that our
polynomial is equal to x,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.914
what does that look like?

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.080
Well, that's going to be
this graph right over here.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.947
They tell us which
term-- how many terms we

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:44.530
used by how many dots there are
right over here, which I think

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.630
is pretty clever.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.790
So this right here, that is the
function p of x is equal to x.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.441
And so it's a very
rough approximation,

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:56.440
although for sine of x,
it doesn't do a bad job.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.830
It hugs the sine curve
right over there.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.580
And then it starts to veer
away from the sine curve again.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.430
You add another term.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.940
So if you have the x minus
x to the third over 6.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.850
So now you have two
terms in the expansion.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.067
Or I guess we should say we
were up to the third-order term,

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.900
because that's how their
numbering the dots.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.151
Because they're not talking
about the number of terms.

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.025
They're talking about
the order of the terms.

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:24.760
So they have one
dot here, because we

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.540
have only one first-degree term.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.360
When we have two
terms here, since we--

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.479
when you do the
expansion for sine of x,

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.020
it doesn't have a
second-degree term.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.670
We now have a third-degree
polynomial approximation.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.270
And so let's look
at the third-degree.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.730
We should look for three dots.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.190
That's this curve
right over here.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.690
So if you just have
that first term,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.320
you just get that straight line.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.490
You add the negative x to
the third over 6 to that x.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.020
You now get a curve
that looks like this.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.730
And notice it starts hugging
sine a little bit earlier.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.270
And it keeps hugging
it a little bit later.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.360
So once again, just
adding that second term

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.710
does a pretty good job.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.720
It hugs the sine
curve pretty well,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.180
especially around
smaller numbers.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.890
You add another term.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.750
And now we're at an order five
polynomial, right over here.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.620
So x minus x to the third over
6 plus x to the fifth over 120.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.580
So let's look for the five dots.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.300
So that's this one right over
here-- one, two, three, four,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.190
five.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.080
So that's this curve
right over here.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.580
And notice it begins hugging
the line a little bit earlier

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.200
than the magenta
version, and it keeps

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.820
hugging it a little bit longer.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.760
Then it flips back up like this.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.330
So it hugged it a
little bit longer.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.770
And you can see I'll keep going.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.330
If you have all these
first four terms,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.640
it gives us a seventh
degree polynomial.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.750
So let's look for the
seven dots over here.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.170
So they come in just like this.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.770
And then once again, it hugs the
curve sooner than when we just

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.310
had the first three terms.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.750
And it keeps hugging the
curve all the way until here.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.890
And then the last one.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.355
If you have all of these
terms up to x to the ninth,

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.230
it does it even more.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.162
You start here.

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:19.870
It hugs the curve
longer than the others.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.550
And goes out.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.300
And if you think about
it, it makes sense,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.830
because what's happening here is
each successive term that we're

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.200
adding to the expansion,
they have a higher degree

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.970
of x over a much, much,
much, much larger number.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.610
So for small x
value-- so when you're

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.420
close to the origin
for small x values,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.820
this denominator is
going to overpower

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.020
the numerator, especially
when you're below 1.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.690
Because when you
take something that

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.280
has absolute value
less than 1 to a power,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.890
you're actually
shrinking it down.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.770
So when you're
close to the origin,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.270
these latter terms
don't matter much.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.760
So you're kind of
not losing some

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.010
of the precision of some
of the earlier terms.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.400
When these tweaking
terms come in,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.180
these come in when
the numerator can

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.980
start to overpower
the denominator.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.070
So this last term, it starts
to become relevant out here,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.080
where all of a sudden x to the
ninth can overpower 362,880.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.220
And the same thing
on the negative side.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.720
So hopefully this
gives you a sense.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.930
We only have one, two,
three, four, five terms here.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.500
Imagine what would
happen if we had

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.642
an infinite number of terms.

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.100
I think you get a
pretty good sense

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.624
that it would kind of hug the
sine curve out to infinity.

00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:39.290
So hopefully that makes you feel
a little bit better about this.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.650
And for fun, you
might want to go type

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.240
in-- you can type in
Taylor expansion at 0

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.830
and sine of x, or Maclaurin
expansion or Maclaurin

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.940
series for sine of x,
cosine of x, e to the x,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.460
at WolframAlpha.com.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.000
And try it out for a bunch
of different functions.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.190
And you can keep adding
or taking away terms

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.060
to see how well
it hugs the curve.
