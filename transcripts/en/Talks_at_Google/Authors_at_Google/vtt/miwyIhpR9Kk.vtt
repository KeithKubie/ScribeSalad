00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.720
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Welcome to Authors and
Wine@Google. We welcome today Randall Grahm.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.110
Just completing a short intro and then Randall
will join us here up front. And thanks to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.520
everyone for coming. Randall's fascination
with wine began in Southern California when

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
he stumbled upon a wine shop close to his
parents' house around when we was 20 years

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920
old.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.183
They asked him if he wanted to open a charge
account and he enthusiastically replied, "Yes."

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:35.720
He realized early on that to be able to experience
the kinds of wines he had there all the time,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.090
he'd have to learn how to make them himself.
Sometime later, he found himself working at

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.870
the Wine Merchant in Beverly Hills sweeping
floors.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.360
Through exceptionally good karma, he was given
the opportunity to taste a large number of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.829
really good French wines. And this experience
turned him into a wine fanatic. He's well-known

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.200
as one of the pioneers of Rhone varietals
in California and he's found success with

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.829
obscure Italian varietals as well.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.510
In 1989, he was indicted into the Who's Who
of Cooking in America by Cooks Magazine for

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.369
"lifetime achievement and leadership and the
improvement and development of American cuisine."

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.600
He was also awarded the honor of Wine and
Spirits Professional of the Year by the James

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.319
Beard Foundation in 1994.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.259
The 2010 Duboeuf Wine Book of the Year, "Been
Doon So Long," is a collection of Randall's

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.409
writings from the Bonny Doon newsletter as
well as articles, speeches, and essays. It's

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.229
described as a "truly original approach to
the subject of wine. One that's full of wit,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.209
intelligence, and mischief.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:58.130
He takes us through his journey of marketing
and crafting wine. He writes with passion

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.009
about wanting to make honest wines--wines
that represent the places that they come from.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.540
He embraces the wabi-sabi approach to organic
winemaking as an essential element of the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.650
beauty of the natural wine.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.280
He believes that it's through these flaws
that wines become revelatory and capable of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.400
directing our attention to new places and
ideas." Soon, we'll get a taste of this vision

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.040
as Bonny Doon releases its first biodynamic
wines in two to three years. Please join me

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.520
in welcoming Randall Grahm.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.049
[applause]

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:47.969
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Typically I begin these séances
with an invocation from Alice Cooper, "welcome

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.400
to my nightmare". [audience chuckles] And
I thought I would give you the Reader's Digest

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.650
condensed version of the, or the brief history
of Bonny Doon and then take you up to the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.650
present time.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.569
I started Bonny Doon in 1981. Basically, with
the quixotic notion that I was gonna make

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.640
the great American Pinot Noir. This was my
obsession, my idée fix , my mantra. And I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.010
suppose fortunately for me, it didn't quite
work out as according to plan. It was about

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.510
three orders of magnitude more complicated
than I ever imagined it would be.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.239
So, I, luckily, made the acquaintance of the
Albanian wine merchant, Kermit Lynch, when

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.159
he was a wine merchant in Albany, California.
And Kermit got me interested in Rhone varieties

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.540
and I had a very simplistic hypothesis, which
was: "It's warm and dry in Southern France.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.530
It's warm and dry in the Central Coast of
California. Maybe the Rhone varieties would

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.670
do well in California." What an interesting
idea. And truly, I mean, we think of Rhone

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.730
varieties as being mainstream, but remember,
30 years ago they didn't really exist.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.329
There were three Sirah vineyards in California.
All of them uniformly dreadful in their own

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.329
unique way.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.500
[laughter]

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.459
There was Mourvèdre, but nobody knew Mourvèdre
was here because it was traveling under an

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.170
alias of Mataró. And that was thanks to Darrell
Corti in Sacramento who clued me in on that.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.080
And no one, apart from David Bruce, knew that
Grenache could actually make red wine because

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.460
all the Grenache that we experience was fairly
dreadful, drecky, pink wine that was quite

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.170
sweet and quite horrible. But David had actually
made some amazingly--.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:48.420
Well, actually made one good one and one bad
one in 1970 and 1971 of Grenache. And this

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.820
was in 1984. I was thinking, "You know, this
Pinot Noir thing is not working out quite

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.330
as well as I had hoped. I need a Plan B if
I'm gonna stay in the wine business." Having

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.481
gone to Davis and this is what I decided to
do.

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.590
I'm gonna figure out how to make this work.
So, I needed a Plan B. So, the Plan B was

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.300
let's try Rhone varieties. And maybe let's
try a blend. Maybe if we blended Grenache,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.630
Sirah, and Mourvèdre together, we could do
something that vaguely approximated a Châteauneuf

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.410
du Pape. [laughter]

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:29.060
And that's how Cigare Volant was conceived.
And looking back in retrospect, I have to

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.310
say that it's miraculous that the wine came
out as well as it did. There are a million

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.110
ways to go wrong. There's many infinite number
of ways to go wrong. And the fact that I didn't

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.380
go terribly wrong, too often of the time,
is a miracle in retrospect.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:59.500
Oddly enough, last year, Bonny Doon--. Bonny
Doon has been this funny journey for me and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:08.040
last year, last year or two, have been a recapitulation
and reevaluation of where I've been and just

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.570
a pause in where is Bonny Doon going in the
next phase? So what's interesting is we actually

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.240
staged two vertical tastings of Cigare Volant.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.630
Twenty-five vintages of Cigare Volant. We
did one in New York at Hearth Restaurant in

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.960
the Village and we did another one at Manresa
Restaurant in Los Carros. And luckily, we

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.390
had some large format bottles and these were,
in many cases, the last large format bottle

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.390
in existence.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.280
In some cases, they were the last of any bottle
in existence. So, we had all the vintages,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.500
many of them in large format bottles. And
I'll you, this was the freakiest thing that

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.280
happened at the tasting. Many things happened.
These tastings were extravagant. I mean, we

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.960
had like literally 12 hundred glasses that
were used in this, that were harmed in this

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.910
[laughter]

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:14.690
exercise. Of all the wines we tasted, many
of them were very good and some of them were

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.070
not so good. But they were all pretty much
alive. Pretty much every single one of them

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.610
was alive.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:29.550
Of all the wines we tasted, the first two
vintages, the 1984 and the 1985 were arguably

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.560
the most interesting wines of the evening.
Not necessarily the best, but the most interesting.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:43.041
And so, it really gave me a lot of pause to
reflect. In other words, what the heck have

00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:44.900
I been doing for 30 years?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900
[laughter]

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.980
Such that, the first two wines that I made,
knowing absolutely nothing, were the two most

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:58.970
interesting wines of the evening. And it did
make me think that maybe in the earliest days--.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.520
It made me aware of a couple of possible conclusions
of this, deductions from this.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:12.140
One is that logic and ratiocination really
doesn't, is far more cracked up than it should

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.530
be. In other words, thinking things out generally
doesn't always work. Sometimes, you just go

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.050
on your instinct and that's a better way.
And certainly in the early days, I was operating

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.390
on my instinct more than any real insight.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.861
Nobody knew anything about making these varieties.
Nobody knew for example, that Sirah was a

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:36.690
cool-climate grape. That Sirah actually had
different requirements than Mourvèdre and

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.310
different requirements than Grenache.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.940
The only thing I knew about winemaking was
what I had read in a book, which was "If you

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.380
wanna make a faux Châteauneuf du Pape, or
if you wanna make something that tastes like

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.940
a Châteauneuf du Pape, it needs to have a
lot of Grenache in it.” OK. A lot of Grenache

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.940
in it.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:59.660
Check. "Needs to go in a large vessel." OK.
Oops. Large vessel. Check. "Keep it away from

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:06.460
oxygen." OK. Keep it away from oxygen. Check.
And that's what we did. And it worked. So,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:15.460
Bonny Doon has been on this funny path for
the last 30 years and the way I characterize

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:21.990
it is it's essentially been an adventure in
unbridled viticultural id.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:28.020
Any etiological id for that matter, too. So
in other words, it's been experimentation.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.520
It's been messing around. It's been having
fun. It's been trying every possible permutation

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.010
and combination of grape variety that one
possibly could. Every winemaking style. And

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.460
having fun.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.490
And making people happy. It's made a lot of
people happy. The only person it didn't really

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:54.660
make happy was me, unfortunately. At least
in the last several years. Bonny Doon got

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:05.040
very complex, very labyrinthine, almost Borgesian
in complexity. Yeah, labyrinthine, [chuckles]

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.640
that's a word.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.070
So, all along the way, I had always and am
always and have always been a lover of European

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:21.490
wines. And I love European wines for their
uniqueness, their specificity, they're sort

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:27.620
of about something. This mysterious other
element. And what is this mysterious other

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.620
element?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.590
This mysterious other element is terroir.
It's a sense of place. It's this idea that

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:40.230
a wine can be not just about the grape, but
somehow also capture a quality of a place.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.510
And it's not even just the place, but it's
also the culture of the place, the history

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.800
of the place, many, many different aspects.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.690
And this was what makes great European wine
great. And this is what arguably makes New

00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:02.710
World wines, relatively speaking, somewhat
banal. So, I'd been giving talks and writing

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.840
articles about terroir and how beautiful it
is and how precious it is and how truly, it's

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.440
really the most precious thing that exists
in the wine business.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.000
And then looking at myself in the mirror and
observing to my chagrin, there was nothing

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.290
at all congruent in what I was saying with
what I was doing. Not a single thing. I was

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.610
producing zero Vin de Terroir. Not only was
I not producing any Vin de Terroir, there

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.520
were no imminent prospects for producing Vin
de Terroir.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:46.400
So, it was time. This was my existential moment.
I had recently turned 50. I had a child. And

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:55.040
I had serious medical problem. So, this was
my intimation of mortality and the thought

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.260
was looking, "Now, what are you doing to do
when you grow up? It's time to settle down,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.640
buckle down, and try to do something with
your life, Randall, for God's sake."

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:14.700
So, the first thing I thought is Bonny Doon
is just way too complex. Too many moving parts.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:21.720
We were producing, in the heyday, about 450
thousand cases annually, which made us the

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.600
28th largest winery in the United States.
And this meant that we actually had to compete

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.029
with people, who actually knew what they were
doing, who actually really were in the wine

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:32.920
business and could do all these things.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:40.740
So, we accidentally became a large winery.
And we're very leveraged and very, all the

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.490
things that are very dangerous about being
in business. So, the first thought was, "I

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.063
gotta sell Bonny Doon. I just have to do it."
'Cause the problem of course was that nobody

00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:54.210
wanted to buy Bonny Doon for more than like,
six cents.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:01.130
So, I ended up selling off those assets that
were semi-detachable. And it turns out, in

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:06.430
fact, that these were the assets that I least
detached to. So, I sold off our large brands.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:12.980
I sold off Big House and Cardinal Zin. Shrunk
the production. Simplified the production.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.240
And then started focusing in on the idea of
finding a place where I could grow grapes

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:28.600
and possibly do something in a true vin de
terroir. So, a couple years go by. It turns

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:37.390
out that it's really hard to rebrand yourself
when people think you are this goofy, happy-go-lucky,

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:45.710
anything for a joke kind of winery with funny
labels and this whatever insouciant attitude

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.480
that you have, allegedly insouciant attitude.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.589
It's hard to get people to take the wine seriously.
So, it has been a bit of a struggle. And we've

00:13:56.589 --> 00:14:01.900
continued to shrink the production. And then
last year, I sold off this other brand we

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:07.001
had, which was called Pacific Rim. And that
was a wine we had spun off in Washington.

00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:13.250
And all along the way, I'd been like, "How
can I get escape velocity and do this next

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:21.720
thing?" So, I'd been looking at a lot of property
and going on a lot of realtor dates, if you

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:30.111
will. And one property's nice and another
property's nice. And I never really was all

00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:33.890
that excited about any of them until this
one property I came too.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.950
It actually turned out that I had dreamt about
this property. And when I saw it, I said,

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.790
"Hmm. I remember this property. This is quite
amazing." And sure enough, this was the property.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:51.150
And it's in San Juan Batista and I ended up
buying it. It gets even stranger 'cause I

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:56.970
also dreamt about a mountain lion on this
property and I saw the mountain lion recently,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.670
which was also quite interesting.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.220
And luckily for me, it was quite far away,
but my colleague, Philippe, got to see it

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.980
at very close range. And that was a little
more challenging for him. About 20 feet away,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:15.470
so that scared the heck out of him. Anyways,
so now I've got the property. Now what do

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.680
I do?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:24.360
And so, the expressed intention is, how do
you make a vin de terroir? And the problem

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:32.080
is, how do you do it, essentially, in a short
lifetime or what is left of one's lifetime?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.800
There's basically two ways of doing it, I
think. Well, there's the European way, which

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.730
is to iterate and observe over 500 to 800
years. This is not a practical way.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.300
[small laughter]

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.880
It's OK if you can consistently reincarnate
yourself with some degree of precision, it

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.370
works. But failing that, less well. So essentially,
I think there's only two ways to approach

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:09.850
it. One is decide you love X grape. You are
just crazy about X grape and then figure out

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.990
how are you going to make your X grape somewhere.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.790
In other words, how can you find conditions
that you know or believe will be brilliant

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.100
for this grape? Pinot Noir is a good example.
We've got a lot of people running around who

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.200
are obsessed with Pinot Noir. Most of them
are men. Why? Because it's really, really

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.420
difficult.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:35.149
And if you're a guy, you are just genetically
predisposed to do things that are like, pretty

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:41.840
much impossible because that's how you know
that you're a real guy. So, you got all these

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:51.029
people out chasing this Holy Grail. And the
problem with this, I believe, is that at the

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:57.540
end of the day, the very best thing you can
do is produce something that tastes vaguely

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.640
Burgundian.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.800
It will never be as interesting as proper
Burgundy. However, it will be like ten times

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.939
as expensive as proper Burgundy because the
effort that you have to put into replicating

00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:17.039
these conditions is so wildly expensive. And
at the end of the day, I'm not sold that you're

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:20.749
really gonna come up with anything all that
original.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:25.759
So that's one way of doing it. The other way
of doing it, I believe, maybe there's other

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:32.440
ways, but I haven't thought of them. The other
way is find a piece of property that you imagine,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:42.730
rightly or wrongly, possesses the possibility
of expressing terroir. Now, it's a little

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.730
bit tautological.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.770
What is terroir? Terroir is the sense of place.
OK, well every place then, expresses a sense

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:59.360
of place by definition. Not all places are
as interesting or as expressive or as eloquent

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.950
as others. Some don't have a lot--. It's like
people. Some people just don't have a lot

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.950
to say.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.860
Some people have a lot to say. Some terroirs
have a lot to say. Those are the ones that

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:24.520
are interesting. Terroir is essentially the
ability of a site and a plant to solve each

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.070
other’s problems. So in other words, a brilliant
terroir is one that solves the problems more

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:40.139
elegantly than the other surrounding areas
most of the time, such that it's able to impart

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:43.230
distinctiveness to that wine.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.769
And in Europe, it's quite extraordinary where
literally the different terroir, or the different

00:18:49.769 --> 00:18:56.749
cru, or vineyards, are separated sometimes
by 30 feet or 40 feet and they will be very

00:18:56.749 --> 00:19:02.720
different, one from the other. So, this is
really, really extraordinary. So, how can

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.899
you get at this?

00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:11.690
How can you illuminate this in a short period
of time? So many of these decisions seemed

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.049
utterly arbitrary. What kind of root stock
do you grow? What kind of variety do you grow?

00:19:16.049 --> 00:19:19.840
What kind of spacing do you grow? What sort
of row orientation do you grow?

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:28.989
Do you plant them on--? How do you trellis
them? Do you irrigate? Do you not irrigate?

00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:38.270
OK. So, I've had this idea that there's certain
things that need to be observed. So, let me

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:47.960
get back to what I think is really the gist
of terroir, or the gist of a great wine. The

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:57.720
gist of a great wine is, I believe, a grape
variety or a blend of grape varieties that

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:06.659
somehow have a perfect congruency to the site
on which they're grown.

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:11.359
So in other words, Pinot noir is a brilliant
grape, but it's not a brilliant grape when

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:14.840
you grow it in Fresno. It's a ridiculous grape
when you grow it in Fresno. But when you grow

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:22.150
it in Maurice Saint-Denis, or von Romenay,
or Chambretaud, it's totally brilliant. Nebbiolo

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:29.919
is a brilliant grape when you grow it in Barolo,
not very many other places.

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:37.429
Cabernet is a pretty good grape when you grow
it in Napa Valley, but it's an extraordinary

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:45.840
grape when you grow it in the Medoc. So, my
belief is that there's not necessarily--.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.049
There are some grapes that are more interesting
than others. That's for sure.

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:52.940
And there's some grapes that are not very
interesting at all. But essentially, what

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.109
is interesting about a grape is how well-suited
it is to the place where it's grown. So, the

00:20:58.109 --> 00:21:03.669
real question is how do you find that congruency
between the grape and the place that it's

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.899
grown?

00:21:05.899 --> 00:21:11.230
So, here's how I've broken down the problem.
The first problem is I decided if you wanna

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:19.070
grow a grape that expresses terroir, you need
to amplify the signal. And it's basically

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.980
kind of a physics or electronics problem.
What you want to do is amplify the signal

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.029
without distorting it.

00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:33.220
So, its signal to noise ratio. So, how do
you boost the signal without distorting it,

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:42.710
creating noise? One of the ways is not irrigate.
In other words, if you have grape vines that

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:49.190
are exploring a large volume of soil territory,
they're imprinting on more of the qualities

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:56.769
of the site and expressing it and distilling
it, if you will, into the wine that's expressed.

00:21:56.769 --> 00:22:03.899
You want to have probably limited production.
So in other words again, this concentration

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:13.350
effect. Lots of roots, very little fruit.
It's kind of again, concentrating the signal.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.890
You don't want to deform the wine in the winery.
You don't want to use a lot of new oak.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.980
You don't want to pick it overripe. You don't
want to use cultured yeast. You don't wanna

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:30.259
use high-tech methods of reverse osmosis.
All those things, essentially, deform the

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:38.450
intrinsic character of the wine. So, I came
to this like, "OK, I need to dry farm. I need

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.799
to grow grapes without irrigation.

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:46.049
I've got this land. It's got really interesting
soil. But you know, it only rains about 16

00:22:46.049 --> 00:22:50.580
inches a year in San Juan Batista." In a good
year, it might be 20, but most of the time,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.590
it's like 15 or 16, which is pretty marginal.
Some of our soils are nice and deep and hold

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.590
a lot of moisture.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:05.789
Others are sandy, not so deep, not a lot of
moisture. I ran into a friend of mine a couple

00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:12.120
of years ago at a barbecue who follows these
things. And I said, "You know, Greg. Do you

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.740
have any ideas about what can I do to really--.
I wanna dry farm. Are there any really clever

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:25.720
techniques that you know of to enhance the
water holding capacity of the soil?"

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.409
He says, "You know, I've been reading about
this stuff. There's these things in South

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:33.749
America. There's this stuff called biochar.
And you may wanna just check it out. I don't

00:23:33.749 --> 00:23:37.249
really know very much about it, but a couple
of people who are really interested in it

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.399
and it seems like it has a lot of potential."

00:23:39.399 --> 00:23:45.260
So, I filed this away and a year goes by.
And then I finally got the property and we're

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.100
ready to do something with it. And I remembered.
And I started doing some research on biochar.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:57.840
And it turns out that biochar not only is
the answer for producing grapes in a dry climate,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.899
it's probably the answer for enhancing the
terroir of your site.

00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:08.340
And it's probably also the answer for saving
the planet. So, here's the deal with biochar.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:20.100
I go to see the biochar maven, who name is
Hans Peter Schmidt. He's in Bern, Switzerland.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:27.250
He's manufacturing biochar. However, so this
is what biochar does. Biochar is essentially

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:33.409
charcoal that is derived from biomass that
is heated in the absence of oxygen.

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:41.409
And you get this crumbly charcoal material.
You mix it with very high-quality compost,

00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:49.100
roughly 50/50. You incorporate it into the
soil. And it enhances the water-holding capacity

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.370
of the soil by about 30 percent, which is
coincidentally exactly the amount that I've

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:58.379
calculated I need to increase mine by to dry
farm.

00:24:58.379 --> 00:25:04.509
But more interestingly than that, the biochar,
the molecular structure, the chemical structure,

00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:10.890
the physical structure has a lot of micropores.
And this creates, and also a really interesting

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:20.149
carboxyl groups at the ends of the molecules,
and this essentially is like crack-cocaine

00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:23.019
for beneficial soil microbes, for mycorrhizal.

00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:28.989
So, it provides a habitat for them to live
and a nutritional source for them to live.

00:25:28.989 --> 00:25:35.450
So, the mycorrhizal population goes completely
out of control and this is what brings minerals

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:42.039
into the plant. This is what nourishes the
plant, keeps it healthy, keeps it vital, and

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:44.810
amplifies terroir.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:50.389
So, if you're growing produce, if you're growing
root vegetables, the vitamin content, the

00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:54.749
mineral content, the sugar content of all
these things just goes up enormously. We're

00:25:54.749 --> 00:26:01.769
gonna do, I think this afternoon, a comparative
potato tasting. Of, this is your potatoes

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:05.279
on biochar, here's your potatoes normale.

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:08.720
And I've never done this before. I've no idea
how it's gonna come out. They're probably

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.879
gonna taste exactly alike,--

00:26:09.879 --> 00:26:10.879
[laughter]

00:26:10.879 --> 00:26:16.320
but we'll find out. We will be the first ones
in Mountain View, California to ever experience

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:26.220
biochar potatoes. OK, so then it turns out--.
So, Peter is making this biochar and having

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:32.690
really amazing results. However, it turns
out that only represents a small part of what

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.690
he's doing.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.600
And it's not even the most interesting thing
that he's doing. The most interesting thing

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.710
that he's doing is he's turning his vineyards
into gardens. And he's developed a set of

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:53.049
rules for formulizing how do you turn essentially
a farm--. How do you turn a monoculture into

00:26:53.049 --> 00:27:00.649
a polyculture into something that resembles
a state of nature, a balanced ecosystem?

00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:05.149
So, his vineyards don't look like vineyards.
They look like gardens. You've got a row of

00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:09.919
grapes and then interplanted, you've got a
row of apple trees or a row of pears and olives

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:16.940
and pêche de vigne and rosebushes and flowering
rosemary and sage and lavender and this and

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.940
that.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:24.629
And bee hotels, which he calls them. And you
get an immense amount of biodiversity in these

00:27:24.629 --> 00:27:32.070
fields. And therefore, you can produce grapes
with minimal intervention. Switzerland, it

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.440
rains a lot. It's very humid, so they have
to do something.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:41.580
But in California, I'm convinced we can pretty
much create an eidetic situation with no need

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:48.749
to any kind of sprays whatsoever. So, this
is very, very interesting. OK. So, a couple

00:27:48.749 --> 00:27:57.149
of problems solved. How are we doing on time,
by the way? Are we OK? OK, great.

00:27:57.149 --> 00:28:02.369
It still begs the question, what the heck
do you grow? And how do you develop a methodology

00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:08.499
for figuring that out? It came to me. I'm
not sure exactly how it came to me, but it

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:16.389
came to me. 
Nothing ever comes in one flash. It comes

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:20.470
in multiple flashes, I guess like sunsets
or LSD or something.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:31.619
But I was having dinner at Oliveto Restaurant
not too many months ago. And the owner, he

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:34.720
says, "Well, can I pour you something?" I
said, "Great. Pour me something wacky, something

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.929
interesting, something fun, tasty, whatever
you think I should have. Pour me a glass."

00:28:39.929 --> 00:28:48.080
He pours me a glass of this stuff. Totally
great. Amazing, mineral, complex, fabulous

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.129
wine. He says, "What do you think it is?"
I said, "I don't know. It reminds me a little

00:28:53.129 --> 00:28:59.009
bit about the wines of Mount Etna--the Nerello
Mascalese from Mount Etna." He said, "Very

00:28:59.009 --> 00:29:03.049
good guess, Randall, but no. It's not Mount
Etna, but very good guess."

00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:10.220
I said, "Well, what the heck is it?" He brings
out the bottle. It turns out it's a wine from

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:16.679
the Canary Islands, from Lanzarote and the
grape is called Listán Negro. I said, "This

00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:22.710
wine is fantastic." He says, "Let me show
you a picture of these vineyards." He goes

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:28.549
out in the back, prints off a page from the
website.

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:33.200
And he shows me a picture of the vineyards
and this looks like the moon if the moon had

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.840
vineyards with palm trees on it. That's what
these vineyards would look like. The vines

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.139
are planted inside of craters and around the
craters are little volcanic rocks, basalt

00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:53.869
rocks, that shelter the craters because it's
very windy, it's very dry, and they need to

00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:58.299
capture every molecule of moisture that lands
anywhere in the vicinity and shelter the vines

00:29:58.299 --> 00:29:59.299
from the wind.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:04.549
So, this knocks me out. This has to be like
the most extreme place on the planet where

00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:11.919
grapes are grown. Hot, windy, miserable, terrible.
So, the next day or two days later, I'm having

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:17.080
dinner with a wine critic from The Chronicle,
Jon Bonné. And I say, "Jon, I had like the

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:23.549
most amazing wine the other night. This freaky
wine from Lanzarote called Listán Negro."

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:28.880
And he starts laughing. I say, "Jon, what's
so funny?" He says, "Do you have any idea

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.820
what Listán Negro is?" I said, "It's Listán
Negro." He said, "There's a synonym for Listán

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.690
Negro." I said, "Well, what the heck is it?"
He's all, "You'll never guess what it is."

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.840
"OK, I give up. What is it?"

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.539
It turns out Listán Negro is synonymous with
what is called the Mission Grape. The Mission

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:52.470
Grape is the first grape that came to California
with the Spanish missionaries. My vineyard

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:58.690
is on Mission Vineyard Drive, as it turns
out. But here's the kicker.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:05.620
The Mission Grape is arguably the worst vinifera
grape that has ever been invented, ever been

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.830
discovered, ever been observed. It has no
redeeming qualities. [audience chuckles lightly]

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:16.330
It has no color, no flavor, no acid, nothing.
It's horrible. It's totally horrible. However,

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:21.340
under these conditions, it produces completely
brilliant wine.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:29.950
Go figure. What does this mean? What does
this mean? I think it means, again, there's

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:41.229
no such thing as most brilliant. There is
best-suited. And I think also it means that

00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:47.480
if you have a terroir that is strong enough,
and I strongly believe the terroir on Lanzarote

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:54.630
is about as strong as it gets, if the terroir
is strong enough the variety itself, or blend

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.059
of varieties, really pales in significance.

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:02.950
And it really essentially becomes a carrier.
It's just simply a carrier. It's really not

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.049
something that--. You just want to get the
balance more or less right. You want it to

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:11.649
have the right amount of acidity and the right
amount of sugar. But apart from that, it's

00:32:11.649 --> 00:32:14.940
just there to bring this other character along.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:23.259
So, it's really in a sense a question gestalt.
So, instead of focusing on one foreground,

00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:28.609
you flip-flop it so the variety is really
in the background and the terroir is in the

00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:34.960
foreground. So, how can you do that? I think
I may have found a way to do it. You grow

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.739
the grapes from seeds rather than from cuttings.

00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:48.369
And why might this work? For a couple of reasons.
It might not work. I mean, this could be like,

00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:52.879
I've talked to people who know about these
things. Roughly, it's half and half. Half

00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:59.509
the people say, "Randall, this is gonna be
the most expensive waste of time ever." And

00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:02.429
other people say, "You know what?"

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:08.649
Some variant of, "This is so crazy, it just
might work." Or something like that. Here's

00:33:08.649 --> 00:33:18.879
why I think it might work. One, seeds behave
very different than cuttings. Grapes, whatever

00:33:18.879 --> 00:33:23.369
plant you're growing, whether it's a tree
or a vine, when you grow a grape from a seed

00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:25.129
you have what is called geotropism.

00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:32.619
So, the roots go straight down to China whereas
if you grow grapes from a cutting, they move

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:39.929
laterally. So, certainly there's gonna be
more of this desire to find water at all costs

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:46.249
from a seedling. The second thing that I think
is quite interesting is instead of having

00:33:46.249 --> 00:33:55.679
a single variety, or two or three clones,
or two or three varieties, you have essentially

00:33:55.679 --> 00:34:01.879
a true population where every vine is genetically
distinct from every other vine.

00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:09.210
Theoretically, they're all in the same family.
They're all from the same clan, but I'm imagining

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:16.730
the difference between a full orchestra and
chamber group. Chamber group is lovely, but

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:22.440
it's small. An orchestra has a depth, a complexity,
a richness of sound that you can't replicate

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.440
any other way.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:30.210
So, I'm thinking that with this tremendous
diversity, something is gonna happen. Now

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:36.500
bear in mind, what I'm trying to achieve is
not identify the best grape. Maybe I might

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.159
accidentally find the best grape or find the
best grapes, or certain class of grape that

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:48.069
seem to be well-suited to the site, but really
what I'm most interested in is what happens

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:49.220
to a population.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.250
What can you achieve with a population? And
maybe, within that population, are there criteria

00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.809
for inclusion or exclusion, some rules that
you might want to enforce in generation two,

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:05.170
when you decide, "OK, the grapes that are
the wrong color, we'll put them over here.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.670
We'll make another wine out of them. Or, the
grapes that ripened too early, we're gonna

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:15.930
put them over here." But I think, at the very
least, you're bringing something unique into

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:22.240
the world. At the very least, you're bringing
ten thousand new varieties that didn't exist

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.240
previously.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:30.630
So, I think it's a good bet. And whether the
wine's any good or not, I think it's gonna

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.299
be distinctive. I think it's gonna be amazing.
As we often say at Bonny Doon, "What could

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.290
possibly go wrong?"

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.640
[laughter]

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:49.740
So, I think that's pretty much the state of
the Doon right now. I could read a section

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.059
from the book, or I can entertain questions,
or both.

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:57.720
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Let's do both.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.359
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: OK. Questions first or book
first?

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:06.960
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: For questions, folks can
just ask and then you can repeat them if you

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960
want to.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.260
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Sure. Of course. You gotta
have some questions. Yeah?

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:20.619
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I noticed you were
using European words to describe terms like

00:36:20.619 --> 00:36:23.890
noise. How do you come by such terms having
been in the wine business?

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.650
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Oh, if you stay in school
long enough as I did, you learn all kinds

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:27.650
of weird stuff.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.180
[laughter]

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:35.890
If you majored in six things, you know. When
you go to Santa Cruz, you can never actually

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:41.920
graduate in four years. It's a known impossibility.
So, if you stay in school long enough you

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.440
learn all these goofy things. Yeah.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.869
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So in a lot of
the vineyards of old people would make field

00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:49.869
blend.

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:50.869
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Yes.

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:51.869
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Which is sort of
akin to the Bordeaux of making it from scratch

00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:52.869
instead of--

00:36:52.869 --> 00:36:53.869
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Correct.

00:36:53.869 --> 00:36:54.869
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: You sort of get
what you get

00:36:54.869 --> 00:36:55.869
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Right.

00:36:55.869 --> 00:36:56.869
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I don't know if
those fields are clones of each--. If the

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:08.642
wines are clones of each other, but how do
you compare that with the field blend?

00:37:08.642 --> 00:37:12.789
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: So, the question is how I
compare this project to a field blend. Essentially,

00:37:12.789 --> 00:37:23.799
it is a field blend on steroids, if you will.
I mean, the--mostly Italians, some Portuguese--who

00:37:23.799 --> 00:37:31.130
did the original field blends, I think they
did this by intuition. You get a sense--.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:37.569
It's like when you're making a dish. You want
some elements. I need color from here. I need

00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:44.529
acid from here. I need body from here. And
when you grow grapes in a warm climate, in

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:49.049
a Mediterranean climate, every Mediterranean
climate has come to the same conclusion that

00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:51.670
you need disparate elements.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.941
You need several elements to produce a wine
that's balanced and complex. And a field blend

00:37:55.941 --> 00:38:05.359
is really just something that enforces that.
And my own experience has been--. I work with

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:11.980
field blends in Antioch, in Oakley, California,
in Contra Costa. They're extremely interesting.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:17.829
But my own personal experience has been when
I'm producing, if you will, a varietal wine,

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:25.289
a Sirah. In every instance, there might be
in this field three or four or five or six

00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:30.270
different clones of Sirah planted. And one
clone is said to be superior because it has

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:34.789
smaller clusters and that the wine is darker
or it has better acidity.

00:38:34.789 --> 00:38:40.180
But in every instance, in my experience, the
blend of the six different clones is always

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:47.200
better than the individual clone. So, taking
that principle--. And again, as long as the

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:57.900
elements are all coherent, I think that this
diversity will just enrich the wine. Here's

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.770
another way of thinking about it.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:06.279
The French make this, I think, really salient
distinction between what they call wines of

00:39:06.279 --> 00:39:13.380
effort and wines of terroir. And a wine of
effort is one that bears the strong stylistic

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.809
imprint of the winemaker, where the winemaker
is really trying to determine as much as he

00:39:17.809 --> 00:39:19.260
possibly can.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.730
And we do this in the New World. We do this
very successfully in the New World. And it's

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:29.359
not a totally stupid thing to do. You want
to know. It's like reading a book. You want

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:33.470
to know how it comes out in the end, so you
wanna know what steps you can take to make

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.740
the wine come out a certain way.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.420
You want it to taste consistent year after
year. You want it to have a certain flavor

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:48.359
profile that people like. And this makes a
lot of sense. However, I would argue that

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:52.680
it may make sense, but ultimately makes a
wine that's completely banal and beside the

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680
point.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.609
And essentially, everyone ends up making the
same wine. What has happened lately in the

00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:04.589
last few years is there are certain influential
critics, who will remain nameless, that would

00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:05.589
be Robert Parker--

00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:06.589
[laughter]

00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:14.519
and the Wine Spectator. And people now are
trying to reverse engineer Parker's palate.

00:40:14.519 --> 00:40:21.150
And they're really successful at it. And there's
a company in Sonoma called Enologix , that

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:29.460
more or less can predict the Parker wine score
before the wine is even finished fermenting

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.460
within a great degree of accuracy.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:37.299
So, and they're just out there acting on their
economic interest. If Parker gives it a 94,

00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:41.180
the wine can sell for this dollar amount.
If he gives it a 91, it can sell for this

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:48.200
dollar amount. So, it's totally rational except
it's evil and bad. And more to the point,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:57.460
ultimately, maybe when good triumphs over
evil, people will understand that wines made

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:04.680
in this fashion have a certain hollowness
to them, a certain simplicity to them.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:10.770
They're only as smart as us winemakers and
that's not very smart. A vin de terroir, on

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:17.730
the other hand, really tries to, forgive the
expression, leverage the complexity of nature,

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:24.970
or expose the complexity of nature, or reveal.
If you can reveal the complexity of nature,

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.690
it's a much vaster universe.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:33.240
It's a much vaster system, a more intelligent
system than the intelligence of a human being.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:39.329
And I think, therefore, vin de terroir are
revelatory. There are depths to these wines

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:43.970
that we cannot fashion through our artifice.
Yeah. Grace.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:49.849
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: You brought an
innovation to the user experience of actually

00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:55.309
consuming wine, which anybody who's ever lagged
behind a corkscrew can appreciate. You've

00:41:55.309 --> 00:42:01.609
really pushed through more uses of screw caps
in your earlier incarnation of Bonny Doon.

00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:02.609
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Yes.

00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:14.960
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Is there anything
you think that needs to be done to help the

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.960
user experience, the consumer experience,
of a wine that will help consumers appreciate

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960
terroir and really get it?

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.690
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: The question is what can
be done to, if you will, turn on the light

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:25.819
bulb for terroir. I've thought about this
for consumers. I've thought about this. It's

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:31.920
really complex. It's a complex question. It's
a deceptively simple question, but I think

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.700
there's kind of a quantum moment where you
literally flip from one universe into another

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.549
universe.

00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:43.450
I don't know what it takes to trigger that
moment. But again, it's a little bit like

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:49.990
a gestalt because you're focusing on one element
or several elements. For me, when I first

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:55.680
started drinking wine, I liked wines that
had oak because I thought oak correlates to

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680
quality.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.650
Oak correlates to softness. Oak correlates
to smoothness. Therefore, good wine equals

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:08.720
oak. And that was one of the signifiers of
quality. And there were a few others, the

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:17.910
texture, certain elements that for me signified
quality. For Parker, it's raspberry juice,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:25.430
or raspberry jam, I should say, things that
are soft and opulent, for him, equals quality.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:30.760
And at a certain point, something happens
in your brain where you say, "You know what?

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:36.589
Those are nice things, but maybe I'm looking
at it the wrong way. Maybe these other aspects

00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:44.299
of the wine that I wasn't really noticing
before, they shift and come into prominence.

00:43:44.299 --> 00:43:50.920
And they become important." This minerality,
this persistence, this chalkiness, this something

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.680
about this wine, this is actually what's interesting
about the wine. Not the fruitiness. Not the

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.849
oakiness. These other elements are what is
interesting. And then, once you can cue in

00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:04.990
on it, then you start looking for it and that
becomes consistently what you look for in

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.990
wine.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:10.100
And then at that point, you can never drink
a Napa Valley Cabernet ever again. [audience

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:18.970
chuckles lightly] So, I don't know exactly
what it takes. I think it's something like

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:26.510
being in situ, going to Italy. It's like Italian
wines. If you were to just pour an Italian

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.880
wine, a Chianti for somebody, a California
wine person, they would say, "Ew. This wine

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.880
is acidic.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:39.510
This wine is weird. Where's the raspberry
milkshake aspect that I've come to trust and

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:44.760
know?" [audience chuckles] But if you're in
Italy and you're eating a bowl of pasta, you're

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:50.260
sitting outside and you're drinking this Chianti,
it's the most brilliant wine that you've ever

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.150
consumed. So, I think having a context really
helps.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:45:01.440
Understanding where these wines come from,
what they're trying to achieve in these wines.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.130
Mainly, what do you eat it with? And when
do you eat it? And when do you drink it? So,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:10.579
I think those are the things that really set
the stage for that "aha." Yeah?

00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:12.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: For grape seeds,
how close to the fence do grape seeds--. Like

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:15.059
when the vine grows from seed just how much
like its parent is it? Where do you--?

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:30.829
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Really good question. Really
good question. It depends on a lot of factors,

00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:36.290
mostly how old the selection is. For example,
Carignan, which is a very old grape, it's

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:41.299
been around, is genetically very stable, so
the offspring look a lot like the parents.

00:45:41.299 --> 00:45:47.339
Cabernet sauvignon, which is a relative youngun',
the offspring don't look a lot like the parents.

00:45:47.339 --> 00:45:53.369
Now, here's the problem in a nutshell. Well,
I won't be in a nutshell. In a grape shell.

00:45:53.369 --> 00:46:01.309
Here's the problem. It would seem, on the
face of it, that if you like Grenache, as

00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:08.590
I do, the straight forward thing to do would
be to get some Grenache grapes and dissect

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:10.779
out the seeds and germinate the seeds.

00:46:10.779 --> 00:46:16.910
The problem is that plants are, vinefera plants
are mostly, but not all, 99 percent of them

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:21.980
are hermaphrodites. So, they have male and
female parts. And it's a little bit like what

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:28.530
happens in other species when they interbreed.
When a plant interbreeds with itself, there's

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.039
a lot of genetic defects.

00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:36.900
It's like the Hapsburgs with idiocy and hemophilia.
[light laughter from audience] So, with vines

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:45.579
that are--. A lot of the seeds are not viable.
They're not productive and they grow weakly.

00:46:45.579 --> 00:46:51.450
There's a lot of problems. So, what you really
wanna do is actually hybridize them, rather

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:58.480
than take the grapes from the seeds themselves,
from the plants themselves.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.920
Did I answer the question? I'm not sure I
answered it.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.370
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah, part of it.
But also like, how much variety will there

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.370
be?

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.109
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Oh, so how much variety will
there be? So, yeah. The question is how much--.

00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:16.750
What will the offspring look like relative
to the parents? So, it turns out if you take

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:23.839
the Grenache seeds from a Grenache vine, it'll
be very Grenache-y. Grenache-ish.

00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:29.890
Certain varieties have more genetic variability.
Pinot noir, for example, if you take the seeds

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:35.550
from Pinot noir they'll really look weird
and different. Some will be pink. Some will

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:40.559
be white. Some will be red. Some will be polka-dot.
They won't be polka-dot, but they'll be red,

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:45.200
white, and pink.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:51.269
But in most instances, they'll be less interesting
than the parents. Now, if you hybridize them,

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:59.039
that's where you get really interesting vines.
And the male part imparts certain characteristics

00:47:59.039 --> 00:48:07.859
and the female part imparts different characteristics.
I'm told, that when you hybridize grape vines,

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:09.180
it's like a bell curve.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:18.089
You get 80 percent kind of look a lot alike
and then ten percent on one side look, are

00:48:18.089 --> 00:48:25.900
really weird and bad, and ten percent on the
other side are really weird and good and different.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.759
So, you might--. Generally, when you hybridize,
when you're breeding grapes, you’re looking

00:48:30.759 --> 00:48:34.319
for the ten percent that are really interesting
and positive.

00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:37.089
But most of them are gonna look a lot alike.
Yeah.

00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:42.049
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I have a similar
question. If you're planning on, if you're

00:48:42.049 --> 00:48:50.109
growing from seed and not from a known root
stock, how do you plan for disease resistance?

00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:51.339
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Correct.

00:48:51.339 --> 00:48:52.960
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Phylloxera or something
like that.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.500
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: You pray pretty much. In
other words, how do you ensure against disease

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.190
resistance? Well, first you start planting
in virgin territory that has not had phylloxera

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:14.549
before. That's a good place to start. We cannot
protect ourselves from phylloxera.

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:21.730
If we grow grapes from seeds, they will eventually
have phylloxera most likely. But in vineyard

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:29.170
two point o, the thought is grow them from--.
Grow root stock, but grow the root stock from

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:34.039
seed. So, one of the things I'm gonna be doing
this fall is going to Texas and collecting

00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:40.430
wild Vitis berlandieri and dissecting out
those seeds and then rooting those seeds.

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:49.539
And those are gonna be the root stock for
the next iteration of what comes first. So,

00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:53.210
that's how you protect yourself. Yes.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:50:06.805
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: I'm just curious.
Is there a general rule of thumb when you

00:50:06.805 --> 00:50:07.805
should save a bottle as opposed to opening
it? I know there's different varieties, obviously,

00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:08.805
but for the wine ager--.

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:09.805
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: OK. If it comes from California,
don't save it.

00:50:09.805 --> 00:50:10.805
[laughter]

00:50:10.805 --> 00:50:15.349
That would be my rule of thumb. Drink it in
the parking lot, would be the best advice

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:26.460
I could give you. Yeah, California wines generally
don't age very well. It's a very complex--.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:31.680
Some things that you'd never imagine would
age, age amazingly well. German Rieslings,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.410
sweet German Rieslings, for example are the
most brilliant wines to age. They'll last

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:42.900
20, 30 years. Oddly enough, in Burgundy, white
Burgundies, which have a reputation for aging

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.920
well, don't age very well anymore.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:52.109
Nobody knows why, but they don't. The one
rule of thumb is look at the alcohol. If the

00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:57.210
alcohol is really high, either don't buy it.
My advice would be don't buy it. Or, if you

00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:03.140
do buy it, drink it in the parking lot because
ripe wines--. They say, the adage is the wine

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.240
either ripens on the vine or it ripens in
the cellar.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.079
So, if you're starting with grapes that are
too ripe, they will not have really great

00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:16.970
longevity. Wines that are 12½ , 13 percent,
all things being equal, will live much longer

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:17.970
than wines that are 15 percent. Yes.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:25.560
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: You start getting
into the genetic part and I have questions.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:41.250
And I'm wondering why that didn't come up
more in terms of matching genetics to terroir,

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.579
because there are wines that do well and grapes
that do well in Germany and grapes that do

00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:51.559
well in Afghanistan, you know. And so, it
seems like you could find part of that terroir

00:51:51.559 --> 00:51:52.559
match with genetically suited toward the region.

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:55.670
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Well, you could. And certainly,
and I had two consultants, the Claude and

00:51:55.670 --> 00:52:01.200
Lydia Bourguignon, who this is basically what
they do. And they're terroir experts. And

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.830
so, I put the question to them. "So, like
I've got this kind of volcanic soil over here

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:09.559
and this kind of soil over here. What do you
think?"

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:15.569
Well, the problem is their database, their
knowledge base is limited. They know what

00:52:15.569 --> 00:52:20.599
grows in France. They know that Cabernet sauvignon
grows on gravelly soil. Merlot grows on clay

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:24.270
soil. Pinot noir grows on limestone soil.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:32.640
I had some chalky soil and they said, "Why
don't you grow some of that--what's the grape

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:39.410
in Sherry?--the Palomino. Grow some Palomino."
It's like, Jesus, God. I need Palomino like

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:46.790
a hole in the head. And so, you can do these
things, of course. And probably succeed, but

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:55.570
again, you're probably, your Palomino in San
Juan Batista on chalk soil is probably not

00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:00.599
gonna be as interesting as the Palomino grown
in Jerez, where they've had this opportunity

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:02.930
to really fine tune it.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:09.490
So, I think you go with your instinct and
you go with your instinct. And then you pay

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:14.200
attention. And make mistakes. And maybe some
of these things will work out really well.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.799
And try to create a mechanism where you can
actually iterate and learn from something

00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:23.500
and then adapt. We shall see. Yeah.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:29.809
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Have you ever tried
to basically just try a bunch of different

00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:33.050
grapes in Year One when you bought the property?
Just put a bunch in and see what happens?

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.140
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: Well, the problem with that,
is that you can do that and it's actually

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:42.261
not--. If you're 25 or 30 years old, that
is like a really good idea. The problem is

00:53:42.261 --> 00:53:46.960
you really don't know what you're gonna get
for at least seven or eight years, maybe ten

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.990
years.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:57.039
So, you kinda have to go for it. You just
have to go for it. And not quit your day job,

00:53:57.039 --> 00:53:58.039
I think, is the--.

00:53:58.039 --> 00:53:59.039
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Does it take even
longer from seed then? Like how long until

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:01.140
you get a good sense of--

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:08.230
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: It does take longer to grow
from seed. The problem of course is that in

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:15.990
some cases, the grape varieties that I wanna
propagate don't exist in California, so I

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:22.910
have to clandestinely--. Oops, being recorded.
[laughter] I'm sorry. I have to somehow obtain

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:30.809
some of these unusual grape varieties, propagate
them, and then collect the pollen and blah,

00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:31.809
blah, blah.

00:54:31.809 --> 00:54:40.089
So, it becomes a very complicated process.
Anyways, we're marching forward. Somehow,

00:54:40.089 --> 00:54:41.089
we're marching forward.

00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:43.259
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's out of time almost.
I don't know. For the wine tasting, did you

00:54:43.259 --> 00:54:50.410
want to quickly say something about the book
or read something from the book?

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:53.289
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: OK. Five minutes-ish?

00:54:53.289 --> 00:55:00.510
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Five minutes. It's 5:10.
So, people are showing up. Do you have a copy

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.510
of the book up there?

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:08.119
&gt;&gt;Randall Grahm: I do. So, I'm gonna read
you just a segment, a couple of paragraphs.

00:55:08.119 --> 00:55:15.319
So, the book is pretty goofy. There's a lot
of literary parody and poems and songs and

00:55:15.319 --> 00:55:23.049
essays, but when I first started doing these
parodies, I thought I just need to parody

00:55:23.049 --> 00:55:24.220
classical literature.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:34.859
So, I did Kafka and Joyce and Shakespeare
and Cervantes. And then, I realized I could

00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:40.410
parody popular literature as well. So, I did
J. D. Salinger. And then I took the plunge

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:48.259
and I did Phillip Roth, with Portnoy's Complaint.
And this is called Trotanoy's Complaint. It's

00:55:48.259 --> 00:55:50.410
very, very, very naughty.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:59.480
So, I won't read you the raciest bits, but
I'll read you a little bit. So, the character's

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.569
called Alexander Trotanoy.

00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:06.170
[reads from book]
"'I lived at home with my parents well into

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:11.770
my young adulthood, Doctor. It gives me no
great pride to admit. They were a constant

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:18.920
source of anxiety and shame to me and in no
small part, due to their incomprehension of

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:24.519
the elegant nuances and extraordinary possibilities
of fine wine.

00:56:24.519 --> 00:56:31.880
“For them, the acme of oenological excellence
began and ended with Manischewitz Elderberry

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:38.249
kosher le Pesach. They were preternaturally
frugal and refused to ever throw anything

00:56:38.249 --> 00:56:44.509
away. Always decanting the unconsumed glasses
back into the bottle at the end of the yearly

00:56:44.509 --> 00:56:49.579
Seder, which was the only occasion that wine
was ever to be seen at our table when I was

00:56:49.579 --> 00:56:51.470
growing up.

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:57.170
“I'm quite sure there was but a single bottle
of Manischewitz Elderberry produced during

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:03.599
the Johnson Administration that lasted us
at least until the ouster of Tricky Dick.

00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:08.690
In recalling it now, I know it was an old
bottle because its familiar clunky square

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:12.249
shape did not have a government warning label
on it.

00:57:12.249 --> 00:57:17.220
“Though it was possible that the warning
had fallen off due to exposure to toxic levels

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:22.519
of mutant microbial life forms germinating
in the science experiment that was my mother's

00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:29.180
refrigerator. My parents were quite moderate
in their consumption, considered it extremely

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:35.150
bad form not to at least take a taste of wine
when the berakhah , or ritual blessing over

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.480
the wine, was said.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.839
“I remember one Seder when it was absolutely
impossible for me to consider tasting this

00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:49.319
impossibly disgusting liquid semi-life form
that had been decanted and recanted an endless

00:57:49.319 --> 00:57:55.930
number of times. 'Just a taste, Alex. It wouldn't
kill you,' my mother says to me.

00:57:55.930 --> 00:58:02.220
“'No Mother, I beg to differ. It would kill
me. In fact, it will kill all of us. The CDC

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.650
in Atlanta will be very interested to know
why the entire Trotanoy family of Newark,

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:13.359
New Jersey, was sickened unto death by uncontrollable
hemorrhagic bleeding from all of their orifices,

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:17.349
as well as from the formation of gangrenously
separating green pus.'

00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:22.990
“ 'Would you look at the mouth on him?'
she asks my father. 'He's such an expert wine

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:28.380
taster. I don't know what kind of palate you
have Mr. Big Shot, Mr. Wine Snob, but you've

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.480
got quite a mouth on you, I'll tell you that,
Alex.' 'Are you or are you not going to say

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.759
a barakhah and taste the wine?'

00:58:35.759 --> 00:58:40.960
“'Please, Mother. I'd rather not.' 'Are
you saying that you're too good, too refined,

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.599
too la-di-da for Manischewitz?' 'Uh, yes,
Mother, I am.'

00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:46.829
[laughter]

00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:53.180
'As your mother, I command you to taste the
wine.' This would be utterly comical except

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:58.769
for the fact that my mother, and I'm not kidding,
Doctor, my mother had taken the corkscrew

00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:04.900
into her hand and was holding the business
end of it poised to my throat.' 'Just take

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:10.700
one little sippy for your mother, Alex.' My
mother was going to stab me with a corkscrew

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:14.279
if I did not take at least a little sippy
of Manischewitz." [audience laughs]

00:59:14.279 --> 00:59:15.279
[end of reading]

00:59:15.279 --> 00:59:16.279
There you have it.

00:59:16.279 --> 00:59:16.280
