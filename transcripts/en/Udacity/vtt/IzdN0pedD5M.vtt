from exploring keyword performance,
thinking about different distribution

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.720
channels, and creating a landing page
and app page, you're ready for launch.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.150
&gt;&gt; But this is still the beginning.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.510

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.400
See you there.
