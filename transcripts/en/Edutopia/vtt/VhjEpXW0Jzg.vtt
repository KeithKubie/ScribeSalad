00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:14.393
- In our school, we try to emphasize
different ways that students

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.393
can demonstrate their learning.

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:20.327
We really believe that when
students have some ownership over

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.780
how to show their learning,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
it increases engagement and
their passion in what they're doing.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
- At Kettle Moraine, we do things
a little bit differently than

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.020
the traditional high school.
We're all about personalizing

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.180
the learning plan for the kids 
to give them voice and choice,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180
in whatever way or shape
they want to learn.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.600
- Demonstrations of learning are the way

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.260
that a student will show you what it is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.420
that they've accomplished over
the course of the semester.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.775
A student may choose to
demonstrate their learning

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:56.398
by a discussion, by a presentation.

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:59.862
Students may choose to write
a paper, or create a video.

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:01.710
The possibilities for
demonstrations of learning

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.543
are endless.

00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:04.363
- As a class, we kind
of move together as one,

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:05.779
but then we're all branching out,

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.274
doing our own things for
separate periods of time.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:11.656
I really like this style of learning,

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:14.277
because I am able to showcase my talents,

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:17.114
and I don't really like
writing papers all that much.

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:19.971
I'd rather be hands-on, working
on what I want to work on,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.620
how I want to work on it.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.437
- Our pathways classes provide us 
the structure and the opportunity

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:30.605
for competency-based work,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.500
and that allows kids to
work at their own pace.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
And then, ultimately, demonstrate
that mastery when they are ready.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.693
- We're trying to get
rid of that concept of

00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:40.224
you're in the chair for this many hours,

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.124
and that's what proves
that you know something.

00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.591
Instead, it's once you
can prove your knowledge,

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.741
then we continue on the pathway.

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.292
- Each of our Pathways courses
has a set of competencies

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.764
that students have to
attain in order to earn

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:53.523
the credit for their course.

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:55.098
- In a web design class, we're looking at

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:59.505
three big competencies, which
are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.604
Demonstrations of learning are essentially

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:04.470
any form of evidence that
the student wants to turn in

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.960
to prove their competency.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.750
That gives the students a lot
of choice in what they do.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.344
In my classroom, a lot of
students build actual projects.

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:17.344
So, they'll build a website,
or they'll write some software.

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.480
The Computer Science
showcase is an opportunity

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.538
for the kids to be assessed on
their competency.

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.866
The student's job is to
explain what they've created,

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.735
look at some of the hurdles
that they had to overcome,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.610
and then they also focus in on

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.277
what those competencies were
and how they mastered them.

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:50.736
- I have a passion for computer science.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.683
I'm going to be a computer engineer major

00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:54.674
next year at college.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.634
Having these options to choose a pathway

00:02:57.634 --> 00:02:58.845
that I want to learn about,

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.428
really I think will
help me in the future.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.748
- In art, the starting level 
competencies are

00:03:08.748 --> 00:03:11.140
the elements of art and
principles of design,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.567
because that's what you're
gonna use to create all art,

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:14.590
no matter what.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.116
If the students know they're focusing on

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:19.011
something like line and
color, it doesn't matter,

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.251
necessarily, the medium or the content,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.840
it's really understanding those concepts.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.074
And then once they understand them,

00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:33.800
then they move to that next level.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.217
Then the competencies get more difficult.

00:03:40.672 --> 00:03:43.474
The critique is a
demonstration of learning.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:44.906
They've got to introduce their work,

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:46.639
talk about their competencies,

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.389
and then get their
feedback from their peers.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:57.129
Assessment for the competencies
in art is really portfolio-based.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.829
It's the whole body of
work that shows value.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.364
Students make a digital folder,

00:04:01.364 --> 00:04:03.108
and they put all of the pieces in

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:05.257
that they think meets each competency,

00:04:05.257 --> 00:04:06.483
and then we assess it.

00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.075
Some of it's through critique,
and some of it's through

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.920
individual conferencing with students.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.131
And then, once all the
competencies have a score,

00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.131
they move on to the next level.

00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:22.984
- Demonstrations of learning
are a really cool way

00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:24.992
for a student to make a choice about

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:27.479
what it is that they want to learn,

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.639
and it allows for a lot of
creativity in how they show what they know.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.120
I think the demonstration of learning
shows that passion,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.860
and really helps with student engagement,

00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:40.506
because they're really
interested in what they're doing

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:44.339
and to see that ownership over their
learning, that's really exciting.
