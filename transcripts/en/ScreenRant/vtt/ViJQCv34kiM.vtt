00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.720
Making a movie isn’t exactly cheap.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.040
Sometime hundreds of millions of dollars are
required just to produce it, with a lot more

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.809
added for marketing costs.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.640
Because of this, studios are always looking
for ways to get a little help financially.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.859
One of the most popular methods to accomplish
this is incorporating product placement within

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.859
a film.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.651
This is when corporations strike a deal with
the filmmakers to place their products prominently

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.689
on screen, offering money to aid with the
budget.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.750
There is a place for this practice, but sometimes
it causes more trouble than it’s worth.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.930
Here are 10 horrible instances of product
placement in movies.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.520
Captain America: Civil War

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.820
One of the most thrilling action sequences
in this MCU installment was the chase involving

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.710
Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, and Captain America.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.641
The three superheroes outran moving cars during
the scene, and Audi wanted to get in on all

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.641
the fun.

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:04.540
A longtime partner of the MCU, the car manufacturer
produced a television spot to tie into the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.181
film’s release, showcasing a family driving
in an Audi vehicle that’s caught in between

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.360
all the excitement.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.859
Steve Rogers is about as American as you can
get, so seeing him pimp out for German luxury

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.749
vehicles is a bit jarring.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.299
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.560
In the buildup to this highly anticipated
sequel, Samsung got to premiere an Age of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.810
Ultron trailer on their YouTube channel, so
it wasn’t any surprise that the tech company

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.039
got some screen time in the actual film.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.600
Black Widow using a Samsung tablet to examine
data about Loki’s scepter is one thing,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.100
but the brief shot of a Samsung store – complete
with an advertisement for the Galaxy smart

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.640
phone in the frame – was a bit much and
seemed like a commercial in the midst of all

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
the action.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.200
There wasn’t any real need for it to be
a Samsung store, and it was arguably a little

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.130
distracting.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.130
Star Trek

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.250
The scene where young James Kirk steals his
stepfather’s car was the perfect introduction

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.540
to the charming rogue of a protagonist.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.670
There was just one detail that didn’t sit
well with fans.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.000
As Kirk speeds down the road, he gets a call
from his angry stepfather on a Nokia cell

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.060
phone that’s mounted in the vehicle.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.160
It pulls someone out of the futuristic movie
to see a modern day product, and the familiar

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.250
Nokia ringtone just sealed the deal.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.150
The same could be said about Uhura ordering
a “Budweiser classic” at a bar.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.640
In a sci-fi movie, you have the creative leeway
to make your own products, and directors should

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.340
take advantage of that.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.340
I, Robot

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.569
Will Smith’s character had to drive around
in something in this sci-fi thriller, so the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.209
Audi concept car that had nine minutes of
screen time was understandable.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.849
What moviegoers and fans of the source material
couldn’t get over were the out-of-place

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.129
Converse commercials, in which Smith happily
boasts about his “vintage 2004” pair of

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.129
All-Stars.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.560
As we learned from Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank
Redemption, we don’t often look at another

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.959
man’s shoes, so drawing constant attention
to Smith’s footwear earned numerous eye

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.959
rolls.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.060
Why would a character so far in the future
be sporting these old school kicks?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.120
Jack and Jill

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.750
Adam Sandler is notorious for product placement,
but Jack and Jill takes the cake for the worst

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.569
instance in his career.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.170
Sandler conveniently plays an ad executive,
so the opportunities for some corporate sponsorship

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.329
were aplenty.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.989
Everything from Coca-Cola to Pepto Bismol
to Sony computers appear throughout the film,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.580
and the crux of the narrative is getting Al
Pacino to star in a Dunkin Donuts commercial.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.069
Perhaps the most egregious illustration of
product placement is Royal Caribbean, when

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.239
the movie stops to showcase all the illustrious
features of a cruise ship.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.780
Even Sandler’s biggest fans had to be put
off by this one.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.879
Jurassic World

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.900
Colin Trevorrow’s highly popular sequel
took a joking swipe at modern sponsorship

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.540
by saying the Indominus rex should be brought
to you by Verizon.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.299
While this bit of satire was humorous, it
unfortunately wasn’t present through the

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.469
rest of the film.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.299
Part of Trevorrow’s approach was to embrace
product placement, but seeing the logos of

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.920
Beats by Dre, Verizon, and Mercedes-Benz stripped
away the awe and wonder of seeing dinosaurs

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.599
come back to life.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.254
Yes, in the real world, this is probably how
it would go, but it just doesn’t sit right

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:16.250
when a blockbuster film is promoting so many
well-known brands.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.250
Transformers

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.250
The ultra successful Transformers franchise
grosses billions of dollars worldwide each

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.620
time out, so companies are always eager to
have their product associated with the films.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.680
When Michael Bay was working on the first
film, GM offered him $3 million to have their

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.810
cars serve as the robots in disguise, and
Bay happily took the money.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.220
Each Transformer models their appearance after
a GM vehicle, including Bumblebee upgrading

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220
his Camaro.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.330
They even used GM’s rival – Ford – to
play the Decepticons, highlighting the classic

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.020
Chevy vs. Ford debate in a tentpole film.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.870
Obviously, cars were needed to make a Transformers
film, but this reads as selling out, no?

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.870
Skyfall

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.520
The granddaddy of product placement, James
Bond has been selling products since the Sean

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.740
Connery days.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.590
In the 50+ years since 007 first graced the
big screen, he’s driven Aston Martins and

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.169
worn Omega watches.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.870
Perhaps the oddest bit of product placement
came in Skyfall, the first film in which Heineken

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.979
paid $45 million to be Bond’s favorite beverage.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.300
It’s quite a departure from his normal martini,
and the trademark green bottle is so distinct,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.110
there’s no mistaking it for anything else.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.419
It’s passable when Bond is relaxing on a
beach, but as MI6 tries to figure out their

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.000
next course of action, the beer sticks out
like a sore thumb.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.949
The Internship

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.949
Google didn’t fund this Owen Wilson and
Vince Vaughn vehicle, but you’d be forgiven

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.190
if you thought they did.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.611
The entire movie acts as free advertising
for the company, constantly discussing just

00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.580
how awesome Google is at everything.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:51.169
Google even got in on the creative process,
aiding with the script and scratching a scene

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.569
in which one of their self-driving cars crashes.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.520
It came across as too self-congratulatory,
and the overall message didn’t mesh well

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.449
with the brand of comedy Wilson and Vaughn
broke in with in Wedding Crashers.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:12.360
Many just saw it as one long advertisement,
and the film flopped upon its release.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.830
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.879
Zack Snyder attempted to right the wrongs
of Man of Steel’s ending by retconning it

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.830
from Bruce Wayne’s perspective in Batman
V Superman.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.169
The Gotham billionaire watches in horror as
aliens destroy his buildings, and he speeds

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.560
in a vehicle to get his co-workers to safety.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.979
His car of choice is the all-new Jeep Renegade,
but there’s a slight problem.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.669
The film’s opening sequence is supposed
to be set in 2013, when Man of Steel was released.

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.990
But this particular Jeep didn’t come out
until 2016.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.720
Bruce was driving a car that wasn’t built
yet.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.490
Mr. Wayne has all kinds of toys, but even
this is a bit much for him.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.380
Speaking of great superhero show downs, our
friends over at the CBR Youtube channel just
