00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.500
Good Lord.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.330
I thank all of you for coming
out to London for Playtime.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.130
This is my first Playtime, so
I'm kind of a rookie at this.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.040
But I've been making
games for a long time,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.910
and I absolutely love this.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.440
This is one of my
favorite topics,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.350
talking about the
games that engage us

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.670
on a daily, monthly, weekly
basis that keep us all playing

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.820
and coming back for more.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.430
So this is one of
my favorite topics.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.362
And it's an absolute
honor to be here talking

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:24.320
to you guys about this.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.480
So thank you all for coming out.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.190
And again, in case
it wasn't obvious,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.780
my name's Adam Gutterman, I
work on the business development

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.780
team at Google Play.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.600
And I focus on game
design and consulting

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.050
with developers on promoting
the best game design, best

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.133
practices on the platform.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.790
There we go.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.440
So here's the agenda today.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.660
First, we're actually
going to define engagement,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.881
because it's a pretty
straightforward topic,

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.380
but there's a couple
of distinctions

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.090
that I want to make
just to kind of level

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.674
set-- make sure that we're all
talking about the same thing.

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:57.840
And then we're going to
talk about probably the core

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.410
component here, actually
designing games for engagement.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.880
We're going to talk about
Google Play game services,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.289
which the way that Ben and
John described it just now,

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.080
it's quite obvious.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.670
It is a tool box for creating a
great engagement for your game.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.430
It is literally all the
tools that you'll ever need.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.210
And then number
four, we're going

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.543
to talk about community,
because community is very, very

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:22.370
important-- the way that you,
as developers, engage users

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.900
with your game.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.340
So what is engagement?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.250
I think everybody here
probably knows how

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.390
to measure engagement for sure.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.020
I mean, we talk about
retention rates, D1, D7, D30.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.610
And certainly one
way we figure out

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.490
how people are engaging
with their game,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.250
if they're sticking
around and playing.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.309
We talk about sessions per
day, session length as well.

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:45.100
And there's another
one that we talk about,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.570
which is like a stickiness
factor, which is Daily Active

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.380
Users over Monthly Active
Users-- DAU over MAU--

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.070
it's a percentage.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.140
But what is
engagement in essence?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.204
We know how to measure
it, but what is it?

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.620
There's actually
kind of two types

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.150
that I want to talk about.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.430
First type is direct engagement.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.220
And this is the one that we see
on a pretty much daily basis.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.760
And it's kind of
the obvious one.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.720
It's when people are
actually using your game

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.100
and playing your game.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.010
This is a game called Two Dots.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.227
This is right after
I finished level 123.

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:15.310
This is direct engagement.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.955
It's very straightforward.

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.720
It's everything players
do while directly

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.155
interacting with the game.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.530
But there's a second type--
and we'll get to that later--

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.071
but I just wanted
to call it out now,

00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:25.690
because it's also
very, very critical.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.980
I call it community engagement.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.850
Now think about it this way.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.289
Think about your hobbies.

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:33.580
And this is really interesting.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.280
I came up with this example
before I saw the opening video

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.770
that came out before Purnima
kind of gave the opening

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.930
keynote this morning.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.750
I thought about this
example about fishing.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750
And there's apparently
an incredible fishing app

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.370
out there, which is exactly
the type of thing that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.600
drives community engagement
with a hobby of fishing.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.570
So it's actually
really well timed.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.410
And it's one of those
moments of synchronicity

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.320
I couldn't have
planned any better.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.380
So for example, when I
was a little bit younger,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.780
I was visiting my hometown
of Houston, Texas, which

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.240
is right on the Gulf of
Mexico and the United States.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.850
It's a great little fishing
town right outside of it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.630
called Galveston.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.090
And my friends and I decided
one night let's just go out

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.850
fishing, because it was
just a nice beautiful night

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.220
and we went out, and we did it.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.329
We caught a 10-kilo
fish last 10 minutes

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.370
we were out on the ocean.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.510
And honestly, it was
one of the best nights

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.300
I've ever had as a fisherman.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.100
That right there, me
telling you this story

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.140
and talking about it, you
engaging with that app

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.040
that we showed earlier
today in the video, that's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.390
community engagement.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.210
It's everything that
you do when you're

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.830
engaging in a hobby or a
game when you're not actually

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.280
engaging in the
hobby or the game.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.340
When I'm out casting
my reel or when

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.520
I'm out playing Two
Dots or some other game,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.954
that's direct engagement.

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:49.620
The second type is
community engagement,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.499
but it's equally important.

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.790
We'll get to exactly why later.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.390
Designing games for engagement.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.630
So we've defined exactly
what engagement is.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.950
Now let's talk about
how to design for it.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.514
And I could go through
game after game after game

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.680
after game, and tell you
exactly how these games are

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.551
designed for engagement, but
that wouldn't be super helpful.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.050
So I've decided to
kind of narrow it

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.496
down to three
games-- three games

00:04:16.496 --> 00:04:18.829
that I've been playing for a
very, very long time, three

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.750
games that are all
very, very different,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.400
three games that have
been out actually

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.090
all for about the same amount of
time-- about a year and a half

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.560
and are all very, very
successful on Play.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.250
Those three games are Two Dots.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.670
Who here has played two dots?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.800
Raise your hand.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.470
Yeah.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.776
Like 50% of you, I love it.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:36.650
There's another game.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.358
It might be a little
bit more US-centric.

00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:41.810
It's called Family Guy
Quest for Stuff and TinyCo.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.510
Hands?

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.230
A couple of you.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.730
Love it.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.990
No.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.560
Few of you.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.059
I love it.

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.627
OK.

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.460
And the last one is
going to be Hearthstone.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.200
Who's played that
game from Blizzard?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.700
Yeah.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.199
OK.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.711
About the same
number as Two Dots.

00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:52.210
Fantastic.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.856
These three games are amazing.

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.230
They're all very,
very different.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.600
Two Dots is pretty much
as casual of a game

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.000
as you can get.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.990
TinyCo is Family Guy's
kind of a builder, very

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.610
much like a SimCity game, kind
of in that mid-core range.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.636
And Hearthstone is
almost as core of a game

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:06.760
as you see on the platform.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270
So tried to pick three very,
very different games and game

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.005
design, style, genre
across the board.

00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:14.380
So let's talk about these
games and how they're designed.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.542
This is Family Guy
Quest for Stuff.

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:21.000
I found this image
on the internet,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.870
because it's quite descriptive
of how this game has

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.320
been engaging for so long.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.520
This is a year's worth
of content in the game.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.930
We're a year and a half in,
but this is exactly one year

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.400
of content in the game.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.830
And the cycle for how this
game is operated and run

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.220
as a service.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.435
As TinyCo releases new content,
players build the content.

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:43.240
They experience it.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.073
It's a builder game.

00:05:44.073 --> 00:05:46.380
It's kind of like a SimCity
or game or a FarmVille

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.400
or something like that.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.510
Players build the content.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.968
They kind of go
through it and then

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:52.580
they have the content
in their beautiful city.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.812
And then TinyCo
releases more content.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.270
Players experience it, build
it, and kind of go through it.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.350
And this cycle continues
on and on and on.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.960
And TinyCo kind of has
to go through this cycle

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.910
very, very quickly--
every couple of weeks

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.040
release new content.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.280
And I call it, not
pejoratively, because I really

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.430
love these games, but I
call the content furnace.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.727
And the furnace, the
way it burns things up.

00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:17.310
The reason I call
it a content furnace

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.440
is TinyCo ships this content and
then players kind of experience

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.940
it.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.829
They burn it up.

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:25.120
It's just kind of like you're
putting coals in the fire

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.780
just to keep the fire going.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.940
And if you were to stop
putting coals in the fire,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.149
that furnace would
kind of die off.

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.690
It's one way to keep
players engaged,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.630
but it's very, very resource
intensive and very resource

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.210
heavy.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.820
And in that way, the
content furnace actually

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.790
doesn't scale very well.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.000
My content furnace, another
way I want to say this,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.180
it's kind of just
single player content.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.150
One piece of content equals
one piece of engagement.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.900
Once you kind of
experience it, you really

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.670
can't experience it again.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.580
It doesn't scale very well.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.650
So the question is,
when you're designing

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.595
games for engagement-- this is
one model-- but what scales?

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.220
How can you get more
bang for your buck

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.496
out of your development hour,
your development dollar?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.910
Here we go.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.264
Let's take a look at this
example from Two Dots.

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:14.680
Half of you have
played this game,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.210
so I don't need to explain
exactly what this game is

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.870
about.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.920
But it's-- for those of you who
haven't-- it's a match game.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.790
It's not unlike Candy
Crush or Cookie Jam.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.110
And matching games actually
are very much content furnaces

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.930
in their own.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.670
Cookie Jam and Candy Crush each
have over a thousand levels,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.580
which is an incredible amount
of content, each meticulously

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.880
designed and balanced.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.590
Two Dots itself has over 400.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.900
So there is definitely
a content furnace here.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.970
They release new levels.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.436
Their most highly
engaged players

00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:45.060
will go through them
very, very quickly

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.517
and then just kind
of wait around.

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:47.100
Come on, guys.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.860
Release new levels.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.526
There's definitely
content furnace here.

00:07:49.526 --> 00:07:52.100
But the story doesn't end there.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.670
Here is the most
interesting part.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.040
So again, this is my
score on level 123.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.530
It's 242.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.520
I got one of three stars.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.490
And here's my little face
on the leaderboard here.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.030
My friend Aaron actually has
a higher score than I do.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.000
And I'm beating Eric.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.880
So what can I do?

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.320
I could go on and
play level 124,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.740
continue to burn
through the content--

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.562
because it's a content furnace.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.270
But the subtle thing
that's going on here

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.360
is I'm being encouraged to
actually replay this level, two

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.120
different ways in fact.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.590
I'm encouraged to go ahead
and get a higher star

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.940
rating, achieve this
higher star rating,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.304
which is set by the developer.

00:08:30.304 --> 00:08:32.470
I'm also being encouraged
to go ahead and beat Aaron

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.350
and his little smiling
face, because he's

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.516
kind of taunting me right
there with his high score.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.890
So chasing that
personal achievement,

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.980
like a three-star
rating or trying

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.110
to beat a friend's high
score, these actions

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.030
actually drive repeat engagement
with the same type of content.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.980
This actually scales.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.670
And hence, in this way,
replayability of your content

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.690
is what scales.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.300
This is the key message here.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.150
If you want to get more
bang for your buck,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.870
for your development dollar,
for your development hour,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.070
replayability of your
content is the key.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.720
One unit of content, instead of
equaling one unit of engagement

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.230
like we saw with
the TinyCo example,

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.495
it equals many
units of engagement.

00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:21.370
Now we talked about, on
that previous slide--

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.800
let's go back to it real quick.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.175
This achievement
here-- the three

00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:26.660
stars-- it's kind of
a limited achievement.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.212
Once I hit it, I'm
actually not going

00:09:28.212 --> 00:09:29.920
to want to try to hit
that again-- once I

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.189
hit my three stars.

00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:33.230
But the leaderboard here.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.480
Let's say I do go back, and I
try to beat Aaron's high score.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.440
And I beat him.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.100
Maybe I post on
Facebook, or Twitter,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.240
or email him directly or
just run into him and say,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.070
hey, man, I beat
your high score.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.580
Well, he's probably going
to be encouraged to beat me.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.481
But maybe then Eric
gets in on the action.

00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:51.730
And this could go on back
and forth and back and forth

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.800
and back and forth
for a very long time.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.160
So whereas this personal
achievement up here

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.700
which is set by the developer
of getting up to three stars

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.250
is something that's kind of
a limited thing, high scores,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.040
in this type of competition,
infinitely scales.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.640
So we talked about
how replayability

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.700
is what actually gets
things to scale in general.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.230
Multiplayer competition--
competition in general-- scales

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.867
forever and scales infinitely.

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.450
Honestly, we could be fighting
over a high score on this level

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.230
forever.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.950
And you saw this back in the
early days of arcades, back

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.560
in the '80s when
people would go--

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.240
fighting over high scores and
their arcades and Pac-Man.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.590
And it still happens today.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.634
It's a similar system.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.940
So I promised I would
talk about Hearthstone.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.410
Here's a Hearthstone tournament.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.600
It's got this rich set of
multiplayer competition going

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.780
on right here.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.957
It's kind of amazing.

00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:47.040
Hearthstone has been around
for a year and a half,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.910
and it doesn't seem to
be slowing down at all.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.310
The question you might
ask yourself, well,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.300
should I just ship
multiplayer to my game?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.770
Is that kind of
the magic bullet?

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.907
Well, it's certainly
a good starting point.

00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:01.490
What else can you
do to actually drive

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.785
success of that multiplayer.

00:11:02.785 --> 00:11:05.410
It's a bit more subtle than just
kind of let's shit multiplayer

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.302
and see what happens.

00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:08.260
Hearthstone has actually
architected their game

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.850
in a very specific way
to drive engagement

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.840
for a number of different
users across a number

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.330
of different levels and with
different types of cadences

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:16.915
as well.

00:11:16.915 --> 00:11:19.827
So let's take a look at that.

00:11:19.827 --> 00:11:21.410
This is what I see
when I first log in

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.275
to play Hearthstone,
Daily Quests.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:27.830
I can win two games as a mage,
or a shaman, or a paladin,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.502
or a warrior.

00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:29.960
And if I went
through all of these,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.200
I can earn all this
gold-- 140 gold here--

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.710
is what it would total up to.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.850
And these carts would
refresh themselves

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.750
at the end of the
day after 24 hours.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.950
So I can come in
and kind of fill out

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.680
these quests on a daily basis.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.025
Very cool stuff.

00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:47.650
They released a
feature pretty recently

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.924
called the tavern brawl.

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:51.340
When I took this screenshot,
it actually wasn't available,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.048
but I decided to stick
with this one just

00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:54.710
to kind of show off
the cadence of it.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.110
It's a Wednesday through
Sunday competition.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.940
At the end of Sunday, the
rewards are kind of tallied up,

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.272
and your placement in the
tournament is kind of shown.

00:12:03.272 --> 00:12:04.480
But it's a weekly tournament.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.870
And I got to come back in
the day to start this one.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.795
So this type of action
here, it's a daily thing.

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:13.710
This one is a weekly thing.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.770
This is a screenshot from the
March 2015 season in the play

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.080
mode, level six, top 3%.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.550
Does anyone want to guess
if this was me or something

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.212
that I pulled off the internet?

00:12:24.212 --> 00:12:25.420
I pulled it off the internet.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.490
I'm not this good.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.540
I wish I was this good.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.870
I finished 10 once.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.410
But yeah, this ranking here
that you see March season 2015.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.550
It's a monthly ranking.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.380
So we had daily quests.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.180
We had weekly tournaments.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.200
We have a monthly ranking.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.090
And see what they're doing here.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.120
Let's look at how
they design this.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.460
They've got many modes of
play with their multiplayer,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.965
including solo play.

00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.090
They've got solo adventures
in the arena, which you

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.350
can pick up and play anytime.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.970
It's available for anybody.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.760
This is your anytime,
always-on content.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.250
You have your daily
quests, rewards

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.410
that you get on a daily basis
for engaging with the game.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.970
You have the tavern brawl,
weekly competitions.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.840
And you have the play mode for
the most core users competing

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.510
for that monthly ranking.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.200
You see what they're doing here?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.940
They're designing
their multiplayer--

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.829
they're designing their entire
game around the multiple ways

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:24.620
that people want to
engage with their game,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.200
whether it's on a daily
basis, a weekly basis,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.650
or a monthly basis.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.970
They're looking for
any way to cater

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.910
to a user that has a
particular way of wanting

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.640
to engage with the game, whether
it's super casual or super core

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.630
or somewhere in between.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.130
I think this is
absolutely brilliant.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.600
So we've talked about
quests in this game.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.730
We've talked about
multiplayer competitions

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.017
in all of these games.

00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:51.350
We've talked about leaderboards.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.397
We've talked about achievements.

00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:55.980
All this should sound
pretty familiar.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.660
We just heard her
talk about all of it.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.840
It's Google Play Game Services.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.000
Play Game Services is 100%
a tool box for developers

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.820
to develop all these
amazing features,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.760
which keep people
engaged in your game

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.330
throughout the life of the game.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.590
And I pulled these images
from the Play Games

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.160
app, which by the way has
over a billion installs.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.777
And you guys should
open it today

00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:17.860
if you've never opened it.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.140
It's a beautiful app.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.560
And it's the way
I kind of manage,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.170
the way I game as a player
on our platform, right?

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.214
Open the app to see
what's going on.

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:26.630
Let's take a look
at these things.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.660
We've got leaderboards.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.415
This is the game I
play called Threes!

00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:31.820
It's one of my favorite
casual games out there.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.680
Doug is a much better
player than I am.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.694
I'm second to him.

00:14:34.694 --> 00:14:36.610
I'm certainly incentivized
to go ahead and try

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.540
to beat his score.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.790
Here's another very, very
popular game on our platform

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.980
called Boom Beach.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.280
I've got about 48%
of the achievements.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.240
And I am slowly
working my way up.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.020
I know that John and Ben
are doing better than I am.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.880
And Quest, for
example, here's a game

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.640
from PennyPop
called Battle Camp.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.520
Anytime a new quest
shows, it shows up here

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.500
in the Play Games app.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.110
And I'm very much encouraged
to go ahead and play it.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.600
And we also have multiplayer.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.250
We have term-based and real-time
multiplayer matchmaking

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.120
that you can plug right into.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.020
And that's kind
of the key thing.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.580
We talked earlier about getting
the most bang for your buck

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.165
out of your development dollar
for your development hour.

00:15:19.165 --> 00:15:21.665
You can go ahead and build all
this stuff if you would like,

00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:25.160
but you know, to be
frank, Ben Frenkel kind of

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.940
made it very easy
for all of you guys.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.611
You can plug right
into our services.

00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:30.860
You can plug right into
achievements, to leaderboards,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.900
to multiplayer.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.610
It's all right here
and ready to go.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.280
It is the tool box that you
need to drive engagement

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:36.940
with your game.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.300
There it is.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.486
So let's go back to this
image of Hearthstone.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.110
It's a beautiful
looking terminal here.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.354
Lots of people playing.

00:15:47.354 --> 00:15:48.770
I don't even know
how many screens

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.978
that we have here, like 10
screens there or whatever.

00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:54.070
But notice there's a lot
of people that are actually

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.740
not playing
Hearthstone, and there's

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.140
a viewing screens up there.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.350
This is community engagement,
this tournament itself.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.570
People are playing and
watching and talking about it.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.260
They're not actually playing
the game, all of them.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.470
These people, as
we defined earlier,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.230
they're engaged in
community engagement.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.235
Why is this important?

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:22.690
You might have seen one
of these in the past.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.510
This is a pretty typical
marketing 101 marketing curve.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.285
This is tracking the adoption
of a product over time.

00:16:30.285 --> 00:16:32.285
You've got your innovators,
your early adopters,

00:16:32.285 --> 00:16:36.430
your early majority, late
majority and your laggards.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.330
If you've read a
Malcolm Gladwell's book,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.620
you've definitely
seen this as well.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.750
Now here's the thing.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.640
The people that influence
other people to download games,

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.850
to go fishing, to buy a
magazine, to try a restaurant,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.970
those people are
actually involved

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.680
in community engagement.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.900
And they're the influencers.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.400
They are the
influencers, the mavens

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.629
that you always hear about.

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.420
And they actually kind
of reside over here.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.135
They're the most engaged
people in whatever product

00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:07.010
you're talking about.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.319
This applies to just
about any industry.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.940
That's why this is important.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.859
When you get people
talking about your game,

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.280
when you get people posting
on various social medias

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.670
about your game, when
you get people creating

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.300
YouTube videos-- anything
that pretty much,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.260
again, falls into that category
of community engagement--

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.700
that's so critical, because
community is actually

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.110
an engagement and marketing
channel for your game.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.880
And this is the critical thing.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.200
User acquisition is incredibly
expensive these days.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.390
Sometimes it costs
upwards of $15

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.660
to get a user onto a platform
or on pretty much any platform.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.150
However community
engagement-- the fact

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.030
that it can drive new users
to your game for free--

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.840
it's incredible.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.340
It's one of the
most powerful things

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.820
that you can do to drive
long-term engagement, long-term

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.135
acquisition with your game.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.010
One last point I'd like to
make about social engagement.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.630
And I wish I knew which
community manager I was talking

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.740
to when I heard this, but it's
really, really interesting.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.930
It's kind of a very,
very critical point.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.010
We've been talking a lot
today about getting the most

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.400
out of your development
dollar, your development hour,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.020
because we're all
resource constrained.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020
The thing about community.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.930
You can develop your
community in real-time

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.390
without bothering an
engineer, without bothering

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.470
an artist, without
a product manager,

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.410
without going
through a QA cycle,

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.430
without pushing out a
release on Google Play,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.190
without going through
a review process.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.190
You can develop your
community in parallel,

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.712
in real-time as your
game is being developed.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.940
It's kind of an obvious thing.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.190
But it's also a very,
very critical thing.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.910
Your community is always on.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.150
It's always engaged.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.840
And you can always be doing
more to engage your community.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.831
And again, you
don't have to kind

00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.330
of work with your development
team, and kind of slot things,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.180
and kind of fight for resources.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.570
Your community manager
or your community team

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.705
is completely independent.

00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:12.204
And that's a pretty
critical aspect.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.960
One last thing about community.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.640
We've talked about community
in sort of that online sense.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.905
I've shown images of Twitter
feeds and talked about YouTube

00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:25.780
and things like that.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.150
But probably the best way you
can engage with your users

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.989
is in real life,
directly, one-on-one.

00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:36.530
So I want to give
the example of Glu.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.925
I've been working with Glu
for a very, very long time.

00:19:38.925 --> 00:19:42.400
And they've got two of the
biggest games on our platform,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.400
Racing Rivals, which is
the number one racing

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.490
game on our platform, and Kim
Kardashian Hollywood, which

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.480
I'm sure you all are
very familiar with.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.850
They've done community events
which I think are quite unique

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:00.260
and kind of display the power
of what community can really

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.210
bring to the table.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.814
Let's look at Racing Rivals.

00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:06.230
Again, Racing Rivals has been
around for many, many years.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.880
It started out as a Facebook
game, and now it's on mobile.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.860
And it's got a cohort
of users that have just

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.480
been playing this
game and collecting

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.365
cards for many, many years.

00:20:14.365 --> 00:20:16.240
They're very, very
passionate about the game.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.140
They spent a lot of money.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.460
They're super engaged with it.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.440
They're gear heads as
people like to say.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.770
People who are really into
cars are really into this game.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.270
So the studio down
in Long Beach,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.920
as they were kind of developing
the next suite of features,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.460
they thought to themselves,
well, you know what?

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.445
We've got a core group of people
involved in this game that

00:20:34.445 --> 00:20:36.320
should probably have a
little bit of input as

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.740
to what we develop next.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.950
Because you look at the roadmap
of things you could develop.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.480
You could develop
it in a vacuum,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.320
or you can do what Glu did.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.180
They flew out to
Long Beach-- 20 or 25

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.970
of their most highly
engaged players--

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.940
and had a round table
discussion about what should we

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.059
do next in Racing Rivals.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:56.100
And they talked about it.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.350
They kind of scoped it out.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.410
And they essentially
turned their community

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.350
into game designers.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.090
And I guarantee you, when all
those guys and girls flew back

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.240
to their home states
and home cities

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.680
or whatever, they
probably spread

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.680
the gospel about Racing
Rivals and said, listen,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.952
I had this amazing experience.

00:21:13.952 --> 00:21:16.410
So I went out to Long Beach,
and sat with the Racing Rivals

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.930
team, and helped
them design the game.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.730
And I guarantee you,
beyond just engaging

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.110
those players and their friends
in a deeper, deeper level

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.834
in the game, that word spread.

00:21:25.834 --> 00:21:27.250
I'm spreading it
to you right now.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.640
This right now is community
engagement in Racing Rivals.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.820
Similarly with Kim Kardashian,
they had a contest in the game

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.920
and flew out some of their
most engaged young players

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.082
in the game to meet Kim.

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:41.540
They didn't talk
about game design.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.940
It was just a meet-and-greet.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.690
But I guarantee you, every
single one of those people

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.720
that flew out and
met Kim, myself

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.070
included-- you can look at
pictures later on my phone

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.819
if you would like.

00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:51.690
Come find me later.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.060
I wasn't allowed to
put them up here--

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.820
I guarantee you every
single one of them

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.280
is spreading the
gospel about this game.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.700
This kind of IRL, real
world community events,

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.720
where you meet your consumers,
and you talk to them directly,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.760
and you get their feedback,
this is the most powerful type

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.900
of community engagement
you can really drive.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.620
And it pays back in spades.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.380
That's all I have for you today.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]
