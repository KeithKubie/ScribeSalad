00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.990
Back in the introduction, we spoke
a little about the various programming

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
models that you'll use when
building Android applications.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.800
And in particular,
using Services to build them.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
One pattern that is
available to developers for

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.450
a synchronous programming in Android
is when you use an IntentService.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.650
When using these, clients send requests
through a method called StartService.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.100
And if needed,
the service then starts and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.940
it handles each intent in
turn using a worker thread.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.870
It captures all of these in
the onHandleIntent override and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.740
when it runs out of work,
it will simply stop itself.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.490
This design pattern is commonly
called a work queue processor and

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.330
it's often used to offload tasks
from an application's main thread.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.880
We'll be using one in this sample but
I won't go into depth on how it works,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.670
just on how we can use it for
our own needs.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240
If you're interested on how
it works on a deeper level,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.130
take a look at the resources
in the instructor notes below.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.830
Let's get started.
