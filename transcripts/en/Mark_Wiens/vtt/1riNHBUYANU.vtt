00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:10.969
I just got off the BTS skytrain at Mo Chit
station and I'm on my way to the Chatuchak

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.580
Weekend Market which is one of the biggest
shopping destinations in all of Bangkok.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
So, this is a wild shopping place, if you
love to shop, you're going to want to visit

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.619
Chatuchak Weekend Market.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.119
Attracting an estimate of over two hundred
thousand shoppers each day of the weekend,

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.600
traffic along the road just outside the market
can be a little hectic at times.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.120
Chatuchak Market weekend market, which is
also known as JJ Market, includes over five

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.340
thousand permanent stores, and if you count
the makeshift stalls and hawkers that inevitably

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.870
sprout up within and around the market, the
number of vendors is closer to fifteen thousand

00:00:45.870 --> 00:01:08.090
- you heard right fifteen thousand and that
makes it the largest market in Thailand.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.740
Though it may take some getting lost and confusion
to find, no matter what you're searching for,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.500
there's something tucked within the jungle
of stalls that will cater to your interest.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.360
Are you in the market for a Hello Kitty dress?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:44.710
It will be one hundred and sixty baht, which
is about five dollars.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.750
One thing you can be certain about is it will
be hot when you visit Chatuchak Market and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.319
you're going to need to refuel with lots of
beverages.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:00.240
This is something called nam bai bua bok,
and it's a very healthy green.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:12.220
Yup, tastes like a bottle of grass, but it's
not bad, it's very healthy, you can just taste

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.570
the earth, the earthy taste of this juice.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:31.810
If you happen to be on vacation in Thailand
and want to bring back a puppy, you can even

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.760
come to Chatuchak and get yourself a brand
new dog.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.820
If you should happen to find a shop you really
love, like Odd's Shop for instance, and want

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.200
to return to that same stall, just remember
its assigned address within the alleys of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.540
the market.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.570
Every few meters on the main pathways of Chatuchak
is a Thai style popsicle seller.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.130
Little metal test tubes are filled with pure
sugar water of different colors, then flash

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.840
frozen by turning the metal pan back and forth.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.270
For just four baht you can have a few bites
of sweet frozen water on stick.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:19.819
Okay so four baht for a little popsicle, wow,
it's like frozen sugar, very sweet.
