00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.290
Now let's have a little more fun by
combining operators and assignment.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.990
Let's create a variable called
totalPayroll and set it equal to zero.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.080
Let's also create some other
variables to hold the salaries of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.120
three hypothetical players
on say an athletics team.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.090
One way we could calculate the total
payroll with salaries is to do this,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.920
which isn't too bad.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.160
It all fits on one line, but

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.050
in certain cases we may only want
to add one salary at a time.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.280
And if we were to do this then
our calculations would change to

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.310
say something like this.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.600
And in this case we add one salary
at time to the existing value of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.260
the total payroll.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.060
So this isn't too bad.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.800
If we want out of one at a time, but
we can do better than this by combining

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.450
assignment and
the plus operator all at the same time.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.380
And we can do this by using
the operator we want, in this case,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.570
the addition operator
followed by an equal sign.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.540
And while this may be
confusing at first,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.550
let's look at how the operator
reads from left to right.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.468
First we want to add to our existing
value and then we want to assign.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:09.092
And we can also do this with
other operators like subtraction

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:12.301
multiplication division and
the modulus operator.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.459
So I go ahead and fix this up, and
now we get the same value by combining

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.720
the addition and assignment for
this addition assignment operator.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.039
If you want to see this with a different
operator, we can change all the signs to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.176
subtraction signs, and
now our total payroll is -2,500,000.

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:32.489
And this would be more appropriate
if we wanted to show the deficit

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.540
after paying our players, as opposed to
the total payroll that we saw earlier.
