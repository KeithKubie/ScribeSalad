Hi there, this is Xiaoyu Wang,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
co-founder and CEO of CastBox.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.050
Two years ago, when I made the CastBox prototype as a personal developer,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.300
I could not have predicted the podcast market would grow this rapidly.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.620
Google's technology and platforms has given CastBox the chance to evolve and grow on a steady pace.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.130
Now, it is actively providing for over 7 million users the contents they love.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.740
The team also grew from a single person to a group of 40 in less than two years.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.890
Since launch, the quality of our product keeps improving, and the app’s review has been great.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.530
Not long after CastBox was launched, a blind user from Russia even sent us a thank-you letter,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.390
stating that millions of audio contents helped to bring her information across the world.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.710
Fascinatingly more, CastBox received Google Play Awards 2017 Nominee for Standout Startup,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.540
and as a result, the public got to know who we are.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.060
My name is Xiaocong He, co-founder and CTO of CastBox.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.380
My job is to optimize content value by utilizing technology.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.290
TensorFlow provides multiple algorithm model,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.490
and made our recommendation process more precise

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.720
When user first log in CastBox,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.280
they can customize their initial recommended contents based on their interests.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.130
Then CastBox would combine listening data and user behavior,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.930
to best personalize the recommendation experience for individual user.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.200
Content to user, the precise two-way paring,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.430
drove CastBox to have a 70% Day 2 DAU Retention Rate.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.380
The average daily usage time reaches over one and a half hours.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.600
Also, with Android Instant App,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600
people can use CastBox without it being installed on devices.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.460
This dramatically decreased the barrier for users to stay connected with content.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.050
I’m Shibin Li,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.060
co-founder and CMO of CastBox.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.530
The full realization of CastBox also requires engagement with content creators,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.400
so that we can establish a healthy content eco-system.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.040
We provide two monthly payment models based on Google Subscriptions:

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.940
The first being channel-driven payment; Second being separate subscription based on functionality.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.200
The flexible subscription solutions

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.650
not only provide directed services towards our heavy and normal users,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.290
but also give us insights to understand deeply about their needs.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.940
Google’s technology has provided a profoundly solid foundation for our success.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.130
Over 80% of our users come from the Android platform.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.640
And we are dedicated to bringing more functions to our users,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.490
provide the best catered content recommendation and the optimal listening experience.
