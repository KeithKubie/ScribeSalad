00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's take a minute to look at reliability in blackboard architectures.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.600
In a blackboard architecture,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.160
the independence of the components can increase system resilience.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.260
That is, the system may continue to function in a degraded fashion if one of

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.700
its components breaks.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.450
On the other hand, because there is no overall definition of system behavior, it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.260
may be difficult to identify the cause of a problem when something goes wrong.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.928
As far as an advantage is concerned, access control and

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:31.150
the blackboard architecture's enhanced because there's a common data repository.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.810
On the other hand,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.630
the flexibility of a blackboard architecture allows for the dynamic condition of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.210
new components which may reduce confidence in overall system security.
