00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.530
The answer is 14/3 which is
the same thing as 4 1/3 rooms.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.450
To solve this, I first found a rate,
which is the rate that Taylor and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.590
Grant can paint a room,
which is 2 rooms in 3 hours.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.220
And I set that equivalent to another
rate, which is x rooms in 7 hours.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.840
X because we don't know how many
rooms they can paint in 7 hours.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.500
Again, notice that the numerators
have the same units,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
they're both the number of rooms.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.910
And the denominators have the same units
as well, they both are number of hours.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.791
Next we cross multiply, so
I'll multiply 2 rooms by 7 hours, and

00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.928
I'll set that equivalent to 3 hours
times x rooms 2 times 7 is 14 and

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:45.348
that's equivalent to 3 time x.

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:49.831
Divide both sides by 3 cross
out the 3 in the numerator and

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:54.605
the denominator here and
we're left with x equals 14/3.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:57.159
