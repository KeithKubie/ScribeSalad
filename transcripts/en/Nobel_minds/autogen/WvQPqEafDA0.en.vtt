year's price is about prices and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750
year's price is about prices and
 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.680
year's price is about prices and
financial markets and financial market

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690
financial markets and financial market
 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.960

prices are absolutely crucial to the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970
prices are absolutely crucial to the
 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.240
prices are absolutely crucial to the
economy because the prices of assets

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250
economy because the prices of assets
 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.090
economy because the prices of assets
like stocks bonds and real estate they

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100
like stocks bonds and real estate they
 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.760
like stocks bonds and real estate they
give important signals to firms in what

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770
give important signals to firms in what
 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.410
give important signals to firms in what
they should be investing in they give

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420
they should be investing in they give
 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.270
they should be investing in they give
signals to households and what they

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
signals to households and what they
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.850
signals to households and what they
should save in and they also affect how

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
should save in and they also affect how
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.800
should save in and they also affect how
much risk is taking investments and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
much risk is taking investments and
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.740
much risk is taking investments and
savings in the economy so because of

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750
savings in the economy so because of
 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.510
savings in the economy so because of
this importance of asset prices it's

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
this importance of asset prices it's
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.610
this importance of asset prices it's
very important to understand how well

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620
very important to understand how well
 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.550
very important to understand how well
these financial markets work in pricing

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560
these financial markets work in pricing
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.580
these financial markets work in pricing
acids now if we look over history we

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
acids now if we look over history we
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.740
acids now if we look over history we
often see very large fluctuations an

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750
often see very large fluctuations an
 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.530
often see very large fluctuations an
asset prices up and down and one example

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540
asset prices up and down and one example
 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.840
asset prices up and down and one example
could be you know during the late 90s we

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850
could be you know during the late 90s we
 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.180
could be you know during the late 90s we
saw technology stocks reach record highs

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190
saw technology stocks reach record highs
 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.970
saw technology stocks reach record highs
and then if you laterz dramatic drops in

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980
and then if you laterz dramatic drops in
 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.100
and then if you laterz dramatic drops in
these prices so it's very important to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110
these prices so it's very important to
 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.600
these prices so it's very important to
understand whether these fluctuations

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610
understand whether these fluctuations
 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.120
understand whether these fluctuations
and prices are a sign of something not

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130
and prices are a sign of something not
 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.060
and prices are a sign of something not

markets because to the extent these
 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.180

fluctuations are due to miss pricing

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
fluctuations are due to miss pricing
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.890

they could have large negative effects

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900
they could have large negative effects
 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.920
they could have large negative effects
on the economy now when you want to

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930
on the economy now when you want to
 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.590
on the economy now when you want to
understand how well asset prices work

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600
understand how well asset prices work
 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.920
understand how well asset prices work
and predictability ie whether you can

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820
issue and the picture you see here may
 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.300
issue and the picture you see here may
look like a stock price index but as a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310

matter of fact is a completely random

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
matter of fact is a completely random
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.780
matter of fact is a completely random
series is what happens if you flip a

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790
series is what happens if you flip a
 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.000
series is what happens if you flip a
coin a number of times and you count the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010
coin a number of times and you count the
 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.280
coin a number of times and you count the
number of tails minus the comp number of

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290
number of tails minus the comp number of
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.370
number of tails minus the comp number of
heads so this is a series that you may

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380
heads so this is a series that you may
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.900
heads so this is a series that you may
see some patterns in but it's completely

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910
see some patterns in but it's completely
 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.200
see some patterns in but it's completely
random series now it turns out that if

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210
random series now it turns out that if
 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.650
random series now it turns out that if
financial markets work well we would

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660
financial markets work well we would
 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.290
financial markets work well we would
actually expect stock prices for example

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300
actually expect stock prices for example
 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.909

particular firm is going to be higher in
 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.130
particular firm is going to be higher in
the future because the price will

compensation for risk so assets that are

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470
compensation for risk so assets that are
 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.190
compensation for risk so assets that are
more risky for investors they're going

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200
more risky for investors they're going
 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.170
more risky for investors they're going
to be less likely or they are less

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180
to be less likely or they are less
 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.420
to be less likely or they are less
willing to invest in those assets and to

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430
willing to invest in those assets and to
 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.100
willing to invest in those assets and to
induce investors to do that they need to

induce investors to do that they need to
 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.690
induce investors to do that they need to
get a higher return for more risky

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700
get a higher return for more risky
 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.430
get a higher return for more risky
assets so we would expect stocks have a

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440
assets so we would expect stocks have a
 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.430
assets so we would expect stocks have a
higher return because their risk here

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440
higher return because their risk here
 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.260

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.710
are going to do in the future based on
historical stock price patterns and as

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720
historical stock price patterns and as
 

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.510
historical stock price patterns and as
we said earlier you know if markets work

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520
we said earlier you know if markets work
 

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.700
we said earlier you know if markets work
well historical prices really shouldn't

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.710
well historical prices really shouldn't
 

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.800
well historical prices really shouldn't
have much to say about how prices are

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:27.810
have much to say about how prices are
 

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.420
have much to say about how prices are
going to move in the future and that's

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:29.430
going to move in the future and that's
 

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.760
going to move in the future and that's
indeed what Jean farmers early studies

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:31.770
indeed what Jean farmers early studies
 

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.839
indeed what Jean farmers early studies
found he also helped developed a new

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:35.849
found he also helped developed a new
 

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.980
found he also helped developed a new
method to focus on how quickly does new

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:39.990
method to focus on how quickly does new

information get incorporated in prices

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.330
information get incorporated in prices
 

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.450
information get incorporated in prices
so if markets work well we would expect

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:44.460
so if markets work well we would expect
 

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.190
so if markets work well we would expect
new information that's relevant about

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200
new information that's relevant about
 

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.770
new information that's relevant about
the stock to be more or less instantly

study they're called events studies and

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:56.649
study they're called events studies and
 

00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.619
study they're called events studies and
this particular event study looks at how

00:08:58.619 --> 00:08:58.629
this particular event study looks at how
 

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:01.049
this particular event study looks at how
do stock prices react when firms

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:01.059
do stock prices react when firms
 

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:02.549
do stock prices react when firms
announced that they're going to increase

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:02.559
announced that they're going to increase
 

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.199
announced that they're going to increase
their future dividend okay so that's

00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:04.209
their future dividend okay so that's
 

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.249
their future dividend okay so that's
something good that should make this

00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:05.259
something good that should make this
 

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:07.980
something good that should make this
talk more valuable and as you see the

basically see no particular trend before
 

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.850
basically see no particular trend before
you see a rapid adjustment and no

research that in pharma pioneered was

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:36.069
research that in pharma pioneered was
 

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:37.889
research that in pharma pioneered was
really incredibly influential and

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:37.899
really incredibly influential and
 

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.710
really incredibly influential and
surprising to people at the time and but

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720
surprising to people at the time and but
 

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.199

by the after these studies and let's say
 

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:45.419
by the after these studies and let's say
by the mid to late 70s was pretty much

much predictability in prices now the

person who sort of changed the views for
a lot of people here in this respect was

00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839
a lot of people here in this respect was
 

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:02.609
a lot of people here in this respect was
Robert Shiller now unlike Jean Pharma

00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:02.619
Robert Shiller now unlike Jean Pharma
 

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:04.230
Robert Shiller now unlike Jean Pharma
Robert Shiller looked at predictability

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240
Robert Shiller looked at predictability
 

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.319
Robert Shiller looked at predictability
over longer horizons let's say years or

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:07.329
over longer horizons let's say years or
 

00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:12.569
over longer horizons let's say years or
even decades and the first revolutionary

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:12.579
even decades and the first revolutionary
 

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.699
even decades and the first revolutionary
finding at the time he found was that it

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:14.709
finding at the time he found was that it
 

00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:17.639
finding at the time he found was that it
looked like financial market prices

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:17.649
looked like financial market prices
 

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.919
looked like financial market prices
let's say stock prices were much more

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:19.929
let's say stock prices were much more
 

00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:23.249
let's say stock prices were much more
volatile they move much more than the

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:23.259
volatile they move much more than the
 

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:26.009
volatile they move much more than the
underlying dividends did and this was a

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:26.019
underlying dividends did and this was a
 

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:28.049
underlying dividends did and this was a
pricing because actually the if markets

00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:28.059
pricing because actually the if markets
 

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:29.669
pricing because actually the if markets
work well we would probably expect the

00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:29.679
work well we would probably expect the
 

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.650
work well we would probably expect the
opposite we would expect dividends and

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:31.660
opposite we would expect dividends and
 

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.239
opposite we would expect dividends and
earnings to move around much more than

00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:33.249
earnings to move around much more than
 

00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:37.710
earnings to move around much more than
stock prices they then went on together

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720
stock prices they then went on together
 

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.629
stock prices they then went on together
with co-authors to show that this high

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639
with co-authors to show that this high
 

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.090
with co-authors to show that this high
movement in stock price which basically

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.100
movement in stock price which basically
 

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.489
movement in stock price which basically
what that means is that sometimes stocks

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:44.499
what that means is that sometimes stocks
 

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:47.009
what that means is that sometimes stocks
become very expensive compared to the

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:47.019
become very expensive compared to the
 

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:48.900
become very expensive compared to the
underlying dividends and sometimes talks

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:48.910
underlying dividends and sometimes talks
 

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.809
underlying dividends and sometimes talks
become cheaper compared to underlying

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:51.819
become cheaper compared to underlying
 

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:54.900
become cheaper compared to underlying
dividends and this actually implied that

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:54.910
dividends and this actually implied that
 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.239
dividends and this actually implied that
you could predict future movements in

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:57.249
you could predict future movements in
 

00:10:57.249 --> 00:11:01.499
you could predict future movements in
stock prices so this picture here shows

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:01.509
stock prices so this picture here shows
 

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:02.850
stock prices so this picture here shows
you a measure

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:02.860
you a measure
 

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.130
you a measure
how quote-unquote cheap or expensive

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.140
how quote-unquote cheap or expensive
 

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.770
how quote-unquote cheap or expensive
stocks are it's basically taking the

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:07.780
stocks are it's basically taking the
 

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.450
stocks are it's basically taking the
dividends of the stock more US stock

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:09.460
dividends of the stock more US stock
 

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.400
dividends of the stock more US stock
market and divide that by the value of

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.410
market and divide that by the value of
 

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.680
market and divide that by the value of
the US stock market so when this is high

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:13.690
the US stock market so when this is high
 

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.410
the US stock market so when this is high
when the dividends / prices are high

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.420
when the dividends / prices are high
 

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.810
when the dividends / prices are high
rock stocks and Sampson's are relatively

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:18.820
rock stocks and Sampson's are relatively
 

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.300
rock stocks and Sampson's are relatively
cheap while other periods you know we

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.310
cheap while other periods you know we
 

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.060
cheap while other periods you know we
see the late 2000s during the technology

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.070
see the late 2000s during the technology
 

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.430
see the late 2000s during the technology
boom dividend / price is very low

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440
boom dividend / price is very low
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.620
boom dividend / price is very low
because prices of stocks are you know

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.630
because prices of stocks are you know
 

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.160
because prices of stocks are you know
very high now if you take this measure

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.170
very high now if you take this measure
 

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.810
very high now if you take this measure
dividend over price and then you see

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:33.820
dividend over price and then you see
 

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.730
dividend over price and then you see
does that say anything about how stock

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:35.740
does that say anything about how stock
 

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.340
does that say anything about how stock
markets will behave in the you know next

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:38.350
markets will behave in the you know next
 

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.830
markets will behave in the you know next
few years it turns out it has a very

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:40.840
few years it turns out it has a very
 

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.310
few years it turns out it has a very
strong predictability pattern here so in

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320
strong predictability pattern here so in
 

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.740
strong predictability pattern here so in
periods when stocks seem relatively

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:46.750
periods when stocks seem relatively
 

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.660
periods when stocks seem relatively
cheap the dividend divided by price is

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:48.670
cheap the dividend divided by price is
 

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.930
cheap the dividend divided by price is
high you see in this this line is sort

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:51.940
high you see in this this line is sort
 

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.120
high you see in this this line is sort
of the seven year returns on the stock

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.130
of the seven year returns on the stock
 

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.830
of the seven year returns on the stock
market following this particular year

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:55.840
market following this particular year
 

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.840
market following this particular year
you see much higher returns in the stock

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:57.850
you see much higher returns in the stock
 

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.760
you see much higher returns in the stock
market following periods for dividends

00:11:59.760 --> 00:11:59.770
market following periods for dividends
 

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.430
market following periods for dividends
over price is high and vice versa okay

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440
over price is high and vice versa okay
 

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.050
over price is high and vice versa okay
so this was you know a very important

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.060
so this was you know a very important
 

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.390
so this was you know a very important
finding it changed the views on

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.400
finding it changed the views on
 

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.520
finding it changed the views on
predictability of a lot of people the

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:14.530
predictability of a lot of people the
 

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.200
predictability of a lot of people the
question is how should you interpret

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.210
question is how should you interpret
 

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.870
question is how should you interpret
this now if you look at farmers findings

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880
this now if you look at farmers findings
 

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.150
this now if you look at farmers findings
of not no predictability in the short

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160
of not no predictability in the short
 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.190
of not no predictability in the short
term they were more easy to interpret

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200
term they were more easy to interpret
 

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.480
term they were more easy to interpret
that these long term predictability

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:24.490
that these long term predictability
 

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.750
that these long term predictability
pattern because of the long term prices

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760
pattern because of the long term prices
 

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.970
pattern because of the long term prices
could be predictable not because there's

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:29.980
could be predictable not because there's
 

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.830
could be predictable not because there's
something wrong with them but actually

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:31.840
something wrong with them but actually
 

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.250
something wrong with them but actually
because they reflect changes in how much

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:35.260
because they reflect changes in how much
 

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.740
because they reflect changes in how much
compensation investors need for risk so

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:37.750
compensation investors need for risk so
 

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.330
compensation investors need for risk so
it could for example be that when stocks

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:39.340
it could for example be that when stocks
 

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.190
it could for example be that when stocks
are cheap and you see subsequent high

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200
are cheap and you see subsequent high
 

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.410
are cheap and you see subsequent high

very interested in investing in stocks

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040
very interested in investing in stocks
 

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.740
very interested in investing in stocks
they're very averse to the risk in the

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:46.750
they're very averse to the risk in the
 

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.270
they're very averse to the risk in the
stock market and because of that reason

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:48.280
stock market and because of that reason
 

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.580
stock market and because of that reason
you see a high return so there was a we

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:53.590
you see a high return so there was a we
 

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.230
you see a high return so there was a we
have a standard model for this is called

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240
have a standard model for this is called
 

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.360
have a standard model for this is called
the consumption cap em that basically

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.370
the consumption cap em that basically
 

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.730
the consumption cap em that basically
predicts this pattern in in prices

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740
predicts this pattern in in prices
 

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.470
predicts this pattern in in prices
however these models are very hard to

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480
however these models are very hard to
 

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.500
however these models are very hard to
test because they are hard to solve they

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.510
test because they are hard to solve they
 

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.390
test because they are hard to solve they
often rely in order to solve them you

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:09.400
often rely in order to solve them you
 

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.980
often rely in order to solve them you
need to make very specific assumptions

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:10.990
need to make very specific assumptions
 

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.140
need to make very specific assumptions
about how you know the model works

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.150
about how you know the model works
 

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.360
about how you know the model works
and the relationships you get out of

and the relationships you get out of
these models are very nonlinear and

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.140
these models are very nonlinear and
 

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.470
these models are very nonlinear and
complex so it's hard to test them and

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480
complex so it's hard to test them and
 

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.450

economics he then went on to take his
 

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.560

new theory and test this standard model

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:56.570
new theory and test this standard model
 

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.820

to be consistent with the theory so

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:19.400
to be consistent with the theory so
 

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.310
to be consistent with the theory so
basically this this first test actually

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320
basically this this first test actually
 

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.430
basically this this first test actually

a million different things I was
 

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.900
a million different things I was
attracted to economic I think because it

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:12.910
attracted to economic I think because it
 

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.900
attracted to economic I think because it
deals with really important problems

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:15.910
