00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.756
- [Kurt Braunohler]
Soggy log, June 1st.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.392
I've ridden 250 miles
in the last two days,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.028
and we've only raised $10,000.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.332
It's only enough to send 100
goats to families in Africa.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
How do I get people
excited about this mission?

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe I just haven't done
enough for people right here,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.572
in the good ol' U.S. of A.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.141
Time to change that.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.977
(energetic music)

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.550
(singing) ♪ Personal watercraft.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.787
♪ Personal watercraft.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.923
So we met Kaylee
the night before,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.292
and Kaylee tells us
that she's graduating

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.528
from high school
the very next day.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.930 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we're just
like, "Oh, Kaylee."

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.133
"Do you wanna ride a
jet ski to graduation?"

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.401
(audience laughing)

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.804
And Kaylee's like,
"Fuck yes, I do!"

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:14.107 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like a caterpillar
coming out of a cocoon,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.577 align:start size:97% position:3%
high school graduation is
maybe the most important time

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.512
of a young lady's life.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.449
Until she experiences
anything after that.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.349
Hey Kaylee!

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.517
- Hey!

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.351
You're my ride, aren't ya?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.186
- I'm your ride.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.120
- All right.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.621
- All right, get on here.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.757
You're gonna graduate!

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.460
Welcome to being an adult!

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.462
It's all as good as this!

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.897
(cheering)

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.166
Kaylee's ready to
get wasted tonight!

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.267
- Hell yeah!

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.402
- Hell yeah!

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.336
- Hell yes.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.838
- [Both] No more school!

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.239
No more school!

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.308
No more school!

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.375
- You can do anything you want!

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.477
Who ya gonna vote for now?

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.112
- I don't even know politics.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.247
- Who gives a shit?

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.715
- Not me!

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.550 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Kaylee, what're ya
gonna be when you grow up?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.886
- A nurse practitioner.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.255
- Now that you're 18, you
can totally milk a cow.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.189
- I can milk a cow.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.457
- You legally can milk a cow.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.625
That's one of the laws
of the United States.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.927
- Are you being dead serious?

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:08.761
- Nope.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.263
- Oh. (laughs)

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:10.797
- Nope, no, I think you can
milk a cow whenever you want.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.998
- Okay.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.566
- And then I drop her
off at graduation,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know, like, ready
for her to just transform

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.805
into the nurse practitioner
she was always meant to be.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.807
And it was like my jet ski had

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.576
become this weird,
wet cocoon, y'know,

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.512
and Kaylee had got
on a caterpillar,

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start position:0%
and got off a butterfly destined
to get wasted in the woods.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.550
(audience laughing)

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.619
It was beautiful.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.988
And then the whole thing was
we're gonna go to Kaskaskia.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:94% position:6%
Kaskaskia is the smallest
town in Illinois.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.491
And it's fascinating.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.160
This place used to have
thousands of people,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.129
and then the Mississippi
changed direction around it

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.532
and killed everyone in the town.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.967
And now there's 14 people left.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.602 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then I'm gonna
give them this present,

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start size:88% position:13%
like I have a big
surprise for everybody.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.140
Here we are in Kaskaskia.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.610
I'm gonna try and meet every
single person in Kaskaskia.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.412
And give 'em bundt cake.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start size:97% position:3%
And invite them to a gift
that I'm giving to the town.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.485
(knocking)

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:15.328 line:0%
- I've got a bundt cake for
everybody, just as a gift.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.832
- I've got a bundt cake for

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.234 align:start size:84% position:16%
everybody who
lives in Kaskaskia.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.268
- Well, thank you!

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.703
- You're welcome!

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.038 align:start position:0%
I've got cameras just following
me because I'm jet skiing

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.306
from Chicago to New Orleans,

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.907
and I happened to
stop in Kaskaskia,

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.142
and I found out that it is

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.577
the second smallest
town in Illinois.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.614 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There's only three,
five, maybe eight

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:35.548
of us that lives here.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.983
- I thought it was 14.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:37.984 align:start size:94% position:6%
So you guys are the
smallest town in Illinois.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.085
- I mean, someone's moved out.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.653
- Oh yeah, someone moved out

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.755 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you actually got it
back to the smallest town.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.823
Have a good day!

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.158
- Yeah, you too.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.095
- Only eight.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.497 align:start size:88% position:13%
So what's interesting
is, talked to that lady,

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.066
eight people.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.934 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's only eight
people, which is perfect,

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.704
'cause we only have
nine bundt cakes.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.673 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I think we can
literally meet everyone.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.275
There's a house, let's
see if anybody's home.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.744
(knocking)

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:05.578
- [Man] Hello there, hi.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.679
- Hi, how are you?

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.147 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Real good, you?
- Good.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.415
I'm just going around trying
to meet everybody in Kaskaskia,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.150
and I wanted to give
you this bundt cake.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.418
- Okay, well I'll say thank ya.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh you're welcome.
- Appreciate it.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.554
- I brought you a bundt cake.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Woman] Oh, well,
they're delicious, yes.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.523
- Here ya go.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He belongs to a
neighbor down the street.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.261
(laughing)

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.963 align:start size:88% position:13%
- This town used to
have 7,000 people in it.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:27.166
And then the Mississippi river
changed direction around it,

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.135
wiping it out, and
it's only because of

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.471 align:start size:84% position:16%
one piece of concrete
that it doesn't

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.107 align:start size:84% position:16%
successfully destroy
it every year.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.276
But then every 20
years, it does!

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:40.213
Never been to a house that
starts on the second story.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.047
Hello!

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:41.981
- [Woman] Hello!

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.316
- [Kurt] Bundt cake delivery.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.150
Thanks, guys.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.618
- Thanks, take care.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.187
- [Kurt] So everybody's been
pretty overwhelmingly friendly.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was more expecting if you
live in a town with 14 people,

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.760
that you kind of,
maybe, hate people?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.094
But maybe it's the opposite.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.796 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a choice,
because you want to

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.331
live somewhere that you love.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.633
And I respect that,
I like that a lot.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.302 align:start size:84% position:16%
It feels weird
saying to everybody,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.971
without telling them what
it is: I got you a gift.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.407
It sounds like I'm a lunatic.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.075
But...

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.345 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't want to tell
them what it is.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.681
I want them to be surprised.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.552 align:start size:97% position:3%
All right, on count of three
you're gonna turn around,

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:22.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we will reveal
the gift to Kaskaskia.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.056
One.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:23.990
Two.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.824
Three.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.292
Turn around.

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.960
(laughing)

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.462
(townspeople cheering)

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.264
- [Woman] They got
kitties, Mary Ellen.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.032
- [Woman in Hat] How did
you happen to get cats?

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:33.866
(laughing)

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.401
She's our cat person.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.403
- [Kurt] Well, that'll be up
there, at least for a month.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.005 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Woman in Hat] That's
great, well thank you so much.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.074
- Thank you guys so much.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.509
Thank you guys so much,
let's come in for a huge.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.744
- To Kaskaskia!

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.646 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The biggest little
town in Illinois.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.814
- [Man] Ready, on three.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.015
- Put it in, one, two, three.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:49.849
- [All] One.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.683
Two.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:51.517
Three.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.352
Kaskaskia!

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:58.124
- These people live in a
town that completely floods

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.126
every 20 years.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:03.463
I mean, I expected to either
find grade A fuckin' lunatics,

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.199
or morons, like a
bunch of dumb birds

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
who keep makin' their
nests in a canon, y'know?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.972
But instead I found
the kindest people.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.208
People who loved
where they lived,

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.844
even if it might kill them.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.112
(audience laughs)

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.013
And I get that, that's
cool, I'm from Jersey.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.683
We're the same way.
(audience laughing)

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:26.085
Fuckin' right on, Kaskaskia.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:27.687
Long live the Boss.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.289
Kaskaskia taught me a lot.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.225
If you just reach out to people,

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.760
don't be scared to talk to them.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.028
Even if they only live in
a town with eight people.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.464 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're still
gonna be very happy

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.533
to have a conversation with you,

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.969
especially if you got a cake.
