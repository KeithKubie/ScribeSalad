00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.080
Parasites have a nasty reputation - but is
really fair to fear these little guys?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.009
Well, yes - and if you don't think so, here's
why these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.410
at all costs!

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.559
As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes
- when they bite humans they can leave larvae

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.920
of the parasitic Filarial Worm.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.020
These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes
taking years to mature into full adults, leaving

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.880
only inconspicuous rashes and sores.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.610
Years later, they work together to block the
vessels of your lymphatic system, creating

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.210
a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases
like elephantiasis.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.570
This is one of the leading causes of disability
in the world.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.500
Another worm worth hating is the pinworm.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.739
Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated
or dirty hands.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.980
The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at
which point the adult female exits the anus

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.899
to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding
skin.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.329
Your butthole becomes a nest!

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.210
This causes intense itching, often leading
to re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.379
can end up in your mouth again, restarting
the cycle.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.659
Feel like scratching your bum?

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.929
Do yourself a favour and wash those hands
and fingernails!

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.560
On the other side of the body, live the lovely
pubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940
Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers
in your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.790
The itching is from an allergic reaction to
their saliva, and it'll take treatment with

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.590
medication or shaving it all off to get rid
of them.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.470
Of course, abstinence or no sex works well
as a preventative measure, along with not

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.040
sharing your undies with other people.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.930
Some parasites are meant for marine animals,
but end up in humans out of the goodness of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.140
our...gut?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.740
The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after
eating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.450
- which contains the larvae.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.750
The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause
abdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.610
But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode
can't mature in a human gut and eventually

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.610
dies.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.890
The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.330
This tongue eating louse finds a suitable
fish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.020
on to the stub in it's place.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.690
Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,
all the while mating and dispersing their

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.540
progeny into the ocean.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.540
And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which
are fungi known for creating zombie ants.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.840
The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,
making it leave the colony and begin climbing

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.860
upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.099
The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and
gets locked into position until it dies.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.550
At which point, the fungus bursts through
the ants head and spreads outward.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.069
Could such a parasite ever affect humans?

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.230
For everyone's sake, we hope not!

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.409
Our friends at James Cook University helped
us put this horrifying list of parasites together,

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.099
with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate
Hutson.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.610
JCU is one of the world's leading institutions
focusing on the tropics with an opportunity

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.239
to study in a diverse physical environment
unparalleled by any university in the world.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.819
I actually studied there for a semester abroad!

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.799
