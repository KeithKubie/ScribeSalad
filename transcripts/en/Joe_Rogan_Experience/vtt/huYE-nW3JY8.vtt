00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.410
Eva Roots, ladies and gentlemen. Hello sir? A brother. What's going on?

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.430
Everything and nothing. Everything and nothing. Yeah. You tell me your,

3
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.130
this is a crazy time for you. You, your vagabond and you traveling around man.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.500
The gypsy. I like the term no man. No bad's good. Vagabond makes.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.810
Is that like I'm pulling, I gotta stick with it, but yeah,

6
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:26.530
those kind of Baghdad nomads. Like a gypsy with money. Yeah. No,

7
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:29.680
but Gypsies over, is that a derogatory term you didn't use to be,

8
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:34.390
I think it might be now they can say it like king of the Gypsies is Tyson fury.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.360
He's allowed to say it. He's allowed to say it might be one of them things.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.430
Yeah, we got wear it like that. A lot of people do. Those words are expanding.

11
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:47.020
There's more of those words than before. Can can say,

12
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:50.230
I'm gonna get in trouble right now. Can they just call themselves?

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.090
I don't know man. I don't know. That's a good one. That used to be a normal one.

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.800
You know, if you know what's really crazy,

15
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.430
if you look at when kids had were born with downs syndrome,

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.820
the original term was mongoloid idiot.

17
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.180
That used to be like they would put that on birth certificates

18
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.750
like, like when you say the original term, any of those people still alive?

19
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:16.060
Like is that still on somebody who's alive? Birth certificate.

20
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.390
That's a good question. Do people with downs syndrome live less?

21
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.990
They don't live as long, right? I think that's the case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:25.180
Do you want, you don't see a lot of older people

23
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.760
don't know this. Like we're tightening up the word.

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.750
I just can't wait till we can read minds.

25
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.080
So this all this nonsense just go out the window.

26
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:38.440
I think once we could read minds and then you just see intent and there's no

27
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.441
like words like cause right now it's just words that convey intent.

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.710
Some of those words are forbidden but some of those words have like bitch

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.270
perfect example. Like you could say that was a bad bitch. This bitch is crazy.

30
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:56.710
Like this bitch is fine. You know, you could say this bitch is hot,

31
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.120
this bitch is cool. That pitches so cool. Or You could say, oh my God,

32
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.320
this girl's a bitch, you know? Yeah. The connotations completely deaf.

33
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.770
There's so many of them. There's so many different ones where it's man,

34
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.490
where is it? A high thing. I remember one time Mickey Chill, Mickey, Joe,

35
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.350
Shelley and Mickey Call Joe.

36
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.120
Shelley and I were talking about about words and perceptions and like,

37
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.110
like your shirt, your shirt is green. Right.

38
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.280
But if I would be in your consciousness,

39
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.420
well I see your shirt and what I see it as as you read, but I,

40
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.050
I know it is green. You know what I mean? To me for sure.

41
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.910
Same colors are the same thing. No we don't. You have no way of knowing. Right,

42
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.410
right.

43
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.530
I have no had knowing what like some people were into weird shit like yellow

44
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:42.970
cars. Right. That's not weird though. That's weird.

45
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.410
All the colors to paint a car. Like why the fuck do you want a yellow car?

46
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.240
Like a nice car. Like you see like a yellow corvette. Like,

47
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:54.070
what the fuck are you doing to that corvette?

48
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.850
I swear you would go to say something different. I swear. I was like,

49
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.960
he's like people listen to people in the weird,

50
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.070
I thought you were going to say like

51
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.540
<v 1>scat or something. They're definitely into that. The yellow cars.</v>

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.520
That's not so bad. Yeah. But I mean I don't know what they're seeing.

53
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.490
Like to me a yellow car is like Ah, it's unfortunate,

54
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.980
you know like why would you do with that coverage?

55
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.830
Like maybe it was us on sale cause it's a shitty color.

56
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.690
I think that so yellow class should cost less. Yeah, for sure.

57
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.470
Yeah.

58
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.240
Unless you're just trying to make a point like your car is like a bumblebee or

59
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:25.691
something,

60
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.890
you know like you have black stripes and yellow and see how it'd be cool on a

61
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.610
bug on a Mustang. I don't know what else.

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.970
I think those are the only two cause they really should be yellow. A Mustang.

63
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.820
Like if you've got a painted like with um, some flames on it.

64
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.050
I don't even like you don't like mustangs? I'm not a big muscle car guy.

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.790
I do like sports cars. I'm not crazy about muscle cars. Somebody needs doctrine,

66
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.920
nature to the world of muscle cars that you just haven't seen the right ones.

67
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:52.090
You know, I think,

68
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:56.770
I think that comes from where I grew up because like you need a lot of open road

69
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.780
to that and we don't have that in the Bob. And like,

70
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:03.220
especially now where I'm from, like I am not a big fan of, um, of like choppers.

71
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.600
I'm not, I don't want those seem silly to me. Like you can't turn. Yeah,

72
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.930
I like crotch rockets and, and dirt bikes. This shit drives me crazy

73
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.600
handles and you're holding if for people just listening,

74
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.040
they have handlebars that are above your fucking head. Yeah. You're, hey,

75
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.440
you're driving around like this and you, if you have to turn quick your fuck,

76
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.340
how can you get away from shit? And once it goes bad it'll like you,

77
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:30.070
you're not gonna recover. Yeah.

78
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.390
I would think they would have like a secondary handle that you would have to

79
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.690
ride like that. You get tired. I have some shit right over the gas, foals out.

80
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.651
Maybe we can do that.

81
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.110
We could patent that and make that and probably make millions of dollars.

82
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.781
Somebody like skill.

83
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.990
That crotch rocket seems safer because they're more maneuverable. Yeah.

84
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.050
Like you can handle those motherfuckers. Those things move good. Yeah.

85
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:53.200
Especially, I mean as what they designed for. If you control it of high speed.

86
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.930
I saw this video of a, of a motorcross,

87
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.780
I don't know what you call when crotch rockets are racing,

88
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:02.320
but these guys were racing and the students that he was losing it and he got

89
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.020
thrown off. I saw that. But he was on his knees sideways.

90
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.770
He hung on their man and it looks like he was still giving it the gas. Yeah.

91
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.610
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what the rules are or like cutting the track.

92
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.680
Right. But like if, if that, if he wasn't disqualified, that was an Indian move.

93
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.320
How do you get back on though? You'd have to slow down. You have to, right?

94
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.650
You got to do the Ninja move. You gotta hit the brake real hard.

95
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.160
So you slamming, then you, your body shoots into data land back on the bike.

96
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.700
The break and pop your hips up at the same time,

97
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.910
like something you'd see on fast and furious. I'm scared of bikes.

98
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.120
I don't know how to ride. You know? I mean, I could ride a bicycle,

99
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.000
but I can't ride a motorcycle. I can't ride a car.

100
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.670
I've never written a crotch rocket. I only written scooters. You know what?

101
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:45.940
They're making them electric now. You won't even, there's no gears.

102
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.740
It's just like a Tesla. But I don't, I don't like, I don't know.

103
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.570
The whole thing about riding a bike is being able to control it, isn't it? Well,

104
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.380
you can still control the speed, but you're not going to be able to shift gears.

105
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:57.980
You don't have to

106
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 0>do the shit with your left foot where you're going with the clutch and up and</v>

107
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:03.440
down, all that jazz. You have to learn how to do that.

108
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.580
You don't have to do that with one of those things. It's brain. Yeah,

109
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.860
that'd be fucking ridiculously fast too.

110
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.330
<v 1>I feel like I would be like the guy on and you know,</v>

111
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:13.190
and like when you go to David,

112
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.680
<v 0>most of the stuff on the motorcycle video. Yeah, yeah. In the,</v>

113
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.060
in Europe they're making cars like electric cars have noise.

114
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.450
You have to have noise, like a regular car so that people could hear you.

115
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.810
That's dumb. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean you're not riding on the sidewalk,

116
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.690
right? Yeah. Well I, yeah, I mean I guess it's,

117
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.670
if people are crossing streets and shit.

118
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.530
<v 1>Um, maybe also, I don't know what the,</v>

119
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.450
what the rules in Europe offer ride motorcycles. But um, I dunno.

120
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.210
Do you hear guys when they're riding on the, on the, in between lanes?

121
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.230
You know what I mean?

122
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.260
<v 0>I don't hear them all the time. There's a lot of times where you don't,</v>

123
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.870
you have to look in la. That's such a,

124
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.320
when I grew up in Boston and you couldn't do that, that's not legal.

125
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.100
Everybody has to stay in the lane. Really? Yeah. In Texas it's legal. Oh,

126
00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:01.840
is splitting lanes? Yes. I don't know how often it's legal versus illegal.

127
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.900
Well, there's a lot of states that don't even, you don't have to wear helmets.

128
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.220
Yeah. Texas was one of them.

129
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:09.970
I don't know if that's changed and the Louisiana has one. That's crazy.

130
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.290
When I was in my last time I was in Miami,

131
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.960
I was watching dudes fly by me on the highway with no hell. And I'm like,

132
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.350
oh no though. I mean, do you, do you want a helmet on?

133
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.740
You hit something at 90 miles an hour. I don't know. Um,

134
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.080
I mean yes and no. It's like, I think sometimes people make it,

135
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.090
you know? Yeah.

136
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.900
But like what about you get all that pain was as Jamie [inaudible],

137
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.820
California remains the only state to allow lane splitting. Oh Wow.

138
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.560
<v 2>So I guess is no longer that. I think you can just do it whenever you want.</v>

139
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:44.440
It's on the motorcyclists to be risk at your, and you take your own risks. Oh,

140
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.030
<v 0>so account in California is legal. Yeah. But in all the other places it's just,</v>

141
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.260
you just kind of do it probably. I mean, yeah,

142
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.720
<v 1>where it says immediately crossing the state line. There is,</v>

143
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.650
nobody crosses the state

144
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.430
<v 2>out here too. I don't know. Maybe it's partially legal there or something.</v>

145
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.900
Certain cities areas. Yeah. Freeway maybe only or something

146
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.260
<v 1>like, um, traffic laws. It's weird. Traffic laws being different,</v>

147
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.020
like so different in every state. I was,

148
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.040
I'm in Texas a couple of days ago and I'm driving and I'm getting over cause the

149
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.660
cops pull somebody over. I'm on the highway and passenger.

150
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.680
She's like, why are you getting over? Like you don't have to do that.

151
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:29.560
But in Texas you're supposed to, if you, if you can get over,

152
00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:31.480
you're supposed to get over and give them that lane birth.

153
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.220
Otherwise you slowed out to like 10 miles below the speed limit or whatever. Um,

154
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.200
but like in DC, Maryland wishes from, it's like you don't have to do that.

155
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.390
Like, but it's like if I'm from, if I'm from Maryland,

156
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.770
I'm in Texas and I do that and then another cops behind me,

157
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:50.460
I'm getting a ticket. Cause if you don't know the law, it's not the law.

158
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.200
It's still not their fault. Right, right. It's your fault for not following

159
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 3>the Hong Kong protests that are going on. No,</v>

160
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.770
this crazy protests going on in Hong Kong. But what's, uh,

161
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.820
amazing is there was an ambulance and the ambulance was trying to,

162
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.530
I mean this giant crowds in the street.

163
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.860
I mean fucking thousands if not a million people. Right.

164
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.540
They part like the see for this, for this ambulance. It's crazy.

165
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.450
Like if that shit was happening in America, good luck.

166
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:21.600
You can blow that horn all you want. What does this, Jamie,

167
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.730
you're gonna have to run this it. Yeah. Mm. Why?

168
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:30.450
It's, why does it say north point, not like Chinese characters on the street?

169
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.050
Yeah. You sure? This is the one, I mean,

170
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.400
Hong Kong protest is Bockwoldt may wait for him. I saw an overhead shot of it.

171
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:43.401
It was more impressive because it was this giant sea of people and they all just

172
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.770
made way and everybody got right the fuck out of the way for ambulances.

173
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.090
It's like when a predatory fish swims to like a small school. Oh, here it is.

174
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.780
This, this is what I saw. Yeah. So these people just open up.

175
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.430
Good luck trying that shit in America. I mean,

176
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.940
these people were so polite. Millions of protesters.

177
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.730
They're like two to 3 million or something. Yeah. What do they do?

178
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.410
You know what they're protesting over. I can't,

179
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.390
there's so much outrage worldwide. I can't keep track man. Yeah.

180
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.560
There's stuff going on everywhere.

181
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:16.620
You see that there's this stuff in Sudan right now. Everywhere.

182
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.670
You know every part of the world is up in arms, Gaza.

183
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.970
There's a bunch of shit going on in there and going off every new,

184
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:28.140
more recent shit. It's exhausting.

185
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.010
I was like, why can't people just not be assholes? Right. That's impossible.

186
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.190
That's what we need. This mind reading software.

187
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.810
The problem with that is like then you just reading the mind of assholes. Maybe,

188
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:40.681
maybe,

189
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:44.940
but maybe people can let you know like hey man do you don't have to think like

190
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:45.420
that.

191
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.070
Your problem is the way you thinking cause it's 90% of the problem with people's

192
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.560
the way they think and then they act on the way they think.

193
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.580
I Dunno if at 90% of them are really not a mathematician just threw that number

194
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.470
out there. They get to locked up.

195
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:02.010
Yesterday I showed you is sort of on the way to what you're talking about,

196
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.120
how your friends can play a video game together using only your minds. Okay.

197
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:09.330
This is what you were talking about after the show. Telepathic communication.

198
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.390
Yeah. This is, this is the future. 100%.

199
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.440
There's going to be a time where we share some sort of,

200
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.290
I think it's going to be some sort of a universal language.

201
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:23.430
They're going to create a language, it's based on images or,

202
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.460
or things that are culturally like you could,

203
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.460
it could cross boundaries like people from other countries is going to be able

204
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.091
to understand that.

205
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:36.270
You'll be able to understand it has like Google translate in it. Yes.

206
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.730
I really think that, I think there's gonna be a language.

207
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.860
I mean like do you ever see someone's tweet?

208
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.040
I read tweets from people all the time from different countries.

209
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.710
It's kind of cool that you could like read some Russian,

210
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.910
see some Russian shit and then just say translate the tweet and you get a chance

211
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:54.130
to try to figure out what this guy is saying. Yeah, I've seen

212
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.220
<v 1>that a couple of times. And then, especially with, um, some of my teammates,</v>

213
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:01.090
friends, Brazilian guys, and um, they will have it in Portuguese,

214
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:04.700
but they will also translate have it in English. Brazilian girls do that.

215
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.000
But then when you translate it, it'll like,

216
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.300
it moves words that are already in the English translation.

217
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.630
It makes it like screwed up. It makes it like the grammar is all messed up.

218
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.930
It's really weird. I Dunno why,

219
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:18.790
why it even touches the English if you bring it to that language, you know,

220
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:20.620
that's the problem with languages, right?

221
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.080
Like the way they say things is different.

222
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.880
And so trying to translate something to English,

223
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.860
you have to take some sort of editorial license.

224
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:29.770
You'd have to move things around. What you're trying to say is this,

225
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.860
you can't just translate it. Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:37.861
Especially because of like where we place like prepositions and like there are

227
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:41.500
some like, um, there are some languages where they don't have the word off.

228
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.510
Like don't, they don't, they don't say turn off the light.

229
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.340
And it's like when they said when they speak in English, they say,

230
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:50.110
kill the light, you know? Well, that's the way,

231
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.950
I mean, you could still get it, but yeah. That if they don't have an off word,

232
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.690
like I would imagine that Asians,

233
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.580
like Asian language is going to be the hardest, right.

234
00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:01.560
Because they have characters, they don't even have letters, you know? Yeah.

235
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.010
They, their alphabet so much,

236
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:06.250
so much bigger and their characters can mean so many different things.

237
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.820
This little piece of a character combined with this changes everything.

238
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.680
It changes each one individually.

239
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.750
Like it's like this one is water and this one is fire and you put them together

240
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.350
and it's chocolate. When you were fighting, what was the place you,

241
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.310
how many times, different times did you travel overseas to fight? Seven,

242
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.340
six or seven, something like that. Was there any, what was the weirdest place?

243
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.020
Weirdest. Most different was Japan, but, um,

244
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.270
I wouldn't say it was weird. Just different. Just different. Yeah,

245
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.710
very different. It was like being in the future sometimes. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

246
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.490
Tokyo. Yeah. You're like, I don't know. It was a lot of fun.

247
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:43.324
The different things they do.

248
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.150
They're the weirdest thing about being over there was that, that Pachinko game,

249
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.380
like what's Pachinko gets like these people they play, they,

250
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.570
it's like a gambling game and um,

251
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:57.571
they have these buckets of like ball bearings and I put them in the game and I

252
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:00.100
don't, I don't even know what the rules are.

253
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.340
But you see like older and middle aged Japanese people,

254
00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:07.510
they just sit there for hours just playing and you win. And it's like,

255
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:11.020
I'm like winning a slice, like a slot machine kind of. Right. So when you win,

256
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.450
like you get a bunch of these, these balls back, I swear to you if you like,

257
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.790
I don't know if Jamie pulled up like something, but it's,

258
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.330
I think it's p a Chenko Oh, sorry.

259
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:24.331
Here's a guy who's hands biggest gaming obsession explained Pachinko they're

260
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.680
like putting ball-bearings in there and they just go for all words.

261
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.680
That's what many people are wearing masks.

262
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.830
That's the other weird thing about the age. You're right.

263
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.470
They know a lot of people like to wear those masks. So, so that's the game.

264
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.160
That thing that they're this weird, how's it work? Did you play it?

265
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.910
No, I mean, I don't know. I don't know what you're trying to do.

266
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Like everything's in Japanese. That's the currency for the game.

267
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.760
Those ball-bearings I don't understand. Can't believe,

268
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.830
I'm just finding out about this and you'll see,

269
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.950
you'll see somebody sitting there and they will have buckets like,

270
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.390
like this big like square rectangular buckets and they'll have like two or three

271
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:06.140
stacks of them next to them and they just reached down and drop them in the

272
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:08.900
machine and that's how they play. I don't know what they're doing though.

273
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.290
I don't understand it at all. I want to play it, but then I'm like,

274
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.300
you look stupid. I don't want to win ball bearings. What am I going to do?

275
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:15.134
Put it in my car.

276
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.110
<v 3>Yeah. What the fuck look at that is so strange.</v>

277
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.220
A buckets guys just taken fists of ball bearings and throwing them into this

278
00:15:23.221 --> 00:15:25.680
machine and then the bounce it around like a,

279
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.440
like a pinball machine turned up on its side.

280
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.320
<v 1>Yeah, I, I don't, I don't understand it at all. I don't know. Like,</v>

281
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:34.370
what's the value on this

282
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.260
<v 3>all there, dude, I don't look, every time I go to Vegas,</v>

283
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:43.040
every time I go through casino I freak out. I just, I just see those people.

284
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:47.570
I feel like they're wasting their life playing those goddamn slot machines.

285
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.800
Yeah. Yeah. That's the first time I went to, the first time I fought in Vegas,

286
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.170
I, um, I played a slot machine. Um, as the only time I,

287
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.130
I did the first time I gambled like in The Bahamas when I was growing up.

288
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.020
Also Bahamians couldn't even gamble in The Bahamas.

289
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.770
But then I came here and I was in Vegas and I was like, I want to play slots.

290
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:07.380
But I was like against gambling. So I played the nickel slots for awhile.

291
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.540
How about 20 bucks a N***a slots? I Bet I'm shaking my, my,

292
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.740
my winnings and people's faces like, oh, that's hilarious.

293
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.360
You got to go to like circus circus at some place to play the nickel slots.

294
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.870
Do you ever go to that place? I bet, yeah. I've stayed at circus circus,

295
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:23.660
but that's a window into history. Yes.

296
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.810
I go to circus circus every time I go to Vegas with my kids,

297
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.600
because my youngest daughter likes going there.

298
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.290
She likes playing all those stupid carnival games. She thinks it's hilarious.

299
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.140
She's nine, you know? Yup.

300
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.020
She likes shooting water at the thing and the pops and all that stuff's,

301
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:40.220
we always go there, but it's always,

302
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:44.900
and then they do like a circuit show or they'll have like a clown and trapeze

303
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:49.460
artists, but it's like, no disrespect, but it's kind of second rate,

304
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.890
you know, like the trapeze guy's got a gut. Yeah. Well, I mean,

305
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.620
you know, he's a little thick around the Middle East.

306
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.080
His best days of flipping around to the air over he's got, yeah, the big gut.

307
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:07.730
The long arms. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

308
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.910
I don't know, it's especially when you compare, when you say second rate,

309
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.660
especially when you compare it to like blue man group or what's going on at like

310
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:19.460
Mandalay and GM or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean a, it's,

311
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.660
you're, you're still on the strip. You're not on Fremont. Like Freelon is like,

312
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.280
Fremont is like, like second rate Vegas. It's very different.

313
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.960
Very weird. I um,

314
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.440
I remember and like I know how many probably kids in flack for this,

315
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:36.240
but I gotta tell you this story. Like I'm, I'm a,

316
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.170
I was there one time and I'm telling my friends about like, I'm like,

317
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.160
this is weird cause like I've never really been to Fremont until this time in

318
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:46.340
Vegas and I'm just like, man, why aren't we on the strip?

319
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:48.650
This is just so weird being out here. What was there for some fights?

320
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.130
I was like, everything is just a little

321
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.430
<v 1>different. I mean like everything's really like everything's really different.</v>

322
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:55.950
I mean look like even the women like look at that girl, she's like,

323
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.370
she's so like [inaudible] she hasn't got a great body. Right? It's like so fine.

324
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:03.330
Then she turned around and she's like, her face is just like ruined, you know?

325
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.070
Like it's not my fault. I mean she wasn't attractive to me and she,

326
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.620
I'm sure she's attracted to somebody.

327
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.730
It's hard to say that these days you used to be able to say someone's ugly.

328
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.280
You can still say it. Dude's ugly. Nobody gives you a hard time.

329
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.820
You can still say a dude's fat or a dudes ugly. Everybody's like, fine,

330
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.780
no problem. Fat All the time. No one has a problem with that. Yeah.

331
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.200
Fat and ugly for a guy, it's fine. But if you say a girl's fat,

332
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.990
your body shaming, if you say she's ugly,

333
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:32.610
you're a fucking sexist piece of shit and you're objectifying her. Yeah.

334
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.210
I, it's, it's really hard. I mean like, there was this,

335
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.900
there's this lady who's a, who's a singer, her name is Lizzo, right. Um,

336
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.970
Big Lady, uh, a bigger lady, a plus size woman. Right. And, um, she,

337
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:49.770
that woman that was on the bet awards, she's fucking talented. Yes.

338
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.380
Woo. Right. And like, see, here's the thing, like Jesse,

339
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.780
she's a plus size woman. Um, some people think she, that's overweight,

340
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:00.810
but I'm like, she's not obese. So it's like, I mean, she,

341
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:05.130
she's like gross grotesquely obese. I guess that's how you'd say grossly obese.

342
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:08.460
She could lose a few pounds. She could if she wanted to, but like there's there,

343
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.620
there like there's, there's definitely some,

344
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.730
there's definitely plenty of guys in the world who that suits, you know, um,

345
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.640
there are some guys my size with that suits.

346
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.400
There are some guys who are like linebacker alignments size who that suits,

347
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:22.710
but then there are, they're like, nobody,

348
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:24.240
nobody complains about the petite woman.

349
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:28.810
But like what about like the big linebacker guy who was into petite women? Like,

350
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.530
yeah. Well, you know that dude the mountain from game of Thrones,

351
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.590
his girlfriend or his wife or whatever she is, she's like three feet tall

352
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.800
and he's a fucking child. Yeah. Yeah. Like you see that sometimes.

353
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:44.280
I think the guy that played Chewbacca, like the original Chewbacca,

354
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:48.180
I think his wife was, was a tiny woman. Like not like a midget or anything,

355
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:52.920
but I'm in trouble now. Yeah,

356
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:56.520
there's a, that's the mountain. Wow. That guy actually, you know what,

357
00:19:56.521 --> 00:20:00.720
she might be normal size. Yeah. He's so fucking big,

358
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.470
which she's going to be heels on there at a gala, but uh,

359
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.070
he's so fucking big like that right there. That looks like me.

360
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:12.480
With my nine year old. Yeah, it does. It does. That's height wise.

361
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.790
That guy is so God damn biggest ridiculous.

362
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:17.760
Like if you cut off his body where her head is,

363
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.080
he would still probably be twice her size. Twice her weight. Oh yeah. For sure.

364
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.760
Yeah. A big fella. Yeah.

365
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:29.250
He's always entering those strong man competitions.

366
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.870
These the most ridiculous thing to watch. You know, whenever I'm like bored,

367
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:38.340
flip it to the channels and I catch some dude throwing a beer barrel over over a

368
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.870
pole. You know there's always a suspended pole thrown over the top of it.

369
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:46.770
Like a, like a high jump pole. So ridiculous. Yeah,

370
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.130
I but those, those

371
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.170
<v 4>kind of type of competitions you talk about like,</v>

372
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.430
like that there's that and then you have that for the athletic or dynamic people

373
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:55.540
like American Ninja Warrior.

374
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.680
<v 3>Yeah. Oh that's an intellect. That's fucking interesting man. Yeah.</v>

375
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.230
Those Ninja Warrior and warrior shows are crazy.

376
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.010
Watch those guys you love that is some serious fucking athleticism too.

377
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.770
We'll do that.

378
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.230
<v 4>Yeah, that, that, that, that's a whole sport now.</v>

379
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.840
Like they create gyms based around that and people that are like,

380
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.510
like training for it. I do with a training. Yeah.

381
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.160
<v 3>For the trials. Yeah. No I can imagine there's probably you up.</v>

382
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.840
I wonder, I'd like to know like who's the best at that weight class wise.

383
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.620
I bet it's guys that are like 160 pounds and under. Yeah. Cause Yeah,

384
00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:27.540
you carry yourself easy. Cause we,

385
00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:30.920
we did a study on fear factor once where you had to a,

386
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.890
they were suspect they were off a bridge and they had to hold,

387
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.860
just hold themselves like on a chin up bar over a bridge.

388
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.480
And the girls all beat the guys wait. They were just hanging,

389
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.140
just hanging, not just himself. Nope. Wow. Okay. Just hanging. Huh?

390
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.310
Just holding on. The girls all beat the guys, the all three guys fell.

391
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.820
Now it's like, part of me was like, maybe these guys are just bitches.

392
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.870
But part of me was like, well the thing is like the guys,

393
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.340
they're pretty big dudes.

394
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.750
They're all around 200 plus pounds and uh, you know,

395
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:08.220
that's a lot of weight in your hands. And the girls are like one 2110,

396
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.250
one oh five, it's not as much weight.

397
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.910
<v 4>There's, there's uh,</v>

398
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.180
a genetic thing between men and women where there are some things that like we

399
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.230
all, we, we see these in sports and whatnot.

400
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.360
There are some sports that are just much more fun to watch when men are playing

401
00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:24.010
or some sports for fun with women playing.

402
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.890
There are some sports that are both right. Right. But um, there was something,

403
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.330
I forget the test exactly,

404
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:31.840
but it's something about leaning over and picking up a chair.

405
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.650
There's a certain posture that you're in and men can't do it, but a women can.

406
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.340
Huh? Like you can't end, but it's like a folding chair, like very,

407
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:44.090
very light chair. Um, I don't know. I don't leaning over and picking up. Yeah.

408
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.130
Like you're leaning, I think you press your head onto the wall,

409
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.650
but arch your back in a certain way and you,

410
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:52.870
you just have to use like your lats basically.

411
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.630
You pick up the chair and you and men can't do it. Really? Yeah.

412
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.440
<v 3>Her weird. Yeah. It's cause it's like a center of gravity tests.</v>

413
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.110
I remember just to say, you leave your butt. Oh yeah. You know,

414
00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:03.030
my daughter tried to show me this the other day.

415
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.550
She tried to get me to touch my toes with,

416
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.820
keep my back flat against the wall of the back of my legs against the wall and

417
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:11.100
go down and touch your toes. You just fall forward. Yeah,

418
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.260
<v 4>that's, that's, let's see. I had it all backwards. I'm like, Hey,</v>

419
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:15.850
you put your butt against the wall, not your head.

420
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.570
Sticking my butt up against stuff. Let me see

421
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.920
<v 3>that. Let me say tricks. Guys. Can't do stand three feet away from a wall.</v>

422
00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:27.870
Bend over. Put your head against the wall.

423
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:31.090
Now try to stand up while lifting a chair. Oh No, you had it. Okay.

424
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.290
That was a couple of different places. So yeah,

425
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:35.580
a couple of around the center of gravity though. Oh yeah.

426
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:39.330
That's the one I'm going to try. I feel like I could do that. That's, that's,

427
00:23:39.331 --> 00:23:41.670
that's what I said. Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

428
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.710
I don't think I'm being cocky and saying I could do that.

429
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.860
But what if a guy's got like really core strength?

430
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.970
I don't think it has nothing to do with that. Yeah.

431
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.590
Just all about center of gravity. Yeah.

432
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.640
Cause I think not most guys black like you take a bunch of fit guys.

433
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.760
They have a good strong core. They can't do it and they can't do it.

434
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.140
Like it takes an average woman. Congratulations on your victory ladies.

435
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.250
You got us on one. Yeah, I don't,

436
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.630
I don't want to stay. That's what it was. Sensitive subjects where I'm like,

437
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:14.700
I don't want to say anything smart ass or anything, any kind of way.

438
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.050
Cause I get myself in trouble. So much trouble to get into today.

439
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.480
So many different things people get mad and upset about. They did a test with,

440
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.080
uh, the way that men and women do a one legged squat.

441
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.570
And I guess the way that each of us would go down,

442
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.240
it's completely different when you,

443
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.430
when you break it all the way down to that move. Oh, so like the mechanics,

444
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.580
is that because of the hips, muscle structure, everything? Yeah,

445
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.190
it probably is that with women, the, the,

446
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:43.580
it's so different the way the shape of their hips. They'll like the mechanic,

447
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:46.340
like women kicking. That's one.

448
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.360
Like for every Valentini shift Chanko that can knock someone out with one kick.

449
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.210
Yeah. You would think that a woman, right?

450
00:24:52.211 --> 00:24:57.211
Take 140 pound woman who is carrying 140 pounds with her legs all the time,

451
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:00.050
going up flights of stairs, running,

452
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.210
doing all these different plyometrics and shit.

453
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.640
You would think that bitch could be able to kick a fucking hole through.

454
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:06.710
You see there's another use of the word bitch.

455
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.750
That's okay that it's out of respect. That's not a, that's not derogatory.

456
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.200
But no. Like if you see a girl kick a bag,

457
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.970
like there's a giant difference between 140 pound girl kicking a bag,

458
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.760
140 pound guy. Big Difference. And now, now,

459
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:27.560
is it mostly technique or is it, you know by, I think it's biomechanics.

460
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.570
I think it's technique. I think it's just muscles. There's,

461
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.500
they're just built different, there's just different muscles.

462
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.640
Like the hips are like this, right? Yeah. Tip. Especially for minutes,

463
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:38.690
wide hips, right.

464
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.480
Or their hips go out wide and their legs kind of go in a little bit.

465
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.920
Where's it got? I wonder if that's responsible for the, what do they call that?

466
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:46.880
The male spread.

467
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.710
When dudes sit on a sit on the subway and they spread the legs,

468
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.000
the man spread. Yeah,

469
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.860
they man spread and people get real mad cause they want to sit next to you and

470
00:25:56.861 --> 00:25:59.360
your legs are all splayed out. You're being rude.

471
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.630
But if a dude has no one next to him, that's how they sit. Their legs spread.

472
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.500
I don't think women sit like that. I don't think,

473
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.580
I don't think it goes that way. No, I don't like sitting like that.

474
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.740
It's like as I sit and like I've sat in coach most of my life,

475
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.710
you know, and like that's, that's, it's uncomfortable.

476
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.380
Like when you have to sit like that for an extended amount of time,

477
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.280
it's really uncomfortable with the legs pinned together. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird.

478
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.090
Yeah. And then there are some times, but after a while you just, you,

479
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.220
you just feel uncomfortable inside your pants and you got,

480
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.650
you had to move stuff around. You can't even open your legs to do that.

481
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.340
But with women, I think that's a normal way to sit.

482
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.600
I think their body naturally with their hips in a shape that there are,

483
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:45.870
the legs kind of go towards other, they kind of point towards the knees.

484
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:49.960
It's more normal for them to sit with their legs together, the think. Hmm.

485
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.470
Does that make sense? It makes sense. I just,

486
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:57.140
I wonder if it has to do with anything that the equipment down there also

487
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.580
probably has to do with not wanting to be a ho. Right.

488
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.540
[inaudible] sit like this with your legs spread. If a dude sits like that,

489
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:06.810
that's a confident man. But if a girl is sitting there with the legs, be like,

490
00:27:06.811 --> 00:27:09.030
look at this bitch. There's another use of the word bitch.

491
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.840
This isn't a scientific article explaining manspreading.

492
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.640
This is a spinal neurosurgeons explanation. Spinal neurosurgeon Johns.

493
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:21.810
The overall width of the pelvis is relatively greater in females and the angle

494
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:23.970
of the femoral neck is more acute.

495
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:29.210
These factors could play a role in making a position of sitting with the knees

496
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:32.130
close together. Less comfortable for men. Exactly.

497
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.340
So all you man spreading people that are shaming men for sitting in a natural

498
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:42.390
way. How dare you. You should be ashamed of yourself. I'm offended. Yeah.

499
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.970
I can't wait until women have all the powers so we can just start shitting on

500
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:49.410
them. So here's a subtle subtlety,

501
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.280
subtle thing about that. They kind of do, right? I have some,

502
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.830
it's like who's the world champion of your house? Yeah,

503
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:59.310
but that's just happy wife. Happy life. That's how you have to run that shit.

504
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.770
Yeah. Anytime you it. Otherwise it's just,

505
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.700
I've never seen another situation that works. Or you have like some,

506
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.110
some woman who just afraid she can't talk and you know,

507
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.890
you don't want that either. No, that's just not healthy. It's not healthy.

508
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:17.010
It's not like, how do you enjoy that? I don't know. You have to be a sick fuck.

509
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.020
Yeah. Yeah. I don't have my, my house is zero designed by me.

510
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.640
There's no decorations of mine is I have one mounted elk head. That's it.

511
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.600
The first elk ever shot with a bow and Arrow I have mounted. That's it.

512
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.870
Everything else fucking, I don't care. It looks good.

513
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.320
The first time they came through. You gave me some alchemy.

514
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.950
I made spaghetti out of it. It was some of the best spaghetti. I made.

515
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.460
Super good for your body, man. You could eat that shit all the time.

516
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.430
If you lived around here, I'd hook you up all the time. Yeah, I used to.

517
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.050
When I get back I'm gonna stop.

518
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:50.850
I'm just going to start hitting you up asking you failed me.

519
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.340
How long you in town for? I leave in the morning.

520
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.550
Do you have a place to cook tonight? Yeah, I got some food for you. Okay.

521
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.920
Okay. I've got some elk sausage that's out of this fucking world, right?

522
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.000
That's good. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm completely down man. The first time I was,

523
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:08.460
I was a little hesitant because I was like, well,

524
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:11.580
this didn't come from the store, so you know what I mean?

525
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.930
But then I took it home, I made it up and I was just like, Oh man, it,

526
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:18.480
the flavor is so different. Like the flavor is different,

527
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.130
the texture is different. Um, I don't know. I really, I wanted more, it's alive.

528
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.020
I mean in, in terms of like when you're eating,

529
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:28.890
it just feels like it's got energy. It's got power. Yeah. Like it,

530
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.540
like it tastes like it had a good life. Yeah man. Like if you are eating some,

531
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.640
some like a pig lives in a pen, like oh sad.

532
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.350
It's just sadness. You've eating an elk,

533
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.690
especially if you didn't know you were there like that.

534
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:47.200
I'll get no idea you were there until that Arrow hit his rib cage and then it's

535
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:50.860
dead in seconds that, that thing lived a noble life. Yeah. You know,

536
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:53.410
and that's the best way it's ever going to die. You don't want,

537
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:54.221
I mean if you're an elk,

538
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:58.450
you don't want to get caught in a valley with some walls. That shit's rough.

539
00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.650
That's a rough way to go.

540
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.410
<v 1>I was talking to you buddy Jeff earlier about that.</v>

541
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.300
I'm like, hello. You got a choice, right? You get, you're good. Of course.

542
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:09.650
Hypothetically you got a choice. You're going to,

543
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.110
you're going to get mauled by a beer, a gorilla, um,

544
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.310
or die by wolf or a tiger. What do you

545
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.620
<v 3>well, I'll take the gorilla all day cause I think it's just gonna beat your ass.</v>

546
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.780
I don't think he's going to kill you because I don't think,

547
00:30:21.781 --> 00:30:23.160
I don't think he wants to eat you,

548
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.390
but like the premise of the question is you're going to die. Hmm. Yeah.

549
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.270
Then the tiger, cause the tiger is going to get your neck and kill you quick.

550
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.490
That's, that's my choice also. I think so.

551
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.360
You in the video of the tiger chasing the dudes on a motorbike? No.

552
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.540
Oh in India it's horrific.

553
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.520
It's fucking dudes are driving on this road in this a wildlife preserve and this

554
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:48.930
tiger comes full clip chasing them out of the jungle and just bales off at the

555
00:30:48.931 --> 00:30:52.080
last second. Just can't catch them. Shit. It should.

556
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.940
It's fucking horrific.

557
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.040
<v 1>They're so fast. Like what do you do? Right. Okay.</v>

558
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.510
Then you do like when you can do let's you have a gun, you're so weak.

559
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.200
It's not much you can do, but then when you think about that, they're like,

560
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.170
you think about Africa, you think about any,

561
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:11.050
you think about these places where lions and tigers exist and people have

562
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:14.980
existed since the beginning of time. At some point someone had to win that,

563
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.290
right?

564
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.070
<v 3>Just, Oh, just numbers. Just population numbers. Here's the video.</v>

565
00:31:19.071 --> 00:31:23.810
Check this shit out. You're going to freak out. I don't need to see her, Jamie.

566
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.300
Here it is. So these guys,

567
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.550
<v 1>oh, this thing just, oh,</v>

568
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.010
<v 3>he just tried. He tried.</v>

569
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.460
Now the reason why this is significant is because in India,

570
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.330
tigers eat people all the fucking time.

571
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.260
They eat them all the time. Like there's tigers that target human beings.

572
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.910
There's a place in India called the Sunderbans and the Sunderbans is um,

573
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.940
it's near this river that they,

574
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.950
they think that one of the reasons why the Tigers are so irritable is that

575
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:55.300
they're drinking this river water and the river water has a high degree of salt

576
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:59.050
in it, high level salt. And so they're irritated all the time.

577
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.750
They're just in the agony and they're particularly vicious.

578
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.360
And over the last 200 years,

579
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.390
tigers have killed more than 300,000 human beings in this one part of it.

580
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.800
<v 1>Like why do you still live there? Like I'm giving the more, you know,</v>

581
00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.090
I'm giving them, I'm giving that place to the Tigers. I S I see that,

582
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:23.420
I see that video and I imagine being that guy on that bike and like I,

583
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.370
you know what a bike seat is like, right? Yeah. Cute. Cute.

584
00:32:26.371 --> 00:32:30.300
Imagine being on a bike seat with like, what? Ha like I'm shitting myself. Yeah.

585
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.820
You know, if you have any shit in your body, it's gonna come out.

586
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:38.010
Like there's no way you win that. Nope. No Way. You win that. Not Today.

587
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.160
No, you don't win. You only win

588
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.290
<v 3>by being on the Mar. So I go and get, in a way,</v>

589
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.610
the fact they got a video of it though. Yeah. How'd he,

590
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.480
I hope we had a GoPro line. He's a, he's like, just like riding. Hey,

591
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.510
they listen, they get, they get got all the time. All the time.

592
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.010
Especially in India.

593
00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:00.130
India I think is the worst place in the world for Tiger in human interactions.

594
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.340
I don't get that. Like other tigers in India.

595
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.290
Bigger Tigers. Yeah, it does. I know it doesn't matter the size,

596
00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.430
like they're even like 300 or 500 pounds or something like that.

597
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.070
Think the biggest tigers are in Siberia. Okay.

598
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.210
But I think that's the case. Usually with mammals,

599
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.850
what happens is the like the same species when they're in a hotter climate tend

600
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:26.840
to be smaller.

601
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.610
Depends on the animal obviously than they are in the colder climates.

602
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.880
It's something that has something to do with preserving body temperature.

603
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:36.290
Like deer for instance.

604
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.980
Like if you get a whitetail deer from Texas,

605
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:43.700
it's much smaller than a whitetail deer from Saskatchewan.

606
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.350
So same species, but way up north they just, it's just colder and they grow,

607
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.070
grow. They'll grow like 300 pounds up there. Whereas like a big white town,

608
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:54.700
Texas like half that size. Yeah.

609
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.980
The people to certain places with people that just the mountain guy from game of

610
00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:03.640
Thrones. That motherfucker. Yes.

611
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.280
<v 2>A controversial moment. Uh, the end of last year into this year,</v>

612
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:12.260
they had a tiger that was known for killing 13 people or more and so they had a

613
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:15.970
shoot to kill a target on it and I guess they,

614
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.490
someone got it and people are mad. People were,

615
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.490
<v 3>it killed 13 people and people were mad that someone killed it.</v>

616
00:34:23.491 --> 00:34:26.410
People are just fucking weak. They're just so soft.

617
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.110
What if you got the wrong tiger? Fuck him. Fuck them all killed.

618
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.450
Whenever anyone that you get a chance to kill that's close enough to kill you

619
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:37.620
kill them man. I think I, I I key, I can't get that,

620
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.580
that video of the tiger chasing that bike out of my head. Cause like,

621
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.890
like that's another thing. Those things,

622
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.240
they're so coordinated that thing at full speed can take a swipe at that back

623
00:34:48.241 --> 00:34:51.300
tire and just [inaudible] and then you're screwed. And they're like,

624
00:34:51.301 --> 00:34:51.980
what do you do?

625
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.350
Cause you like what's your first reaction going to be like get up and try and

626
00:34:55.351 --> 00:34:58.770
get back on the bike. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do.

627
00:34:58.771 --> 00:35:00.180
There's no way you get the bike going.

628
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:03.570
And time the tiger would be on you so fast they can run,

629
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.260
they could probably run 40 miles an hour. Those fucking things. Yeah.

630
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.750
And it's probably 400 pounds, 500 pounds,

631
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.390
400 pounds of something.

632
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:17.450
An animal that's 400,000 pounds and runs at twice the speed of Usain bolt.

633
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:25.770
How is that fair? I mean, that's why there's not a million deer.

634
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:26.761
You know,

635
00:35:26.761 --> 00:35:31.080
the reason why that a million deer in that same spot is because of those tigers.

636
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.280
They need them. You know, I was um, in Lanai,

637
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.010
which is one of the islands in Hawaii,

638
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v 1>hunting a access deer and the access deer were given to King Kamehameha of</v>

639
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:48.600
Hawaii like in the 18 hundreds. And when we were over there,

640
00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:51.270
you know, you bow hunt these things and I'm telling you,

641
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:53.980
you've never seen a deer move this fast. Yeah.

642
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.990
The reason why they're so fast as they evolved to get away from tigers,

643
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.960
so when they see you there,

644
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.130
they make these noise like bay and then they fucking scattered and there's so

645
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:09.780
fast. Like it's hilarious to watch. Like, wow, they're so fast.

646
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:12.750
When you say that, like my brain just starts doing the math and I'm like,

647
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.350
like of course the ones that got caught by the tigers are the slower ones. Yeah.

648
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.240
So like the fastest ones. Amazing. Yeah. Like, yeah,

649
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.500
I can only imagine it's,

650
00:36:22.501 --> 00:36:26.760
it's Kinda like I'm a Olympic sprinter,

651
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.570
female Olympic Sprinter, Mary's uh, uh,

652
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.910
running back and they have a kid. Whoo. Yeah. Look, genetics are real. I mean,

653
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:40.130
that's one of the reasons why Americans becoming softer and softer is cause what

654
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:40.620
are you getting?

655
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.610
You getting people that sit at a desk all day with fucking herniated discs in a

656
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:45.480
fat belly,

657
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.350
drinking coffee and eating donuts and they marry someone who's just like them

658
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.730
and they barely get their shit together.

659
00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:54.110
And they have a kid who watches video games all day and eat cookies and,

660
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.140
and he's gross. And then he marries another girl who's like that.

661
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:02.190
And next thing you know, you go through this four or five, six generations,

662
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.070
you get, you got piss poor jeans. Yeah. I, um,

663
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:10.320
I just recently went home to The Bahamas and I,

664
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:14.370
I'm starting to miss it more and more and more because as I get older,

665
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.670
I long for the things that I did as a little kid.

666
00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:20.220
I love for the places that I was at as a little kid.

667
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.570
And so my family's from this little place called farmer Ski Exuma that's three

668
00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:25.930
quarters of a mile by seven, eight.

669
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.890
I think I told you that before and it's tiny and I was there this time.

670
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.500
And just seeing, just,

671
00:37:30.501 --> 00:37:35.070
just waking up every morning and just looking out the window and just blue ocean

672
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.970
all day. Um, I just, I want to go back there. The people that people,

673
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.910
the people that live there, like you get a boat at like 14,

674
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:45.810
15 years old because there's really nothing that you can do on the island other

675
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:48.870
than interact with the family and fish, right? Everything, everything,

676
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.250
everything that you need stabilized, you have to go somewhere else to get her.

677
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.850
It has to be brought in. So like, I have a cousin who, um, he's like,

678
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.270
he's older than me. He's like my grandmother's generation, but he's my cousin.

679
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.540
Um, he's like four years older than me, but like this guy,

680
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:07.710
he free dives and he will go down and he will hang out on the water for like two

681
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:11.160
or three minutes. Like with this, with a spear. He doesn't,

682
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:14.580
he doesn't like to school. He doesn't like to take, um, take a tank with him.

683
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.980
One time we were fishing off the back of the boat.

684
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:20.310
He's off the front and he's like, he ended and then on top of that he's in,

685
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.880
he's in the water and he read, he comes out and when he reaches up he says,

686
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.430
Hey Julian, bring the boat over here. It's a shock. So like there's not as like,

687
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.320
but, and then he goes back down, you know what I mean?

688
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.800
Does it shock in the water near, I'm probably a reef shark and um,

689
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.290
he's got his spear and he's just like, just get closer, but I'm still fishing.

690
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.270
Like that's, that's the life.

691
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.130
So he just wants to be able to get out if shit goes sideways. Yeah, I,

692
00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.280
I'm assuming, but I'm like scared.

693
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.750
Would you think that it would be safer to be in the water or on top of the

694
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:52.330
water? If there was a shark, like if you had goggles,

695
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:55.090
you could see the motherfucker. Wouldn't you want to be in the water?

696
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.690
Do you need it then on top and not knowing where he's coming from?

697
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.670
I would think so. I would think so.

698
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:04.210
But then you like not only is it three 60 but it's like universal.

699
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.730
The view is universal. Right, right.

700
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.000
But if you're on top of the water and you can see at least is like you've got

701
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:13.000
your back to the wall and you can't come from the top. That's true.

702
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.340
So that's true. I don't know.

703
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.360
But at the same time you're in the water with an animal who's who.

704
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:21.580
That's his natural habitat. Yeah. Like you can't,

705
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:23.710
you can't even turn around nearly as fast as he can.

706
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.160
He can probably swim around you and come up from the back before you could even

707
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:31.420
turn around. Yeah, probably. Yeah. They swim pretty fucking fast. Yeah.

708
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.590
They're like Ninjas in the water to just clean the cleanup crew.

709
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.170
Just like the tiger. I am. So I girlfriend and I were there and I was, um,

710
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.570
feeding the turtles, right?

711
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.660
So I try to grab a turtle and literally the turtle is this big.

712
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.970
It's no bigger than this. And I'm about to pick it up.

713
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.930
I'm trying to pick it up being like explaining to people, oh, I'm sorry. Yeah,

714
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:57.880
I'm probably like trust 16 inches. Leon trashcan lit no bigger than a trashcan.

715
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:03.210
And I am trying to pick it up and this before I can get it out of the water.

716
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.910
Those are the big fins arms that they have. He just,

717
00:40:06.911 --> 00:40:10.150
he pulls me down into the water like this, this little thing.

718
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:14.890
He probably weighs 40, 50 pounds, right? And it's just so powerful in the water.

719
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.690
Like if I were to hang onto that turtle,

720
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.730
I would be moving faster than I would move with fins on. Like,

721
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:24.790
how was that po? And I'm like, I don't want to talk about my weight,

722
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:28.570
but I'm a lot bigger than that. He can sensitive.

723
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.940
I am, I'm not fight weight. And you're eating well. You look good man.

724
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:36.790
Don't worry about it. Do you think you're gonna move to Bahamas?

725
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.700
You think you'd live there someday? Um, I like, ultimately,

726
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:44.640
I definitely want to live back there in my lifetime. You know, I, um, I mean I,

727
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:48.430
if I want to, I want to die there. Whoa. You know what I mean?

728
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.550
I don't necessarily want to die anytime soon, but,

729
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.480
but when you do you want to live the end of your life there? Relaxed life,

730
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.900
island life. Hey Man, I get it. Every time I go to Hawaii,

731
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.360
my brain starts spinning. I'm like, can I live here? Why don't I just move here?

732
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.500
I'm like, I don't, I don't need much. You know, you, you had,

733
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.640
did you watch the Steve Jobs movie? No, I haven't either.

734
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:16.870
But just recently it was on television and the f the opening scene was some guy

735
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:17.890
in like, I don't know,

736
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:21.190
the seventies or sixties talking about computers when computers were huge,

737
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:24.250
when computers were like as big things and take up an entire room.

738
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.320
And he's like, yeah, one day.

739
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.410
Like you can be anywhere in the world and you can work,

740
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:32.620
you can be on a remote island and you can be doing your work and you will get

741
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:34.220
emails. You're talking about emails

742
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.540
<v 4>like in the 60s, you know,</v>

743
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:37.760
he's talking about the internet in the sixties or something.

744
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.270
It's on the beginning of the jobs movie. And I'm like one with Ashton Kutcher.

745
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.853
No,

746
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.610
<v 3>I said I was gonna ask which one? There's another one fast.</v>

747
00:41:45.611 --> 00:41:48.570
Michael Fassbender too, that came out. I think it's the Fastbender.

748
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.130
I don't know what Michael Fassbender, it looks like. I know that name,

749
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:55.240
but it's Michael Fassbender. He's a, what was he in? I build,

750
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.960
I think he's like Loki and the Avengers, I think I asked him to, Oh,

751
00:41:58.961 --> 00:42:01.480
let me somebody. Yeah, I think that makes sense.

752
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:06.010
<v 4>I think that's him. But yeah, that, that movie. Um,</v>

753
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.380
they were talking about that then and I'm like, you know,

754
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:13.390
and then 2001 was when, um, jobs came out with a, yeah, that's him.

755
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.980
<v 3>Oh No, no. It's easy. Loki. So he's someone, but I picked somebody up,</v>

756
00:42:17.981 --> 00:42:22.690
but he's from prometheus's. Okay. So robot in the promiscuous and alien series.

757
00:42:22.691 --> 00:42:26.710
He's the a, Oh yeah, that guys. Excellent. Yeah. Oh,

758
00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:30.340
so he played a bunch of stuff with Steve Jobs and asshole in the Steve jobs

759
00:42:30.341 --> 00:42:30.810
movie.

760
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:34.200
<v 4>Yeah. I mean, I only saw like the first five minutes I want to watch this,</v>

761
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.170
but in the middle he does look. Yeah, he is in the movie.

762
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.630
But the claim is that you have to be an asshole to be like a genius. Right,

763
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.540
right.

764
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.940
<v 3>I don't know if I buy that either.</v>

765
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.360
A lot of people who get a lot of shit done eventually run into people that don't

766
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:55.611
get shit done the way they want and so the only way they figure out how to get

767
00:42:55.711 --> 00:42:58.850
shit done with those people is to dominate them. Yeah.

768
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.290
Plunkett to yell at them and to, you know,

769
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:05.550
like the apple deal was that you had to work insane hours too.

770
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.790
That's a weird thing, man. If you're going to work for a company,

771
00:43:08.791 --> 00:43:10.590
you got a good job. Is it a good job?

772
00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.350
What's so good about it that you getting money? Where's your life?

773
00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:17.580
You don't have a life, you, you're working 17 hours a day. Oh, okay.

774
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:21.540
That sucks. That's a shitty job. Even if you make it a lot of money,

775
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:26.670
like a guy who makes less money but it can take the weekend off and go fishing

776
00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:30.000
and hang out with his kids and chill. That's a better life. Preach it Joe.

777
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.400
Preach it. That's a better life. I'm listening. Hallelujah.

778
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.410
That Bahamas life is the way to go. I'm telling you,

779
00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.690
you got me thinking when I went on when I was at [inaudible]

780
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.440
<v 4>home is it was just nice like a fighter's.</v>

781
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.160
A fighter's life is kind of like that. I mean, not,

782
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:45.350
not all the time and not every one,

783
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:50.351
but you get to do what you love to do and then you get to do what you want do,

784
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.800
<v 3>if you can handle the highs and the lows with fighters,</v>

785
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.180
it's handling the highs with the ego and the lows with the emotions and the,

786
00:43:58.181 --> 00:44:00.670
just the letting everybody down and the depression

787
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.530
<v 4>that both of those things, that's like, those are the extremes, but that,</v>

788
00:44:04.531 --> 00:44:08.400
that the highs of, of winning big fights and, and have getting,

789
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:13.190
being admired for something that really truly becomes a part of you just just

790
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.380
being yourself. Yeah. That, that feels good.

791
00:44:16.381 --> 00:44:19.650
But you do put a lot of weight on yourself and,

792
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.470
and when you lose, like, I ain't gonna lie, man. Um, there,

793
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.380
there has been some things on the Internet, like when I lost the harmonic,

794
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.910
right. I was like, oh, he threw that fighting and I like, like

795
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.790
<v 1>that, that breaks my heart. That hurts when someone says you through the phone.</v>

796
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.970
Yeah. You can just can't read that shit. But I know what you mean. Yeah.

797
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.680
You can't read this. People that they have crazy theories about nonsense.

798
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.210
You know,

799
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.480
that's crazy that the idea that you threw a fight or the you would get together

800
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:52.080
with hot or making a bet against yourself or something stupid like that.

801
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.900
So I just heard, I just heard, um,

802
00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:00.960
at some point over the past year or so, I heard a, an argument that like,

803
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:01.470
well,

804
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:06.470
if a guy doesn't make weight and the other guy gets so much of his purse,

805
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.020
like, and he's going to get his winning show money, right?

806
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.020
If he's guaranteed is winning show money anyway,

807
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.500
then why wouldn't he just throw the fight and get a bonus percentage of the

808
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.060
winners win money. And that's the more on

809
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.070
<v 0>it's a moron. Well, not only that, the thank you, that's not just a moron.</v>

810
00:45:27.071 --> 00:45:30.000
It's someone who doesn't understand the psychology of a winner. Yeah. Like the,

811
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.230
the thing about a winner is a little lasting.

812
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.650
A winner wants to do is lose on purpose. Right.

813
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.670
And when you have the opportunity, the, the big thing is winning.

814
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.740
You have the opportunity to win.

815
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.040
It's right in front of you and you only get a chance to do this three times a

816
00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:49.600
year, four times a year, five of your cowboy, right? Like right.

817
00:45:49.601 --> 00:45:51.610
Like how many times does he, he's crazy. He's crazy.

818
00:45:51.611 --> 00:45:53.950
But he fights like five times a year. Right. If he could,

819
00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.130
he'd probably fight every week. Yeah. But the,

820
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.560
the idea that you're going to throw that,

821
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.650
<v 1>the, the, the best feeling that you could ever achieve.</v>

822
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.580
<v 0>They're crazy. They just don't understand it.</v>

823
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.750
But that's just the problem with the Internet is reading comments. Yes.

824
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:15.610
To any morons with ideas. I used to love the underground man. It was great.

825
00:46:15.611 --> 00:46:19.780
Back in the day I was like, how am I, like I had the old one,

826
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.060
I had think I've double o's. You know what I mean? Yeah.

827
00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.640
Like being and being from back then, you know? Yeah.

828
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.960
Maybe even in 90 like they at some point they just gave you the number that was

829
00:46:28.961 --> 00:46:31.270
on in the nineties same here. Yeah. So like,

830
00:46:31.271 --> 00:46:35.510
I don't know if my thing says 99 or [inaudible] I still sign in every once in a

831
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.790
while just to check in, just to check in. So it's toxic conversation,

832
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.250
but that's just the Internet in general.

833
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:46.450
There's still a lot of good discussions on the underground lot of thing.

834
00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:49.250
Last time was on was about a month ago I went and checked. I was like, hmm.

835
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.570
Like there was some, especially there was some good Jujitsu talk.

836
00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:56.590
There was some good technique. Talk about like leg locks and,

837
00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.120
and you know, and whether or not there's going to be a, uh,

838
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.560
transition from leg locks because everybody's,

839
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.850
the leg lock game sort of overtook Jujitsu, whether or not it was going to, uh,

840
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.430
switch to choking or when someone's like,

841
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.060
whether it's going to going to be a new trend because the leg lock defense is so

842
00:47:13.061 --> 00:47:15.340
good now. And I'm like, I appreciate that.

843
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.060
I appreciate it when people are like devoted practitioners and they're really

844
00:47:19.061 --> 00:47:21.880
discussing technique and disco. But when it's like,

845
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:25.420
this guy's a pussy and he fuck, it sucks. And you know, Rhonda,

846
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.260
Rosie's a fucking bitch. And like, dude,

847
00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.160
there's so much that on the Internet it's hard

848
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.420
<v 1>to um, to filter through that to find some good conversations sometimes. Yeah.</v>

849
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:39.340
It's like in your life you would avoid people like that, like the plague.

850
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:42.070
Like if there was a guy in your life that wanted your phone number and all he

851
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:45.970
does is complain about things and have stupid theories get this guy the fuck

852
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:50.470
away from me. Right? Yeah. But you can't avoid them online. Yeah,

853
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.440
no online. That's the thing that, that, you know,

854
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:58.180
being anonymous on the Internet, that's some power for some people, man.

855
00:47:58.181 --> 00:48:00.700
Sure. When it's crazy. Well it's also,

856
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.460
you got to realize that the people that are executing that power,

857
00:48:03.461 --> 00:48:05.380
the people that want and need that power,

858
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.230
they're all either young or they're losers.

859
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.050
Those are the two that either young and they don't get it. You know,

860
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:12.610
they're 14 someone lets them online.

861
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.820
They just want to say mean shit cause it's fun. Like you gotta you gotta Rock,

862
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:18.490
there's a window. Ah, yeah. I was looking at my throw this rock.

863
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.350
That's what people do. It's normal,

864
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.160
but I don't want to hang out with young kids and I don't want to hang out with

865
00:48:24.161 --> 00:48:27.700
losers. But see that's the problem. I think there's something with that too,

866
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.170
that, um, I mean, let me,

867
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.620
we know there's something with that where that being anonymous, you,

868
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.970
that's a protection. Like you see, sometimes I bleeds into their real life.

869
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.060
I mean, I saw this, this video of this kid, he's like,

870
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:42.570
he's just like making fun of this older man. He was,

871
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.390
he's being rude to this woman. He's making fun of this old man, man.

872
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:49.390
So the man I making fun of him too. He's like, Amy, me, me, me.

873
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.360
That's so the kid starts punching him in the arm and the guy's like,

874
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.850
he just turns away. Kids punches swinging at him.

875
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.180
And this is not like a little kid. He's, he's, he's a little kid. You shouldn't,

876
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.380
he's not a kid that you would smack because if he started talking smack to you,

877
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.670
right, you didn't fight him because of that.

878
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:06.250
But then this kid starts punching him and he's like, he's like,

879
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:09.430
he tells the kid to stop and the kid keeps going and grabbing my throat and he

880
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.830
pushes him, right? And the kid falls down and he's like,

881
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.880
and then he starts crying and I, you assaulted me. And it's like, like,

882
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.550
what? What reality do you live in man? Like your parents have failed. Like,

883
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:25.840
I'm sorry. You know, life failed them. They live in a blurry reality.

884
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.420
It's too much online. Not enough real world. Yeah. Like not enough.

885
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:34.900
Getting your ass kicked as the thing. Fighting solves everything. Man.

886
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:38.770
Solves a lot of things. Everything. I hate those people that say fight fighting.

887
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:41.200
What is that going to solve? Like everything I'm telling you,

888
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.830
like my thing is like if you start, if I don't like going back and forth,

889
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.080
you know what I mean? Like we're not going to go back and forth.

890
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.170
You say something disrespectful. I'm going to say something disrespectful.

891
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:53.710
I'm going up the [inaudible] and then if you want to keep going, like, man,

892
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:57.310
we can just stop talking right now and go, yeah. You know, I know I'm, I'm,

893
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.900
I'm an old man now,

894
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.650
but like I think that solves everything.

895
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.150
Like there's no reason to be talking.

896
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:08.290
Also having a history of that and your life gives you a much better perspective

897
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:12.280
of the consequences of talking shit if you don't have any history.

898
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.160
Like how many times have you seen guys talk shit and you know they can't fight.

899
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.880
No. Yeah, this is crazy. This is like someone challenging someone to a race.

900
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.300
They've never driven a car. Like they don't even know how to shift gears.

901
00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:25.590
So you don't know a god damn thing what you watch a Jackie Chan movie thinking

902
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:26.483
to fuck somebody up.

903
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.720
<v 0>But there's a lot of people there. Yeah.</v>

904
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.400
<v 1>Doing this. So many people that believe that like,</v>

905
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:36.420
and then just guys will watch fights. Like they believe that they can beat,

906
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:36.790
they, they,

907
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:41.160
they're legit people that believe they can beat people that are inside the

908
00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:45.750
octagon or inside a professional cage inside the PFL or rising or somewhere and

909
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.320
they're just like, I could beat that guy. No,

910
00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:52.270
you can't really believe that just by being poly mile. Naji did you see?

911
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.720
You know? No, he'll fuck

912
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.650
<v 0>queue up. That was a sad fight, man. I've watched.</v>

913
00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.510
I watched it again. I didn't watch. I didn't, I don't know. I can't,

914
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:04.840
I can't bring myself to watch the band knuckle boxer. I'll tell you what, man,

915
00:51:04.841 --> 00:51:09.340
it changed my opinion. I was thinking for a long time that MMA done correctly,

916
00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.140
you'd have bare knuckles because I was like,

917
00:51:11.141 --> 00:51:13.780
why you got bear shins and bear knees and bear elbows,

918
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:16.270
but you have your knuckles pat it up. That doesn't make any sense.

919
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:21.370
But now I see how that cuts like Chris Lieben, his face was just opened up,

920
00:51:21.371 --> 00:51:22.780
man. I was like, that is just,

921
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:27.460
I don't want to see people take unnecessarily cuts that way because then that

922
00:51:27.461 --> 00:51:31.690
scar tissue opens up and then shortens their careers, stops fights.

923
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:37.190
<v 1>I don't want to say hey, also breaking hands. I mean like I, I game.</v>

924
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:39.650
That's why I don't want to watch it. I, I'm not a big fan of cuts.

925
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.520
You remember Marvin Eastman and Vito Belfort and I don't, I don't, I don't like,

926
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.550
I don't like, you know, horrific. I W I,

927
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.320
I want to show you something. Okay. That's like you, you, when you do see,

928
00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.680
when you see those gory videos, does that really throw, you know? Okay.

929
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:58.700
So I'm going to show you something and it's horrible. Right? But um, oh crap.

930
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.570
What is it? Um, it's a video. It's a video of, of,

931
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.090
I don't even know how to explain. I don't want,

932
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:07.910
I don't want to tell you what it is until you see it,

933
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.920
because it is so graphic. Is it a fight video? It's not a fight video.

934
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:16.710
It's just something gory. Okay. You want to see some more? Yeah. All right.

935
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.740
Show me. I keep, I'm forgetting how to get through my phone sometimes,

936
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:26.150
but I found it. Okay. Let's see.

937
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.710
So you're watching that, right?

938
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.533
<v 5>Okay.</v>

939
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.890
<v 1>I don't know if those two things go together.</v>

940
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.150
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus Christ.</v>

941
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.193
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

942
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:43.170
<v 1>Yeah. Whoa. You can see that JV. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

943
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:48.420
Whoa. I don't know if that, that part one equals part two.

944
00:52:48.421 --> 00:52:51.240
I Dunno if that was just edited, but still it looks like

945
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.740
<v 0>took him right in the mug. Oh,</v>

946
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.880
that seems like what it would do if a log hit you in the face like that.

947
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.620
I don't know. This guy's whole head is broken. He's missing his upper jaw. Yeah.

948
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.500
Yikes. Like I don't, I don't want anyone to look at, you know. I know.

949
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.490
How about Cyborg? When Michael Venom page hit him with that knee? Whew.

950
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:15.180
That's one that makes you, you make shit fucking, your whole body tightens up,

951
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.093
right?

952
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.730
<v 1>Like how do you, how do you get somebody's skull? No much force.</v>

953
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:21.740
You have to hit somebody with like that crazy.

954
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.520
Think of all the fights you've seen. We've never seen that. I've seen that.

955
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.190
Think about

956
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.050
<v 0>this. When something, you've,</v>

957
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:30.930
everybody's been hit on the head or something fell on your head and it's the

958
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:33.430
edge of something and it just that pain. Yeah.

959
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.890
I can't imagine what that pain is like. That's, that's bone. The ball.

960
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:41.000
I don't want to see it. There's like, no, I'm not saying open up.

961
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.700
Just like I looked over there like that. That screen brightened up and, well,

962
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:49.230
how about yeah, cosmo Alexandra did to save.

963
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.120
That's crazy too. One Punch broke like eight bones in his face.

964
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.340
Yeah, like it's not, this is not for the lighthearted man. Not for the,

965
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:04.380
I get a lot of people lie like I'm not, I'm not a sage hater,

966
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.360
but I'm not a sage lover. You know what I mean?

967
00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:10.650
But like I don't wish that on anybody. I don't wish that on anybody either.

968
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:15.090
And I don't, I don't like that matchup. I didn't like that match up at all.

969
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.160
I was like what are they doing? That is a, that's a world champion striker.

970
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.900
Cosmo is a fucking bad man. He's a bad man.

971
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.660
He likes people on fire, you know,

972
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.750
and him at 185 pounds with no weight cutting.

973
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.940
And that's one of the things that he said about that fight.

974
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:36.990
How good he felt like we didn't have to cut any weight and you see how thick

975
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.640
fucking full he looked.

976
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:41.220
It wasn't depleted and dehydrated and everything like that.

977
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:46.030
And that is just not sages. It was bring it back to the beginning, but look out,

978
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.940
look how thick he is to like if you seen Cosmo's fights before.

979
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.780
I remember when he fought John Wayne par in lion fight, I mean,

980
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:59.781
but John Wayne Pars a multiple time world champion and a skillful guy and he

981
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.460
managed to avoid like the big power shots like this and didn't get hurt.

982
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.870
But it's also cosmo having a chance to punch you with MMA gloves on too with the

983
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:12.600
majority of his career. He fought all the time. Boom.

984
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:16.140
I mean that is a crazy punch. Everything's behind that. It's,

985
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.660
and it's like this kid is just not ready for this yet.

986
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.860
He's just not ready for this as much as he has experienced in karate.

987
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:27.300
And you know, he had some good MMA fights against some, you know, good fighters.

988
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:31.980
This is not a good fighter. That's an elite world class striker. Right.

989
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.870
And you know, you're fighting him with little gloves on in a ring and you're,

990
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.970
you're mixed martial arts game is primarily a striking. Yup. Yeah.

991
00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.600
You had a big disadvantage. Huge, enormous disadvantage.

992
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.140
I like what one is doing though. I really do. I like what they're doing.

993
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:52.040
I thought that's interesting too that they made them fight in a ring. Well,

994
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.050
I don't know how many events one does in a ring versus does in a cage,

995
00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:58.770
but the dynamics shift radically. When you get caught, you get cornered.

996
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.870
You know, like that's one of the cool things about the Bella tore case.

997
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:06.360
It's circular. There's no corner and you're on it. Yeah. But that, you know,

998
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:10.350
when you see a boxing ring like that, the owl that's,

999
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.330
especially again with Cosmo, like, yes, that's where he spent most of his time.

1000
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.290
Like all of his time.

1001
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.920
It's a different environment and cutting that off is so much easier.

1002
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:24.100
And for a guy who's, who knows how to do that, it's, he,

1003
00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.730
<v 4>it's almost like sage was set up. I'm not saying they sent him up.</v>

1004
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:30.510
<v 0>Can you set up? Yeah. That's just a bad situation. He didn't have, I mean,</v>

1005
00:56:30.511 --> 00:56:33.690
I guess he didn't have to take the fight. I don't know how I, I should say,

1006
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.240
I don't know how they do their matchmaking. I Dunno if it's like,

1007
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.680
like the UFC kind of forces fights on people, right. They let you know, like,

1008
00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:44.460
you take this fight or you know, we're probably not gonna call you. Yeah,

1009
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.680
I mean it's up to you, but if you want a career in the UFC,

1010
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.240
you take fights when you get them.

1011
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.310
But like when you see fighters in boxing, they get,

1012
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:55.560
if they have a really good manager, they,

1013
00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:59.580
the manager knows who the guy you're going to fight is and says, okay eve,

1014
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:03.270
this guy is good, but you can beat them.

1015
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.700
And this is what I like about this style. He's going to,

1016
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.740
he's going to challenge you in a couple of areas,

1017
00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:10.020
but overall you're a better fighter than than him.

1018
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:13.140
But it'll give you a challenge and we're trying to build your record up to get

1019
00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:14.490
you a title shot and you know,

1020
00:57:14.491 --> 00:57:18.270
maybe you'd be nine to no 10 to no 11 and no 12 no. And then you know,

1021
00:57:18.271 --> 00:57:21.510
you get to a certain level and they go, okay, we're ready to fight for a title.

1022
00:57:21.511 --> 00:57:25.020
And then it would be this big promotion, Eve Edwards, you know,

1023
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:29.580
17 and Oh, you know, 16 knockouts and shows your highlight reel.

1024
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.640
Like this is something that big management,

1025
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:34.950
this is the reason why it's exists in boxing.

1026
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:39.300
It's actually smart because it's part of the development of a fighter for every

1027
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.493
Jon Jones.

1028
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:45.000
They could just step into the octagon at 21 years old and start fucking people

1029
00:57:45.001 --> 00:57:49.710
up. There's so many young fighters that could be world champions,

1030
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.860
but then they run into elite competition early in their career and get fucked up

1031
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.200
and then they, they, their dream kind of drifts away from them.

1032
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:02.430
If fear gets puts in, put it in them early. Yup. Yup. That's a problem.

1033
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.860
And unnecessarily in my, in my opinion.

1034
00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.700
<v 4>Yeah, I agree. Um, and that's,</v>

1035
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.730
that's the thing about guys getting into the UFC really early in their career.

1036
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.130
Like that's everybody's goal. Virtually every fighter on the planet,

1037
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:19.680
that's where they want to be. That's the most recognized belt. That's,

1038
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.060
that's the belt that everybody considers the highest rank belt. Right.

1039
00:58:23.061 --> 00:58:24.230
So that's where everybody wants to get.

1040
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:28.880
And getting there with two or three fights on new, you're right under your belt.

1041
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:34.700
Um, it's exciting, but like you don't, you're in the wolfsten now.

1042
00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.060
<v 0>Yeah. It's not smart. Everybody wants to say they're a UFC fighter,</v>

1043
00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:39.620
but it really isn't smart.

1044
00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.430
The smart way to do it is to fight on the regional circuit,

1045
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:48.360
train at a really good gym and develop yourself. Get to a, to Tega. Yeah, yeah,

1046
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.020
yeah. I mean there's look, look at Marlin Mariah's.

1047
00:58:51.021 --> 00:58:55.040
Did you know when he was before PFL when it was the world series of fighting,

1048
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:58.910
she was fucking everybody up over there and we were watching him going,

1049
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.850
how would this guy fair against world-class competition?

1050
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.570
And then you get get them into the UFC. Okay, well this guy's the real deal.

1051
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.070
He's the real deal. But he,

1052
00:59:07.071 --> 00:59:12.071
it took all those years in smaller shows and to build up that sort of skillset

1053
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:15.560
and that confidence and experience is a lot of,

1054
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:20.210
a lot of good guys that came through. They're like gaging sure. Perfect example.

1055
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.070
Yeah. And it's also a good

1056
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.790
<v 1>place, um, when you get, when, when guys got bet one,</v>

1057
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:28.490
I'm not talking about now of course, cause it's no longer the world series,

1058
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:30.230
but when guys got, you know,

1059
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:33.320
they got to the UFC and they did their experience show that they weren't ready

1060
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:36.050
for it. And you know, having these smaller promotions,

1061
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.450
that's a good thing because some of those guys,

1062
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.210
their spirit doesn't necessarily break.

1063
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:43.390
They just know they're not ready for that. Yeah. So yeah,

1064
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.150
going back down and working their way back up. But then again, it's hard.

1065
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:51.740
It's sometimes it's hard to, to earn that second shot, you know what I mean?

1066
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.110
Yeah.

1067
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:56.270
You can go back and then I guess it all depends also in the relationship you had

1068
00:59:56.271 --> 01:00:00.290
with, with, with the powers that be once you, once you're out, you know,

1069
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.660
if you went out on a bad note, kind of doesn't really matter. Yeah.

1070
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.540
There's some bridge burners out there. Yeah.

1071
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.360
Some young guys that get crazy and then they're doing an interview.

1072
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.350
Interviews are so toxic, right?

1073
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.660
You start getting crazy and you say something that really could fuck up your

1074
01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:18.470
entire career and you might not even really mean it. Or if you do mean it,

1075
01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:22.220
you might mean it only for an hour, you know? And then after you say like,

1076
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:25.190
why did I say that? Really? I should look at it from their perspective.

1077
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:27.050
They're trying to run a business. Don't be in your feelings.

1078
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.520
Don't be in your feelings. Well like you know,

1079
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.080
one of the more interesting things about the PFL this season was Vinnie,

1080
01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.860
my glaze like Vinnie,

1081
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:41.861
my glaze has become who I thought he would be earlier in his career because he's

1082
01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:47.060
such a phenom with grappling. I mean he's, he's the legitimate world champion.

1083
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:51.950
I mean, I remember watching him throw a flying armbar unpaid, a Pano,

1084
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.860
who's,

1085
01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:56.930
I'm a multiple time Brazilian jujitsu world champion himself and Vinny just

1086
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:00.620
locks him up and jumps into a flying armbar. I'm like, that is crazy.

1087
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.740
And finished them off. I was like, that is insane.

1088
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.090
Like that's how good Vinnie is. And he was catching people and,

1089
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.460
and I thought he was on his way. And Sean, what is his last name?

1090
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:13.290
Sean O'Connell. O'Connell. Yeah. I want to say O'Malley, but I know that song.

1091
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.770
I'm saying Sean O'Connell. I was very impressed, man.

1092
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:17.900
Amazed that he was able to beat him. Man. He put,

1093
01:01:17.901 --> 01:01:21.100
he put a real good game plan together. He had Jeremy who in his corner too. Huh?

1094
01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.590
I haven't been having that knowledge behind you. You know what I mean?

1095
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.450
But I'm like Vinny,

1096
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:31.940
I think his fights lasted like not even around to get into the get to the finals

1097
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.910
cause that's four fights and he hasn't even spent five minutes in the cage yet.

1098
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.800
You know, and then Sean takes him to the end. But then this season,

1099
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.140
Vinnie just fought a couple of weeks ago and um, man, the,

1100
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.930
I guess it's kind of like the strategy to be Vinny of course,

1101
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.700
is to keep the fight standing. I'm not get taken down and not be on bottom.

1102
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.440
Don't even let him pull guard. But he took, he took,

1103
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.070
he took a pounding in that first round he needs, he needs a win.

1104
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.280
He needs like he needs to show that, that Vinny level Jujitsu,

1105
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.100
his next fight to get into the playoffs this year. Did He,

1106
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.150
when his fight he lost, he lost, stopped in the second I believe. But who?

1107
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.780
Emiliano Saudi. Oh, he lit him up, man.

1108
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.380
He just just picked him apart. Stayed on the outside.

1109
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:19.980
I think Vinnie did get land one take down, but Saudi defended guy back to his

1110
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.820
<v 4>feet and he like you just worked him body head, just really good boxing.</v>

1111
01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1112
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.300
If any might be the just that guy that's just elite level Jujitsu guy that never

1113
01:02:28.301 --> 01:02:31.990
quite realizes his full potential in MMA, you know?

1114
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.080
And it's also like the amount of time you've got to think he was back in the

1115
01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:38.320
ultimate fighter. Ryan Bader stopped him in the finals.

1116
01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:42.070
That was a long time ago. I was like the third or fourth or fifth season,

1117
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:46.210
something like that. Yeah. So was that 2007 or something like that 12 years ago.

1118
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:47.560
That's a long career.

1119
01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:51.330
<v 4>That's a long time. But like he still looks good. He still has his,</v>

1120
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:53.500
his striking has gotten better. I mean,

1121
01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:57.580
he's not going to be able to go toe to toe with the elite level strikers in his

1122
01:02:57.581 --> 01:03:00.820
weight class, but um, his wrestling is where we're at.

1123
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.670
I think that's where he really needs to focus now. If he still wants to do well,

1124
01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:07.480
how much longer he wants to do this. Right. Because, you know,

1125
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.590
I think Vinnie's 30, 33 34 35 it was close.

1126
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.010
But um, but his striking is you have to respect it.

1127
01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.890
You have to respect his standing and if he could transition to,

1128
01:03:20.891 --> 01:03:23.590
to taking a shot off of that and just chain wrestle,

1129
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.620
like that'll be so much better because on top of course, yeah.

1130
01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.180
You know he's going to be a monster, but if he's pulling guard, um,

1131
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.960
there's a few guys he's going to catch. But most, most of the better guys. You,

1132
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.660
you're going to have a problem there. What you're saying to his birthday today?

1133
01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.050
Oh, I'm 35 happy birthday Vinny.

1134
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.570
<v 3>Yeah, he's one of the few guys,</v>

1135
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:46.170
I mean he didn't get like two Camorra's in a row. Two cameras on the same night.

1136
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.670
Did it really? Yeah. One for fighting on the same night. That shit's crazy.

1137
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.740
I'm not a fan of that. Why?

1138
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:56.730
Because I think that the problem is say if two guys fight right,

1139
01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.410
and one guy knocks the other guy out real quick and then goes into the next

1140
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:05.430
round, but the other guy who is going to fight, he,

1141
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:10.550
he fights and he has a rough three round war and then he goes into the next

1142
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:11.550
fight.

1143
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:16.320
One guy is super fresh and the other guy's body's beat to shit just doesn't,

1144
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.070
doesn't make sense. Like one guy's legs are all fucked up. He's been leg kicked.

1145
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:21.150
He might've got dinged,

1146
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:25.740
he might be like a little dizzy and then he's going to go and fight an hour

1147
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.450
later. This seems ridiculous to me

1148
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.390
<v 4>about like, does that, so that's different for you if it's wrestling or if it's,</v>

1149
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:35.230
um, a submission grappling towards yes. Because there's no striking. Yeah,

1150
01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:39.970
because, no, strike, the thing about that is you can always,

1151
01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.850
if you're going in banged up, right, or if you get hurt.

1152
01:04:42.851 --> 01:04:47.680
We saw that last year in the playoffs. Um, I forget who they, I believe it was,

1153
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.090
um, mom and dad, no Islam. Mom Dove. Right. He won his fight,

1154
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.950
but he, I don't remember what the injury was, but he pulled out, you know,

1155
01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:00.220
and the guy he beat who was not banged up really,

1156
01:05:00.221 --> 01:05:02.890
I mean the fight was a tough fight. Um, he claimed he wasn't,

1157
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.420
he was going in at 100%, except for the conditioning. Um,

1158
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.250
yeah, but the thing is like,

1159
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.990
<v 3>there's a difference from being injured. Like you tear your ACL and you know it.</v>

1160
01:05:13.991 --> 01:05:17.590
And like I can't fight. I can't go on and just being beat shit.

1161
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:21.610
<v 4>That's, that's, that is the difference. But yeah, I mean,</v>

1162
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.450
what's the difference between fight you? You can only fight five rounds, right?

1163
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:25.660
Like,

1164
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.330
and no commission is going to let you fight five rounds more than five rounds at

1165
01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:30.460
a night. So in the playoffs with the PFL,

1166
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:34.870
we have two rounds in the quarterfinals and in the semifinals is three rounds.

1167
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:38.620
Right. It's kind of tricky because should the fight ended up in a draw,

1168
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:42.860
then the fighter won the first round wins the fight. What? Yeah.

1169
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.890
I think it should be the second. Yeah.

1170
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.180
Some people think because you'd be the second.

1171
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:49.360
Some people think you should be the first fighter that won the first round.

1172
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:53.560
I don't know. I mean that seems silly. It's,

1173
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.160
yeah. So I just want to like if the teacher

1174
01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.390
<v 3>comes and pulls you off a dude you're on top of you punch him in the face,</v>

1175
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.510
but that guy was hitting you with a jab for the first two minutes.

1176
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:07.470
Doesn't matter. Everybody knows you won the fight street fire rules. Yeah.

1177
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.640
You're on top and you punched him in the face when the,

1178
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.330
when they break it up you one. Yeah, he knows it too. Everyone knows it.

1179
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:18.220
<v 4>I agree. So I do like, I do like the second round being weighed,</v>

1180
01:06:18.221 --> 01:06:19.260
weighed more heavily. Yeah.

1181
01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:22.450
I think also having the second mountain weighed more heavily, um,

1182
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.400
where the first round is you're going to press the action and the guy's not

1183
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:31.750
really gonna run. Cause if, I mean, if you do run, you can't be assured that if,

1184
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:34.150
unless you dominated the first round completely,

1185
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.460
you can't be assured that you're going to win that.

1186
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.140
<v 3>I get the strategy though, where they want people to fight exciting fights.</v>

1187
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.040
They don't want anybody to hold their energy hold back until the second round.

1188
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.460
<v 4>I get that. That makes sense. Yeah.</v>

1189
01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:49.550
But at the same time from one guy presses the action in the first,

1190
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.650
everybody's going, I mean you got to go. Yeah, that's true. I Dunno,

1191
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:59.390
but it's, it's, see that's the, that the only problem with that is if,

1192
01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.290
if commissions would allow three rounds, you know. Yeah.

1193
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.010
I mean what's an extra round anyway? I like there's, there's not a single,

1194
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.270
it's weird how sometimes these people who don't do it and they, they say they,

1195
01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:16.520
they um, they're concerned for your safety and you're like, we're fighting.

1196
01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.010
<v 3>We already agreed to do this. It's like, yeah,</v>

1197
01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.790
I mean I know this is the worst thing that could happen today is a fight. Yeah.

1198
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:29.570
You're worried about someone's safety. Yeah. It's funny. It's, I don't know man.

1199
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.020
It's,

1200
01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:34.310
I just think that twice a night when you talked to neurologists in particular,

1201
01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.010
they, they think it's very dangerous. Yeah.

1202
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:37.760
Cause they think repeated concussions.

1203
01:07:37.761 --> 01:07:41.150
Like one of the things about football they're really concerned with was guys

1204
01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.600
that get head injuries early in the game. They,

1205
01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.760
they sit on the bench for a quarter and then jump back in.

1206
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:48.830
They're worried about that.

1207
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.440
They're worried about repeated concussions in one day.

1208
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:54.880
<v 4>I get that. And I also think like, we're football's concern. I again,</v>

1209
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:55.601
I love football.

1210
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:59.590
I still like to watch this sport and I have nothing against that. You,

1211
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.560
as long as the, the players have the information, you're making a choice. Right.

1212
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.680
This is freedom

1213
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:08.460
<v 3>now. Today. Yeah. They have the, you know, Bo Jackson,</v>

1214
01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:12.330
so he wouldn't let his kids play. Yeah. Well, which is really interesting.

1215
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.120
He said that he didn't know. I said no one knew back then.

1216
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.340
<v 4>Yeah. Nobody, I mean it's like, well yeah,</v>

1217
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.260
<v 3>they saw you wearing a helmet, you're going to be fine.</v>

1218
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.060
<v 4>See, that's the thing about,</v>

1219
01:08:21.061 --> 01:08:23.220
that's where I think the difference between fighting and,

1220
01:08:23.221 --> 01:08:26.690
and the NFL and football happens is because like, if,

1221
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.970
if I gave you a basketball and I stood here and I said,

1222
01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:32.760
throw that in my head as hard as you can, as hard as you want. Right.

1223
01:08:32.761 --> 01:08:35.340
As hard as you can. Right. I don't think you're gonna go,

1224
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.610
you're gonna try to smash me in the head with the basketball. Right. Right.

1225
01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:40.740
But if I put on a helmet, you,

1226
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.260
you're going to be more willing to throw it harder. Right.

1227
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.670
But it's like that doesn't, that, that really doesn't change anything is now,

1228
01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:52.170
now that you, this perceived, um, defense protection, there's just the barrier,

1229
01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:54.960
but I'm still getting that concussive force of you throw that basketball at my

1230
01:08:54.961 --> 01:08:57.360
head. Right? Yeah. Well, when you take football, you,

1231
01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:00.270
you're not taking just a punch traveling at like 20,

1232
01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:04.860
30 miles an hour from like two feet away hitting somebody. Yes. It's repeated.

1233
01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:08.690
But like, people don't take me really more than 60 punches in a, in a, in a,

1234
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:12.900
in a fight. But, um, sometimes they do. But, um, football,

1235
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.980
there's like you're slamming into each other and we're talking about 250 pound

1236
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:21.510
men at full speeds at 15 to 20 miles an hour. Boom,

1237
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:26.130
boom. You know, and that's, they're both running at each other, but that's,

1238
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:30.630
yeah, like a head on collision. So that's insane. That's, that's so different.

1239
01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.990
But I'm like, I don't, I don't, I don't say don't, don't play this sport.

1240
01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:36.960
Just make sure the information is out there and let that the people make their

1241
01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:37.794
choice

1242
01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.890
<v 3>is ever going to be anything they can do to figure out how to protect the brain.</v>

1243
01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:46.670
And so, I mean,

1244
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:51.170
this gotta be a way that they can figure out how to wow. Maybe not,

1245
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.230
I mean your brain sloshing around inside there. Yeah.

1246
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:58.410
<v 4>All right, good. That they have a way like give us the information,</v>

1247
01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:00.930
let you decide where you want to put your brain list or not.

1248
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.793
You know what I mean? Yeah.

1249
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.160
But like what I like the thing about the PFL because when you get,

1250
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.650
when you get to the playoffs that those two fights one night, um,

1251
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.350
I fun tournament. I ain't like, you know,

1252
01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.880
we knew about boxes being punchy and all that. I knew that, but I'm like,

1253
01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.740
I don't know. There's, there's a thing, there's a thing about competing,

1254
01:10:22.741 --> 01:10:26.250
there's a passion about competing and having that tournament opportunity.

1255
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.510
That's a lot of fun. Like a lot of these young guys love these young fighters.

1256
01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.960
They didn't get the chance to fight in tournament's because tournament's kind of

1257
01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:37.230
ended recently, you know, um, the pride tournament's were awesome.

1258
01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:40.140
And then of course back then it was a lot of points that UFC had the tournament

1259
01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:43.410
originally. So that's a whole lot of fun. But like with the PFL season,

1260
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.730
what I like about it is,

1261
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.820
is there's a bunch of different storylines that happens. You know, you, you,

1262
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.270
you're fighting to gain points to get into the playoffs.

1263
01:10:51.271 --> 01:10:55.470
So the f there are two regular season fights and the first regular season fight

1264
01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.000
you, um, you, you know, where everybody stayed in at zero,

1265
01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.790
but then you come in the second. Of course everybody wants to win their fight.

1266
01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.790
Everybody wants to win as soon as possible to get the maximum amount of points.

1267
01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.990
But then when you come into the second fight, then everybody's like, okay,

1268
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.230
you're looking at the numbers. I need this, I need this. You're concerned.

1269
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.270
Then you're watching throughout the night to figure out who's,

1270
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.380
who's got to do what.

1271
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.080
I you explain that to people that don't understand what we're talking about

1272
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:22.170
because there's a, you guys have a score system. We have a scoring system.

1273
01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:26.670
So the professional fighters league, um, a win win,

1274
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.760
you have to win. You have to, we have a seeding for the playoffs.

1275
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:31.380
So the top eight fighters in, in the,

1276
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:33.570
in the melee classes and the women are only eight.

1277
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.330
So the top four fighters get into the playoffs, right?

1278
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.350
And you get in by point standings. So you get a draw.

1279
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.220
That's one point for each fighter. You get a win. That's three points.

1280
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.920
But you gotta win by stoppage in the third round.

1281
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.100
That's four points when by stoppage in the second five win by stoppage in the

1282
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:52.740
first six. So you try to accrue points.

1283
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.680
So accumulate points so that when we get to the playoffs,

1284
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:58.560
you're seated in the top eight and I'm talking about the men.

1285
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.830
Just remember that the women are our four in the playoffs.

1286
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:07.250
But when you get seated for the top eight and then you fight the quarter final

1287
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:12.150
and semifinal fight on the same night and the winners from those nights,

1288
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:16.230
the windows in the semifinals go to the championships and that's on New Year's

1289
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:19.980
eve and that's for $1 million. So you get three fights for $1 million. Right?

1290
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:24.030
Um, that's pretty fucking good. That's really good. Right?

1291
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.980
So I wish this tournament was around when I was like,

1292
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:32.040
I'm like, yeah, I want to do that, you know? Sure. I want to win $1 million.

1293
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.040
So how many fighters got a million? I'm six. Wow.

1294
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:39.180
Six fighters got $1 million last year. So, um, there it is. Six champions.

1295
01:12:39.181 --> 01:12:43.590
Million dollars each. Yeah. And this year will be six, six millionaires again,

1296
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:48.200
um, the, the way that the season plays out, like I said, you,

1297
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.270
you fight the first round of the regular season when you come in.

1298
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:53.760
We're going into the second round of the regular season now. So on,

1299
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.610
on the eighth. On July eight, I'm sorry, July 11th,

1300
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.980
on Thursday night we're going to be in Atlantic city.

1301
01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:03.981
We have the women and we have the women hundred and 55 pounders and then we had

1302
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:09.021
the man welterweights and so this is a fight that I'm really excited about,

1303
01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:12.390
right? Maggie and Maggie, mad caramel, he won last season,

1304
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:16.290
but then Chris Curtis came into the PFL and he won his first fight.

1305
01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.640
Maggie had won his first fight, got six points. Chris Curtis gets four points,

1306
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:24.660
got third brown stoppage and he called out McNamara carom off you call out the

1307
01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:25.710
champion from last year.

1308
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.640
So he wants to go into this next fight finding the champion. I'm like,

1309
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:31.380
why would you do that? Because if you lose that,

1310
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:32.670
you're not making it into the playoffs,

1311
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:36.060
you lose your opportunity to million dollars. But like that, that, that,

1312
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:40.070
that provato of being a fighter and wanting, you know, you want to,

1313
01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:42.930
you want to knock the best guy off, right? You always want the best guy.

1314
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.760
But to call him out in a fashion where, where it threatened your potato,

1315
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:50.400
like he has to perform, he has to perform now.

1316
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.600
So like that fight really interests me because Maggie Mag Karamazov is really

1317
01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:58.530
good. He can do everything. Like he's one of those guys who does it look like,

1318
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.890
you know his body type. He doesn't look like the kind of guy who will smash you,

1319
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:04.470
but he will like, did you see Ray Cooper last year?

1320
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.320
Like Ray Booper the second ray Cooper the second.

1321
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:12.100
That's what's crazy is a Jake shields Fahd his dad and him and him and fought

1322
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.040
<v 0>him twice. Dow was what was kind of fucked up. I watched both those fights.</v>

1323
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:17.440
I was like, damn, they're making Jake shields fight this dude again.

1324
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.020
They didn't make him do it. I know they didn't make them do it,

1325
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.800
but he fucked Jacob and then he fucked him up again a couple months later. Yeah.

1326
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:28.240
How many months later? Was it like three or four months? Yeah. That's rough.

1327
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.410
But a a k a bad kao like that from the same guy. And then you find to be,

1328
01:14:32.411 --> 01:14:34.000
I mean he didn't have any answers for that dude.

1329
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.450
I like to fight a guy like ray who was a,

1330
01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:39.700
I believe it was state champion Hawaiian wrestler. Right?

1331
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:42.220
And Ou does he have some fucking heavy hands?

1332
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.700
<v 4>He's like the Mike Tyson of like welterweight</v>

1333
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:49.380
<v 0>and for Walter Wade, he's fairly short. He's like five, seven. Yup.</v>

1334
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:52.470
He just throws fucking bricks. Well, sodas, John Howard though.

1335
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:56.160
John Howard's got some fucking bombs in his hands. Yeah, I liked that fight too.

1336
01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:57.590
Yeah. Very interesting fight. Yeah.

1337
01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:00.070
<v 4>That's a very good fight. Now with that fight,</v>

1338
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:02.740
I [inaudible] because ray hits Hawaii.

1339
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:06.580
John Howard does have some bombs in his hand. I think. Um,

1340
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.620
ray has more power though. You know,

1341
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:11.380
I feel like how it's going to have to stick and move,

1342
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:14.410
use those leg kicks and try to slow them down. You, you, you can't,

1343
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.720
you can't go out there trying to take ray Cooper out early.

1344
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:21.370
<v 0>Well, John's been around a long time to John. John is set a long career. Yeah.</v>

1345
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:25.840
You know, I mean, how old is John Now? I think John is probably like 33 now.

1346
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:30.400
He's at least five. He was in the UFC a long time ago,

1347
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:35.890
minus 36 oh six. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he's been in some crazy wars.

1348
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.843
You know,

1349
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:39.160
<v 4>he's been in some wars. He's black. He like, he's,</v>

1350
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.060
he just got his black belt and that's [inaudible] the only guy who beat ray

1351
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:46.330
Cooper last season. You know, American made Caramel, beat beating my submission.

1352
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.570
Um, I think that's, that's the best,

1353
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.130
the best option for a lot of guys facing him cause he has so much power.

1354
01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:57.810
<v 0>Now all of these are on NBC sports. Is that what they're doing? Yes. PN Two.</v>

1355
01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:02.070
ESPN two ESPN and ESPN plus. Oh okay. Well that's, that's right. That's,

1356
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.120
that's new to this year. Right. That's new to this year. That's very exciting.

1357
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.840
That's very exciting.

1358
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:11.310
So ESPN plus w which also has the EOC and put it on ESPN as well.

1359
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:13.920
That's great. Yeah. That's so good man.

1360
01:16:13.921 --> 01:16:16.880
That ESPN is stepping into MMA like this. I love it.

1361
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:21.990
<v 4>It's huge because I thought this last year when the UFC signed with ESPN,</v>

1362
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:25.760
I was like, like that's a great thing because a lot of times the UFC,

1363
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:31.380
when fight fans watch the UFC, they only, they only think of the UFC as,

1364
01:16:31.381 --> 01:16:34.210
as mixed martial arts. I'm sorry. They think of mixed martial arts as the UFC.

1365
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:36.660
Right. You know, people ask you, you train UFC, you know. Right, right, right,

1366
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:41.080
right. But um, but like ESPN being the worldwide leader in sports,

1367
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:45.580
I've seen like highlights on ESPN from rise in from, you know, from Japan,

1368
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:48.310
from one while he's different from, from some small promotions.

1369
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:50.290
And it's like that helps the sport grow,

1370
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.660
that helps people recognize that this is just,

1371
01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:55.930
there's not only one avenue for the sport and these,

1372
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.150
these guys do have to cut their teeth somewhere.

1373
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:02.320
And also there are some other organizations where where you can get some quality

1374
01:17:02.321 --> 01:17:06.130
fights and really good fighters. Um, and then money and money. Yeah.

1375
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.470
Like I like there being a lot more options for guys where the money's concerned.

1376
01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:10.000
I'm very

1377
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.691
<v 0>happy about that.</v>

1378
01:17:10.691 --> 01:17:15.280
I mean that's how they lured sage over to one FC and also Eddie Alvarez and

1379
01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:16.810
mighty mouse, you know? Yeah.

1380
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:20.200
But it's a different world when there's no way cutting, you know,

1381
01:17:20.201 --> 01:17:24.520
I am just such a giant fan of that know what weight cutting deal the way they're

1382
01:17:24.521 --> 01:17:25.780
doing it over at one FC.

1383
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:30.290
<v 1>It's okay. So what exactly are they doing? You, you, you hydration tests.</v>

1384
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.350
And how, how's how far out before the fight?

1385
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.720
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know how they're doing it, but it says, wait,</v>

1386
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.240
what was explained to me is they essentially say if you are the 170 pound

1387
01:17:40.241 --> 01:17:43.480
champion, they bump you up to like one 85 yep. They're like, look,

1388
01:17:43.481 --> 01:17:46.270
you're going to fight one 85 now there's no way cutting.

1389
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:48.520
We are going to test you. We're going to test your way.

1390
01:17:48.521 --> 01:17:50.170
We're going to test your hydration. We're gonna,

1391
01:17:50.171 --> 01:17:53.140
we're gonna know what your real weight is. So this is your real weight.

1392
01:17:53.141 --> 01:17:55.060
Your real weight as 185 pounds,

1393
01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:59.200
you're dropping 15 pounds of water to get to one 70 but we both know that when

1394
01:17:59.201 --> 01:18:02.230
you get into that octagon, you're going to be 185 pounds.

1395
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:06.850
So let's just cut the shit and have you never dropped down to 170 and just say

1396
01:18:06.851 --> 01:18:09.120
you're 185 pound fighter, which is what they are.

1397
01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:11.290
I mean stand next to guys like Kamara loose mon. You're like,

1398
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.340
how are you one 70 that doesn't make any sense or are yo well,

1399
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:20.220
who's the craziest version? Yo well is so big. He's so big.

1400
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:25.600
His fucking neck starts at the top of his head and his, his shoulders,

1401
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:30.440
they may meet the traps in the middle, you know, it's like [inaudible].

1402
01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:35.290
He's just as mammoth of a man and the idea that that guy is 185 pounds is

1403
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.393
bananas.

1404
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:39.920
<v 1>I remember Tim t bow, those, those kinds of guys. Yeah.</v>

1405
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.650
And these guys are still muscular the entire time. I don't know how glaze. Yeah.

1406
01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:44.693
<v 0>Did it all those years.</v>

1407
01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.160
Glieson was walking around well over one 90 and getting down to one.

1408
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:54.030
<v 1>Not even man, like I'd see t bow in the gym and has like tee ball.</v>

1409
01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:56.070
What do you weigh right now? He's like, oh my friend.

1410
01:18:56.071 --> 01:19:00.510
One one 91 95 like get on the scale. No, no, no.

1411
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:01.890
He's not doing that, you know,

1412
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.810
easy like two oh five to 10 really two oh five to 10 you would get down to one

1413
01:19:06.811 --> 01:19:11.430
55 so big. How did he do it? I don't know.

1414
01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:14.250
Sheer force of will. Yeah. So I've, I've seen him,

1415
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.100
I weighed cuts just like laid out. Like we,

1416
01:19:17.101 --> 01:19:19.170
we fought on a couple of cars together also, you know,

1417
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.380
and he just like laid out and Ila, he has to be carried out of the room,

1418
01:19:22.381 --> 01:19:25.920
you know? Oh, of course you have to walk up to the scale on your own. But um,

1419
01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.410
that's so insane that you let a guy do that and then they fight a day later,

1420
01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:33.030
then yeah. The next day like, but you wouldn't,

1421
01:19:33.031 --> 01:19:37.650
you wouldn't let somebody recover from the flu, like say, Oh, I feel better.

1422
01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:40.610
The temperatures down. You want to let them fight the next day. Right. You know,

1423
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:45.170
they probably be healthier. Yeah. Much healthier. I don't know. It's a,

1424
01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:48.630
it's the dumbest thing in all combat sports in terms of, okay. Yeah,

1425
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:53.700
but I can be avoided. So you think the one, there's no,

1426
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.970
I can't, I'm, because I haven't been in the position,

1427
01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:02.100
I don't know how you work the system with the one FC system.

1428
01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.060
I would like to talk, talk

1429
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.830
<v 0>to Chaudhry Cha tree. Cha Tree is the one who set it all. I mean that's,</v>

1430
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.930
it's his organization and he, I think he's the leader in terms of the safety.

1431
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:17.610
And it also fairness because I think weight cutting is, I mean, look,

1432
01:20:17.611 --> 01:20:22.140
everybody's doing it so it's not like everybody is ethically compromised,

1433
01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:25.320
but I think it's cheating. I think it's legal cheating.

1434
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.390
That's what I think it is. If you're pretending you weigh 125 pounds,

1435
01:20:30.391 --> 01:20:31.470
like mighty mouse does,

1436
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:36.450
he doesn't really weight one 25 he weighs like one 41 40 something, you know?

1437
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:38.910
That's what he really weighs. And the thing is,

1438
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:41.940
when he's fighting over in one FC, those are the guys he's actually fighting.

1439
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:43.560
He's fighting guys his size. Yeah.

1440
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.790
So the guys that really did a great job of cutting weight,

1441
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:51.150
they do have a significant advantage once they get into that octagon.

1442
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.280
But I don't think that's a fair advantage.

1443
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.490
There's some guys that do it really well too. Yeah. Really well.

1444
01:20:56.590 --> 01:21:00.070
Some guys are excellent at it. Yeah. Some guy, I'm Joelle. He's excellent.

1445
01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.480
Even though he's missed a couple of times though, some of those guys, they just,

1446
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:08.160
the advantage is so spectacular. How does James Vick, may one 55.

1447
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:12.180
That's a good point. He's a tall fella. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of those guys.

1448
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:15.630
How Paul felter, Paul Valdez and fucking gorilla. How's he going?

1449
01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.010
Tell them what 55 he so thick. Yeah. Yeah, he's broad man.

1450
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.610
I remember when Dustin was making one 45 [inaudible] crazy.

1451
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:27.690
He looks like he's having a hard time making 55 now. But look man,

1452
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:31.020
the difference between him at 45 and 55 it's pretty easy.

1453
01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.990
<v 4>I'll never forget. So with Dustin,</v>

1454
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.350
like I, I'm, I'm kind of biased cause he's one of my best friends. Right?

1455
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.593
But um,

1456
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.490
you see how Max Max dominated a lot of guys at 45. Um,

1457
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.050
and then the, all the, you know, you talk about Max is like now he,

1458
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:52.660
now he's the greatest. Now he's the greatest at one 45 he may,

1459
01:21:52.661 --> 01:21:55.320
he may be the goat. He may be greater than Josie Aldo.

1460
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:57.080
Like that's an argument that people can make.

1461
01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.100
<v 0>Well, you beat him twice, right? Although he'd beat him later in his career.</v>

1462
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:03.260
Right. Josie is not 50 years old. He was in his early thirties.

1463
01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:05.640
<v 4>Yeah. And he was still, he was still the number one guy.</v>

1464
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:07.860
He was still dominating everybody else. Yup. Right.

1465
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.620
And he kept beating everybody else in corner. Um,

1466
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:16.710
but like the way Max beat those guys, beat Ortega,

1467
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.890
beat Joe say twice. Um, and then Dustin's having these tough fights. He's, he's,

1468
01:22:20.891 --> 01:22:24.210
he's fighting these same guys. He's fighting games. He's fighting Eddie. Um,

1469
01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:28.260
he's, he's winning them along. He's convincingly winning them. But um,

1470
01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.960
when he fights Max, like Max the,

1471
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:34.650
the fight is Dustin's fight as the same fight that he had with gay.

1472
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.920
Jesus ain't as far as competitiveness. Right. Max was still in there,

1473
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.790
but Dustin Wednesday's, but like, I just like, this is where my bias kicks in.

1474
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:45.330
I'm like, give that man some credit, man. Like, I mean,

1475
01:22:45.331 --> 01:22:48.180
I know everybody loves us. I mean, not everybody, but people love Dustin.

1476
01:22:48.181 --> 01:22:51.420
They appreciate the way he fights. They appreciate his style, but I'm like, man,

1477
01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:55.650
he's, he's taken out like champions taken out champions gates.

1478
01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:58.200
You as a champion who was in world series, but he's a champion. Yeah.

1479
01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.130
To got Eddie champion. Yup. You know, Max champion and he's like all these guys,

1480
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:06.160
he's beaten Sergio pet, I mean Andrea Anthony Pettis champion, you know,

1481
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.830
<v 0>just champion after champion rises to the occasion.</v>

1482
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:12.190
He fought better against Max and any other fighter you ever fought in his

1483
01:23:12.191 --> 01:23:12.600
career.

1484
01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.890
<v 4>That's the thing about him though. Like he just, these, he's like,</v>

1485
01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.760
he's like the cream, you know, he's easy rises that that's, that's, that's why,

1486
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:22.740
that's why his nickname's and diamond, you know,

1487
01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:27.520
what do you think happens when he fights? Could be, yeah.

1488
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:32.760
This, this is the one that's the fight. Like, so fight, like that's, I mean,

1489
01:23:32.761 --> 01:23:35.980
could be, he was, the guy. Could be, was definitely the guy. And um,

1490
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.890
I was talking to him about it. I, so I'm s I started a new podcast. I um,

1491
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:42.420
I it's called yes. Sup Fan.

1492
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:48.040
<v 0>Subfamily sub fan with Eve Edwards. Yeah, I know.</v>

1493
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.770
I just just released it today. It's a on, on, um, on my youtube.

1494
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:55.480
I just started today. Yeah, well just released the first episode. Oh, all right.

1495
01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:58.350
Um, and Dustin's my first guest. Oh, perfect.

1496
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.270
So I was out there with him last week and we just hanging out and we talked

1497
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:02.200
about some of that. But like,

1498
01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.400
<v 4>what do I think happens? This is a tough fight.</v>

1499
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.870
This like it's the toughest fight everybody's going to get. Right. Um,

1500
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:13.710
I absolutely understand and agree that can be,

1501
01:24:13.711 --> 01:24:17.010
you should be going in as the favorite, right? Um, I want,

1502
01:24:17.011 --> 01:24:21.630
of course I want Dustin to win this fight. The every round starts on the feet.

1503
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.950
Dustin's got to make smart moves every single time because when [inaudible]

1504
01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.590
takes him down, it's,

1505
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.540
it's almost virtually impossible to get back to your feet. Right?

1506
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:36.810
Um, and that's where it could be. He was going to want this fight to happen. Um,

1507
01:24:36.811 --> 01:24:39.720
Dustin's going to have his opportunities, but like,

1508
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:44.550
is he going to be able to stop that wrestling consistently enough to make this

1509
01:24:44.551 --> 01:24:47.490
fight happen where it's best for him? And that's the hardest thing.

1510
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.430
He's got a good training camp. He's got really good people there with him.

1511
01:24:50.431 --> 01:24:53.100
He's got Mike Brown there. You know who I want to get with him,

1512
01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:57.030
Greg or Gillespie. I want Greg Gillespie to, to,

1513
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:01.140
to get with Dustin and just get on top of him for the next two months.

1514
01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:05.420
<v 0>It's just feel that high level wrestling, smashing pressure, that pressure,</v>

1515
01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:08.930
pressure pressure and get comfortable working out of it. Working on two there,

1516
01:25:08.931 --> 01:25:11.630
protecting yourself, doing that. Would he be interested in,

1517
01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:16.460
I mean he might fight him down the road though. It's possible. Yeah. Right. Um,

1518
01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.090
but like Tyron and Robbie trained together a long time ago. Oh that's true.

1519
01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.530
Yeah. I mean that's how you get better.

1520
01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.050
<v 4>Yeah. Like it's, it's, it's one of those things where it's like you,</v>

1521
01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:30.530
you gotta sometimes you gotta trade with a potential arrival or you know,

1522
01:25:30.710 --> 01:25:35.330
not an enemy, but, um, but like the iron sharpens iron.

1523
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.560
Yup. No, and sometimes you gotta you have to go with somebody that's,

1524
01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.880
<v 0>we'll match up in the future. It just,</v>

1525
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.700
specially if you're going to fight a guy who has that same style,

1526
01:25:45.701 --> 01:25:48.430
and I think you nailed it too,

1527
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.570
cause Greg or Gillespie is probably when you get past,

1528
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:55.690
could be the scariest wrestler in the division. Yeah. I mean,

1529
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:59.080
he's a guy that gets on top of people and just smashes them and he's relentless

1530
01:25:59.081 --> 01:26:01.900
with his, with his wrestling also. He's a guy who's not going to get tired.

1531
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:03.950
He's going to put that pressure on you is going to come forward

1532
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.720
<v 1>and once he gets a hold of you,</v>

1533
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:10.550
if you don't use perfect technique to escape and get that distance back,

1534
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:13.850
he's just going to chain wrestle and chain wrestle. There's, there's no,

1535
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.270
there's no stopping until you're doubt. Until he scores his two there,

1536
01:26:17.290 --> 01:26:19.190
there's the, the take down is still happening.

1537
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.840
He's got some fucking relentless strength and conditioning sessions too that he

1538
01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:26.420
puts on his Instagram. You watch it and you go, oh,

1539
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:27.830
this is why this guy doesn't get tired.

1540
01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.520
Fuck that guy doesn't get tired cause he's, he's obsessed.

1541
01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:36.350
Like he, he runs, he wants like five minutes miles. Does he really like,

1542
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:41.270
he'll run like six of them straight. Like he like he will,

1543
01:26:41.271 --> 01:26:45.080
he will run like you'll run eight miles and you'll keep the ball on the six

1544
01:26:45.081 --> 01:26:49.460
minutes. So he'll run six miles and a half an hour. Yeah, he can do that.

1545
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.070
Fuck. He's crazy. Well that's crazy. That's crazy.

1546
01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:58.850
High level marathon pace, right? Yeah. Like period. People don't,

1547
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.090
people don't know some of the things about, about these guys. Like,

1548
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:05.720
like there was a point where training with these guys, I was just like,

1549
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:09.200
alright man, I'm too old to be doing that. Like I can't,

1550
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:13.250
I just can't keep up with that. You know what I mean? And that was one of them,

1551
01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:18.230
man Gregor, like we were on this Nike running app together and I'm like,

1552
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:21.620
I had to delete him off my thing cause I was a kid,

1553
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:25.370
like discuss like I'm not trying to beat that, you know?

1554
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:29.060
That's hilarious. Like for real, you should go fishing with them.

1555
01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.780
I want to go fishing with that dude. I want to take up fishing in The Bahamas.

1556
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.350
Oh that's a good spy. Yeah. And line fishing. Not,

1557
01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:40.290
not like that with the rod weight. We fish a lot of line fishing. Okay.

1558
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:42.440
Just with your hands. Yeah. And um,

1559
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.830
that's why when you feel the fish on the line, oh,

1560
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.790
and you're just fighting and pulling. Uh, I love that. It's funny. I mean there,

1561
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.710
there are some fish, like I'm not pulling up a group of like that, you know?

1562
01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:54.350
Why do you, why do you prefer line fishing with your hands?

1563
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:57.620
Just because it's the old school way. Just, just because it's the way I grew up.

1564
01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:03.120
Um, like when we, when we get like my cousin I told you about who's we,

1565
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:05.840
you know, free dives, like he'll spearfish.

1566
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.410
So I remember once I was a little kid and um, he was out with,

1567
01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:14.150
his daddy was spear fishing and he missed the fish and he smashed the turtle.

1568
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:17.530
Oh, I thought you was going to say his hand. No, no. He's silly. See,

1569
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.010
somebody hit the, his spirit. A turtle turtle took off with the spirit. Oh No.

1570
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:26.360
So yeah, I mean it's potentially some turtle out there in the ocean right now.

1571
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:28.520
The spirit stuck in them. This is like 30 years ago.

1572
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:30.610
Those things live for him to live forever.

1573
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:35.180
Wonder if it's survived the calcified over the, the spear point. Yeah.

1574
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:39.770
I never been spearfishing, but it looks like a hell of a lot of fun. I have,

1575
01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.430
I've never spearfished like inside the, I've, you know,

1576
01:28:43.431 --> 01:28:47.690
I played with him on land. Um, and of course it's with the, with the, with the,

1577
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.860
what's that? The rubber, you know, like kind of like a slingshot. Yeah.

1578
01:28:50.861 --> 01:28:54.620
The bungee cord. So that one was cool, but um, of course they have the guns.

1579
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.690
I would like to use a spear gun, but I like, um, I dunno,

1580
01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:02.040
you gotta kind of have to earn that, right? I feel like, yeah,

1581
01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.580
I gotta I got to go free diving with curly and do some of that.

1582
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.450
As long as you think you can hold your breath under water. Um,

1583
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.190
so we used to have this thing as a kid where I was,

1584
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.360
where we'd say we tried to blow the pool and, um, I, I can,

1585
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.250
I can swim in Olympic level. Well,

1586
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:21.060
I have swam Olympic length pool staying under water. Right.

1587
01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:23.550
But how long does that take? That probably took me like, Nah,

1588
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.940
I probably took me like 40, 45 seconds.

1589
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.160
And then also you're swimming. Yeah, you're exerting. So yeah. But, um,

1590
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:33.660
but like he, like I'm telling you,

1591
01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:36.910
he goes down and he's under the water for easily three minutes. You know,

1592
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:39.450
it was supposed to be insane at that. It's Eagan, Eagan. Anyway,

1593
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:42.780
I heard about that. I already heard about six minutes. Seven minutes.

1594
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.320
Yeah. I, it's like, I don't know, maybe from sucking up a joke.

1595
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:51.590
<v 0>Yeah, I think it's just practice.</v>

1596
01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.810
And then you just practice free diamond and Hawaiians,

1597
01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.940
they do that crazy workout. There was a member,

1598
01:29:55.941 --> 01:29:58.880
one of the countdown shows and BJ was supposed to be fighting George Saint

1599
01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:58.910
Pierre.

1600
01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:02.300
They had him doing his strength and conditioning in the water where he would

1601
01:30:02.301 --> 01:30:04.110
dive under water and pick up a rock and,

1602
01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:07.160
and move it and drop it and swim to the surface and drive,

1603
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:11.210
dive down again and pick up the rocks like a big ass rock and move it.

1604
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:13.010
And that was part of his strength conditioning.

1605
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:16.320
<v 1>So like, um, the, the, I,</v>

1606
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:19.970
I was D I was good with my cardio ties on a guest, but, um,

1607
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:23.060
like when punches are coming at you, a lot of people blink.

1608
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.220
A lot of people do that. So that like, that was my thing.

1609
01:30:25.221 --> 01:30:28.280
I keep my eyes open a long time, you know what I mean? So that, that's my,

1610
01:30:28.281 --> 01:30:30.860
that whole steer camp thing and that kind of comes from that.

1611
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:35.210
I just keep my eyes open, not blinking. Um, those guys who,

1612
01:30:35.211 --> 01:30:39.410
who do those underwater things, how do, how do you think that relates to, like,

1613
01:30:39.411 --> 01:30:41.120
I understand you can hold your breath longer,

1614
01:30:41.121 --> 01:30:43.250
but how do you think that relates to cardio? Because you're not,

1615
01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.280
you're your muscles not working except to, to hold the rock.

1616
01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:49.870
<v 0>Well, the idea is the doing the rock thing, like loot,</v>

1617
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:53.440
moving and carrying the rock while you're underwater. I don't know, man.

1618
01:30:53.441 --> 01:30:57.010
I don't know enough about it, but I know I had layer in Hamilton on recently,

1619
01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.580
you know, he's a big time surfer and a,

1620
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.800
one of the things that he's doing now with,

1621
01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:06.100
he has this whole program where they're doing weights in the water. So they're,

1622
01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:08.330
they're doing like heavy dumbbells and they'll,

1623
01:31:08.331 --> 01:31:11.000
they'll bring them to the bottom of the water and uh,

1624
01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.050
you have to take the dumbbell swim with it to the top,

1625
01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.110
catch your breath of air and then you go back down again. And there's,

1626
01:31:17.111 --> 01:31:19.420
there's also doing some where they're taking like a, you know,

1627
01:31:19.421 --> 01:31:20.770
like a 70 pound dumbbell.

1628
01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:23.980
You hold it to your chest and you're swimming through the water while you're

1629
01:31:23.981 --> 01:31:28.600
trying to carry this dumbbell and you know, it's extremely difficult to do.

1630
01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:34.020
The thing is how much is that applicable to fight it?

1631
01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.440
That's what I don't know.

1632
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.730
Cause I remember when I was like real heavily in did you do to at one point in

1633
01:31:39.731 --> 01:31:44.230
time I didn't do any striking for like, like a whole year.

1634
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:48.070
I didn't even hit pads and then, but I was in really good. You did too shape.

1635
01:31:48.071 --> 01:31:52.120
I was rolling a lot and then I went to hit pads. I was like, God damn it.

1636
01:31:52.121 --> 01:31:55.180
Why am I gassing out so quick? This is crazy. It's a different shape, right?

1637
01:31:55.181 --> 01:31:56.170
Yeah, it's different shape.

1638
01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.010
<v 1>I don't, I always, I'm always concerned about that.</v>

1639
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.220
Are curious about that anyway

1640
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.780
<v 0>because, because of all those different aspects of it, um,</v>

1641
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:07.270
you know, there, there are times when when you,

1642
01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:08.500
when you're grabbing on to something,

1643
01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:11.320
holding onto something and you eat it and then you get back to your feet and all

1644
01:32:11.321 --> 01:32:13.750
that lactic acid builds up in your arms and your arms are slow,

1645
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:18.160
but like you still feel your conditioning feels good but you just feel heavy.

1646
01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.710
But I'm there. There's those times also when you're,

1647
01:32:20.711 --> 01:32:23.980
you're grappling and then you get back to your feet and then it's like your arms

1648
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:28.030
don't feel tired, but it's like, it feels it's a d. I don't know. I don't,

1649
01:32:28.031 --> 01:32:30.820
is it because you're holding your breath and maybe that's what going on the

1650
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:32.980
waters for, I don't know. You know, the people that,

1651
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:37.570
the train BJ for in the prime of his career was a Marlboro Penivich.

1652
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.780
Do you remember that? Yeah, I remember that name. They, they,

1653
01:32:39.781 --> 01:32:44.710
they had these ridiculous plyometric drills they had them doing and their

1654
01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:49.711
attitude and nick curse on is one of their proteges and he still sort of has the

1655
01:32:50.321 --> 01:32:55.030
same philosophy. Their attitude is that you already know how to fight.

1656
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:58.420
Like you're already a skillful fighter when you get to the UFC.

1657
01:32:58.421 --> 01:33:01.150
If you have eight weeks to get ready for a fight or 12 weeks,

1658
01:33:01.151 --> 01:33:01.931
get ready for a fight,

1659
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:06.931
the most important thing is your gas tank and that you should concentrate on

1660
01:33:06.971 --> 01:33:11.770
these fucking preposterous plyometric drills and strength and conditioning

1661
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:16.210
drills and just get your body so you have the biggest fucking gas tank possible

1662
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.600
and then all your skills you just drill like that shouldn't have any,

1663
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:24.220
any effect like cardio wise,

1664
01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:28.300
like if you're doing drills as far as like striking, grappling,

1665
01:33:28.301 --> 01:33:29.860
combination drills or whatever you're doing,

1666
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.400
like those things should almost be secondary to strength and conditioning.

1667
01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.940
That's their attitude. I kind of agree with that.

1668
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:39.220
I mean there's a point where yeah,

1669
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:42.880
you can always improve technique-wise but are you going to do that in a eight

1670
01:33:42.881 --> 01:33:45.640
week camp? Right, right. Like you do that,

1671
01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:48.820
you do that in your downtime right now. You do that when you're not in camp.

1672
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:53.770
When camp comes, it's all about being ready to fight for as long as you need to.

1673
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:54.850
As hard as you can.

1674
01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.050
And I think their attitude also is that this way you're doing way less barring

1675
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.760
way less opportunity to get hurt.

1676
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.390
And mostly it's these crazy plyo drills,

1677
01:34:04.391 --> 01:34:08.590
box jumps and all this crazy shit, medicine ball stuff, all this,

1678
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.880
all this stuff where you just explode, expose, expose folks.

1679
01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:13.330
Well everything is just go, go, go, go, go.

1680
01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:16.660
So that your body's just used to that. So then when you get into a fight,

1681
01:34:16.661 --> 01:34:20.590
your body has this insane gas tank and they might,

1682
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:24.250
I mean there's something to it, cause those were BJ's best days.

1683
01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.520
The Sean sherk fight, the Diego Sanchez fight.

1684
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:31.780
That was Prime BJ Penn when he was the motherfucker of motherfuckers.

1685
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:33.820
That was what was up. I mean he was,

1686
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.800
he was training with the Marinovich is did you,

1687
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:39.600
did you see that video of him beating of the bounce? Everything. Sad,

1688
01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.530
sad. They still obviously having a real tough time, man, I didn't,

1689
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:47.360
I just saw the video. I don't know how it happened. I don't know what, yeah,

1690
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.090
he's just inside control with flip flops on a, but here's my thing.

1691
01:34:52.091 --> 01:34:54.370
I don't know the situation that led to it.

1692
01:34:54.371 --> 01:34:58.370
I only saw that he's on top of the guy and I'm like, I'm like this isn't Hawaii.

1693
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:03.460
<v 1>Like who picks a fight with BJ Penn in Hawaii or who even like steps to BJ pet</v>

1694
01:35:03.941 --> 01:35:07.010
in Hawaii. I mean I understand if, if, if there was, I don't know the situation.

1695
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:08.990
If it's like DJ, you've got to leave and he's not listening.

1696
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.740
You try to get BJ's friends to come.

1697
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:13.400
They talk to your Garmin and get them out of here. Right. But like you don't,

1698
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:16.880
you don't go toe to toe with BJ Penn. Right. Seems stupid.

1699
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:20.840
It's just a bad choice. I don't care that hey did Max Holloway,

1700
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:24.230
is he the one who started the bottle cap challenge? Do we know that for a fact?

1701
01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.670
I use the first one I saw.

1702
01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.800
<v 3>I'm so tired of seeing people kick bottle caps.</v>

1703
01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:30.510
I was going to say there's not some different about his.

1704
01:35:30.511 --> 01:35:34.920
Is that the cap state on the bottle? Everyone else is just kicking the cap off.

1705
01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:37.560
I kept it on. They kept spinning coincidentally. I know,

1706
01:35:37.561 --> 01:35:40.500
but that might be to the bottle of Tito's. I think that he used.

1707
01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.140
But like that's a little more impressive than some of the other people just

1708
01:35:43.141 --> 01:35:46.520
knocking it off or slightly slightly. But it's not that big of a deal.

1709
01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.600
[inaudible] is a reason why so many people are doing it. It's not that hard.

1710
01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:54.240
It's just not that hard. He throw wheel kick like this.

1711
01:35:54.450 --> 01:35:55.830
He just like get someone to hold it,

1712
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:58.530
get someone to hold it tight and the wheel kick goes like this and you have the

1713
01:35:58.531 --> 01:36:00.180
bottle cap barely on.

1714
01:36:00.181 --> 01:36:03.300
So the bottle cap is like this and you just make sure you throw a wheel kick

1715
01:36:03.301 --> 01:36:05.760
like that but you don't knock it off. That's everyone else knocked it off.

1716
01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:08.670
He kept it on. People use him both water bottle caps,

1717
01:36:08.671 --> 01:36:11.070
which have a shallow set of grooves.

1718
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.370
Whereas like the bottle that he used has a deeper group.

1719
01:36:14.371 --> 01:36:17.130
Would it be more impressive if they showed the whole bottle and that there's not

1720
01:36:17.131 --> 01:36:19.120
someone holding it and you like you only? I think

1721
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.820
<v 1>so. Is it anything? Yes. Really. It's,</v>

1722
01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.850
I've never even thought once about doing it,

1723
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.080
so I know how to throw a wheel kick. I'm not going to do it. It's just,

1724
01:36:29.081 --> 01:36:31.840
it seems silly to me. Like with Jason Stayed, them's do it.

1725
01:36:31.841 --> 01:36:35.680
And when John Mayer did it, the fucking shark was jumped.

1726
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:40.900
Oh, that's [inaudible] wasn't it? That assassin,

1727
01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:44.190
I think Max called him out on it. He did it. Yeah. He called out John Mayer.

1728
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.590
Why? It's like, why does Justin Bieber want to fight Tom Cruise?

1729
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.870
There's so many questions. I would watch it. I would watch it and watch it.

1730
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:57.790
I think Tom Cruise will lock him up with all those crazy voodoo super powers

1731
01:36:57.791 --> 01:37:01.810
that he has got from Scientology and the aliens belief in himself, man.

1732
01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.430
The fights last weekend. Yeah, right. I just, I, so I didn't want to watch him.

1733
01:37:06.431 --> 01:37:08.710
I was, um, I was in Texas and, and I called,

1734
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.370
there's this ice cream and they were in Austin. I was like, they never have it.

1735
01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:14.950
And they had at one time I was, I drove from Houston,

1736
01:37:14.951 --> 01:37:18.700
Austin and get some ice cream. You drove from Houston to Austin.

1737
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:23.650
That's like three hours. You drove three hours for ice cream. I did.

1738
01:37:23.710 --> 01:37:25.510
Oh my God. You're embracing the fatness.

1739
01:37:28.450 --> 01:37:31.890
It was worth it. I know. But you make it by your weight.

1740
01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:37.410
You get ready to, for people to see you in the later stage. James, Tony Career,

1741
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.630
remember? Yup. I don't want to beat James. Tony.

1742
01:37:40.631 --> 01:37:42.790
I want to still be able to take off my shirt. But man,

1743
01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.040
I had to go get it but wow.

1744
01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.490
But I did watch the fight and I watched the main card. Frances.

1745
01:37:49.690 --> 01:37:54.160
It's fucking terrifying. Right? He's fucking terrifying.

1746
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:56.160
Like when when jds mist.

1747
01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.840
<v 3>Yeah. Like you can't,</v>

1748
01:37:57.841 --> 01:38:00.720
you can't make mistakes against him cause you take one and that could be it.

1749
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.820
Well I felt like jds was doing pretty good in the beginning with the leg kick.

1750
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.470
That's what you need to do with Francis.

1751
01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:09.930
You need just to keep moving and kick those legs. Yeah.

1752
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:11.860
It'd be interesting to see if, uh,

1753
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:15.840
well I mean obviously Allister was the most elite Stryker's for the most

1754
01:38:15.841 --> 01:38:20.040
decorated striker in the whole division and one of the most decorated strikers

1755
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:21.840
ever. And Francis Still Nuke Tim.

1756
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:26.070
He's nukes guys to do is hit you man. Crazy.

1757
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:31.050
You saw 'em um, I can't say his last name. Champion dollar,

1758
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.960
his nickname. He fought on the, on the card.

1759
01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:36.150
I think he was Cameroonian also.

1760
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:39.420
I didn't see the undercard the only thing I saw was the a Frances fight.

1761
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:44.600
This guy looks like if you take Tyron Woodley and made him bigger,

1762
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:50.760
stronger, faster. What, what's his name?

1763
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.680
Dollar Lou Louis Ambu. I can't, I don't know his last name.

1764
01:38:55.681 --> 01:39:00.270
I can't pronounce it. But um, as he a new, uh, acquiring,

1765
01:39:00.271 --> 01:39:04.560
I think this was his debut. Oh. And he looked,

1766
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:09.540
I honestly, I would like to see him in Alonzo manifold at some point. Um,

1767
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.100
they, they both look, they're both like,

1768
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:15.040
it would be like watching like two GI Joe figures, you know,

1769
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.850
like just like getting in there and go into town. You know,

1770
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:21.420
that heavyweight that fights in one FC, they call him the panther.

1771
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.160
He just did the bottle cap challenge two.

1772
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:26.790
He did like a hook kick and then a wheel kick with a different leg. No, he uh,

1773
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:31.910
he's this dude who is another one of those preposterous looking fellows that

1774
01:39:33.451 --> 01:39:38.010
just unbelievably jacked and the heavyweight. What do you, okay, here it is.

1775
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:41.880
We're gonna see the, this is the highlight. Oh yeah.

1776
01:39:43.730 --> 01:39:47.320
Oh my God. He's fast. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1777
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:53.460
And you're just so big and powerful. Heavyweight, whatever way right here.

1778
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.100
Oh yeah. Oh, that's, well,

1779
01:39:55.101 --> 01:39:57.710
that's interesting because this fucking weight clause needs some new blood,

1780
01:39:57.711 --> 01:40:02.390
that's for sure. I mean, Yup, that's a wrap quick. Damn.

1781
01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:07.760
I'm like, I'm like, dude, I'm like, man, you want to come make $1 million?

1782
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.440
How many contracts? I mean, these contracts,

1783
01:40:12.441 --> 01:40:16.550
how many fights did they put them under? Um, you just for the year.

1784
01:40:16.551 --> 01:40:20.420
So I continue to get to the main, it's firefights and if you win,

1785
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:25.420
do you have to stay in the PFL? You do not have to. Um,

1786
01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:30.230
I don't actually, when it comes to the, I don't know the details on champions,

1787
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:34.430
but I know that the semifinalist, um, have returned.

1788
01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:37.550
So I haven't read everyone's contract or anyone's contract really.

1789
01:40:37.551 --> 01:40:40.010
But I'm thinking that the semifinals should turn.

1790
01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.850
I don't know if there is a right to first refusal in the contract for the

1791
01:40:43.851 --> 01:40:47.570
season, but, um, that's a good question. I need to know that too.

1792
01:40:47.571 --> 01:40:50.300
Like the whole point scoring format thing.

1793
01:40:50.301 --> 01:40:54.370
Do you think just it's a good added element? I like it. Um,

1794
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:59.050
<v 4>I like it and not necessarily because it changes how people's fight people fight</v>

1795
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:02.990
, uh, fighting in this organization that I believe you kind of, you're,

1796
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.010
you're a little more loose, you know what I mean? You show up and you know,

1797
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:07.930
you have to, when you try to win and you try to win,

1798
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.400
you don't just try to get the w, you know, there, there,

1799
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:14.980
there's a lot of fights sometimes when it's like you're on the bubble and it's

1800
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:18.610
like you're fighting very cautious, you know? Um,

1801
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:22.450
I feel like with this rule set, you get to just be yourself out there.

1802
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:26.410
You every, you always want to win, so you always going to fight to win,

1803
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:31.150
but you don't necessarily change your style to, to play again, play the rules.

1804
01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.400
You know, you just, you just gotta fight the way you fight.

1805
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:38.290
The only thing that concerns me is the, that's a little complicated.

1806
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:43.480
Paying attention to all the, for the fans, the points and all that.

1807
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:46.480
So I understand why you would say that,

1808
01:41:46.481 --> 01:41:50.830
but if you're watching the broadcast, like, you know, you got me Shawn, Randy,

1809
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.600
I'm behind the desk and we're,

1810
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:55.870
we're trying to keep people updated with the points and, and how that works.

1811
01:41:55.871 --> 01:42:00.220
And, and it's, it's really not that hard. Who? Sean Charlotte call. Oh,

1812
01:42:00.221 --> 01:42:03.610
so he's doing commentary. So he's doing commentary Radio Guy, right? Yeah.

1813
01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:07.560
He was a radio guy for on, on serious, like a sports radio guy. And He,

1814
01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:11.050
I think he still has that program. Yeah. Good for him. Yeah.

1815
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.350
He's always a millionaire. Divert that.

1816
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.030
He's a millionaire and he's diversified his portfolio and he retired.

1817
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.920
He retired from fighting. Um, and now he's in the booth and he's,

1818
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:24.330
I think he's a pretty good play by play guy. Especially as a,

1819
01:42:24.331 --> 01:42:27.940
as a former fighter. Not a lot of play by play guys. A form of flighters. Yeah,

1820
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:32.140
that's right. It's usually color. And he, um, he fought well in the UFC too.

1821
01:42:32.141 --> 01:42:36.580
He's a tough guy. Yeah, I mean, and, and it's weird. I always make fun of him.

1822
01:42:36.581 --> 01:42:39.220
I always tell him like, you fight like homer Simpson,

1823
01:42:39.221 --> 01:42:43.140
but your fight IQ is higher. I said fight,

1824
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:45.760
it's like a homer sim cause he takes so many shots, man,

1825
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.150
he just like stands in front of you and just trades punches. But like,

1826
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:52.980
like he had to use his brain to be Vinny. You know what I mean? There's a,

1827
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.370
Vinny takes you down and gets on top. He's,

1828
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:58.810
he's gonna Grind and grant himself do submission. But I'm with Shawn. He was,

1829
01:42:58.811 --> 01:43:01.780
he was, you know, he backed away from, from the,

1830
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.020
cause all of his other fights all season were where the homer Simpson fight.

1831
01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:07.560
You know, like he got hit sometimes,

1832
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.990
but he just came back and bombed on you and, and knocked everybody out.

1833
01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:14.080
He lost every first round that he fought. Um, one of them,

1834
01:43:14.081 --> 01:43:17.440
he lost the entire fight. But, um, every other fight that he fought,

1835
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:21.550
he lost the first round and then came back and, and just, just bond on guys. Um,

1836
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:24.670
even with any, he lost the first round, you know, but um,

1837
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:27.100
but as far as the points go with that,

1838
01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:30.860
you have us communicating how the points work and it,

1839
01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:35.710
I remember being in your position before the season started thinking, oh,

1840
01:43:35.711 --> 01:43:38.500
the points thing is it's going to be weird. It's going to throw people off,

1841
01:43:38.501 --> 01:43:42.760
but legit, you see that play out one time. It's like, oh this is simple.

1842
01:43:42.761 --> 01:43:44.080
It makes sense. You know,

1843
01:43:44.081 --> 01:43:47.440
you started watching guys like so this next round of fights coming up on the

1844
01:43:47.441 --> 01:43:50.590
11th and on the 25th, then August 8th, we have the different weight,

1845
01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.970
two weight per show. Right. And um,

1846
01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:56.510
so we started with the women's lightweights and the welterweights.

1847
01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:59.660
Then we have the featherweights and the men's lightweights and then we have the

1848
01:43:59.661 --> 01:44:03.860
light hair using the heavies. So on those dates. But when, um,

1849
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:05.960
when you think about the points, right,

1850
01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:10.220
you understand that like these guys are on the bubble, you're watching it like,

1851
01:44:10.221 --> 01:44:12.110
like the NFL playoffs. When, when, you know,

1852
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:15.200
the last two weeks of the playoffs is like, this guy needs to beat this guy,

1853
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.290
but this guy has to finish before this time. You know,

1854
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:22.400
if he can get this win in the second round in less than two and a half minutes,

1855
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:25.520
then he's in the playoffs. But if it goes past two and a half, he's out.

1856
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:31.230
But like we're, we're communicating that to each fight, especially in the,

1857
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:33.860
this second round of the regular season. But I'm,

1858
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:38.330
you want you watching that because these guys know that also, you know, so,

1859
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:41.360
so some, some of that, like it's weird because in,

1860
01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:44.480
in a fight you're not thinking about anything else but the guy in front of you.

1861
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.750
But you go in there with that mentality that's already on the board.

1862
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:49.610
You don't have it. There's a pin in that. You know,

1863
01:44:49.611 --> 01:44:51.140
you don't have to think about it consciously,

1864
01:44:51.141 --> 01:44:54.980
but it's in your subconscious at some point. You, you played to that. Um,

1865
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.100
but even if you get out of that, if you get beyond that, then you're still this,

1866
01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.030
there's the pride thing.

1867
01:44:59.030 --> 01:45:04.030
And this is a format that didn't exist with the peer fell or no other,

1868
01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.050
no, this is a new format. This is a new format. They changed the name,

1869
01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:10.040
they changed the name,

1870
01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:13.190
they changed the name just before they introduced this format. But um,

1871
01:45:13.191 --> 01:45:15.770
I believe that the name has changed going into this format.

1872
01:45:15.771 --> 01:45:19.400
I think they had one event as the professional fighters league without this

1873
01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:24.270
seasonal format. Um, Oh man, I might be too old school. You might be too awful.

1874
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:28.640
But if you, you say that like you gotta try it. Like you, you're a fight fat.

1875
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:32.130
Like I promise you as a fight fan, you're going to appreciate it. Okay.

1876
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:36.230
Tell me what car to watch. What's, what's a good upcoming card?

1877
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:40.940
The next card is a real one because cause the, besides the women, um,

1878
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:44.870
you got Kayla Harrison judo two time when she's a baby. She's right.

1879
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:46.890
She's a baby. She's a beast. But she,

1880
01:45:46.891 --> 01:45:50.630
she needs to get a finish to guarantee yourself a playoff spot because she

1881
01:45:50.631 --> 01:45:53.120
fought her last fight. She fought her tough,

1882
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:56.480
his opponent who took her to her decision, she, she won the fight convincingly,

1883
01:45:56.481 --> 01:46:01.370
but she couldn't get herself a stoppage. Sarah Kaufman is, um, it's,

1884
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:03.750
cause I call from a sitting at the top of the women's rankings, the,

1885
01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.280
with the finish. Um, there are some, some, some really good women out there too.

1886
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:09.860
They're, he's two kickboxers. They fought each other last time. Bobby,

1887
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.120
Joe DL and Jenna Fabian. They're both built like European kickboxers.

1888
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:18.140
They're tall, lanky, long women and they're legit. Good.

1889
01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:20.940
Kickboxers they went until they went toe to toe with each other. Um,

1890
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.630
they're fighting in this week then not fighting each other,

1891
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.010
but they're fighting. They, Jenna Fabian needs a w to get into the playoffs.

1892
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:29.390
So those fights are good.

1893
01:46:29.391 --> 01:46:31.940
And then of course we have the welterweights we're talking about Maggie Med,

1894
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.660
Megan Med, Karimov and, and, and, um, Chris Curtis.

1895
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.560
I don't know if you know Chris Curtis. He, he was on, he was on, um, he was,

1896
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:42.820
I think he was LFA champion or RFA champion and he was on,

1897
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:45.230
he was on the contenders. He won his fighting contenders.

1898
01:46:45.231 --> 01:46:48.950
I don't know why he didn't get a contract, but, um, he's really, really,

1899
01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:50.010
he's one of those guys

1900
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.820
<v 0>he's been training with, with um, Henderson and those guys for a long time.</v>

1901
01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:55.740
Now he's in Vegas with, um, with,

1902
01:46:55.750 --> 01:47:00.600
with extreme couture there and then the John Howard Ray Cooper fight.

1903
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.050
That's like as a fight fan, you, I know you, you appreciate that.

1904
01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.060
Excellent Front. So when is that? That is on July 11th. That's next Thursday.

1905
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.650
And on ESPN too. Okay. And plus beautiful. Yeah, I'm around.

1906
01:47:13.710 --> 01:47:16.290
I'm gonna Watch that Fart. I'm legit.

1907
01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:20.790
When we sit down for the broadcast, I'm texting you. Okay. You got it.

1908
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:23.520
If you don't, if you don't respond and put you on blast,

1909
01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:29.880
I'll text you back and say, man, this guy doesn't like on ESPN. Plus we are,

1910
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:32.810
we are on ESPN plus and Joe Rogue is nowhere to be found. Oh,

1911
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:37.580
I can't have that happen. I'll be paying attention. All right. Um, so that's a,

1912
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:42.390
so all the fights are going to be on ESPN plus sometimes one ESPN, two fights.

1913
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:45.780
You can't get them on ESPN plus unless you have it set up. Okay.

1914
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:49.470
So a lot of times, so we bounced between ESPN plus him too.

1915
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.480
I don't know the format for the first fight.

1916
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:54.660
I can't remember which section of the card is on ESPN two and then on plus,

1917
01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:55.523
oh there it is.

1918
01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:00.720
So where I'm plus at five 30 to eight 30 east coast time and then on to from

1919
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:03.600
eight 30 to 10 30. That's a great thing about ESPN,

1920
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:08.930
including with the UFC is that so many sports fans just have ESPN on automatic.

1921
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.260
Absolutely. Like I was at a pool hall on Saturday night.

1922
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:16.320
I did a show in Baltimore and then we went to a pool hall.

1923
01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:20.580
We got there right when junior was entering into the octagon. It was perfect.

1924
01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:23.130
It was perfect timing. And I was like,

1925
01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:26.610
don't blink because this fucking probably ain't gonna make it out of the first

1926
01:48:26.611 --> 01:48:27.660
round. Yeah, that was,

1927
01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:30.920
that was a fight I was telling my grandmother about that flight, man. Like, no,

1928
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:33.690
I'm not. I'm not bullshitting you. She was up. It's interesting.

1929
01:48:33.691 --> 01:48:38.100
Like Francis wants another shot at the title and you know it's, it's a,

1930
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:41.410
I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't give them another shot at the toe.

1931
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:46.170
In my opinion. It's like what you got now is steep a versus DC that,

1932
01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.590
that irons out. Who's the champ. Right.

1933
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.680
And thank God they made that fight instead of the Brock Loeser fight. I mean,

1934
01:48:52.681 --> 01:48:56.400
I think the Brock Lester fight would've been fun. And I want, I love DC.

1935
01:48:56.401 --> 01:49:00.630
I want them to get paid. I think he sends Brock Lesnar into another dimension.

1936
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:02.190
That's what I think happens in that fight.

1937
01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.920
And I think he gets a big payday and that's all great.

1938
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.050
But the reality is the real fights, DBAs, DBAs,

1939
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:10.980
the most successful UFC heavyweight champion of all time,

1940
01:49:11.190 --> 01:49:13.500
the only guy to ever defend the title four times.

1941
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:17.370
And the only guy that survived the fucking hurricane that is Francis and Ghana.

1942
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:20.620
Yeah, the only guy he figured it out, he figured it out.

1943
01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:25.590
It just weather the storm, you know, just roll with the punches, kick the legs,

1944
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:29.940
Jab, move, use your wrestling rassle immediately. But he had to stop.

1945
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.270
He had to avoid the punches at first. Yeah. And he's got, you know,

1946
01:49:34.330 --> 01:49:35.610
that was an interesting thing too.

1947
01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:39.270
I was thinking the fight with steep a with a Francis.

1948
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:43.590
How much did that take out as t pay? Because even though he won that fight,

1949
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.980
when DC knocked him out with one punch, like wow, that's crazy.

1950
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.040
You don't see Steve Bay

1951
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.080
<v 1>getting knocked out like that.</v>

1952
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:52.840
I wonder if he was still suffering from the in Ghana fight,

1953
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:54.730
which is only like a few months before that.

1954
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:58.750
I don't know if he was still suffering from that versus um,

1955
01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:03.880
it's perfect punch to that's, that's the thing. Um, and DC talked about it.

1956
01:50:03.881 --> 01:50:07.420
He talked about we saw this being an option in this fight,

1957
01:50:07.421 --> 01:50:11.200
this being an opportunity to get this to, to land this shot this and um,

1958
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:16.060
he did it, you know, that, that's the thing. Um, if Francis, anybody,

1959
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.060
probably anybody with any power, of course a Francis lands at shots,

1960
01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:23.320
nighttime light out also. But, um, he didn't see it or, and he didn't,

1961
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:27.130
he didn't have the skillset to provide that opportunity right there, you know?

1962
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.200
So I think, I think that's,

1963
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:33.070
that that might be more telling this sorts of perfect punch to him. You know,

1964
01:50:33.071 --> 01:50:36.760
he, he gets rid of the arm on the left side, then boom,

1965
01:50:36.761 --> 01:50:39.090
the right hand comes over. You got like that,

1966
01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:43.450
that kind of thing that makes me appreciate like fight IQ of a guy like cornea.

1967
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:48.070
You know what I mean? Because like again and Gatto bigger puncher like,

1968
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:52.720
but like he just doesn't have the skillset that DC has and seeing that, like,

1969
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:54.790
you remember him talking about that in the post fight,

1970
01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:58.390
like that was something they saw and to,

1971
01:50:58.391 --> 01:51:02.170
to know that that's there and find that opportunity to make that opportunity

1972
01:51:02.171 --> 01:51:05.290
happen. You know? That's um, that's high level stuff, man.

1973
01:51:06.370 --> 01:51:10.660
That's what the best guys do. I'm, I heard the DC looks fantastic and camp,

1974
01:51:10.690 --> 01:51:14.920
I heard it look so good, but I'm really interested in to see what are motivated,

1975
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:18.220
hungry, you know, out for revenge. Steeper can do.

1976
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.890
And like he, he knows to take that away. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1977
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:27.010
Um, his DC, he, he kinda got into it.

1978
01:51:27.010 --> 01:51:31.930
He explained exactly what they saw and how they figured to use that against him.

1979
01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:34.840
So like Steve pay is also, like you said,

1980
01:51:34.841 --> 01:51:38.650
he's the most decorated every way champion. He's the most successful. Um,

1981
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.100
that's success didn't come from like, not only his skill set,

1982
01:51:42.101 --> 01:51:46.000
but also his mentality. So he has to go back into the gym, break that down,

1983
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.970
take that out of his game, you know, make that not a, not a thing.

1984
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:52.720
And also now he knows that, that it's, the title's everything.

1985
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:55.450
You lose the title. People don't even talk about you. Yeah.

1986
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:59.190
They stop talking about them. Yeah. You know, I felt a Blige,

1987
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.230
I felt like I had an obligation to talk about Steepbank. I'm like,

1988
01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:04.270
no one's talking about them. Like,

1989
01:52:04.271 --> 01:52:06.910
how are you not talking about the most successful heavyweight champion of all

1990
01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:07.810
time? Yeah.

1991
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:13.030
The guy who I understand him having to have one fight before yet in rematch or

1992
01:52:13.181 --> 01:52:16.690
he could, he could have legitimately just got the rematch because of the,

1993
01:52:16.691 --> 01:52:21.160
of his resume as champion, you know? Um, I don't know. I, I,

1994
01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.540
I don't like that part of fighting where you only as good as your last fight.

1995
01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:28.210
Yeah. No, I don't like it either. I don't, I don't,

1996
01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:33.730
I just feel like I get the business aspect of it. I get that.

1997
01:52:34.150 --> 01:52:38.560
But I feel like we're a fighter like that. You gotta give him a rematch,

1998
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:40.660
have to deserves it.

1999
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:44.950
He's earned it and oh look a legit champion. The Guy,

2000
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.010
he wants a rematch,

2001
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.750
<v 0>set it up. So a quick question where that's concerned, when you say that,</v>

2002
01:52:50.751 --> 01:52:55.610
right. Um, Woodley like of course, like you had GSP, you had Matt Hughes,

2003
01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:00.320
they had long title runs also, but, um, the fight with Kamala,

2004
01:53:00.321 --> 01:53:01.630
Kamala was so dominant in that,

2005
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:04.940
like what does Woodley need to do to get a rematch?

2006
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.240
That's an interesting question cause it's a different thing, right? Yep.

2007
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:11.870
I guess it's a different thing, but is it really, I mean, is it real?

2008
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:15.140
Is it really different to dominate a guard than to hit him with one punch?

2009
01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:17.180
I mean kind of is, but it's also,

2010
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:21.260
you're dealing with a guy who was like a long time champion who dominated the

2011
01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:23.670
division. A guy who, you know,

2012
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:26.270
just blew Darren tills,

2013
01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:30.620
title shot hopes up in the smithereens, you know, that was,

2014
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:31.960
that was the big one. Right?

2015
01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:35.330
Like the Darren till one because that one was confusing to me. I'm like,

2016
01:53:35.331 --> 01:53:38.890
how are the, how is he the betting favorite? I don't understand it. I get it.

2017
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:43.310
He beat cowboy and I guess he dropped Wonderboy, but this is tiring.

2018
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:45.710
Woodley's a guy whose battle tested man,

2019
01:53:45.711 --> 01:53:50.480
he's been in there with everybody that I'd felt that was the one of the weirder

2020
01:53:50.481 --> 01:53:55.481
believing the hype things in terms of like the bookmakers and it worked out well

2021
01:53:56.091 --> 01:53:59.530
for it for Taco or fans that you know, new. Yeah.

2022
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:03.140
But yeah, Dom Kamara was so dominant.

2023
01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:07.150
And then you've got Colby Covington who still has the, the, you know,

2024
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:11.630
claim to the interim. They took it away from them, but he's fighting Robbie.

2025
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:15.740
So that's a fight as a fight.

2026
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:19.220
I'm interested in because like we all used to train together. You know,

2027
01:54:19.221 --> 01:54:22.550
there was when, when, when Robbie was getting ready for Johnny Hendricks,

2028
01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:26.960
remember call me, he's a wrestler and he's a southpaw, you know. Um,

2029
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:29.930
it was years ago and Colby has grown a lot since then,

2030
01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:35.170
but I mean those guys spent a lot of time on the mat together a couple of years

2031
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.870
ago. You know, how do those training sessions go? I can't tell you that. Yes,

2032
01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:42.410
you can if you don't even work for the organization anymore. Yeah. But,

2033
01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:44.840
but like one of them is acquaintances. Like none of those,

2034
01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:47.330
a good friend blink twice if Robbie fucked him up

2035
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:55.250
and stair cap. I like, you know what I like about it?

2036
01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Robbie looked physically fantastic in his last fight and I know he lost to Ben

2037
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.420
her. It was a crazy controversial situation. I don't know, man.

2038
01:55:05.421 --> 01:55:06.710
I went over it with herb dean.

2039
01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.740
We watched the fight again when herb was in here and I kind of believe him.

2040
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:13.190
I kind of go the way his arm just dropped like that. I'm like,

2041
01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:18.110
that seems like he was out. I believe that her, um, spelled, he was out.

2042
01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:21.800
I don't think Robbie was out. I think he was out for a second think so, yeah,

2043
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:26.230
I think he was out for a second. And I think when herb came over then Ben let,

2044
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:28.610
let the show to watch that again in slow motion.

2045
01:55:28.611 --> 01:55:31.730
But like you don't come back from a chill instantly. Well you do.

2046
01:55:31.731 --> 01:55:35.260
If he was letting the choke up while you were fighting. So if,

2047
01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.250
if Herb's coming over and he thinks Robbie's out and he starts to let up and

2048
01:55:39.251 --> 01:55:42.530
then the blood rushed to the brain and then herb stops the fight and he lets it

2049
01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:44.130
go and then he's like, nothing

2050
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.130
<v 1>happened. It depends on how long you've been out.</v>

2051
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:52.050
If you're out for only a second, it depends. Depends on how tight the choke is.

2052
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:55.260
He's the blood kind of getting in there and then not kitten in there.

2053
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.380
I'm gonna leave it alone. Cause now we're getting in a conjecture. I can't,

2054
01:55:59.070 --> 01:56:03.720
yeah, we just point to point now. Yeah, it was disappointing.

2055
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:07.200
But also if he just put him to sleep, that would have been definitive.

2056
01:56:07.201 --> 01:56:09.000
But it was just, it was so confusing.

2057
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.760
We thought he was out and then he wasn't out and we were like, what?

2058
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:16.200
And then we, the most people thought they had to run it back. Most people. Yeah,

2059
01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:18.390
I thought so too. Yeah. I'm surprised they're not,

2060
01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:22.830
but I that I'm down for him in Mazda. Yes.

2061
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:24.570
I liked that fight. Yes.

2062
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.880
I liked that fight a lot because Mazda doll can wrestle Mazda Dog Russell,

2063
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:32.250
and he's super crafty and he's mean as fuck.

2064
01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:36.900
He's a mean man. You know, I'm, I'm not going to lie, man.

2065
01:56:36.901 --> 01:56:39.570
I'm going to tell you of all the people I've trained with,

2066
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:42.270
I think overall when you put the entirety of the,

2067
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:44.790
of mixed martial arts to his together,

2068
01:56:45.650 --> 01:56:50.650
Mazda might be the best real like he like his boxing is some of the best in the

2069
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:54.660
sport of mixed martial arts. He, he's not a kickboxer,

2070
01:56:54.661 --> 01:56:58.740
but he's confident and comfortable with all the kicks. Wrestling.

2071
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.750
His wrestling is way beyond a guy who never wrestled. Like, you know, it's,

2072
01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:06.180
it's like he's like division one level, you know, at the very least.

2073
01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:09.480
And then his Jujitsu people sleep on his Jujitsu man.

2074
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:12.340
Mazda doll is legit on the ground. Um,

2075
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:13.970
the first day I went into American Tahltan,

2076
01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:17.010
we had fought each other before and I figured now this guy's horrible on the

2077
01:57:17.011 --> 01:57:19.740
ground. We just go. But like, I was like, I was surprised.

2078
01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:24.610
And this was like 12 years ago, 10 years ago, you know, and he, and he's, he's,

2079
01:57:24.611 --> 01:57:29.310
he's Day in, day out, he's a worker. Like he's constantly working on his craft.

2080
01:57:29.311 --> 01:57:32.190
He's constantly working to get better. Um, Ben asked great, and you know,

2081
01:57:32.191 --> 01:57:36.140
he's got the ground, he's, you know, he's got the wrestling. Um, but, but miles,

2082
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.870
when I was defense of wrestling is he is asking him to be able to, you know,

2083
01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.720
mall him like he'd just done to everybody else and he's gotta close that

2084
01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:45.840
distance. He's got to close that. I mean, and the, on the feet,

2085
01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:50.940
Mazda dollar has a giant advantage. Just giant footwork, great hands,

2086
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:55.980
but ask, has this crazy way of getting ahold of people. Even Robbie,

2087
01:57:56.130 --> 01:58:00.510
even after Robbie was blasting his brains into another dimension,

2088
01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.660
he still got up and was grabbing Robbie.

2089
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:07.890
It's like he has this ability to grab people and hold on to people.

2090
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:08.700
Like if you watch this,

2091
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:13.700
the Douglas Lema fight or the Korskoff fight and Bellatore like teases Christ.

2092
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:17.610
Like he bragged all his people. It's weird. And he holds, yeah,

2093
01:58:17.611 --> 01:58:20.940
he's hard to get away from it very hard. He got me from,

2094
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:25.950
I remember when I first met Ben, he, um, I watched, he went to this tournament.

2095
01:58:25.951 --> 01:58:29.910
He used to do tournament's and in college just to get more pins so you could

2096
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:32.760
have like the pin record. So he got the pin record for,

2097
01:58:33.110 --> 01:58:36.120
I'm from Missouri for the University of Missouri. Um, he used to,

2098
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:39.000
but he would also, with other high level wrestlers,

2099
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:42.040
he would just like let people take them down. Oh. I let people in on his

2100
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.820
<v 0>legs so that he can get into these scrambles with that funk stuff that he does.</v>

2101
01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:51.220
Yeah. I really, as Dean Thomas, one time, he's wrestling on that same trip.

2102
01:58:51.221 --> 01:58:53.500
He's wrestling with Dean and then he just stops everything. He's like,

2103
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:56.790
do you not a sprawl like, like,

2104
01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.980
like Dean and didn't even know what a sprawl was cause his wrestling is so good.

2105
01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:02.380
He just touch, he was touching us and we were fallen over.

2106
01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:05.710
I mean mom is the wrestling. Is that good?

2107
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.400
Well that makes it even more impressive with Jordan Burroughs to do them.

2108
01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.300
When Jordan Burroughs in him had that wrestling match,

2109
01:59:13.301 --> 01:59:16.570
like there's levels and he said it afterwards, he put it on Instagram.

2110
01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:18.670
There's levels to this and there is,

2111
01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:21.310
cause he just ran him over right through him.

2112
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:26.170
Power doubles and everything crazy. Just when you think about that,

2113
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:31.171
a guy who's the elite of the elite in wrestling is so much better than the elite

2114
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.760
of the elite in wrestling and MMA. Yeah. It is so much better.

2115
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:42.270
But would he have still been able to do that the same way if Ben was only

2116
01:59:42.491 --> 01:59:46.780
wrestling some good questions? It's hard to say because Jordan is so good.

2117
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:48.370
He's so dominant.

2118
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:52.100
It's hard to say if you're talking about what two time Olympic champion. Yeah.

2119
01:59:52.330 --> 01:59:56.920
And he's unbelievably explosive to any work that you've ever seen. His workouts,

2120
01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:00.370
all ply drills, explosive drills,

2121
02:00:00.371 --> 02:00:05.371
and he's just all about closing that distance with just ferocious energy.

2122
02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:10.300
Boom. That dude crosses that distance like is not even there. God Damn,

2123
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:12.940
he's good. Teleports I was hoping he was going to get into MMA,

2124
02:00:12.941 --> 02:00:16.240
but it doesn't seem like he wants to know. I, um, I honestly,

2125
02:00:16.241 --> 02:00:19.240
when he was still in school, so one of my buddies, Lynn oding,

2126
02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:22.150
he was reaching out. This is how I met Tyron. He's reaching out to, to,

2127
02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:26.320
to division one wrestlers for me to help me with my wrestling after the Joe

2128
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.750
Stevenson fight. Cause I was like, I can wrestle. Right.

2129
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:32.440
And I'm Jordan Burroughs was one of the guys that he reached out to and he was

2130
02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:34.990
just not interested in MMA at that point. Even when he was like,

2131
02:00:34.991 --> 02:00:38.890
I'm going to the Olympics, um, I'm gonna Wrestle. He had no interest.

2132
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:42.040
I don't know where that stands now because the sport is bigger,

2133
02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.940
there's more money in it, but he's still having so much success wrestling.

2134
02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:50.230
Right. And who knows how much time, if any, he's putting into striking.

2135
02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.250
Yeah, but like that IQ of his,

2136
02:00:54.251 --> 02:00:58.060
as far as wrestling that that athleticism, you know, he's a hard worker.

2137
02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:02.170
Oh yeah. It will apply if he dedicated himself to it. But if he hasn't at all,

2138
02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:06.850
he's so far behind the eight ball. Like if he jumps in now with zero striking,

2139
02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:08.141
you know,

2140
02:01:08.141 --> 02:01:11.320
like how long would it take before he gets to a comfortable level of striking

2141
02:01:11.321 --> 02:01:13.000
where he can hang in there. You know,

2142
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:16.270
like remember Kamara Kamara when he first started fighting was really just a

2143
02:01:16.271 --> 02:01:17.080
wrestling. Yeah.

2144
02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.440
But then you really saw on the tire and fight when he almost stopped hiring on

2145
02:01:20.441 --> 02:01:24.400
the feet. He's, his striking is legit now. His fight with

2146
02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:27.520
Maria Murrayas. Yeah, surgery on rice.

2147
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:32.910
That was where I started to recognize his strikings improving and you could see

2148
02:01:33.461 --> 02:01:34.870
it if you watch his fights from men,

2149
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:38.410
you can see it each time a fast improvement in his striking.

2150
02:01:38.650 --> 02:01:42.530
But what I like about that is his wrestling didn't really feed.

2151
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.070
His wrestling still stayed sharp and that's, that's where I like, I'm like,

2152
02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:49.300
how do you do that? Because there's only so much hours in a day. Well,

2153
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:53.030
it's also crazy with him. He can't run. His knees are so fucked up.

2154
02:01:53.150 --> 02:01:55.700
I didn't know that he talked to, he doesn't even care to talk.

2155
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:59.180
He doesn't mind talking about it. He's like, Joe, my knees were so fucked up.

2156
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.390
I'd have to walk on the grass because I couldn't walk on the concrete because it

2157
02:02:02.391 --> 02:02:05.990
hurt too much. How do you fight at that level?

2158
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:10.970
I give you can't run. I don't understand. Well, he just does like Airdyne bike,

2159
02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.530
but I mean, how do you even,

2160
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:17.450
how do they even work inside the octagon if you can't run on tough?

2161
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:20.240
Just tough. Unbelievable mental toughness. I mean,

2162
02:02:20.241 --> 02:02:23.570
I think he gets in there and just forces body to do whatever he wanted to do.

2163
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:25.790
Did you ask him if he feels any pain when he's,

2164
02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:30.330
when he fighting's in all the time. Whenever you never see it. Well, you know,

2165
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:33.560
you had a broken foot in that fight. Yeah. That's the kind of,

2166
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:38.830
there's like a mindset that some people have the champion mindset with the,

2167
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:40.670
all that stuff means nothing.

2168
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:45.560
And he had hernias and he had hernia surgery after the fight. I mean,

2169
02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.040
what the fuck man, that's, yeah, that's, that's some different,

2170
02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:51.530
that's some different shit, bro. Says there's levels,

2171
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:53.260
there's levels to the mental game to this.

2172
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:56.720
Like some guys can just push through everything and some guys will find a reason

2173
02:02:56.721 --> 02:02:59.150
why they have to get out. Yeah. You know? Yeah.

2174
02:02:59.151 --> 02:03:03.800
There's that being in that moment and I'm like, now, now means everything.

2175
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.790
There is no tomorrow. You know? It's like, I like to, I, I,

2176
02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:12.140
I try to keep that mentality also in some of the things that I try to do now

2177
02:03:12.141 --> 02:03:15.620
because like, there's like, I'm this kid from The Bahamas, you know,

2178
02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.610
there's no reason that somebody in Japan should know my name,

2179
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:23.000
but because of mixed martial arts, because of my dedication to the sport,

2180
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:27.770
because I wanted to be something in that that happened. So it's like,

2181
02:03:28.050 --> 02:03:32.570
um, you just have to have that mentality of if I'm on a boat out in,

2182
02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:35.700
if I'm in The Bahamas, I'm on a boat and my boat sinks and I'm out in the,

2183
02:03:35.701 --> 02:03:39.740
in the middle, I'm 20 miles from land. Like if I don't get the land,

2184
02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:43.250
it's not because I failed. That means not because I quit. It's because I failed.

2185
02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:47.990
You know, so like that, that mentality. That's how I look at guys like that.

2186
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:49.220
Guys, we just have no quit in them.

2187
02:03:49.221 --> 02:03:51.140
I feel like your rye is like favors like that.

2188
02:03:51.141 --> 02:03:53.420
You know the Mike Brown for perfect example,

2189
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:57.800
he broke both his hands and was still throwing elbows, kicks,

2190
02:03:57.830 --> 02:04:01.160
trying to take him down, doing everything he could to broken hands.

2191
02:04:01.161 --> 02:04:05.210
Tony Ferguson, Tony Ferguson's a nano, an animal like that.

2192
02:04:05.211 --> 02:04:09.500
He's the scariest guy. One 55. Martin my word, I agree in my world,

2193
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:12.650
cause you don't get tired. The cowboy fight freak me out.

2194
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:17.420
He cowboy looked like Tony had bricks in his gloves. Yeah,

2195
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:20.660
his face was all busted up. Tony didn't look like he had a scratch on him.

2196
02:04:20.661 --> 02:04:22.940
And Tony wasn't even tired. Tony posted a meme,

2197
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:25.120
I feel like a couple of days ago he showed like his last seven,

2198
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:30.080
they're all fucked up, but they all fell off a train and yeah, it's crazy man.

2199
02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:34.070
He has insane power man. It's like,

2200
02:04:34.071 --> 02:04:39.071
it's a weird thing cause Tony does stuff to and does,

2201
02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:40.410
he doesn't get tired.

2202
02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:45.450
<v 4>He doesn't get to eat. Like he's legit. Crazy. Yes. Like he does it.</v>

2203
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.680
Like,

2204
02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:50.430
I don't know if he feels pain that kind of crazy [inaudible] you know what I

2205
02:04:50.431 --> 02:04:53.790
mean? Like he will do things in there that I remember when we fought,

2206
02:04:53.791 --> 02:04:55.380
I'm South Pole, he's Orthodox, right?

2207
02:04:55.590 --> 02:05:00.590
He throws that inside kick and I'm turning my leg over to check it and I'm like,

2208
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:04.200
it was never at my knee. He was throwing that at my shin.

2209
02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:08.880
Like if you're throwing that calf kick with that open stance,

2210
02:05:08.881 --> 02:05:10.920
you're throwing it out the shin. Right. You know what I mean?

2211
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:14.520
So like I checked it and um, I was like, I was about to check.

2212
02:05:14.521 --> 02:05:17.910
And then we bank Shin Duchen like the middle of the shins in the middle of his

2213
02:05:17.911 --> 02:05:21.740
shin. And I remember thinking myself, why the fuck would you do that?

2214
02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:26.230
Now we're both hurting. Like I seriously hated that feeling, but he did.

2215
02:05:26.231 --> 02:05:28.620
Like there was no reaction on his face. There was nothing.

2216
02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:31.170
He was just like still on just onto the next thing.

2217
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.320
And I feel like I'm glad I fought it men, cause I look at him now,

2218
02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:35.490
he's like psychotic.

2219
02:05:35.850 --> 02:05:39.690
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Look at the 21st, his last seven opponents,</v>

2220
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:45.180
Jesus Christ, he's got all bloody methods. Even like his,

2221
02:05:45.210 --> 02:05:49.560
the what? The things he posts. Like you get an insight to how crazy his mind is.

2222
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.940
Like, did you see his posts, his press conference after, um,

2223
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:58.890
after um, Sergio, uh, after Anthony Pettis? No. Yeah, he was talking,

2224
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.140
he's talking about how was going to be a doctor. He said, we,

2225
02:06:01.141 --> 02:06:04.860
I think he said something like, he said, what did he say? He said, um, he said,

2226
02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.190
<v 4>um, oh you say you know what they call me cause he, I, he's like, yeah, he's,</v>

2227
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:12.390
he's GQ guy. He's talking about Anthony. He's, I use a GQ Guy,

2228
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.790
but you know what they call me. They call me the GQ killer.

2229
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:17.400
You know what that is so awesome nickname.

2230
02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:20.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2231
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.883
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2232
02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:28.580
<v 0>I would like to see what his conditioning workout is cause Eddie goes with him</v>

2233
02:06:28.581 --> 02:06:32.170
up to big bear, you know any, he trains with him and he says, yeah,

2234
02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:34.040
Sam never seen anything like it. He said,

2235
02:06:34.041 --> 02:06:37.280
everybody else in the camp can't keep up with them. Who works out. He goes,

2236
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:40.020
I've never seen anybody have this kind of dedication and gas tank.

2237
02:06:40.050 --> 02:06:44.480
He said he works out a legitimate six hours a day. He says he's running hills,

2238
02:06:44.481 --> 02:06:47.690
they do these hill sprints and he said he laps everybody.

2239
02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:51.440
He goes all the way to the top before they do goes down and then beats them on

2240
02:06:51.441 --> 02:06:55.820
the way up. Said it just doesn't get tired. Yeah, I don't understand.

2241
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:57.380
What is someone doing when their,

2242
02:06:57.710 --> 02:07:01.400
their cardio is so much better than everybody else's cause the cowboy fight.

2243
02:07:01.401 --> 02:07:04.040
I'm telling you man, I watched him from the moment they,

2244
02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.560
they stopped the fight after the second round.

2245
02:07:06.710 --> 02:07:11.180
I'm watching him and he goes back to his corner. Cowboys face is a mess.

2246
02:07:11.630 --> 02:07:14.330
He's just beating the shit out of cowboy. He goes back to his corner.

2247
02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:18.470
His stomach isn't even heaving. Yeah, he's not breathing heavy.

2248
02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:23.000
I'm not gonna lie to you as I don't want to see this fight cause I like both

2249
02:07:23.001 --> 02:07:25.550
those guys. But as a fight fan,

2250
02:07:25.610 --> 02:07:27.710
I wanna see this fight and that is him and Dustin.

2251
02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:30.080
Oh Him and Dustin would be insane cause like that.

2252
02:07:30.110 --> 02:07:33.500
Those are two guys who don't know how to quit. Well if Dustin beats could be,

2253
02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:36.070
that's the fight. And if Dustin doesn't be, could

2254
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.970
<v 1>be Tony and could be EBS. The fight. Yeah, they'll fight eventually, I'm sure.</v>

2255
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:44.700
Yeah. I mean that, that is a crazy ass fine.

2256
02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:48.670
But the thing is like Tony's pace is so disturbing.

2257
02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:51.790
It's so disturbing because I watched him fight guys and I'm like,

2258
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:54.730
how do you keep up with that? Like nobody keeps up with it.

2259
02:07:54.970 --> 02:07:57.910
Like you've got to crack him. You got to catch on. Like Anthony caught him,

2260
02:07:58.270 --> 02:08:02.680
but he broke his hand. But pet has had him hurt and he and Lando had them hurt.

2261
02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:07.030
Lando Vanatta cracked. I've had him hurt. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2262
02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.550
Bled like knows how to survive though. Yeah, exactly.

2263
02:08:09.551 --> 02:08:13.780
And also it's weird because he doesn't survive like most people do.

2264
02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:17.470
He doesn't tie you up and try to get shy. We collect as itself.

2265
02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:21.880
Like he's just still fights. Yeah. And he like, he instead like scramble.

2266
02:08:21.881 --> 02:08:25.780
You heard him, he puts it on you. He's like, okay, I need a break.

2267
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:30.520
Meaning I'm coming after you now you're going to have to stop me from killing

2268
02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:34.510
you so then I can take a break. Yeah. I've just,

2269
02:08:34.511 --> 02:08:38.170
I'm always stunned at his, his pace and his cardio. It's amazing. I really look,

2270
02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:42.460
I just want to know is this scientifically planned?

2271
02:08:42.461 --> 02:08:46.090
Like are they monitoring his heart rate or is this just psychotic?

2272
02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.970
I guess it's scientific or is it psychotic? I think it's the latter.

2273
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:54.250
I think it might be. I like Tony Ferguson. If,

2274
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:59.530
if this was a scary movie, Tony Ferguson would be that guy. He's El Kukui. Yeah.

2275
02:08:59.590 --> 02:09:02.900
He's the Boogie man they need. They need the, they need to make a movie out.

2276
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.760
Like somebody needs to do some kind of like, I dunno,

2277
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:10.600
Mashup of his fights that make him seem like, like the Jason,

2278
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:12.490
the guy that just never goes away.

2279
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:14.470
And as soon as you turn around and he's ready to kill you,

2280
02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:19.660
will you just think about Luke Thomas posted some tweet where the last time Tony

2281
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:22.450
Ferguson one like who was champion and what was going on in the world.

2282
02:09:22.610 --> 02:09:27.580
It's like 2013 was the last time he lost and he lost to Michael Johnson. Yeah.

2283
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:31.870
Also beat Dustin. Yeah. Yeah. That was Dustin's last loss as well.

2284
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.870
That much more recent though. Yeah, much more recent. I was,

2285
02:09:35.010 --> 02:09:37.720
that was here in la. Was it the form? What's up? Yeah. Um,

2286
02:09:38.050 --> 02:09:41.650
but that fight also where Dustin's concerned now, like you,

2287
02:09:41.651 --> 02:09:42.670
we propped up Tony's,

2288
02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:45.490
I gotta get Dustin some props because like that's the thing about,

2289
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:48.880
about mixed martial arts. First of all, there's not a lot of guys who,

2290
02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:52.240
who have some success success and then they get stopped.

2291
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:55.480
Then success is success. And then they get stuck and success is success.

2292
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:59.950
Then they get stopped. And then since that like, but every time he got stopped,

2293
02:09:59.951 --> 02:10:04.600
every time he lost, he, he made adjustments, made improvements and got better.

2294
02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:07.660
Sure. And that was, that was the last one.

2295
02:10:07.661 --> 02:10:11.500
And then he had the debacle with Eddie with a disqualification. And, um,

2296
02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.540
the, the knock on him going into that was, you know, when he hurts somebody,

2297
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:19.740
he doesn't necessarily not finish. He gets too aggressive. You know, Eagle,

2298
02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.670
he goes crazy. Um, that fight. Then he gets it,

2299
02:10:23.671 --> 02:10:27.760
he gets gate where it's like if you hurt him and you go crazy,

2300
02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:29.560
you're putting yourself at risk.

2301
02:10:29.710 --> 02:10:33.590
So that was the perfect fight to demonstrate that he learned the lesson and he

2302
02:10:33.591 --> 02:10:34.040
did.

2303
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.850
<v 4>Yeah. You know, so like I don't know where,</v>

2304
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.860
I don't know really what the knock on him is.

2305
02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:42.410
Now I remember this is something that, um, I,

2306
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:45.770
I didn't want to say this to him cause he doesn't watch a lot of, um,

2307
02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:49.040
his opponents and their, their, their press stuff.

2308
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:54.340
But I remember a long time ago DC had ted could be on the Fox desk and he's

2309
02:10:54.861 --> 02:10:56.840
talking to him, he's asking about opponents. He's like,

2310
02:10:57.170 --> 02:11:00.080
what do you think of this guy? What do you think of this guy? And he said,

2311
02:11:00.081 --> 02:11:03.710
just give me one word answers. And he said, Dustin, poor ea. And he goes,

2312
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:08.810
easy fight. Whoa. And um, I like, I'm like,

2313
02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:12.690
yeah, I don't, I go on to see this fight now. You know,

2314
02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:15.000
<v 0>a few things. Then after the hallway fight though,</v>

2315
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:18.090
that was an eye opener for a lot of folks. Yeah.

2316
02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:22.980
But Holloway fought Dustin the way Holloway would,

2317
02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:26.310
the way Dustin would look the best he stood in front of him.

2318
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:29.820
Holloway doesn't have the same knockout power that Dustin has.

2319
02:11:29.821 --> 02:11:33.670
Dustin has like real legit one punch power. Max Beats you up. Yeah,

2320
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:36.510
he just beats it, puts a pace on you, beat your ass and takes you,

2321
02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:38.190
takes you out. But also,

2322
02:11:38.191 --> 02:11:43.191
I don't think Max has the same kind of power at one 55 he just,

2323
02:11:43.890 --> 02:11:48.450
at one 45 he's just so much bigger than everybody. And one 55 he's their size.

2324
02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:51.540
And Dustin's a big 55 or, yeah,

2325
02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:54.130
<v 4>I, Dustin is a big 55 I do,</v>

2326
02:11:54.131 --> 02:11:58.450
I can't say I agree about the power only because does, yeah,

2327
02:11:58.451 --> 02:12:01.330
Dustin's been knocked out but he does have a chin. You know he can take it.

2328
02:12:01.770 --> 02:12:05.230
<v 0>No, but I'm, and I'm not saying he doesn't know. I know you're not know.</v>

2329
02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.260
This has never knocked anybody out with one shot.

2330
02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:11.460
He beats guys up and takes them apart. Yeah, no, you're right. You're right.

2331
02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:13.650
Dustin's capable of flatline in yeah. Yeah.

2332
02:12:14.070 --> 02:12:16.650
He can flatline people with one shot. Yeah.

2333
02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.790
You don't really see that that much with Max Max. It's t he just,

2334
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:22.890
he sharp is super sharp,

2335
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:27.510
super high fight IQ and just makes you fight wars with him.

2336
02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:30.660
But he was fighting a war with a guy who had higher caliber weapons.

2337
02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:34.530
That's what it seemed like in that fight. And Dustin just fought real smart,

2338
02:12:34.890 --> 02:12:39.890
great boxing and capitalize on these openings and really stung Matt and w Max in

2339
02:12:39.931 --> 02:12:43.200
a way that we haven't seen before. And good footwork too. If you remember,

2340
02:12:43.201 --> 02:12:47.370
Max was, Max was using his full work early in that fight.

2341
02:12:47.730 --> 02:12:51.040
But everywhere he went, Dustin was there too, you know? Yeah,

2342
02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:54.150
<v 4>it's, there are some times it's not loudly.</v>

2343
02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:58.230
Maybe not even a conscious decision where it's like, well it doesn't matter.

2344
02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.440
Like wherever I go, he's going to be there anyway,

2345
02:13:00.441 --> 02:13:02.560
so then this is what we're doing. Right. You know,

2346
02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:06.690
I'm not just going to keep running around now. You know? So he might've,

2347
02:13:06.691 --> 02:13:11.250
he might've made Max decide to stay in front of him like he did towards this was

2348
02:13:11.251 --> 02:13:12.084
the second and third. Yeah.

2349
02:13:12.710 --> 02:13:16.990
<v 0>The differences with Khabib obviously is the grappling. Yeah, that's true.</v>

2350
02:13:17.290 --> 02:13:21.170
Could be bread and butter. He's so fucking terrifying. The good,

2351
02:13:21.590 --> 02:13:24.260
when he clenches you, it's like you see these guys,

2352
02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:28.670
they have this look on their face like what is this? This is a new experience.

2353
02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:32.060
This is a different kind of grappling and IOM mobilizes people. Yeah.

2354
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.080
<v 1>Like he gets you in positions that like you are literally, you can't go laugh.</v>

2355
02:13:37.081 --> 02:13:38.520
You can't go right. You know,

2356
02:13:38.521 --> 02:13:43.140
he's got that wrist wrap on the backside and a half guard on the front side so

2357
02:13:43.141 --> 02:13:46.710
you can't turn turn to your right. But you also can't turn to your left.

2358
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:51.290
It's like, and he, he straps you down man. Like,

2359
02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:56.100
how do you like, that's what I hope Dustin works on right now.

2360
02:13:56.101 --> 02:13:57.600
Like just sealing off,

2361
02:13:57.601 --> 02:13:59.910
not allowing him to be able to get those under hooks on the ground,

2362
02:13:59.911 --> 02:14:03.090
not allowing, could be able to get around his body and just,

2363
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.980
just get back through his feet if he gets taken down. And I mean you,

2364
02:14:07.981 --> 02:14:12.690
we saw some of that. We know that could be, he was not the greatest Stryker,

2365
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:17.460
you know, um, we saw, um, I like winter, do some,

2366
02:14:17.461 --> 02:14:20.780
do some damage on the feet in I think in third or fourth round of that flight

2367
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:25.380
definitely showed where it could be. If he has any vulnerability,

2368
02:14:25.381 --> 02:14:28.230
it's going to be in the striking. But he didn't really hurt him.

2369
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:30.990
Never heard him once. And the only person that Ding them is Michael.

2370
02:14:30.991 --> 02:14:32.940
Michael Johnson dinged him once. Yeah.

2371
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:35.970
But he recovered from that quickly and beat the shit out of Michael.

2372
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.990
I also in the ground,

2373
02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:41.460
I also think Dustin is more of a predator.

2374
02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:45.900
Like he's like, I think I like went is good on his feet. He's, he's,

2375
02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.060
he's boxing solid. He hits hard.

2376
02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.740
But I think just Dustin's boxing IQ, like if he hurts you,

2377
02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.230
especially now, I think if he hurts you,

2378
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:59.580
he smarter about being able to finish on what the power that he carries. He, he,

2379
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.340
he's more selective with his weapons, you know, so like that.

2380
02:15:04.341 --> 02:15:06.480
That's definitely a big option. If he,

2381
02:15:06.481 --> 02:15:10.950
if he can show that he can hurt it can be standing then he ha he has a very good

2382
02:15:10.951 --> 02:15:15.270
shot of stopping him there. But what does that mean to stop? Could be like,

2383
02:15:15.271 --> 02:15:19.800
you know what I mean? Like is it possible? I think,

2384
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:23.250
but you know what I think you have to cause like how do you beat that wrestling

2385
02:15:23.251 --> 02:15:24.270
over 25 minutes.

2386
02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.390
How do you keep them from taking you down over and over and over again?

2387
02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:29.730
Just getting back ups not good enough. Yeah.

2388
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:32.190
Cause it's going to keep taking you down. That's a real good point.

2389
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:35.100
Cause he's been able to do that to every single person who's far inside the

2390
02:15:35.101 --> 02:15:39.690
octagon. I mean, even when Connor stopped a little bit of it early on,

2391
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:43.110
I mean it's just, it was a matter of time and that's, that's,

2392
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:45.600
that's that whole Gregor thing, man. I want like,

2393
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:48.330
I hope Greg is watching this and he's like, man, I should do that.

2394
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.250
I should do that. Cause Eve Eve's calling me out is eve in, um, I mean, um,

2395
02:15:53.490 --> 02:15:56.130
it's dusted rather in Florida. Yeah. He just, he just,

2396
02:15:56.131 --> 02:16:01.020
so I was in Texas last week. I went up to, I drove down to, um, to New Orleans,

2397
02:16:01.050 --> 02:16:05.370
New Orleans to Lafayette Youngsville to, um, to talk to him, to,

2398
02:16:05.371 --> 02:16:10.290
to record that podcast. We trained some, um, he made me his, I am,

2399
02:16:10.291 --> 02:16:13.170
I'm like, I'm like two hours. I'm like an hour away. And he's like, all right,

2400
02:16:13.171 --> 02:16:17.790
you're running practice. And I'm like, I'm fat. I don't know what to do.

2401
02:16:18.210 --> 02:16:22.380
I haven't trained like weeks. But, um, he came in and he did that and then, um,

2402
02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:26.280
and then he was, he was leaving for Florida that Friday.

2403
02:16:26.281 --> 02:16:29.530
So He's been there for about a week now, almost a week now. And the fight is,

2404
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:30.250
what's the date

2405
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:34.390
<v 3>of the fight? The fight is September 7th Abu Dhabi Tonto.</v>

2406
02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:39.850
You're not going to that note. So if, if you do,

2407
02:16:39.851 --> 02:16:41.860
if you do a fight companion,

2408
02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:47.020
I love to come in for that because if I could [inaudible] because it does cause

2409
02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:51.190
just as my boy, man, I want to find out if I'm even in town,

2410
02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:54.820
I might be on the road. You're going to be an AC very soon, huh?

2411
02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.210
I was just there. Oh, okay. That's what it was there this past weekend. Okay.

2412
02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:04.080
Oh yeah, no, I'm home. If I, if I'm still home. Um,

2413
02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:07.180
as of right now, I'm home, but if I'm still home, we have a fight companion.

2414
02:17:07.450 --> 02:17:10.690
You're in Fella. All right. That'll be fun. I'm down to be there.

2415
02:17:10.691 --> 02:17:13.600
Especially if I don't go to Obadiah. I would love to be there for that.

2416
02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:16.990
But that's how Abu Dhabi, there'll be interesting to, you know him so well,

2417
02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.050
you know, to get your insight on that. He's the only,

2418
02:17:20.051 --> 02:17:23.820
he's the only guy rapping thug Jitsu right now. That's right. I love,

2419
02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:25.480
I love when like, he's like,

2420
02:17:25.481 --> 02:17:28.180
I'm telling Bruce to make bog me down as a tuck Jitsu fighter.

2421
02:17:28.620 --> 02:17:33.400
Like he came up under Tim Krader who's, that's right. You know crazy Tim crazy.

2422
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:33.860
Tim Man.

2423
02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:37.420
I remember Tim from the John Jock Machado days like way back in the day.

2424
02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:40.720
All right. I saw it first saw crazy Tim. I never got to train with him,

2425
02:17:40.721 --> 02:17:45.721
but he came down in like 98 somewhere around there.

2426
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:52.510
Yeah, 98 ish. He started when Tim started trading with me, I was coaching him.

2427
02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:53.920
We went to some fights in Boston.

2428
02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:57.130
I'm sitting next to the commission and Tim's fighting this guy and he wants,

2429
02:17:57.131 --> 02:18:00.100
he's working on a standard with me and they're trading and the guy takes him

2430
02:18:00.101 --> 02:18:02.680
down and when the guy takes him down,

2431
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:05.950
I looked at the commissioner and I grabbed like all this stuff and I'm like,

2432
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:08.560
well that's the end of that. I started putting everything in the bucket

2433
02:18:10.310 --> 02:18:13.210
and then the commitment, like, I don't know, before I even got my head up,

2434
02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.060
like Tim tapped him and the, the commissioner was like,

2435
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:20.990
you call that one didn't you? There's some shit that you just know, right.

2436
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:24.310
Especially at a certain level of fights. There's some shit that you just know.

2437
02:18:24.730 --> 02:18:25.360
Yeah, that's what I'm,

2438
02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:29.140
one of the more interesting things about high level fights and high level

2439
02:18:29.141 --> 02:18:33.040
fighters is you don't know anymore. No. It's so like,

2440
02:18:33.370 --> 02:18:35.020
because now everybody,

2441
02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:39.280
everybody knows the same thing unless you have that checkmate card.

2442
02:18:39.281 --> 02:18:42.710
Like Francis, like no disrespected junior.

2443
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:46.000
But I did not think that that fight was gonna get out of the first round.

2444
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:50.050
I had a feeling it was going to go that way and that's what I said to all my

2445
02:18:50.051 --> 02:18:52.480
friends. I said if I had to bet my money, anything could happen.

2446
02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.450
It's crazy sport. But if I had to bet my money,

2447
02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:00.340
I bet the house on the big fella. Yeah. Cause he just does shit to people.

2448
02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.530
Yeah. No. Like I said with that guy, man, those, those only takes one guys.

2449
02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:08.050
They're, they're scary. Like, um,

2450
02:19:08.110 --> 02:19:13.110
and junior style wasn't necessarily in style too to avoid encounter that,

2451
02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:16.900
you know what I mean? Like that, that for me,

2452
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:20.260
like the Jeremy Stevens fight was like that. Jeremy Stevens is those one.

2453
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:24.160
He's that, that, that one punch kind of thing. And you'd just have to,

2454
02:19:24.250 --> 02:19:27.470
you have to make sure that they miss and just pick your shots. And me,

2455
02:19:27.471 --> 02:19:28.160
it was fortunate

2456
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.330
<v 1>that like I had him, I caught him running into something too. Right. I'm not,</v>

2457
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:35.930
I do have one punch Powell, but I don't pack power like Dustin does, you know?

2458
02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:41.120
Um, I'm, I would say my power is more if we're talking about the best today.

2459
02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:44.690
Yeah. More about precision, more closer to like Max's in the sense of like,

2460
02:19:44.691 --> 02:19:46.490
I w I would pick you apart,

2461
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:50.900
but like all the knockouts they came from like volume or catching you slipping

2462
02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:55.460
and catching you coming in or something like that, you know? And um, but like,

2463
02:19:55.800 --> 02:19:58.970
so I don't know who's at heavyweight who fights like that. No, bunny.

2464
02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:01.990
<v 0>You'd have to get a Rico Verhoeven.</v>

2465
02:20:02.650 --> 02:20:07.650
You'd have to get someone who's like a worldclass Stryker who Rico's had some

2466
02:20:07.721 --> 02:20:09.160
MMA fights and he's, you know,

2467
02:20:09.161 --> 02:20:13.360
he's still the glory heavyweight champion and he's also a big giant dude.

2468
02:20:13.690 --> 02:20:17.620
But then again, man, he's been fighting with those big gloves and you know,

2469
02:20:17.621 --> 02:20:20.440
he's been stopped before. Could he handle it? I mean,

2470
02:20:20.441 --> 02:20:23.620
if he stands in front of Francis, could he handle it? Yeah.

2471
02:20:23.621 --> 02:20:25.660
I don't think any human handles it. Yeah.

2472
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:28.930
That you gotta get a guy like Steve Pei that just knows how to get the fuck

2473
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:30.023
outta there.

2474
02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:33.390
<v 1>I think. I think Francis could knock on an elephant.</v>

2475
02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:41.060
<v 0>He probably could. I'm serious. At least the baby elephant. Yeah,</v>

2476
02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:45.960
a little elephant that's fucked up though. Hit even thinking about that as fuck.

2477
02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:49.350
Yeah, I don't think there's anybody he can't knock out,

2478
02:20:49.351 --> 02:20:51.960
which is really interesting. If he decided to go to boxing,

2479
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:56.940
he's one of those guys where you go. If he really decided to go to boxing,

2480
02:20:57.210 --> 02:21:00.840
who hits harder? Hammer Bono. Deontay hit

2481
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:06.750
[inaudible] Deontay hits. So God damn hard.

2482
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:11.620
It's hard to tell because he's Deontay has fought the cream of the crop in

2483
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.730
boxing and he's knocked out 39 dudes.

2484
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:20.060
He's 40 and what is he like 40 and one 40 and 39 knock.

2485
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:25.470
Well, how's he 40 you know, he's the Tyson period. Five was a draw.

2486
02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:29.580
Oh, 40 oh 40 oh and one. Yeah. And 39 knockouts.

2487
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:31.020
Stubborn was the only one.

2488
02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.980
The first fight where it went the distance and then he nuked them in the second

2489
02:21:34.981 --> 02:21:39.090
fight. Yeah. The first time they fought went to a d I believe that's the case.

2490
02:21:39.091 --> 02:21:41.700
Is that who did, who was he? Who did he have a decision with?

2491
02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:48.850
Does it say there? You can look in his Wikipedia. That's um,

2492
02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.480
he hits harder than anybody I've ever seen in the heavyweight division in this

2493
02:21:52.481 --> 02:21:55.930
modern era outside of Tyson. I feel like I should call him CTE.

2494
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:58.510
[inaudible] for real.

2495
02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:02.740
You remember they did that study on the NFL bodies and they did like 111 bodies

2496
02:22:02.741 --> 02:22:07.240
and 110 of them and CTE. Yeah. 39 out of 40. Yeah.

2497
02:22:07.241 --> 02:22:09.360
He's giving people some real problems. Still

2498
02:22:11.170 --> 02:22:13.240
remains the Vern first fight against him.

2499
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:14.830
Stubborn was the only one that went to distance.

2500
02:22:14.831 --> 02:22:19.630
Everybody else gets nuked and he hits guys. They just go flying, you know,

2501
02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:23.920
like the fact that Tyson fury got up after the 12th round, like Jesus Christ.

2502
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:27.570
Yeah. That, that, that was crazy. Yeah.

2503
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:31.230
I was like Gypsy kinks of crazy like, yeah, Buddha, look,

2504
02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:35.300
he had like a extra chicken bone in his fucking shorts because you see like,

2505
02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:36.513
like I don't know,

2506
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:37.291
<v 4>me I watch, I,</v>

2507
02:22:37.291 --> 02:22:40.030
I notice those things like when we were watching that they would sage and an n

2508
02:22:40.031 --> 02:22:45.010
and cosmo right when sage went down. Um, and then after cosmo hit him,

2509
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:48.820
like his body like didn't give up. Like they get shut off on him,

2510
02:22:48.821 --> 02:22:52.420
but like he was trying to get up. Yeah. Like he was getting up to fight back.

2511
02:22:52.421 --> 02:22:55.940
Right. Yeah. Cause if you're, if you're not getting up the fight back,

2512
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:58.740
you're covering up. Right. Right. But he's trying to get up. Um,

2513
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:02.550
same thing where we're Tyson fury goes down the referees in his face and he's

2514
02:23:02.551 --> 02:23:04.680
counting the mountain. You see his head, you see his head go

2515
02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:10.490
<v 0>right. And he just gets up just like, fuck it was over. I thought it was over.</v>

2516
02:23:10.491 --> 02:23:15.350
I did too. I was watching it at home. I was celebrating. Yeah. I was like,

2517
02:23:15.351 --> 02:23:19.370
I want a mix of money. I was watching it at home and my thought was, God damn,

2518
02:23:19.371 --> 02:23:20.930
he knocked him out in the 12th round.

2519
02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:26.140
How the fuck does that guy carry that power like that the 12th and that Tyson's

2520
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:29.390
backup and then he wins the rest of the round. That was was even crazy.

2521
02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:31.790
Deontay bombs on them.

2522
02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:35.810
He hits him with some hard shots and then Tyson comes back and dings him and you

2523
02:23:35.811 --> 02:23:38.330
see he catches him. Yeah, he did. He wobbled him first. Yeah.

2524
02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:41.150
And like this is unbelievable. What a fight that, that,

2525
02:23:41.210 --> 02:23:43.730
that was probably the best heavyweight boxing fight I've seen.

2526
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:46.340
I can't remember this. Tyson furious. Let's put it this way.

2527
02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:48.110
He hits four times harder than Vitali.

2528
02:23:48.111 --> 02:23:51.200
Klitschko he hits five times harder than Vladimir Klitschko.

2529
02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:53.660
He hits six times harder than Anthony Joshua.

2530
02:23:53.810 --> 02:23:57.260
And he hits eight times harder than Tyson fury. Well, who said that?

2531
02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:02.150
Richard Towers. Oh, okay. He's a sparring partner for him. Oh,

2532
02:24:02.151 --> 02:24:05.620
I thought it was Tyson furious coat. Yeah. Hmm.

2533
02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:10.690
Well that's probably accurate. It says it's Deontay wilder,

2534
02:24:10.691 --> 02:24:12.740
a stronger punch that a prime George Foreman.

2535
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:17.510
The thing about Deontae is he knocks everyone out.

2536
02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:21.050
[inaudible] is not winning any decisions except one.

2537
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:25.940
I mean there's nobody like that. You even go back to Tyson Tyson when he fought.

2538
02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:30.650
I mean he fought a lot of dudes that went to a decision and he beat their asses,

2539
02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:33.410
but they went to decision. I honestly,

2540
02:24:33.411 --> 02:24:38.411
I wouldn't mind Tyson getting into his camp and just even just kind of mentoring

2541
02:24:39.201 --> 02:24:42.530
him a bit like Mike Tyson. Um,

2542
02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:46.980
<v 4>I feel like somebody like that would really help a guy like deal.</v>

2543
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.150
I mean he's not like he needs a lot of help. Right.

2544
02:24:49.420 --> 02:24:53.350
But like somebody like Mike Tyson being, being, being around,

2545
02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:56.490
just having him to like call on, talk to,

2546
02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:59.890
sometimes Tyson doesn't really want to have anything to do with boxing anymore

2547
02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:02.710
though it seems. And maybe, maybe not even in the gym.

2548
02:25:02.711 --> 02:25:06.040
Maybe just somebody to talk to once in awhile, just for maybe some strategy,

2549
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:10.810
maybe even about strategy sometimes. You know, cause I feel, I don't know the,

2550
02:25:10.811 --> 02:25:12.430
I forget exactly what it was,

2551
02:25:12.431 --> 02:25:15.310
but there was a moment when I was watching Deontay wilder and then there was

2552
02:25:15.311 --> 02:25:16.870
something, I think when Mike was in here,

2553
02:25:16.871 --> 02:25:20.050
something he was talking about that up, I was just like,

2554
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:26.050
<v 0>man, those two should get connected. [inaudible] interesting. I was,</v>

2555
02:25:26.051 --> 02:25:29.020
I was a long time ago and I was living in Texas.

2556
02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:33.190
Well I got a phone call at like 2:00 AM and my one's mind minding my buddies,

2557
02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:36.310
my buddy Lynn Odie. And I was like, um, I don't want to,

2558
02:25:36.311 --> 02:25:38.980
I don't want to answer that man. I'm trying to sleeping on the bed and my wife,

2559
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:42.610
I'm sleeping on these calls and then the next morning I listen to my voicemail

2560
02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.450
and he's like, hey, if he, if he, you get this, call me back. I'm like,

2561
02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:48.640
he was at a club and he's like,

2562
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:52.320
somebody who wants to talk to you and he has a phone. He's like, even with,

2563
02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:53.733
even with

2564
02:25:56.340 --> 02:26:00.280
[inaudible] cause I'm so busy, God, man,

2565
02:26:00.281 --> 02:26:04.160
I missed a phone call from Mike Tyson. He ran into him in a club or something.

2566
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:07.570
I was like, Mike Tyson knows my name dude. I met him at the,

2567
02:26:07.571 --> 02:26:10.480
at the UFC and he's like, Yo, that we got

2568
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:17.530
[inaudible]. I mean, he was in the weed back then, but it was like,

2569
02:26:17.531 --> 02:26:20.320
that's what he said goes. He goes, I like you, man. You're funny. I'm like,

2570
02:26:20.321 --> 02:26:21.780
thank you. So glad you like

2571
02:26:24.810 --> 02:26:27.640
having them in here was so surreal because when I was a kid,

2572
02:26:27.850 --> 02:26:32.100
he was the fucking man. I mean, he was the, you would go to pee,

2573
02:26:32.130 --> 02:26:34.870
you'd pay to see his fights, just to watch him fuck somebody up.

2574
02:26:34.871 --> 02:26:38.860
It wasn't a fight. It was an execution. You would watch him execute guys.

2575
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:42.130
He was the man. He was mad. He changed every way.

2576
02:26:42.131 --> 02:26:45.550
Boxing people don't realize that heavyweight boxing in the early eighties was

2577
02:26:45.551 --> 02:26:50.440
dead. Nobody cared because Larry Holmes, after he beat Muhammad Ali,

2578
02:26:50.470 --> 02:26:52.840
everybody was sad. It was like a sad thing.

2579
02:26:52.841 --> 02:26:54.250
Like those are changing in the guard.

2580
02:26:54.251 --> 02:26:58.510
Larry Holmes beat the shit out of Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes never got his

2581
02:26:58.511 --> 02:27:03.250
due. He never got his dude. He was so good, man. Larry was so good.

2582
02:27:03.251 --> 02:27:07.090
He had one of the best jobs of all time. He was so good,

2583
02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.290
but people were still upset at him because he fucked up Muhammad Ali. He came,

2584
02:27:11.370 --> 02:27:14.740
he was the champ after the greatest, you know,

2585
02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:18.130
and not mama only wasn't just the greatest as to,

2586
02:27:18.131 --> 02:27:20.680
in terms of like the greatest fighter.

2587
02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:26.020
He was a cultural icon. He meant something to people. It was something,

2588
02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:26.801
I mean,

2589
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:30.910
everyone knew the guy was out for three years because he protested the Vietnam

2590
02:27:30.911 --> 02:27:32.980
War. Everybody fucking hated the Vietnam War.

2591
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:37.600
Especially people who went to Vietnam, hated the Vietnam War, and they,

2592
02:27:37.601 --> 02:27:42.550
you know, they, they got it man. And he just, he meant a lot. He meant a lot.

2593
02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:46.270
So when Larry Holmes came around, it's like, man, Larry just never got his, do.

2594
02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.190
Never got his do that arm, that era of boxing.

2595
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:54.370
I remember going back watching tape and, and doing that.

2596
02:27:54.371 --> 02:27:57.520
And that's the one thing I appreciate about Tyson. You know, like he,

2597
02:27:57.521 --> 02:27:59.330
he was a student. Yes,

2598
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:04.060
thank God he knew Jim Jacobs who have that crazy library that he could get all

2599
02:28:04.061 --> 02:28:04.894
that. You know,

2600
02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:10.350
John Jacobs was the guy who curated like he has every old time fight all of

2601
02:28:10.571 --> 02:28:11.050
them.

2602
02:28:11.050 --> 02:28:15.790
He would watch sugar Ray Robinson at Jack Dempsey and he's watching like Willie

2603
02:28:15.791 --> 02:28:19.120
pep and he not only watching the heavyweights. Yeah, he watched it every,

2604
02:28:19.121 --> 02:28:21.680
oh yeah, Harry grabbed, he watch all those guys,

2605
02:28:21.681 --> 02:28:25.190
all his old school and weird obscure fighters,

2606
02:28:25.191 --> 02:28:28.250
you know guys that most people don't remember anymore.

2607
02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.760
<v 1>Yeah. That, that, that era of boxing was very different. Sandy, Sam Blur</v>

2608
02:28:33.810 --> 02:28:36.810
<v 0>and you know, all those guys, he would watch all those guys. Yeah.</v>

2609
02:28:36.811 --> 02:28:39.090
That era of boxing before him was terrible.

2610
02:28:39.091 --> 02:28:42.870
It's like you had champs like Pinkel and Thomas and Tony tubs and no one cared

2611
02:28:42.871 --> 02:28:43.800
about the heavyweight division.

2612
02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:47.880
And then he came along and just started blasting people and the like, finally,

2613
02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.540
I remember I was, I was like seven or eight years old. I met Trevor Berbick,

2614
02:28:52.770 --> 02:28:55.530
he's down in The Bahamas for a flight and that says who Tyson took his belt

2615
02:28:55.531 --> 02:28:59.880
from. Yeah. Got His first belt from 20 years old. Yeah, that crazy.

2616
02:28:59.910 --> 02:29:03.690
2020 now you're the heavyweight champion. Okay, well that was the thing.

2617
02:29:03.691 --> 02:29:07.200
Talking to him about it. Like what was that like? And it just,

2618
02:29:07.290 --> 02:29:09.780
there's no way he can manage it. No one can manage that.

2619
02:29:10.530 --> 02:29:11.363
You're going to go crazy.

2620
02:29:11.370 --> 02:29:15.700
I feel like his career and his life would have been very different if custom

2621
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:19.020
didn't when he did. I think so too. Yeah, I think so too. It's a,

2622
02:29:19.170 --> 02:29:22.950
it's a tragic story, but it's also like, there's so many lessons in that story.

2623
02:29:23.370 --> 02:29:27.060
So for all of us, it's like there's a lot to learn. You know,

2624
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:30.300
that what happened when it got all the way to buster Douglas when it was like,

2625
02:29:30.390 --> 02:29:34.470
he thought it felt like you can't lose and he was in this rare state.

2626
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:38.900
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. The like his life. Like he's,</v>

2627
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:41.900
he's had so many ups and downs and as,

2628
02:29:41.901 --> 02:29:46.100
as the heavyweight and like to be somebody that's the heavyweight champion of,

2629
02:29:46.101 --> 02:29:49.320
well, somebody was so many eyes on them, you know, the Robin givens,

2630
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:53.060
all that whole, that whole, so in his life, you know, um, I remember they were,

2631
02:29:53.061 --> 02:29:57.560
I forget who was it Oprah when they were being interviewed and on the wall,

2632
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:59.930
they were on the show. And he just, he just kind of looked like,

2633
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.660
I feel like Mike Tyson and that interview was like those tigers that people walk

2634
02:30:05.661 --> 02:30:08.960
with that they drug. Yes. You know what I mean? Yeah. Perfect.

2635
02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:13.040
Perfect way to describe it, man. They probably medicated him. Yeah,

2636
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.810
cause he did. He did not look,

2637
02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:18.680
he just didn't seem like the Mike Tyson who I was a fan of.

2638
02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:22.010
Like I didn't dislike him in that moment. I was just like,

2639
02:30:22.011 --> 02:30:22.750
what's wrong with him?

2640
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:26.080
<v 0>Meanwhile, what? Who the fuck? I mean it had to be her idea.</v>

2641
02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:27.850
If I was his friend going, why will you go?

2642
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:30.220
Why are you going to talk to Barbara Streisand? Yeah.

2643
02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:33.010
But that's Barbara Walters, whoever it was, get the fuck out of here.

2644
02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.620
Same thing. Barbara Streisand, Barbara Walters to me saying,

2645
02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:38.680
can you talking to some Old Lady? You're the fucking heavyweight champion.

2646
02:30:38.681 --> 02:30:42.340
The World Kid Outta here with that talk. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2647
02:30:42.341 --> 02:30:46.810
This is nonsense. And you're gonna bring your wife. Woo. What are you doing?

2648
02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:47.673
What benefit is,

2649
02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:50.320
<v 1>yeah, it is deaf as well. I can't say definitely,</v>

2650
02:30:50.321 --> 02:30:53.950
but [inaudible] my assumption is it was Robyn given you matriculated them.

2651
02:30:54.130 --> 02:30:57.790
<v 0>Yeah. She emasculated them in front of the world and you know,</v>

2652
02:30:58.050 --> 02:31:01.360
and I think afterwards he realized what happened. He was furious. Yeah.

2653
02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:04.660
But it's like that life is unmanageable. He's,

2654
02:31:04.690 --> 02:31:07.180
the life that he lived back then was unmanageable.

2655
02:31:07.181 --> 02:31:10.030
He was the fucking King of the world.

2656
02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:15.030
He was in his twenties he was buckwild just going crazy flatline.

2657
02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:16.420
And people everywhere he went,

2658
02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:20.010
people throw rose petals at his feet and screaming, cheering

2659
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:24.810
<v 3>fans. It's unmanageable. You're too young. Imagine me, you know, poor</v>

2660
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:31.260
adopted black kid with no love in your line. No love in your lane until, yeah,

2661
02:31:31.261 --> 02:31:36.261
until you're 13 and then you come into all this money because you're the best

2662
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:40.170
fighter in the world. Like there's,

2663
02:31:40.470 --> 02:31:44.310
what could he possibly be afraid of then to nothing. Right.

2664
02:31:45.570 --> 02:31:49.620
Pet Tigers, bro. Wrestle with them. I mean,

2665
02:31:49.621 --> 02:31:50.670
that was the crazy thing.

2666
02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:53.910
And him talking about what he found out that he could get a tiger, what?

2667
02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:54.773
I could get a tiger.

2668
02:31:57.630 --> 02:32:00.000
But he's so humble now. It's so interesting.

2669
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:02.700
And one of the more interesting things that he said that he doesn't train

2670
02:32:02.701 --> 02:32:07.080
because he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to fire his ego up. You know?

2671
02:32:07.081 --> 02:32:08.340
He's like, I don't like that part of me.

2672
02:32:08.341 --> 02:32:11.040
I don't want that part of me to come out again. I don't, I don't want,

2673
02:32:11.041 --> 02:32:14.760
it wasn't a video of him. Like I understand he wasn't training,

2674
02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:16.440
it wasn't a video of him. I think last year,

2675
02:32:16.441 --> 02:32:20.160
just before he came in here and spoke to you where he's hitting the heavy bag.

2676
02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:23.010
I think it was a little bit longer ago than that. But yeah,

2677
02:32:23.011 --> 02:32:25.620
he was doing it for something and he's still can crack man

2678
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:29.240
powers and last thing, you'll see that scene.

2679
02:32:29.250 --> 02:32:32.060
He's doing a movie and there's a scene in a bar. They're there,

2680
02:32:32.061 --> 02:32:34.800
they're doing something and he just shows them a combination.

2681
02:32:34.801 --> 02:32:39.450
He just punches in the air, no warm up, Lightning Fast Jab,

2682
02:32:39.451 --> 02:32:42.210
hook up or cut right hand. It's like, yikes.

2683
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:47.460
It's all still there and 50 years old still fuck you up. And that was,

2684
02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:49.950
that was like, he was the heavyweight champion of my childhood.

2685
02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:54.870
Mine to Mohammed Ali. He came, you know, but, but again,

2686
02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:58.350
Larry Holmes just doesn't get the credit. It's like for whatever reason,

2687
02:32:58.351 --> 02:33:02.100
it's just like in the first round when when Tyson fought Larry Holmes,

2688
02:33:02.310 --> 02:33:03.660
it made me think like, damn,

2689
02:33:04.050 --> 02:33:06.330
what would have been like if Larry was in his fucking prime,

2690
02:33:06.331 --> 02:33:08.850
cause when they fought Lara was like 36 or something like that.

2691
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.150
Somewhere around there. It was already kind of over for him. Yup.

2692
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:16.770
And Mike was Mike. I mean Mike was black shoes. No socks.

2693
02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:18.840
There it is right here. Why y she

2694
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:24.780
if the weave, yeah, I mean he just can't help.

2695
02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:28.950
I mean that was like built into his system, you know, Blah Blah Blah.

2696
02:33:29.490 --> 02:33:33.790
Fuck head movement. Delhi, he was a,

2697
02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:37.500
he was such an interesting guy too because he was only like five.

2698
02:33:37.770 --> 02:33:42.060
He's probably like five ten five 11 I think he was like five 10 and a half,

2699
02:33:42.061 --> 02:33:42.840
something like that.

2700
02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:47.440
But to be a heavyweight and just so low and bobbing and weaving and moving in

2701
02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:50.120
and everybody was like, Jesus. Yeah. You see him coming,

2702
02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.420
I guess heads right in your chest and he's ripping your body and then upper cut

2703
02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:57.360
that right hook to the body and then upper cut behind it that he used on.

2704
02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.020
Everybody used it on Frank Bruno using on everybody. Boom.

2705
02:34:01.530 --> 02:34:05.670
Right up the middle. We had talked to him with Francis Francis. Really?

2706
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:10.080
Francis it's harder. Yeah, he, it's harder. I think so. I think,

2707
02:34:10.170 --> 02:34:13.420
I think Mike Tyson, it was a way better boxer. Yeah.

2708
02:34:14.010 --> 02:34:18.010
But I think if Mike Tyson can hit like Francis does,

2709
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:22.450
just Francis just has to clip you. He just like,

2710
02:34:22.451 --> 02:34:24.580
what would he did a jr he just grazed them.

2711
02:34:25.570 --> 02:34:27.730
Obviously there are different gloves obviously.

2712
02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:30.940
I just think Francis is such a way bigger man. You know,

2713
02:34:30.941 --> 02:34:35.640
Mike at his prime was like two oh nine two 15 round. Then I remember on, on,

2714
02:34:35.641 --> 02:34:40.180
on punch out. I never beat him and that would be, yeah,

2715
02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.160
well, you know Deontay uh, when he fought Tyson fury and he's told me only way,

2716
02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:48.880
two oh nine, that's what he weighed. He's, how tall is he?

2717
02:34:50.170 --> 02:34:54.730
He's like six, six at least. Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy.

2718
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.200
But I still, I mean I wouldn't want to, I want to see Deontay wilder punch that,

2719
02:34:59.250 --> 02:35:03.210
that thing that the UFC has, although I have one of those out here. Those, uh,

2720
02:35:03.390 --> 02:35:07.720
what is it called again? The puncho meter. The poncho meter.

2721
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:08.590
That's how I found that thing.

2722
02:35:08.591 --> 02:35:11.620
I was looking for someone talking about his punching power somewhere.

2723
02:35:11.621 --> 02:35:13.290
If there's any gauge of it. Well, things,

2724
02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:15.580
I would never let him punch it if I was his trainer. I'm like,

2725
02:35:15.581 --> 02:35:17.470
what if you break your hand? You know,

2726
02:35:17.471 --> 02:35:20.410
like what if you fuck yourself up trying to just hit something as hard as you

2727
02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:23.530
can. I mean, he's the goose that lays the billion dollar egg.

2728
02:35:24.610 --> 02:35:27.370
Deontay if he keeps going, right, like where he's at right now,

2729
02:35:27.610 --> 02:35:31.540
he has become the motherfucking man. You know,

2730
02:35:31.541 --> 02:35:34.840
especially with that last fight with Dominick Brazil,

2731
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:39.040
he sent him into orbit after the Tyson fury fight. You realize like, okay,

2732
02:35:39.041 --> 02:35:43.720
this guy's the fucking man, right? You want to see him fight Andy Ruiz.

2733
02:35:43.721 --> 02:35:46.840
You want to see him fight Tyson fury again. You want to see him fight Joshua.

2734
02:35:46.841 --> 02:35:50.820
Joshua comes back. He's worth so much money now. I be like,

2735
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:52.150
don't be punching things.

2736
02:35:54.430 --> 02:35:58.480
So I guess on that it's the Fox thing where they'd test punching,

2737
02:35:58.481 --> 02:35:59.320
but I think it's Fox.

2738
02:35:59.890 --> 02:36:04.030
It tested punching power and they actually do have a wilder on this and I guess

2739
02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:08.270
Andy Ruiz recently just broke it. Really? Yeah. Oh,

2740
02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.530
but see that those, it's like a game. I don't know how accurate.

2741
02:36:11.531 --> 02:36:14.230
Let me see what Andrew always can fucking punch.

2742
02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:15.700
Say the snickers too or something.

2743
02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:21.540
He's got a mouthful of food and what's he got on something plus and I think

2744
02:36:22.001 --> 02:36:26.800
Wilders was at nine 27. Nine 20. Okay. But I'm telling you that don't mean shit.

2745
02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:30.820
It's a matter of how you punch it and it just slams up in this state.

2746
02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:34.450
Needless sneakers. Is he trying to get a development deal?

2747
02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:39.310
A sponsorship with snickers. That's hilarious. I love Andy Ruiz.

2748
02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:42.970
He's coming here. We got them. We got them for the end of the month. I'm fuck,

2749
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.260
I'm very excited, man. Deaf. I was crazy. Yeah. Anthony,

2750
02:36:47.261 --> 02:36:50.680
Joshua like, um, see that punching power record. That shit ain't real.

2751
02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:54.130
You got to hit that thing. Like I have out there where you really can tell,

2752
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:56.910
even though you gotta hit perfectly to kind of, you got to have this sweet spot.

2753
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:57.970
You have a different thing.

2754
02:36:58.030 --> 02:37:02.320
I have the one that Francis hit the UFC performance institute has were Francis

2755
02:37:02.321 --> 02:37:05.350
broke the record for the hardest punch. Yeah.

2756
02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:08.770
How many lightweights have you had hit that? None.

2757
02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:13.920
The only worst hit it behind besides Frances is a Joe Schilling and you yeah.

2758
02:37:15.630 --> 02:37:16.180
And Brian and

2759
02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:20.710
<v 0>fucking around. No dairy. Brian. He's got 11 knockout power.</v>

2760
02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:26.300
Yeah. All right. It's three o'clock. Let's wrap this up. Um,

2761
02:37:26.301 --> 02:37:30.350
so one more time. Uh, PFL is next.

2762
02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:35.000
The 11th Thursday the 11th Thursday the 11th ESPN and ESPN plus.

2763
02:37:35.001 --> 02:37:38.570
So ESPN plus, if you don't have it, get it. It's an awesome app if you like.

2764
02:37:38.571 --> 02:37:41.330
