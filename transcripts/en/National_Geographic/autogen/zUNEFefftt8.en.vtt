00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:02.810
(intriguing music)

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.483
- [Narrator] Off in the
horizon they rumble.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.940
Rolling across the land,
they darken the skies

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.193
to then spark fire in the darkness.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.833
Letting out an unmistakable roar.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.010
Thunderstorms are rain showers

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.890
accompanied by lightening and thunder.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.020
While violent, these
weather phenomena are common

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.500
with about 2,000 occurring
at any moment worldwide.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.320
There are four major
types of thunderstorms.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.890
Single-cell, which are small,
weak, and isolated storms.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.980
Multi-cell, a common of
type of storm that includes

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.743
a cluster of thunderstorms.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.190
Squall line, a collection
of storms that form a line

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.490
hundreds of miles long.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.559
And supercells, the most
intense kind of storm

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.473
capable of producing tornadoes.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.390
All thunderstorms form
when warm air in the lowest

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.810
layers of the atmosphere rises.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.700
Called an updraft, this air causes water

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.060
from the earth's surface to evaporate

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.740
and carries the moisture
upward to form clouds.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.860
The clouds then build and grow.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.090
Sometimes as tall as 10 miles high.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.900
The clouds darken as they fill
and become heavy with water.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.130
Cool, dry air from the upper
layers of the atmosphere

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.883
known as a downdraft then
pull this moisture downward

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.203
causing it to fall as
life-sustaining rain.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.050
In addition to helping sustain
life, thunderstorms also help

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.693
maintain the planet's balance
of energy and electricity.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.520
When energy specifically in
the form of heat causes water

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.330
to evaporate, the heat is carried upward

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.520
with the water vapor.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.920
As the vapor condenses
and forms water droplets

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.630
it releases the heat
into the higher altitudes

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.743
of the atmosphere and
cools the earth's surface.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.380
Thunderstorms also help
regulate the electrical balance

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.230
between the atmosphere and the planet.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.610
As clouds in a thunderstorm develop,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.450
excess positive and negative
charges form within them.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.750
At a certain point, this
buildup of opposite charges

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.930
leads to the transfer of electrons

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.160
in the form of lightening.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.400
This transference of
electricity occurs so quickly

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.910
that it breaks the sound barrier.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.423
A phenomenon that produces thunder.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.970
While thunderstorms are necessary

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.143
for maintaining balance in the atmosphere,

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.530
(alarm blaring)

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.343
they can also be hazardous.

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:49.520
(phone line beeping)

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.270
Lightening strikes create fires.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.900
Excessive rainfall can
cause flash flooding

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.463
and high speed winds from
tornadoes can destroy homes.

00:03:03.827 --> 00:03:08.020
Meteorologists study weather
systems to try to predict

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.540
the occurrence of thunderstorms
and help ensure the safety

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.323
of countless communities.

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:17.389
(thunder rumbling)
