[Music]

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.310
the climate threat is not new we've
known for a few decades that this was

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.380
going to be the big issue in the 21st
century

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:34.660
this is clearly the biggest threat to
the planet we have an emergency

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.320
[Music]

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.870
we have this whole new injection of
people in the last ten years young

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.300
hungry ambitious eager engineers who
want to do great things it started out as

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.149
an academic pursuit but once we started
working on this it seemed like we might

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.809
actually be on to something you have a
set of these small startups run by you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.270
know these really young idealistic
people who have kind of come up with

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:10.170
these really innovative designs call it
nuclear 2.0 we wanted to develop a new

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.200
type of nuclear reactor that can consume
existing stockpiles of nuclear waste we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.439
need to be building reactors all over
the world as soon as we can if we care

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.940
about climate if we care about dealing
with emissions we need to build nuclear

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.250
so they don't build coal or burn other
fossil fuels I want to build an advanced

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.509
reactor in the next decade so that we
can build them all across the planet to

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.759
put this simply a nuclear reactor is not
an app this is not the kind of idea that

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.440
can be fueled on pizza and lines of code
the risk is proportional to the reward

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.810
and this is about as big as it gets

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:00.430
[Music]

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.510
I'm Ross Koningstein.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.549
I worked on
Google's effort to make renewable energy

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.780
cheaper than coal.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.200
we published a bunch
of material from this, I realized that

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.560
slowing or reversing climate change
could not be addressed without new

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.730
energy technologies coming to bear,
particularly cost-effective ones.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.430
And In
2014 I founded the nuclear energy R&amp;D

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.700
group here at Google.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.730
And we wanted to
see how we might accelerate R&amp;D in

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.730
advanced technology.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.050
something that could
bring about more scalable zero-carbon

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.340
always available cheaper energy for
humanity.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.370
For those of you who are not
students of nuclear science, nuclear

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.680
processes are fundamental to matter and
energy in our universe.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.970
We are made of
matter that was formed through slow

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.720
fusion in stars and our heavier elements
were formed through supernova experiment

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.190
experiments huh
not so much

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.230
supernovae and nuclear decay.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.959
Nature is naturally radioactive so
the nearest radioactive sources

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.430
right near me in fact comes from the
potassium-40 that is decaying in my

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.920
panelists and myself.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.640
So on that note I'm
looking forward to some scintillating

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.140
discussions with this group of
innovators and experts.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.019
So first off
let's introduce David David Schumacher an

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.650
award winning actually Emmy award-winning
director and producer of the new fire

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.180
welcome you're a graduate of the Berklee
School of Music and then took a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.990
left-hand turn to go into the world of
film under esteemed filmmakers

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.200
such as Barbara Kopple and Ken Burns.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.090
I think most of us are aware of one or
two works that Ken Burns has worked on

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.090
that's great.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.780
You became really inspired
and driven to work on the new fire as we

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.390
have talked about several times this is
great and you tie it to the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.959
environmental need the technological
abilities and the opportunities that are

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.300
out there that's great.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.239
Our next panelist Caroline Cochran.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.629
She is
the co-founder and COO at Oklo Inc

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.129
a company named after a naturally-occurring
reactor in Gabon, if I remember correctly

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.159
so Caroline
earned her BA in economics and her BS in

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.419
mechanical engineering from the
University of Oklahoma and her MS and

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.080
nuclear engineering from MIT.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.479
She has a
background working on solar vehicles

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.590
natural gas oil refining and of course
nuclear engineering and her company Oklo

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.280
is working on clean energy plants for
microgrids where advanced fission

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.320
reactors can pair and work along with
renewables so it's pretty exciting.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.759
Tyler Ellis is founder and principal of
Ellis, black Ellis partners pardon me he

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.380
received a PhD, SM and SB degrees from MIT
in nuclear science and engineering and

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.160
also an MBA from Harvard that's probably our
most decorated panelist.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.680
Previously Tyler was
on the founding team at Terra Power

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.750
which is a Bill Gatesâ€™ backed nuclear
energy company and now at Black Hills

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.750
Partners.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.630
He is an entrepreneur investor
scientific adviser who works with both

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.590
the private and public sector to bring
high impact energy technologies to

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.461
market and Mengyao, Mengyao Yuan is a
postdoctoral research scientist at the

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:25.940
Carnegie Institution for science at Stanford.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.160
She recently got her PhD at
Stanford for studying carbon capture and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.360
other low carbon technologies and her
current research focuses on modeling

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.389
analysis of near zero emission energy
systems.

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.880
So thank you all so much for
being with us here today and so let's

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.380
talk about advanced nuclear energy
technology and the solutions and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.600
opportunities that it may present for
the future.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.330
So perhaps let's start with
some maybe you could provide a little

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.500
motivation for each of you to let the
audience know what you're about.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.020
yes
David yeah well I'm not I went to music

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.070
school in Boston and then on 150 Mass Ave.
and I

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.039
found myself on the other side of the
Charles River at Mass Ave.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.180
at MIT why would I go and do this I was
just worried about climate like

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.170
everybody else
and when I sort of realized that the

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.940
science about how do you decarbonize was
not really being followed by the

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.190
policymakers and the just general public
opinion people had no concept of how do

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.199
we actually decarbonize and what role
nuclear would have to play I felt like

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.160
well this is really worrisome because
I'm we have to solve this problem and

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.360
the rate we're going we're just it's not
going to happen and so I felt like

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.290
that's kind of a bold statement and kind
of a very contrarian statement perhaps

00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:00.490
and maybe not the most popular type of thing
to do but I felt like once I sort of met

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.849
some people that were working in this
field and I found you know saw these

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:10.770
amazing sort of heroic folks who were
really just the dedicated to providing

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.860
clean energy for the world even if it's
misunderstood at this time I thought the

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.160
people have to see this because I was so
amazed by what I learned that to be able

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.789
to present that journey of discovery
that I went through to other people and

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.210
they could see the whole get the whole
thing at the 85 minutes as opposed to

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.480
you know spending three years doing all
of this that's that's what I felt was

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.860
really exciting about it great Thank You
Caroline I think in some ways my journey

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.949
parallels David's not entirely I was
engineering in undergraduate but I

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:48.620
didn't know anything about nuclear at
all and met some nuclear engineers

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.110
actually Tyler and an undergraduate
engineering internship in DC I was

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:58.560
mostly interested in policy I thought I
was gonna go to grad school and robotics

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.740
with mechanical engineering and really
just became convinced every I was very

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.410
skeptical about nuclear we learn more
and more about it and I my kind of

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.240
underlying passion is the environment and
health and just realized that this is

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.169
one silver bullet that you don't really
you really don't see something quite

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:17.820
this impactful so I became passionate
about it decided to go work for a year

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.580
reapply to grad school and that's how I
ended up at MIT

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.530
My co-founder Jacob DeWitte who's here actually
today was passionate about

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.160
commercializing something in advance
nuclear and so I became part of that

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.670
group but what we really realize this
people needed this kind of power what

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.680
we're looking at now they needed it
yesterday basically these microgrids are just

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.110
starving for clean reliable
power so that's how we really got

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.920
focused in on this really really small
concept great Thank You Tyler yeah mine

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.519
actually starts back to freshman year we
had to pick your major and then I said

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:55.580
okay I got into a good school I think I
should work on something that's high

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.750
impact to society and I said okay we
have genetically modified crops for food

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.589
we have desalination technologies for
water we have cheap building materials

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:06.620
for shelter but energy is really the
underpinning factor that we don't know

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.360
how we're gonna get all that it is we
need to get I said okay I'll work on

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.360
that and then I looked at all the energy
funds that you could scale up without

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.580
emitting massive amounts of co2 in the
interim and it's okay nuclear technology

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.480
is the best option there I said I'm
gonna work on that I spent about seven and

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.800
a
half years at MIT and then subsequently

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.709
worked with several other startups
Afterwards Great.

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:28.709
And Mengyao.

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:35.170
Yeah, so what got me started in the energy
and environment space is Captain Planet and

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.029
the Planeteers, which I really enjoyed watching
as a kid.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:43.990
But what keeps me going is just a sense of
accomplishment I get from doing something

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.819
I find meaningful.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:48.040
so I have a question for David

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.470
so of course congratulations with the
the release of the film which was like

00:09:53.470 --> 00:10:00.149
this weekend right yeah Friday yeah
Thursday and I think you've told

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:03.180
us a bit about your motivation behind
the story.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.990
Can you tell us about the
reactions at the film festivals and what

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.300
you think the path for the film will
be well I think that the you know the

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.339
path with the film is just gonna be
number one box office smash worldwide

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:23.750
no I mean it the point of the
Film this isn't a commercial film I mean

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.660
when you go about making a film like a
documentary you have to ask yourself why

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.490
am I doing this
and there's generally three buckets that

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.320
could fall and it could be to make that
money you know I want to make as much

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.140
money as I possibly can
or it could be I want to be famous I

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.380
want as many people to see this film and
awards and reviews and everything and

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.500
it's a really big deal or I want to
change the world and I'd love to do the

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.810
first two don't get me wrong but my main
priority with this film was changing the

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.760
world and I think that the thing that it
could it was able to do and the biggest

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.370
concern that I had was that people who
are concerned about the environment and

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.640
concerned about climate and sincere
about that just don't understand nuclear

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.800
and don't understand the role that
nuclear can play to really solve this

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.040
plant and solve this problem this energy
problem this climate problem this social

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.790
justice around energy problem
sustainable development problem nuclear

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.730
is something really interesting that can
really help with all of those issues and

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.589
I felt that if I could somehow bring a
story that can appeal to those

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:31.709
sensibilities of those type of people
and get you know them to accept

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:35.660
especially advanced nuclear and the role of
innovation we're already doing a lot

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.180
of renewables we're already doing
storage we're already working on

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.400
efficiency systems thinking all of that
stuff what else can we do because this

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.649
is a big problem the biggest problem
we've ever had as a species

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:49.600
what about technology what's next in a
pipeline and if you think about it in

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.160
that respect the development pipeline
the low-hanging fruit in energy is

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.010
nuclear so I think it's really
interesting and I hope that

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.860
environmentalists will see that this is
that we're environmentalist too and

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.430
that's I mean Caroline could even talk
about she was at the screening at the

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.390
world's largest environmental film
festival environmental film festival in

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:15.620
the nation's capital and we're accepted
as environmentalists I mean it's amazing

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.000
and we've been at four environmental film
festivals and that's really amazing so

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.450
one of the things that many people might
not know is that some of these film

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.540
screenings have Q and A's what were the
reactions like from the people who saw

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.360
the film I would say that we've had some
really great reactions I had one couple that

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.260
came
after up to me after our screening at

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.920
the Philadelphia Film Festival
environmental film festival and they

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.029
said you know we were we live downwind
from the Three Mile Island these were

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:50.250
older folks than me they were young
adults living around Three Mile Island

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.220
when that happened and they were very
scared and it became very anti-nuclear

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.230
in the wake of that and started a branch
of the Sierra Club and they were very

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.080
anti and they said you know we they came
up to me they said you know we have a

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.960
friend who's been pro-nuclear and she's
been trying to convince us and it hasn't

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.070
worked but you know seeing this film and
seeing these the next generation

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.970
reactors and the people behind it made
us you know really interested and inspired

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.480
and I think now we actually changed our
minds and that was a really big deal I

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.180
mean I think it's a big deal for people
that changed their minds but I think

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.910
also at these environmental film
festivals there's a lot of disaster porn

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.960
you know there's so much bad news in the
environmental space that to bring a

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.380
positive solutions based story was kind
of a really nice palate cleanse and

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.250
beyond that it was just the way in
contrast everything else so I mean I

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.410
could have asked for a better quality of response
than what we've

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.410
gotten from the environmental film
festivals in particular but film

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.790
festivals in general I would say that's
great.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.709
Well let's let's switch gears a
little into a technology in the systems

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:55.390
view so I think as we all know you know
in the early 1900's a telephone was this

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.540
40-pound box that was attached to the
wall of your house and you had to hand crank

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.810
it and here we are today and we
carry you know something that you can

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.730
call anybody in the world from and it
fits in your pocket and it happens to

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.069
have a computer and all sorts of other
good stuff in it.

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:12.250
Nuclear
technology sadly has not seen the same

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.699
rate of advance however there are a
number of advances that have occurred

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:22.519
and Mengyao I wonder if you might talk a
little bit about what you think of from

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:27.269
traditional nuclear energy which is
basically 1950s technology and how that

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:30.949
fits into the energy system and compare
that perhaps with the possibilities of

00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:32.510
advanced technology nuclear.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.080
So yeah so
traditionally nuclear power is a

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.019
large-scale zero emission technology
and has played an important role in the

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:45.880
u.s. energy system nuclear currently
represents 20 percent

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:51.310
of the electricity generation in the US
and more than half of the countryâ€™s

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:57.290
carbon-free electricity the energy
system is changing rapidly however and

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.850
nuclear faces competition from cheap
natural gas especially in the US as well

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:09.260
as increasing penetration of wind and
solar PV and because of the variable

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.730
generation from wind and solar
we need technologies that can fill the

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.910
gap between variable demand and variable
generation and currently natural gas is

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:26.380
filling this role but to minimize the
impact on the climate we would need

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:31.940
substitutes that are carbon free and
these technologies would also need to be

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.740
cost competitive with natural gas
because eventually everything would need

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:42.300
to compete on dollar per kilowatt hour
basis future energy technologies will

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.009
also need to be reliable and flexible to
accommodate the variability in the grid

00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:54.690
and they would also need to be climate
resilient to adapt to the more

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.230
challenging operating conditions caused
by climate change and advanced nuclear

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:04.149
technologies could be an important
player in a future energy system if they

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:08.759
can tick these boxes and I look forward
to learning from the other panelists

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.170
about this topic thank you thank you
well let's let's hop to that panelists

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.170
so Caroline you are in an advanced
nuclear energy startup could you tell us

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:20.820
what that's like yeah well you know in
the movie it says it's not like an app

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:27.320
that's true um in some ways but in some
ways it actually is believe it or not

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.851
and that's part of why we're based here
in Silicon Valley is because we feel

00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:39.370
like the focus that's on developing
and turning out something quickly is

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:44.350
really important we're part I think it's
we also friends who are doing other kind

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.899
of really cutting-edge things like
quantum computing and things like that

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:52.759
but I almost think this is it's harder
than that in a way because we're not

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:55.910
just trying to break new ground but
we're trying to break new ground and

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:01.649
such an old industry and kind of like
what was mentioned by the other

00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:04.150
panelists we've got an industry where
it's no joke they still use analog

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.059
devices frequently okay so we're talking
dials and levers and stuff um and so

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:12.809
we're trying to do this and a totally
new kind of reactor using tested

00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:18.510
technologies from the labs from decades
ago but basically totally new in a

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.640
commercial sense for the micro grids but
trying to do within an industry that is

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640
incredibly backwards and not necessarily
always friendly to that kind of kind of

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:31.540
new innovation so it is I think we're in
a really interesting spot in that way

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.960
we're trying to use computers you know
now with computing power you can

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.590
actually model an entire reactor used to
be you really couldn't do that and so

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.510
you know using Python and using modern
scripting and computing capabilities to

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.380
really turn this around much quicker and
much cheaper so um yeah it's a really

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.950
unique space okay so you have the
perspective of innovator Tyler I'd like

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:58.179
to turn to you and get the perspective
of somebody who helps make things happen

00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:07.340
in funding advice etc so in the nuclear
space there's about 30 startups

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:13.490
operating today in advanced nuclear what
do you see as some of the things that

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:18.970
that need to happen there to really make
that successful yeah so I mean each

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.929
individual company and Technology
approach kind of has their own specific

00:18:23.929 --> 00:18:27.419
things that would be most beneficial so
you know for one company maybe their

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:29.830
central technical risk is a new
materials development program for

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.910
another company maybe it's a you know
complex simulation and finding kind of

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:39.960
the optimum topology of reactor layout
so kind of each individual concept and

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.770
company kind of has their own you know
set of technical milestones that's that

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.580
would be most helpful in the like in the
investment space I think there's a

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.530
variety of interesting things that are
happening there with the rise of a lot

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.890
of new funds that have longer timelines
and providing access to physical

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.880
facilities in order to perform a lot of
earlier stage prototype development and

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.049
proof-of-concept without having to spend
all the money to build up one of those

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:09.240
types of facilities and then just
generally connecting

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.370
those types of organizations with large
strategic companies that can help them

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:18.680
scale up or help them learn how to better
really ramp that up into a

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.300
commercially viable type of design and
then on the regulatory front I think

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.890
there's a number of kind of interesting
developments there as well as far as the

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.220
NRC is entirely rate based they're about
a 90 percent of their fees are recovered

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.900
from you know the rate payers but
they're starting to change some of those

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.150
requirements such that you know smaller
companies can go and talk to them and

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.910
have interactions you know for for
establishing kind of a large-scale

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.700
design that's between like forty to a
hundred million dollars which is pretty

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.880
expensive for a lot of early-stage
startups but you're starting to see

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.400
movement in that space in order to try
and alleviate that burden so kind of new

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.419
or more exciting technologies have a
shot at actually getting to market

00:19:56.419 --> 00:20:00.310
without having to raise hundreds of
millions to billions of dollars to get

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:05.960
over that hump because that high amount
of capital you know is a pretty

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.230
significant barrier to entry for a lot
of the older space startups so you have

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.929
to be really keenly focused on what is
that central technical risk let's do

00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:14.210
what we can to take maximum risk out early
and then use that to justify

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:21.380
the subsequent round of financing yes that
definitely is one of the challenges in

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.840
nuclear space because energy is about
10% of the world economy

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.240
so the potential revenue stream is huge
but you know scaling your company and

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.250
technologies to deliver that you need money
to make that happen.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.470
Great &nbsp;well
I'd like to turn now to the panel part

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.420
of our discussion and I'd like to talk
I'd like us to talk &nbsp;for a little bit about

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.350
the circular economy so the circular
economy is somewhere where you reduce

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.130
your environmental footprint by
designing out waste remanufacturing your

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.880
products or regenerating your systems so
that your waste stream becomes

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.510
incredibly small and hopefully your
supply stream also becomes quite strong

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.740
small of course to do this you tend to
need to add energy and you know

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.840
processing to make these things work so
for example Google has realized quite a

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.510
few savings as well as reductions in
waste in our own implementation of

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.670
circular economy in the management of
our data center hardware so nobody likes

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.789
to throw out a lot
of you know used electronic equipment so

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:28.080
if you can close that cycle and minimize
your waste stream then you have a much

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.030
smaller environmental impact energy
technology can play a real role in

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.640
this and so I'm wondering if we could
talk a little bit about the circular

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:45.300
principles of reduce reuse recycle etc
and how we could embed that much at a

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.100
larger scale into a society's
infrastructure how do you see the next

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:56.890
generation of nuclear reactors fitting
into that picture so I mean just to kind

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.260
of reiterate what you said you know the
amount of waste itself is actually

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.350
incredibly small you know when you look
at you know it's a football field 9 foot

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.171
high which is the waste stream for the
entire United States 20% of our

00:22:10.171 --> 00:22:12.690
electricity generation for about 60
years

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.870
you know if an individual got 100
percent of their electricity from

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.020
nuclear energy and lived to be a hundred
their waste would fit inside of a Coke can

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.910
it's very well contained very small
so it's a fairly small amount to deal

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:28.260
with a lot of the existing nuclear
reactors burn about 0.7% of kind of all

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.309
uranium that exists there's two isotopes
u-235 u-238

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:36.610
many of the advanced reactor designs can
go upwards of you know close to 50%

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:42.170
utilization which is a significant
expansion as far as the uranium

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.740
utilization and then also once you
actually split that uranium in there

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.799
there are a variety you get basically
the entire periodic table in your spent fuel

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:53.530
elements so there are a variety of
uses from any of those isotopes for

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.690
medical applications you know
molybdenum-99 at Kazon to technetium-99

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:02.470
which we use for 20 million imaging
procedures in the medical field today so

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.470
I think there's a lot of opportunities
with many of those advanced technologies

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:12.900
to increase the utilization and or reuse
their fuel for you know making new fuels (mumble).

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.170
Mengyao, I think you had a comment, no
So, I'd like to add to that if there's extra

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.710
time I like once I learned about
nuclear I found it's really the it's

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.830
almost like the ultimate circular
economy situation because you can try to

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.929
recycle a lot of things but very few
things can you recycle and produce clean

00:23:31.929 --> 00:23:35.910
electricity at the same time
so that's really what's so amazing about

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.510
it and part of why we're passionate
about our technology - it's one of the

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:44.750
ones that Tyler was mentioning where you
can really make use of the entire well a

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:50.559
large portion of the remainder of the
nuclear fuel that's been used that's why

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:54.250
sometimes people call it used nuclear fuel
instead of waste because one

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.390
analogy is like if you buy the liter pop
and took a sip and threw it away we can

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:03.150
use a good portion of the remainder of
that so that's really important to us is

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.140
making closing than what we call closing the
nuclear fuel cycle but also like you

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.240
thinking about all so many different
products for use today maybe we can try

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.270
to recycle them but they use an
incredible amount of energy to recycle

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.730
so the carbon footprint of recycling and
sometimes greater than just making it

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.860
new although you're still talking about
resource impacts on the globe right and

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.100
in the environment and so we have to
focus on what has the lowest carbon

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.919
lifecycle footprint and that's really
nuclear by a long shot um when you when

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:34.929
you account for whether or not you have
to have backup power or storage for an

00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:37.929
energy source and then if you take that
which is already incredibly low carbon

00:24:37.929 --> 00:24:44.419
footprint and then recycle it then you
really have an incredible situation for

00:24:44.419 --> 00:24:47.279
the environment so that's why we're real
excited about it and now you mentioned

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:51.220
the electric part but there's also the
primary energy part where you know the

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.650
large-scale use of natural gas or other
fuels that go into manufacturing

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.750
I just wanted throw something out here
is that we're talking about the waste so

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:08.909
when people hear about nuclear waste
does anybody worry about that well

00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:12.260
that's reasonable because when you
pulled spent fuel out of a reactor

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.120
that's pretty nasty stuff right then and
there and you know you definitely only

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.890
be anywhere near it or you won't live
very long but the thing I think is

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.640
really interesting it's the reason that
I'm making this film at all is because

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.970
of fossil fuel waste that here in the
United States we're putting 100 million tons

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.169
of it into the atmosphere this week and
every week that's how much we do just in

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:37.640
the United States we use about 10% of
the world's energy I think it is and yet

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.371
we're worried about a football field of
spent fuel how many people know the

00:25:44.371 --> 00:25:46.520
difference between high level waste and
other waste so when you hear about the 5

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:54.230
million gallons of high level waste does
anybody know what that is so that's the

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.020
scary stuff the high level waste is from
military when they were doing the

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.049
Manhattan Project and they're just in
such a rush to let's get the bomb as

00:26:02.049 --> 00:26:05.720
fast as we can we weren't really worried
that much about the waste and so forth

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.360
so there are some millions of gallons of
waste that has not been fully remediated

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.000
yet and you know so that's kind of the
cost of getting the the bomb finished in

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.110
time and finishing the Second World War
however on the nuclear energy side every

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.220
bit of nuclear spent fuel nuclear waste
that is produced by the nuclear energy

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.400
industry is collected by the nuclear
energy industry is controlled by the

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.940
nuclear industry there's never been a
fatality from that for many you know

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:42.600
civilians certainly and it's a it's a
big lie out there about nuclear waste is

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.669
something dangerous I mean imagine if
the fossil industry collected and

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:48.070
controlled its waste imagine if that
happened we wouldn't need to have this

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.409
climate problem, would we but yet here we
are

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:55.360
worrying about nuclear waste no one's
ever died from it so who benefits from

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.159
that that's the question I want to know
your fear of nuclear waste of radiation

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:06.640
who benefits from that because you're
not supporting nuclear so then if people

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.700
don't support it it's not gonna get
built and what fills the void think

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.880
about that on that thought-provoking
note let's shift a discussion to what's

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:23.750
next so just sort of anybody please
comment what do you think is needed to

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:31.920
scale the advanced nuclear reactor
industry well please happy to go I

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.630
think there's a variety of things for a
lot of the new startups kind of as I

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:42.070
mentioned before having
sort of a new mechanisms in the

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.020
regulatory side is gonna be very
beneficial so as I mentioned it's very

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.780
capital-intensive to have any sort of a
regulatory review so that would have a

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.799
very massive impact I think another
thing that you could do would be right

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:57.710
now each individual state has a
renewable portfolio standard and they

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.830
actually define winners as only wind or solar,
so they kind of artificially

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.830
selecting winners I think the original
intent of the legislation is really to

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:10.970
encourage non co2 emitting generation so
if individual state by state basis we

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.770
were to go around and say okay let's
change the definition from only wind and

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.230
solar to all non emitting generation
sources I think that would go a long way

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:28.830
towards helping uh helping that out and
then I had one other but oh I'm sorry

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.539
the public-private partnership site I
think there's a variety of interesting

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:37.539
mechanisms that could be used to a lot
of Department of Energy experts and

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:41.120
other experts in the government can have
public/private interactions with the

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.210
private industry so whether that's
leveraging a lot of their large testing

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.350
facilities at National Labs so you
startups don't have to rebuild all of

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.990
that or tap into some of that expertise
I think they can go a long way and then

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.929
one of the other things that was really
beneficial in the NASA COTS program

00:28:55.929 --> 00:28:59.649
which basically provided about four
hundred million dollars to SpaceX and

00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:05.630
allowed SpaceX to be the success that it
is today from from other companies that

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.330
didn't win that award like SpaceX they
were actually able to interact with NASA

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.320
experts and then have NASA sign off on
the technology approach and then have

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.590
independent experts say yeah that's
reasonable if you build that that will

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.480
work then they're able to take that to
the private investors and say oh well

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.870
you have NASA experts signed off on that
you know we're gonna fund you to get to

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.460
your next milestone that actually
encouraged a lot more innovation to

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.760
happen which was phenomenal beyond just
the individual winner of the

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.760
public-private partnership.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.340
I think that what's
interesting about what Tyler is talking

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.880
about though is it's different between
nuclear and and you know space travel

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.970
and when SpaceX is all about is that who
doesn't want to see that type of you

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.850
know
they're talking about going to Mars you

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.320
know like that's exciting who isn't
excited about that but in a nuclear

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.130
business we're gonna build a new reactor
like hey people just don't get as

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.220
excited you don't capture the
imagination of the public but it really

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.530
should because this is how you get off
fossil fuels and after all it's all

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.580
about keeping it in the ground that's
what we have to do is keep fossil fuels

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.610
in the ground so if you ever wondering
about a problem with nuclear like the

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.919
safety safety no one's ever died from a
nuclear plant including Three Mile

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:21.720
Island in the United States ever yeah
what happened in San Bruno a few years

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.360
ago with natural gas so we didn't have a
moratorium on natural gas after a bunch

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.210
of people died when there's a big
natural gas explosion in their

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:34.380
neighborhood but yet you know at
Fukushima happens which nobody who died

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:40.350
from radiation at Fukushima either and
Germany shuts down everybody shuts down

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.880
and it's just amazing because who
benefits from this and who fills the

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.340
void fossil fossil is still the fastest
growing form of energy in the world

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:57.330
right now out of all of the new energy
that the capacity that's put out in the

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.820
world renewables is only about a third
less than that the vast majority of a

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.919
new energy is filled with fossil and so
you're not even replacing existing the

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:13.210
only thing that is ever you know worked at
the scale and speed necessary in

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.720
the world is nuclear, but some people
aren't gonna be happy about that

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.820
because if you think about the energy
industry it's 10% of the world

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.710
technology and the fossil industry is a
multi trillion dollar industry it's

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:29.309
crazy it's huge amounts of money nuclear
is a few billion dollars a year in the

00:31:29.309 --> 00:31:33.230
fuel space because it's basically free
fuel doesn't cost thing right like one

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.000
gram of uranium has about saying that
ash is two tons of coal and in those two

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.100
tons of coal there's four parts per
million of uranium so when they're

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.480
Burning two tons of coal they're
actually spewing more uranium out there

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.360
into the earth for all of us to breathe
and whatever then you would need to burn

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.080
in a reactor to create the same amount
energy in the first place and then you'd

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.110
have waste from one gram
of uranium which is like a size of a pea

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:04.860
so this is how insane it all is and why
because public opinion people afraid of

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.740
radiation people afraid of nuclear
safety people afraid of all that but if

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.640
you look at the facts what's the most
dangerous form of energy they ain't

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640
nuclear, it's coal.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.570
Nuclear's at the
bottom it's the safest form of energy

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.940
along with renewables and you know hydro
is actually much more dangerous because

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.610
people have you know had there's been
bad accidents but there's it's not

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:29.700
dangerous and radiation it turns out
that we're way over afraid of radiation

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.620
there's no exactly the amount of
radiation required in a year so you

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.260
evacuate from a place according to you
know health physics society and the EPA and

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.019
other guidelines it's 100 millisieverts
annual dose well there's no biological

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:51.530
evidence of anybody ever getting cancer
having a bad health outcome from

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:56.390
receiving less than 100 millisieverts
not over a year but over the course of a

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.630
few seconds to a few minutes nobody's
ever died from a cat-scan nobody's ever

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.559
died from an MRI nobody's ever died from
a PET scan nobody's ever died for a

00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:07.870
chest x-ray that's never happened
there's no evidence of it yet here we

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:13.409
are being told these risks that are not
real risks it's all like it's something

00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:18.980
everything is upside down and nuclear
everything I thought I knew was wrong

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.850
and it's just it's bonkers but it's so liberating
it I just hope some of

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.539
you folks look into this it's really
interesting so it's really interesting

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:31.919
to see that if you're particularly
data-driven and you can set aside your

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:36.190
feelings on the matter then you can
arrive at this kind of conclusion right

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:40.660
but you know most people who actually
don't have a lot of information they

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:46.230
rely on things they see and hear what do
you think about the importance of having

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:51.510
demonstrations of new technology in the
nuclear space that the public could

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:56.570
somehow see and use as a basis for
re-evaluating perhaps what they think

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:01.850
yeah yeah like that's actually a perfect
segue cuz I was just going to echo what

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.730
Dave is saying and Tyler is saying but
also you know how we scale this up or

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.120
how do we really change things I think we
have to build

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.364
it I don't think we necessarily need
huge government programs do that I think

00:34:14.364 --> 00:34:16.419
huge government programs usually lead to
the kinds of outcomes so you don't want

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:20.360
to see in this industry which is more
backwards thinking and more kind of anti

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.839
innovation thinking which is what we're
battling basically every day right and then

00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:30.020
what's really behind all this there's
not a big motive there because there

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.500
isn't the education the stuff that
Dave's talking about people aren't

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.409
passionate like you see people have
learned some things and then they get

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:40.490
really passionate it's really amazing
but by and large like you're saying

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:44.360
people aren't and so there isn't the
motivation for the politicians to push

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.210
things or to give credits or I think it
all comes down to what people really

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.040
want and I think when you build
something especially our reactors kind

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.710
of what we call community size so it's
small enough that there's really nothing

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:03.440
that can happen to it and you can have a
small piece of land where people could

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.570
come and actually come pretty close to
the reactor because it is that safe and

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.270
we can demonstrate that and then they
can see it and they can feel in a touch

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:16.190
it and I think it's not as foreboding as huge
plants that have you know large

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.930
amounts of water intake like we don't
require any water and you can't come

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:24.230
anywhere close and there's huge guards
and you know guns and fences and all

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.280
those other things so yeah I think
that's a huge part of it it's just

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.760
building it and letting people see it
firsthand and letting them make their

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.910
own decisions and giving them education
to know what's real what's not real yeah

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:39.030
we have the interaction is a huge part I
mean if you get greater social licence

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.780
when you actually bring people in and
show them as opposed to oh this is super

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.980
secret you can't you can't see what
we're doing we're gonna do a put a black

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.550
box around everything and then users
have to trust us so having that

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:55.490
interaction I think is very key for kind
of the next generation to be successful

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.560
and deploying new technologies what
we're seeing to as communities are

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.970
already opting in instead of sort of
saying okay we have this huge plan we

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:07.390
have to site in this one you know kind
of low cost area and so poor people end

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.260
up having to move or whatever it has a
socioeconomic effect but when you

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.630
have this small thing that communities
can decide to opt in on because it's

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.849
small enough and cost-effective enough
for them to do that we are seeing

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:21.490
communities that are saying hey I want that
for mine, and

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:22.490
that might be Native American
communities or our small communities up

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.690
in Alaska and so we're basically already
having what's almost like a early

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.670
purchase list because there's
communities are like hey I want that in

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.950
my community I want my community to be entirely
carbon free and so we can pair

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.280
that with renewables and have you know
electricity at night or when the wind

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.040
doesn't blow or when it's really dark
and extremely cold in Alaska and so I

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.340
think there's incredible power if you
can have an opt-in situation great so

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:51.090
another advantage I would think of to
build more reactors is to drive down

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:56.970
the cost of nuclear because currently
the high capital costs especially of

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:04.320
nuclear is a barrier that prevents I
think further development of nuclear so by

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.750
building more reactors we could learn from
the

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:15.390
experience and potentially lower the
cost of this technology great so we have

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.260
a number of people here in the audience
today and a number of people who are

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.650
likely watching us through the internet
do you have any words of wisdom or

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:27.480
advice to people who are interested in
in learning more about this wanting to

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.090
make a positive impact on the world or
simply get involved somehow in the

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:37.119
nuclear conversation
Well, the first place to start is check out

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:40.170
the movieâ€™s website, newfiremovie.com
Commercial plug.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:48.050
The thing that weâ€™ve done on the film on
this website that we just relaunched or expanded

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:54.359
out is that it explains a bit about the
technology and it has links to all sorts

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:58.290
of different sources of information so
if you want a jumping-off point to get

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.270
into you know learning about this if you
go to the website that's a pretty easy

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:08.050
place to start that's what I was going
to say yeah we participated in this film

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.829
because I feel like there isn't a great
there's not like a single great source

00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:16.450
to point people to people are like hey I
want to learn about advanced fission

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:21.680
like what is it how does it differ from
older plants what is nuclear at all um

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.030
I'm not I don't have like a lot of
resources I'm like oh this is a really

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.010
great way and user friend
not really technologically dense to

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:33.100
learn about this and that's part of why
we participate in this film it's

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.400
hopefully like it gets the word out
about what's going on and a little bit

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.160
about the tech and then the website has
more resources so yeah additional plug

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.940
so I completely agree with all of that I
mean I think the the big thing that I

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.880
would say would be to start today don't
start tomorrow or next week we've been

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.170
enough delay so we've people if you want
to get involved involved now I think

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.970
reaching out to a variety of startup
companies in the nuclear space are a great

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.240
way to get involved you know you can
either help them out and you know some

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.349
way shape or form and that can kind of
put you on the cutting edge of a lot of

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:11.031
that technology I think that's a really
exciting way to learn about the

00:39:11.031 --> 00:39:15.490
technology as it's being you know
developed and kind of reengineered I

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.170
mean there are a few other industrial
websites where you can do a little bit

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.400
of additional background reading so
nuclear energy institute is a pretty

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.810
good source of information the world
nuclear Association is another good

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.150
source of information if you want to do
background reading that can kind of give

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:33.840
you a rough lay of the land and
understanding of the technology

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:42.630
Just keep calm and carry on
ok great

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.830
well I think we are coming up on our Q&amp;A
period.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:55.400
Camila, do we have some questions
can everyone hear me so one of the questions

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.650
we had
come in was it seems apparent that we

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:03.359
can no longer reduce carbon we have to
remove it from the atmosphere should we

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:08.960
use the need for energy to sequester
carbon to justify nuclear energy

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.470
Yes!

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.490
- Other thoughts?

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:19.089
cool things I think about
having such an energy dense and non

00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:23.079
carbon emitting source of electricity is
you can do really wild things so we've

00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:27.349
looked into pulling carbon out of the
atmosphere and basically making a carbon

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:33.720
neutral form of fuel for vehicles or
planes you can do that when you have

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.970
such an energy dense form of electricity
you can you can do desalination and it

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.280
really
effective ways but yeah pulling carbon

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.280
out of the atmosphere is one of the
things that nuclear can be really well-suited

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.170
to
okay I would just say that I think it's

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:52.280
probably better to use the nuclear
energy to sort of produce energy and

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.150
offset fossil and get rid of fossil and
then once we're at, you know, zero fossil

00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:02.080
or as close to that as we can get then
start using it to suck the energy there

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.520
the co2 out but that's a small point
yeah a big part of the challenge though

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.320
is there has to be some there has to be
some mechanism that values removing co2

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.840
from the atmosphere because right now
there's no economic way with which that

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.000
is valued so I think one of the big
things for that is actually just being

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.430
able to have some sort of a market
mechanism that addresses and values that

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.460
sort of you know that sort of technology
approach and then as soon as something

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.430
like that happens and you're gonna see a
lot more a lot more movement but

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.579
nuclear's
I think probably the best way of being

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:40.980
able to actually power facility like
that before you had mentioned using last

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.849
gen waste as next gen fuel does that
limit at all where these next

00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:55.000
gen reactors can be built do they have
to be built next to waste sites from former

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.480
sites or can they be dispatched in
other locations yeah it's pretty small

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.480
the fuel part is only five percent of
the cost of nuclear electricity so even

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.619
if you were to spend a little bit more
money or have it be a slightly more

00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:10.710
complex process it really doesn't impact
the net price of electricity much at all

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.530
and then you know the the kind of the
choice between using fresh uranium fuel

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:20.950
versus using a used fuel it's more of a
kind of an economic question because you

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.690
know remanufacturing old fuel or
reusing old fuel will cost a bit more

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.740
money but then performance aside, it is kind
of a society-level question &nbsp;of you know

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.329
where do we make our investment in and
how much do we value you know utilizing

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:36.670
that used nuclear stockpile fuel and then
manufacturing new you know new fuel

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.609
elements from that versus paying for a
repository or something like that so it

00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:44.319
really kind of comes down to you know
what that particular society is

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.790
optimizing for you know we're trying to
have you know the smallest repository

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:53.490
possible or you know for okay using dry
cask storage on reactor sites, or just what

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.050
the desired mix is that'll
be different for each country and I

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.970
think a great question is can you define
advanced nuclear

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:04.690
I'll start, I guess, there are a lot of different
definitions so that makes it kind of tough.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:11.310
You know Congress defined it, they have politically
motivated definitions that

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:16.770
are like any reactor after a certain
year I think usually when people say

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:22.119
advanced they mean non light water
reactors so in other words all the

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:26.980
existing commercial reactors the United
States today use you know huge amounts

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:32.890
of water and they use water for cooling
in moderation so ours doesn't a lot of

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:37.869
these advanced technologies don't there
are some other people who would define

00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:41.089
advanced is more or less having what we
call passive safety characteristics so

00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:46.640
in other words inherent safety so even
if react an operator wasn't there the

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.930
reactor literally couldn't meltdown so
there are some light water reactors that

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.400
have some of those safety characteristics
what we call passive safety

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.950
characteristics so sometimes they get
lumped into the advanced reactor bundle

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:00.829
so it kind of just depends on what you
want to call it I think usually people

00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:05.210
use it as a way to define newer
technology so in the last couple decades

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.330
these passive safety to ensure that
there is no meltdown capability so I

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.040
think that the important thing to think
about when you're thinking about what is

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.359
an advanced reactor is it's and why
would you want an advanced reactor is

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:22.530
precisely building on what Caroline said
right now we have to use water as a

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.490
coolant and you have to get up to about 300
degrees Celsius or something like

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:30.250
that and water boils naturally at a
hundred degrees Celsius so I think that

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:34.470
means you have to be at 150 atmospheres
pressure so you got to keep that water

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:41.050
at that level and imagine the amount of
you know the the size of what you're

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:45.000
dealing with in the magnitude and the
strength of everything and it has to be

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.420
failsafe and has to run 100% at a time
for 40 years that's a big ask on

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.481
materials and on you know this big plant
where if you say well why don't we just

00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:59.810
use material like a coolant that can't
evaporate you know and we can get it up

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.790
to like a thousand degrees
there's no way it's ever going to

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.349
evaporate and it could just run it at atmospheric
pressure well as soon as you

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:10.220
do that it just gets way smaller and way
less complicated and way fewer parts and

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.150
way simpler so why didn't we ever do
that before because we didn't have the

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.770
materials at the time when they you know
in in the 1950s when they needed to get

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:22.330
a reactor going it was like what can we
get going it's gonna work right now and

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:26.113
that we can put in a submarine and it's
gonna work right now and it was, like, a light

00:45:26.113 --> 00:45:31.040
water reactor that made perfect sense but
in the past sixty years with all the

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.060
developments and materials and
everything else that's happened the fact

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:40.080
that we're still using water as the coolant
in nuclear reactors is just I

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.940
mean it's great but it's like it's like
going to Cuba and going oh look at all

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.310
these great old cars it's so nice you
know, '57 Edsel, that's &nbsp;so great and it's

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.670
like but don't you think the people of
Cuba want to be driving Tesla's like

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.150
everybody else
I mean it's charming but we need we need

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.810
new technology and we need the pop
social license and we need people

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:03.800
demanding it if you want to get off
fossil fuel if you want to get at the

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:11.140
fossil industry and make them real mad
and hit him where it hurts advocate for nuclear,

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:16.369
this kind of nuclear
and so to that point the current state

00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:20.390
of the nuclear industry what what is
happening with these old reactors from

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.530
the 1950s are they being shut down with
any replacements are they being upgraded

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:29.810
how is that changing well I think
there's a couple of things that dynamic

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.990
wise that are changing so I mentioned
one the renewable portfolio standards

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.430
and individual states which is actually
mandating a certain percentage of

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:41.110
electricity which has to be purchased
from either wind or solar and the way

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.590
that a lot of those markets work is that
they quote out the total number of

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.780
megawatts they need for the day and each
individual state will say okay well this

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.839
certain percentage has to be for wind
and solar and that moves all the other

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:55.770
resources out of the stack and because
of the advent of cheap natural gas it's

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.109
actually pushing what used to be one of
the cheapest sources of electricity

00:46:59.109 --> 00:47:04.220
generation which is nuclear fission
power plants out of the stack and making

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.569
it challenging for them to be able to
actually sell all their electricity so

00:47:07.569 --> 00:47:09.530
that's why you're actually seeing a lot
of

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:14.250
challenges with regards to should we
keep this plant open or not I mean these

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.980
are very long-lived assets you know
they're originally licensed for 40 years

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.320
but we're doing license extensions for
60 and likely 80 years they're replacing

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.060
a lion's share of the components in
there so you know these already

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.510
constructed facilities can operate for a
very long period of time but you know

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:34.369
really it's a it's kind of a market type
of a dynamic and you know the advent of

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:37.339
the renewable portfolio standards have
really changed that dynamic of being

00:47:37.339 --> 00:47:41.060
able to sell that electricity so I think
that's the challenge it's not a it's not

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.589
a waste issue it's not a it was
partially kind of related to a cost

00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:48.089
issue but it's because the market was
actually changed the rules of the games

00:47:48.089 --> 00:48:01.839
were changed and that's what actually is
really hurting a lot of existing

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.210
generation now that's it one interesting
thing though that's happened the last

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.020
couple decades is massive upgrades to these
plants so we've added maybe 8 gigawatts of

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020
clean
electricity to the grid just because

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.880
these plants use advanced technologies
to grow larger and produce more clean

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.660
electricity it's really valuable
obviously for the grid because it's

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.740
that's 9 gigawatts we don't have to
produce using something else that's a

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:18.670
really good story for the environment
even if we don't think that those are

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.400
necessarily the kinds of plants we
should be building now I've been really

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.190
happy to see some of that so these
plants are operating at 95 plus percent

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:32.369
capacity factor so almost 24/7 and if
you can get squeezed out you know you

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:36.450
know double-digit percentages greater
power out of the same plant and that's

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.900
what they've been doing just because the
need for power has been great and they

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:44.510
had I mean as you mentioned before the
the better computational tools so the way

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:48.520
these reactors were designed in kind of
the 1950's and 40s they had very large

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.550
margins in there and then after they've
kind of sharpen the pencil with a lot of

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.210
their advanced computational tools they
realize oh wow we can actually get a lot

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.690
more electricity out of this and we can
shave those margins down to a more

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.690
reasonable level rather than excessively
large margins so that's also part of the

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:09.290
so some states have had decent emissions
cuts just &nbsp;because of upgrades in

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:14.960
nuclear which is great and then you
mentioned before the high barrier to

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:20.750
entry sometimes with the cost of capital
needed to start a nuclear reactor and so

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:25.740
nuclear we have a question says nuclear
power is distinguished from most other

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.200
technologies in that its cost increases
with time and so do you do you agree

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.830
with that and if so why does that happen
I totally disagree with that it's

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.990
arbitrary the price of energy is
arbitrary if you think about energy what

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:46.010
is it all predicated on right it's all
predicated on this asset this commodity

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.319
fossil fuel commodity that started out
as coal and it was a small thing to do

00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:54.609
you know whatever they did with steam
engines at first and then gradually you

00:49:54.609 --> 00:49:59.400
got oil and then gasoline kerosene
gasoline and natural gas and became this

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.410
multi trillion dollar industry the
fossil industry so we predicate our

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:10.420
whole grid all of the energy that we get
is predicated upon feeding money to this

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.280
commodity industry it's not
infrastructure like you should be

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.210
infrastructure should be like building a
hospital building roads building you

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:21.480
know sewage for cities and stuff it
should be thought it was that nuclear

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:26.880
power just like renewables is power for
the people it's about ideas using

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.470
smarter not using resources to get
energy they're using some resources but

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:37.060
it's about using just really smart
science to be able to get a ton of

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:42.240
energy out of the tiniest little it's
mind-boggling and it's a huge threat to

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.480
the fossil industry but the fossil
industry side a good ride

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.380
I think they've it's time for them to
sort of pass on the torch and it's time

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:55.500
for the world to start thinking energy
more as a public good then as a business

00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:01.380
commodity driven type of thing that's
all for the benefit of enriching a bunch

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.339
of folks that don't necessarily have the
best interests of the planet in life but

00:51:05.339 --> 00:51:09.869
I think we can point to economic
statistics so the question referred to

00:51:09.869 --> 00:51:14.099
that what we call a negative learning
curve in economics and there are

00:51:14.099 --> 00:51:18.800
examples of positive learning curves and
in nuclear and I believe Korea is an

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.590
example of that right so maybe we could
just turn that question around to the

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.809
panelists and say what do you think
would have to change

00:51:25.809 --> 00:51:30.360
for nuclear to go on a positive learning
curve again yeah so I mean I think one

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.690
of the things that's important to keep
in mind is that the cost escalation of a

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.010
lot of the plants in the United States is
not representative of the global

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:42.720
experience around the world you know in
a lot of the costs the united states

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.410
have gone up due to a lengthening of the
regulatory and permitting process and a

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.960
wide variety of other challenges is very
easy to challenge a lot of these

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.730
projects and then subsequently through
the court delays drive up the lion's

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:58.120
share of these costs also American labor
is a lot more expensive than labor in

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.300
other countries so if you compare the
plant construction costs in South Korea

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.410
which has some of the least expensive
power plants the other thing that

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.460
they've done is they've standardized
designs you know so in the United States

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.890
we have about roughly a hundred-ish types
of reactors they're all a little

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.900
bit different as opposed to you know
South Korea kind of made a choice if

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.869
we're gonna have one plant design we're
gonna standardize this and then we're

00:52:19.869 --> 00:52:23.950
gonna come down that learning curve so
that's all coming down the learning

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.220
curve necessitates some sort of a
standardization so then you build it

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.600
over and over again and then those
people that were you know helping to

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.599
construct this reactor can apply those
learnings the subsequent reactor and so

00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:37.190
on and so forth and and that's where
you're really getting a lot of the

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:40.300
savings so I think you know the cheapest
electricity reactor construction

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.280
projects in the world are gonna be
driven by the South Koreans driven by

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.280
the Chinese where they're really
standardizing a lot of these designs and

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.070
building a lot of the same types of
plants because that's really where

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:58.510
you're gonna get the savings so Tyler has
summarized a very elegantly although I

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:03.020
just wanted to add that if you're
interested about this topic I would

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:08.130
recommend reading Jessica Lovering's pieces
on this she also appeared in the

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:11.980
movie I believe so she has some excellent
work on

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:20.470
this topic okay well on that note we are
out of time and we greatly appreciate

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:24.390
appreciate each of you panelists taking
time out of your day to be here today

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:29.670
and sharing your knowledge with our
audience and also out in Internet-Land so

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:32.109
everybody please thank join me in
thanking the panelists

00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:41.530
and also a big thank you Camila Montes de
Oca for making this panel

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.920
discussion happen thank you
