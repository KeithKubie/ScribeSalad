things and this is where I think he gets
a<00:00:13.799><c> little</c><00:00:13.920><c> bit</c><00:00:14.040><c> optimistic</c><00:00:14.519><c> but</c><00:00:15.210><c> but</c><00:00:15.660><c> he's</c><00:00:16.020><c> no</c>

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit optimistic but but he's no

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.230 align:start position:0%
of rejection and so here's the Rogerian
theory<00:01:09.810><c> with</c><00:01:10.020><c> regards</c><00:01:10.470><c> to</c><00:01:10.530><c> therapeutic</c>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
endeavor now the first thing is and this
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649 align:start position:0%
endeavor now the first thing is and this
seems<00:01:17.189><c> critical</c><00:01:17.430><c> and</c><00:01:17.820><c> I</c><00:01:17.880><c> think</c><00:01:18.090><c> Rogers</c><00:01:18.450><c> was</c>

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
seems critical and I think Rogers was
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 align:start position:0%
seems critical and I think Rogers was
right<00:01:18.840><c> about</c><00:01:19.049><c> this</c><00:01:19.259><c> that</c><00:01:19.320><c> the</c><00:01:19.979><c> client</c><00:01:20.460><c> has</c><00:01:20.640><c> to</c>

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 align:start position:0%
right about this that the client has to
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.130 align:start position:0%
right about this that the client has to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
want to change and this is this is a
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
want to change and this is this is a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
funny thing about therapy because my
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 align:start position:0%
funny thing about therapy because my

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
observation has been that it's not

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 align:start position:0%
be better and that alterations in in in
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
be better and that alterations in in in
something<00:01:37.650><c> they're</c><00:01:38.009><c> doing</c><00:01:38.040><c> might</c><00:01:39.030><c> make</c><00:01:39.360><c> it</c>

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
something they're doing might make it
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
something they're doing might make it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
better it's a non-starter
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 align:start position:0%
better it's a non-starter
and<00:01:42.119><c> so</c><00:01:42.390><c> I've</c><00:01:43.200><c> had</c><00:01:43.380><c> clients</c><00:01:43.649><c> who</c><00:01:43.979><c> were</c>

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
and so I've had clients who were
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 align:start position:0%
and so I've had clients who were
court-ordered<00:01:44.579><c> to</c><00:01:44.909><c> attend</c><00:01:45.180><c> therapy</c><00:01:45.630><c> and</c>

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
court-ordered to attend therapy and
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 align:start position:0%
court-ordered to attend therapy and
that's<00:01:45.869><c> just</c><00:01:46.170><c> complete</c><00:01:46.530><c> waste</c><00:01:46.740><c> of</c><00:01:46.950><c> time</c>

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 align:start position:0%
can extract from that is that if you're
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
can extract from that is that if you're

is that well you're pretty perfect but

is that well you're pretty perfect but

you're probably not quite as perfect as

you're probably not quite as perfect as
