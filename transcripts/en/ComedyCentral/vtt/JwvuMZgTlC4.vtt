00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.037
- Vegas, Vegas knows how
to fuck you in the ass.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.038
What?

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.308
(rock music)

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.542
Vegas.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.745
I'm out here once a
month at the Riviera,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.180
trying to sneak my new
stuff for the TV show,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.649 align:start size:97% position:3%
but you know, they're
excited, weekend Vegas crowds,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.652 align:start size:97% position:3%
they can kind of smell it when
it's not polished material.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.887
And I'm like,

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.523
what do you guys
think about trees?

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.627
So you know how trees are
like tall or whatever?

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.996
OK, well, like what doesn't
bend breaks? (CHECK AGAIN)

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.931
Stop cutting off my great jokes.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.934
We can't hear your voice on
this show or maybe we will.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.970
Kim, my sister, has
never been to Vegas.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.139
I feel like she's gonna love it.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.807
- Ow.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.443
- You should take your
ring off, so people,

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.677
no actually keep it on.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.947
Two of you, two of
us, I'll do the math.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.052
We're in Vegas having fun.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.587 align:start size:84% position:16%
I know what's going
to get you psyched up.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.156
You can drink outside.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.524 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Do you want to
wear one of my rings,

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.159
and then people will think

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.161
that we are both
married and happy?

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.430
- Do you know where we
can get tested for AIDS?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.831
- [Stranger] Huh?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.367
- AIDS?

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.170
- Yeah.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.107 line:0%
It doesn't have to be
blood it could be...

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.443
A clinic, alright thank you.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.212
You need another drink.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.881
Come on this is the best.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.249
- No, I know, I know.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.718
Cheers queers.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's more, it's more
phallic than architecture.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.224
- That makes it phallic,
you jamming your straw

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.926 align:start size:84% position:16%
in and out of it,
you fucking pervert.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.894
I am fucking wasted right now.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, look where I am,
look where you are.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.998
- Cuz I'm worried, like
I want to still seem

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:39.833 align:start size:75% position:25%
like I'm a lady.
- Drink it,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.101
I feel like a dick head.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.368
- How come nobody's
trying to fuck us.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.436
- We should probably
take it easy on these.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.971
- I'm gonna throw this up.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.273
- Drink your Eiffel Tower.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.775
- Babe, it's hard.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.316
(trumpets)

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.717
- [Amy] That's beautiful.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.587 align:start position:0%
I don't care what your
sexuality is, that's beautiful.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.055
- Babe, you have a show tonight,

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.157
maybe slow down a little bit.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.091
- I have a show tonight.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:05.892
- You have a show tonight.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.026
You could just stop

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
drinking all together.
- Oh I'll stop

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.395
drinking, you're right.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.965
Stop drinking, start dancing.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.233
(dance music)

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.904
- Shh.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.305
I might get sick.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.608
Hold my hair.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.743
Not you.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.413
Sir, sir.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.483
Sir.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.684
Sir.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.354 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It seems like
maybe you'll do OK.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.125
- I'm not drunk, you're drunk.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.360
- I thought that Vegas

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.728
would be a really
good place to come.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.296
- What is this, water?

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.764
Is this water?

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.033
This tastes like water.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:47.867
- Ready.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.742
- I wish I was going faster.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.810
Oh, shit.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.312
I have no control.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.293
Do you have a basket?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.162
You know what, I'm gonna
bring these back to my room

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.666 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
and then I'm going to come
back and pay for them.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.767 line:0%
Sir, please don't yell at me,

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.769
my father never loved me.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.271
(piano music)

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:38.451
Hi.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
I picked you up this
coffee, I thought

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:46.426
it would be helpful for
you, for just right now.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.760
- I'm not drunk.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.465
You're, OK, yeah.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.468
Thank you.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.710
I think that's coffee.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.646
(light jazz music)

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.022 align:start size:94% position:6%
give it up for Amy
Schumer, let her hear it.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.025 line:0%
(audience applauds)

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.661 line:0%
- Who said it, is it this guy?

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.664 line:0%
You fucking Vegas
tan piece of shit.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:28.301
(audience laughs)

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.737 align:start size:88% position:13%
With your hot girlfriend
who will leave you

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start size:88% position:13%
the second some
95-year-old winks at her

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.841
who has a dollar more than you.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:37.810
(audience laughs)

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.912
I hope you die alone.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:40.747
So,

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.684 align:start size:81% position:19%
and also to answer
your question,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.253
it's to make dicks
like yours seem big.

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.488
(audience cheers)

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:49.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thank you guys so
much for coming out.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.624
You were a great crowd.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.825
(rock music)

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.294
- Just write what you
would like to have

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.195
appear around you.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:00.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
We wanted puppies around
us, and we got them.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.803
- [Amy] Like, there are just
moments where you're like,

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.805
oh my God, we wrote this,
it's really happening now.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.674
- [Director] That's your queue.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.909
(cast and crew laugh)

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.312
(rock music)

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.720
(sharp noise)
