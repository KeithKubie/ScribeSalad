1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,560
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,270
Just checking in on you.
How are you?

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,530
We've got the lovely Nia with
me. Hello. What's going on?

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,450
Oh it's Christmas needy.
I know. City sidewalks.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,460
Pretty ladies.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Everybody walking around spending
money on people that annoy them.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,200
You take your dick out and a charger game.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,630
Rub it up and fucking down.
No, I feel so bad for that kid.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,550
Why? Why do you feel bad? Cause I
have a dick and I know how hard it is.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,460
You know how hard it is?
No, sorry. No Pun intended.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,350
He was in public. I know, but he
just looked like that kind of guide.

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,860
He did not have talked to.
Look if he's a fucking like seriously.

14
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,580
I mean if he's fucking like, you can't
control rubbing his dick in public.

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,320
It was entrapment.

16
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:11,020
They had like 12 fucking scantily clad
women and the whole thing that SRAP meant

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,630
, let me ask you a question. He was
not a game. There's cheerleaders there.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,360
And how were they dressed? Oh, so it's
their fault. How are they dressed?

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,600
The way she really isn't
always says that this,

20
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,120
why can't you guys ever be
flattered when a man flash issue,

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,850
that's a fucking woman ever just whipped
her who are out because I look so good,

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,690
no fucking tee shirt and it would just
fucking make my day as long as she stayed

23
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,090
away from me. I mean, he was,
she was doing its own thing.

24
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,580
You know what's hilarious? Fucking
pervert the way doing it in public.

25
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:43,610
You know what? I loved the way he had
his arms crossed. He was like, well,

26
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:47,550
I can't see what I'm doing.
That means no one else can get an idea.

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,290
Get a fucking the new technique. I never
tried the overhand before. Thank God.

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,900
The cross control the crossover overhead.

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,860
That's like an Olympic level jerking
off through his pants. You know? Look,

30
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,800
everybody you know you, that's how
you get caught. You know, you fucking,

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,680
you can't cheat you. He got greedy is
what happened. You know what I mean?

32
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:07,580
He thought he could. He, you know,

33
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:12,080
he thought he could do like fucking
20,000 people staring right at him.

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,970
Yeah. But you know,
okay, and, and, and look,

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
when I'm talking about those
cheerleaders, why are they out there? Nia?

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,680
Why are they really out there to
stir the crowd up to cheer more? No,

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,060
they're not spreadsheets.

38
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,800
They dress him like fucking
like just shy of who is,

39
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,220
that's what they're out there for.
They got their cleavage,

40
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,970
they get their butt cheeks hanging out.
Everything's barely covered.

41
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:42,680
Everything's all shiny, glittery,
glittery and shit. You know,

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,800
hey, what the fuck was he supposed to do?
You know, not touch his dick in public.

43
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,010
Hey, that's what he was supposed to be
there. But for the grace of God, go,

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,720
I really trying to say that you would
be in a position where you would just be

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,830
jerking off through your
pants in public like that.

46
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,700
[inaudible] I've never stood next to 12
women all dressed in the same sparkly

47
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,100
outfit touching their toes in front of me.

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,520
Wearing some very user friendly slacks,

49
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,340
accidents, slacks, action
slacks. They were, and you know,

50
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,540
you're saying you wouldn't
be able to control yourself?

51
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,920
I would say half to touch.
If I have to take my my life savings,

52
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,260
if I have to take my life savings says
no way. I'm betting on black slacks.

53
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm not, there's no way I'm
going to put it all on one thing.

54
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,130
I don't know what I would do if I had a
couple drinks in me. You know? Who knows?

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,310
Might do the, oh no. Who knows? Who knows?

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,990
Every guy's done that don't want
your golfing public. Oh, absolutely.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,470
Now they have at some point they did
something. They were in their car.

58
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,350
They rubbed one out. They did
something. They weren't a porch. Well,

59
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:53,230
guys are always talking on a plane,
on a plane.

60
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,720
They went to the bathroom and just
rubbed, went out. The amount of men,

61
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm just saying the amount of fucking
men have done it. The year is like, Hey,

62
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,570
yeah. You got to understand when, wait
a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,000
What's that?
I you say that you've gone into a plane,

64
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,990
like a bathroom on a plane and jerked off.
I know I have not done that.

65
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,570
What are you going to do? I
don't know. Scold me. Yes.

66
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,070
Goal to Shaman. I know, listen guys,
I've, the way they talk to other guys,

67
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:24,010
Shit that they've done or
whatever, you know, hey,

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,970
we've all done stuff we're not proud of.
You know,

69
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,850
didn't Jesus say he was not fucking
rubbed what out to a fucking cheerleader?

70
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,470
You fucking cast cast the front.
You know what I hate is if that,

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,750
if that's the worst that that kid does.
Okay.

72
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,410
Which is basically all he did was
completely humiliate himself. All right?

73
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,280
And his life is fucking over it. I mean,
isn't that enough? I feel bad for them.

74
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,730
I do.

75
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,120
Unless he's like really a pervert and
he's running around grabbing women and

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,250
he's ruining people's lives,
then yeah, then you know,

77
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:55,000
put the kid down like a rabid dog without
a doubt. But if it's worst fucking,

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,790
you know, I love about it is
they say men can't multitask.

79
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,510
There was a man clearly
operating as a security person

80
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,810
while rubbing one out that is
multitasking one hand free.

81
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:10,270
So I don't really feel like he was at
his full capacity as a security guard

82
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,210
while a lot of securities just presence,
just people seeing you,

83
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,530
seeing you with your dick taking your
hand. He had his gun in his hand.

84
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,870
I feel bad for them. Don't feel bad.
Just hear those sleigh bells ringing.

85
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,070
Link, tink, tink tingling too. He's
like, you know a homeless child.

86
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,780
Come on and rub one out.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,190
Fucking cheerleader or to keep
the rubbing. Keep the rubber wild.

88
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:37,720
Everyone watches. Oh my
God. That poor bastard.

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,420
A tweet that this person has Sunday, man.
I Dunno. Can you stay focused here? Yes.

90
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,530
I'm trying to tell you my, can I tell you
my story today? I went out. I went into,

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,740
well, you don't have to be here. What
do we watch it on? TV. Nia. It's the,

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,240
it's The Washington capitols first.
The Philadelphia. Oh wait, no, I don't.

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,640
You said chargers.
Don't know Philadelphia fucking fly.

94
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,330
Why is this is rivalry Wednesday?
That's Wayne Simmons. I can't get up on,

95
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,860
have my feet up and I'm pregnant
and I'm the size of a house.

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,850
That's why I'm here. No, you're not.
You look like an Igloo more than a house

97
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,680
that's, do you look like asshole? Oh,
just the shootout. What do you think of?

98
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,940
Oh, that was a nice movie. He had
them tuning, skipped off his stick.

99
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,050
I don't like to fly. I don't like the
gold numbers on that. While you fly.

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,580
He's got such a great uniform that
kind of fucks it up a little bit.

101
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,940
You know somebody's got to buy it.
You know that guy just paints his room.

102
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,900
Fucking orange and white little
biggest fan ever. You know, you know,

103
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,280
if you dedicate your whole bedroom, you
know painting it, your team colored.

104
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,160
There's no way you can judge that kid on
the charges because you definitely wear

105
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:50,990
slacks and you rub one out in
public. Oh sheet. Just fuck you.

106
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,730
That was a fuck you. I don't respect you
as a goaltender. Didn't even do a move.

107
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,640
He just stared at him and was like,
this is going in the net bitch.

108
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:03,390
And that's exactly what the fuck
capital of this Jesus Christ. Yeah.

109
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,750
Led on in you right there
Fred. Fuck you. That's one.

110
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,540
Nothing in over time. Oh,
sorry. Two, two. All right,

111
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,430
here comes another flag comes down.
He dipsy Oh, little head go out.

112
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,620
Too many fucking Moe's. See
what he did? Claude Euro.

113
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,770
I liked,
I love the head fake in hockey.

114
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,620
I mean it works in basketball and
fucking if you're a wide receiver,

115
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,790
but as you're gliding and it just never
seems to work. Uh, he stayed home.

116
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,160
He stayed home. All right. No one wants
to listen to this shit. So anyway,

117
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:35,150
so I go to target today. You literally
just had your arm over your eyes.

118
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,750
Like it was the most torturous thing ever
to listen to them exhausted. You know,

119
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm fucking tired. Thought said. Yeah.

120
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,990
I have friends way faster than you
and they're doing much more stuff.

121
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,890
I don't know what you're
complaining about.

122
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,540
I have so few friends that
have like morbidly obese. Okay.

123
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,330
And they're more active than you are.
I think you're being a little dramatic.

124
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,990
I they just dating life.
Mm.

125
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,690
I Dunno what just dating means.

126
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,850
Do they have another human being in
Jesus yells at Nice Go. Holy Shit.

127
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:11,090
Taking all their for the mis,
sucking all of their energy.

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,353
Ah Do they have,

129
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,440
they're increasing their blood flow and
their water retention and there exists

130
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,100
no, but they probably have a woman in
their life. Fucking Yammer and Adam,

131
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,770
that was a goal. I didn't think
I put the fucking number of,

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,620
I don't want to be a part of this podcast.
You don't?

133
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,580
No I don't cause I don't like your
attitude right now. Oh okay. I'm sorry.

134
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,470
How about this,
you know Nia,

135
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,240
what you're doing right now is one of the
most special things that has ever been

136
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:42,140
done on the planet.
Granted most of the people on the planet,

137
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,890
we'll do it at some point cause more.
Most people are women, you know,

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,140
and gas don't like wearing, it's sorry.

139
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,910
Um, all right, so I go to
target today. Well Jesus Christ,

140
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,190
Wade Simmons.
When you told me that earlier,

141
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:03,000
I just couldn't even imagine you
going into target on your own accord.

142
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,180
It just didn't seem like something that
was buying you a Christmas gift from

143
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,680
target. Yeah. From target. And I
couldn't walk and find what I wanted.

144
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,350
Why are you buying me? Oh, you know what?
Let me stop cause I'm about to sound.

145
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:17,360
Really? Yeah. You're going to
sound like what you are. Well,

146
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm an asshole to twos. The final score.
What? I'm fucking old. I can't see what,

147
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:25,300
what's the uh,
the overtime score we have to get,

148
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,840
we have one in our eyes
examined this year.

149
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,910
I mean 2017 we both have to
go to the optometrist. Listen,

150
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,980
I think we have enough
activities together.

151
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:37,830
I already went to the optometrist
activity. It's together. Yeah,

152
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,610
it's not an activity I'd already got.
I got fucking four and I fly.

153
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:46,050
I got glasses so I can see the radio
channels like glass. I Gladstone,

154
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,310
I got the, I got the half moon things
where like I'm regular. I'm a freak.

155
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm regular. I'm a freak. Bye Bye
bifocal. Yeah. I don't know what they are.

156
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,320
Yeah, they fucking great. I've
never seen you in these glasses.

157
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,360
It's cause you won't fly with me.
Your baby fly with me.

158
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,030
I'll take you over the ocean.

159
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,090
I did fly with you and we'll see some
people sitting on some surfboards as they

160
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,850
wait for a fucking wave way.
You fly with me,

161
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,900
I'll fly you over the Santa Monica Pier.

162
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,900
I did the whole snapchat story of it.
Yeah,

163
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,720
but she won't go unless I'm with
an instructor. Of course. Well,

164
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,640
that right then all that does is
motivate me knees. You're a comedian.

165
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:30,570
You're a pilot. You're a comedian.
That's like saying, I'm a comedian.

166
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,960
I don't have a license to
drive a car. No, it isn't.

167
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,260
What do you mean it's the same thing?
I'm not a professional driver.

168
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,440
I don't drive at the Indy 500 I
don't fly for American Airlines.

169
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,230
You get me in a Robinson
22 where the old 44 they,

170
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,580
I'll take you for a fucking ride legally.
Okay?

171
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,820
I don't know if I have enough hours
for 44 but the 22 with the two sita

172
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,450
[inaudible]. You can try this fucking
woman thing that you guys all do.

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,580
Did fucking thing that yanking on the
fucking range that you guys all do.

174
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:06,090
Anytime you see a guy doing something
new, you got to have that. Hmm. Well,

175
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,300
he thinks he fair, but he's, you'll
always shitting on our fucking hobbies.

176
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,780
That's what you guys do. I would love
for you to get a hobby. Excuse me.

177
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,610
You know what? I'm going to get
you. I'm going to get you a fight.

178
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:18,000
Listen to me when I speak.
I am the man in this relationship.

179
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,570
I'm going to get you a week
would whittle and shit.

180
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm not shitting on your hobbies.

181
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:27,441
I'm just saying like I would feel more
secure with there is a person there who

182
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:32,040
is a professional flying with us.
Fair enough. That's so bad. It isn't.

183
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,190
It's fair enough. But there's a this
also part of it is that it motivates me,

184
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,710
motivates me. That's all. Okay, well
all right. See you then. Okay. Wow.

185
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,060
What does that, what do you want me
to do for me? You always say that.

186
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:47,640
What do you want from me? Hey,
what do you want for, you know,

187
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,990

191
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,040

I eat when Patrick Swayze sat on Whoopi.

195
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,670
Oh, uh, God made up pot plants.

196
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,110
Well, I'll get it. I'll get it. You're
confused. Patrick Swayze. No, no.

197

parts with me while singing the sound

202
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,380
track to another Patrick Swayze movie.

No, his comb. No, he wasn't.

206
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,320
And there's a body by the train tracks
and then stand by me. Was He in San Miami?

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,160
Yeah, he played more than me and guys with

This is you describing everybody
in Donald's Leonardo Dicaprio,

212
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,020
but it's a a river Phoenix. That one's
too sad. So I'm not going to do that one.

213
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,030
And then the other guy, hey, I'm going
to fucking talking about Jerry O'connell.

214
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,240
Then there's the other dude, right?
Who does the thrill dance still right?

215
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,660

when this stupid fucking day.

218
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,080
I feel like you're talking
about Corey Feldman.

219
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,400
He was not in stand by me that
he was, was he? I usually was.

220
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,330
He was the dude with the fucked up here.
Who wanted to fight with the glasses.

221
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,100
Oh yeah. Yeah. I liked
him. Hmm. Today would go.

222
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,430
Originally you were talking about ghosts
and then you started singing the song

223
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,500
from dirty dancing.
Don't tell me cause I'm going to get it.

224
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,850
I'll get it by the end of the podcast.
Um,

225
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:11,601
you know,

226
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:16,601
one of my goals in 2017 I'm going to get
a fake id fake id for all this fucking

227
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,460
times. You know, you, I'm on the road. I
want to use the gym and they will come.

228
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,650
You need an ID and they want to
take a fucking copy of my life.

229
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,570
Do you know how to fake id is
illegal, right? I'm going with,

230
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
my name's going to be
frank. Falucia. Yeah,

231
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,650
I like alliteration. Bill Burr, Frank
Volusia, right. Teddy. Pendegrass.

232
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,650
All right, well, so I go and do, um,

233
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,950
I go into target to buy you a gift
that evidently you're up above.

234
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,610
I was going to get you a flat
off right next to the bicycles

235
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,110
targets so fucked up. Like, what do you
guys want to be? I don't like target.

236
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,080
They're like that person who just
morphs themselves into what you,

237
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,590
they think you want them to be so they
can be friends with you. It's just like,

238
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:03,480
pick a fucking angle.
It's like you walk in,

239
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,390
you're looking at TVs in there
next to cereal. Like what the fuck?

240
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,770
Like, this is like a fucking yard
sale, but everything's new. Um,

241
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,910
all right, so I go into target and I'm
looking for your fucking shit and every,

242
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,370
you know it's funny about target as
everybody looks like they work there.

243
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:25,130
So you got to ask like nine fucking
people. Hey do you work here?

244
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,940
And they get all offended but you look
like you do. Don't find the clothes here.

245
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,870
You asshole if they're wearing a red
shirt, they work at target. Yeah,

246
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,090
but there's different levels.
It's like the military.

247
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,210
There's different kinds of red shirts
does the people with the Pete Carroll

248
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,660
dockers and then the red shirt
tucked in there like management.

249
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,860
Then there's the grumpy,

250
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:46,040
filthy people who got to like fucking
unload the trucks all day and they never

251
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,710
let them go home.
They're not going to answer this shit.

252
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,000
And then there's sort of dumpy
women walking around like, I dunno,

253
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,110
I dunno what they're thinking.

254
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,980
Like they took a pot cookie and every
once in a while you meet that one that's

255
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:01,820
on the ball. Who's not going to be there
long skull. Oh, I thought that was new.

256
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,230
Sorry.
That's a highlight.

257
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,980
That was a nice fucking wrap around goal.
Oh, you got to love the wrap around.

258
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,800
Oh, he saved it. He didn't saved that
fucking thing. Did he? That's a goal.

259
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,663
That's a goal.

260
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,110
I would love to review the fuck
employee sleuths so like as I'm leaving,

261
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
I bought you a high end gift.
They're at target, right?

262
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,340
I bought you a floral apron with a
frozen burrito in the pocket and um,

263
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,920
I got to keep it in the freezer until
right before twas the night before

264
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,390
Christmas and all through the house.

265
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,400
Not a creature was stirring except for
this bald freckled fuck taking a frozen

266
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:47,570
burrito. I'm sticking it in the stock.
And by the way, underrated stockings,

267
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,840
stockings. I don't know about you guys.
Like, I don't know. Some people are like,

268
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:53,240
they start with the stockings.
Other people,

269
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:56,720
we always end on the stocking and the
stockings always liked the bump. Bump,

270
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:59,330
a bomb. Damn. Like you're
already got your cool gift.

271
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,600
Then you go over to the stocking and
it's like a, it's like a, you know,

272
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,930
a gift certificate to a book club and
you've got to sit there acting like,

273
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,070
oh yeah, thank you. I get to read.

274
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,910
Awesome. What else is in
here? Oh, new socks. I mean

275
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,890
[inaudible] you shouldn't have literally,

276
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,570
and I would rather wear one stock and
walking down the street in a pair of gold

277
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,310
toed socks just because
of what they represent.

278
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,290
There's a lot of blood and shame on
all those gold toed socks. You know?

279
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,910
Do you have any hookers?

280
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,230
Have laid on motel rooms in the last
thing that they saw was somebody bloody

281
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:39,530
gold toed sock walking towards them.
So bad,

282
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,580
so bad during the holiday season.
Silver Bells.

283
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,690
If you leaving your family going to
get oh hooker while the goose cools.

284
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,540
Double Life.
Serial killer.

285
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Cops show up one day and you confess to
40 other killings and your wife says,

286
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,060
who the fuck are you?
What did I do with the last three decades?

287
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,100
And you stare at her with
no feeling behind your eyes.

288
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,970
I really got you. Go on this one,
man. Nini. Yeah, egging me on here.

289
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,950
I like your dark holiday here on,
cause I hate that song.

290
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,870
I hate silver bells. It
just goes on for, it's like,

291
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:38,470
it's just song on a fucking loop.
There's no way. This is one song. Oh,

292
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,470
did fucking fish record this fucking
thing? It's like 20 minutes long that um,

293
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,590
silver bells and I hate Jingle Bell Rock.

294
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,520
It's just such an attempt of like white
people trying to be here. You know,

295
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,010
we're going to, jazz is one, a
jingle bell, Jingle Bell Rock. Hey,

296
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:56,844
jingle bells.

297
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,400
It's that thing where you kind of just
shaking your head and your ass at the

298
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,940
same time. You know, as you're snapping
your fingers with your fucking loafers,

299
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,890
that's when somebody,
you know,

300
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,710
if you're at a party and there's a
piano and somebody knows how to play,

301
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:14,160
they're going to sing that at
the holidays, you know? Oh yeah.

302
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,130
And then there's going to be the
undersexed fucking 20 year old,

303
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,150
20 years married chick with the red
wine teeth always start dancing.

304
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
And it's like, all right, I am, I going
to get her out of here, get a coke,

305
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,090
send her home. I just don't
know why they stay together. Um,

306
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,730
so I'm leaving target.

307
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm leaving target and a
sky looks fucking confused.

308
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,470
He was getting interviewed here. Huh. Um,

309
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,960
so I'm leaving target
and as I'm walking out,

310
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,420
all of a sudden I just hear
this guy go on, get off me.

311
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,800
And I look over and there's two target
ladies there at the Pete Carroll level of

312
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,590
the target thing and a in a,
in a target guy.

313
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,990
Two women and a guy are just fucking
grabbing this dude and they're dragging

314
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,040
them into like this windowless office
and the guys going, this isn't illegal.

315
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,290
And they just drag and
amended. Everybody's just
watching like what the fuck?

316
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,590
And then like the door starts to close
and then it all fucking closes again.

317
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,733
And then,
and then,

318
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,950
and then they finally got him to
calm down and they closed the door.

319
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,800
And this older manager just
close the door and he did that.

320
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,650
You know it's smile you do when you
walk by a stranger because you hope that

321
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:28,480
they don't have an ax. You know that
little purse lip, what you Kinda do?

322
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,850
You lift your eyebrows up. He kind of did
that like well that's the end of that.

323
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,580
And it's like that's an
American citizen in there, sir.

324
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,940
What the fuck just happened?
But nobody said anything cause its target.

325
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:43,920
You just don't expect it.
So I said to the lady next to me,

326
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:47,740
I go, did he steal something? And
she goes, no, I don't think so.

327
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,440
And then somebody else goes,
I think he's autistic.

328
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:55,280
And he was acting a little weird.
They dragged them into yeah,

329
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,760
there's bombing the back room.
Yeah. I don't think that that's,

330
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,540
it doesn't make sense.
Does it make sense?

331
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:06,541
But I feel like why would they take
it upon themselves to drag him away?

332
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:07,930
Why wouldn't they call the police?

333
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,710
I know it looked like that Scientology
show that you're watching that the stuff

334
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,950
that they do to people except
it was at target. You know,

335
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,340
I wonder if one of those people
are going to do a two t v show,

336
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,830
exposing target and what?
What really goes on there?

337
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,020
They probably wanted him to work all
three shifts on Christmas and he said no,

338
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,130
they just dragged him in there. They
don't fuck around at target. I guess not.

339
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,700
Are you fucking kidding me? Did that guy
just score from the other side of that?

340
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm just watching the highlights.
It's pathetic. And that was it.

341
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,050
And that was the end of a,

342
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:46,051
and then I just sort of walked out and I
have to admit any rolls of paper towel.

343
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes. Merry Christmas, Nia.

344
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm expecting a lot of big
tears next year. Big Tears.
Big Tears. Yeah, that's me.

345
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm somebody who was, I should probably
read some advertising here. I'm like,

346
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,520
Oh this is fun. What a great
night. We got the fire going. Oh,

347
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,580
tell them how much I like Eggnog.
A lot of people don't like Eggnog.

348
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,800
I like you love Eggnog.
I love it now too.

349
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,330
Well what it is is always shy
about it. Cause I was like, yeah,

350
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,380
I don't know if it's my thing,
but it's delicious. Yeah,

351
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:18,950
but people pour you a giant fucking glass
of it. It's, it's like in a, it's a, uh,

352
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,300
like a, what do they not an aphrodisiac.
What do they say? What's that shit?

353
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,830
You're drinking Italy. FTA.
FTA. Yeah. That's what it is.

354
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,350
But was shortages Steve as a
digestif you have a big meal.

355
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,500
You sip on a little egg. Nog
No, he's like melted ice cream

356
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,353
and I like it.

357
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,290
Wait, hold up. The podcast where
I type in my fucking pot. Yes.

358
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,190
It tastes like milk in it.
Melted ice cream. And I like it.

359
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,910
I know. I'm sorry. Guests and that.

360
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,510
I'm sorry because I spelled stocking that
look right to me now when I look back

361
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,780
and I'll be the dumbest
person ever. S t o l, K, I n,

362
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:58,810
g of stocking stuffers.
Underrated.

363
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,360
Let's see, I wrote some ideas. Silver
Bells, kid jerking off Christmas break.

364
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,950
Stoeckle Stouffer's underrated. Oh. Oh.

365
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,780
This is the one I wanted
to talk about when I was,

366
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,670
I went into best buy afterwards.
Oh,

367
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:16,970
I was hitting all the corporations
and I'm standing in line,

368
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,110
this pathetic line of fucking people
just waiting till the last minute to shop

369
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,370
or all fucking hate in life.
And I'm still, you know,

370
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,100
and you're going through like the Disney
world line where you got to fucking go

371
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,510
all the way back and forth,
back and forth.

372
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,890
So I'm standing on final last rung and
this guy walks up to stand in line behind

373
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:36,940
18 people. You know what is
t shirts said do epic shit.

374
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,920
First of all, what kind of a
fucking adult? Where's that
stupid fucking tee shirt?

375
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,810
Why would you wear it going to
stand in line at best buy, right? I,

376
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,860
that's a new fucking thing with people.

377
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:55,740
Try to motivate people with their
workout videos and shits, like kill them.

378
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,510
You know, like they're doing it
for you. Like what am I supposed,

379
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:00,950
when I see that guy with
that t shirt like wow,

380
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,370
that guy's doing epic shit in
standing in line at best buy. No,

381
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,600
he's taking a break.
He just,

382
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:08,540
he was doing that point break shit
earlier out in Santa Monica League.

383
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,530
You've got helicoptered out.

384
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,770
Just some sort of fucking a
burning man out in the ocean.

385
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:15,110
Whatever they do when they know
big waves coming, you know,

386
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,100
everybody else runs for cover. They
go, we got to go right out at it. Man.

387
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,630
It's another Patrick Swayze movie.
Yes it is. I saw the remake of it.

388
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:28,070
I enjoyed it, you know? Oh
yeah. Wasn't about surfing.

389
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,280
It's not about anything.
It's like fast and furious.

390
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,370
It's just about fucking fast
and furious is about the cars.

391
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
A point break is about, you know, the
stunt man and everybody do. You know,

392
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,180
in the flying squirrel suits in riding
waves and shit. That's all it's about,

393
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,220
you know? Yeah. I've
never seen that movie.

394
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:51,140
I possibly hot women with mysterious
attitudes who can't walk a straight line

395
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:55,260

the other. It always in some rainy alley

Gordon Gary Oldman. Okay.

He was in, it was based on a
jacket by the professional. No, no,

this was before that dude did fucking
boogie nights. He's on, he's on,

415
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,680
he's on a adult swim. He's in like in
every fucking movie teak played chest,

416
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:21,290
Roswell bronzy rarely John C. Reilly,

417
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,560
when he gets his throat slit and just
Christ. So long, long fucking way to go.

418
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,580
That's the same fucking alley where all
those women get fucked in all those,

419
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,540
those movies, you know.
Okay. All right. What was,

420

they make the make the pot

421
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,310
unchained melody.
Whoa,

whoa. Oh they played that
song. Whether I'm making a pot.

423
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,950
No wonder I never fucking could
get through that movie Darlene.

424
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,950
I just felt your head going down on
my shoulder while the movie's on.

425
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:57,780
Just I hate when women do that.

426
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,540
I always hated when I was on a date
and you deliberately took them to some

427
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:04,050
fucking schmaltzy shit cause you knew
they wanted to see it and then it comes

428
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:07,380
that stupid fucking moment in the movie.
Whatever. What's the Siren Song? Go?

429
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,730
It's 16 rally.
Just sing the song while I tell you what.

430
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,191
All right.
And then you fill,

431
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:18,840

under your shoulder and you know,

you're kind of excited cause
she's becoming intimate.

433
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,630
But there's another party that
just wants to fucking do a tie.

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,630
Domi did the all Samuelson when they
were standing in front of the net.

435
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,610
All right,

So you get genes that would cost you
hundreds of dollars starting at 65 bucks.

486
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,680
How do they do it? By

I swear to God,

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,750
I cannot believe you haven't learned
how to pronounce this word yet. Shut up.

know if I ever told you this.

516
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,430
You're unique. You don't. You are.
You don't walk like everyone else.

517
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,530
Talk like everyone sounds

I teach you to walk like everyone else.

Talk like everyone shoot shit
or sleep like anyone else.

520
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:10,970
So why is your mattress
one size fits all well,

521
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:14,270
because there's an average height of
human beings. They're mass produced.

522
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,850
It's a cost effective thick.
All right?

523
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:20,630
Because it truly customized mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks right

The questions they're gonna ask you.

527
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,550
You know you actually have a unique body.
You don't have the ball,

528
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,840
can you balls hang up and over your leg.
Okay.

529
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,950
This bed mattress is going to
have to be a little wider there.

530
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Run a three D biomechanical model of your
body through the proprietary algorithm

531
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,170
they develop with the help of the world's
leading era Gomix and biomechanics.

532
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,900
Say this is the fucking Illuminati
mapping your whole body is these is where

533
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,400
entity beg for you, Huh? Yeah, they
are. What is Arab era genomics?

534
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:02,710
What does that mean?
Ergonomics.

535
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:07,120
Isn't that like how you have
a chair that's Eric denomic
Lee, correct. Like it's,

536
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,070
it's good for your back.

537
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:12,580
Like it supports all your back and like
the proper way all your vertebrae and

538
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:15,040
stuff.
Isn't that what it means?

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,640
What is biomechanics
mean? Oh, I have no idea.

540
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,840
I mean mechanics are mechanics.
Bio,

541
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,760
it was like biology. So the
mechanics of the body, whoo.

542
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,800
That's probably what it means.
I'm like,

543
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,710
you sound like the fifth family member
on family feud when all the good answers

544
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:41,620
are gone and you just say
some dumb shit and like, hey,

545
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,400
you're right. Show me mechanics.
Set works in Bios. Actually,

546
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:50,800
the biomechanics, they both sounded
right to me, but I'm a morning.

547
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,110
He customers report at 30%

How do you know you were asleep? And for
couples, they customize each matches.

549
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,440
See the sign of the matches though?

550
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,730
You're gonna talk about fucking your Magis
arrived into or for a couple of lady,

551
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,410
you bang on this fucking thing.

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,730
I'm coming 30% faster.

553
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,720
Your mattress arrives at your door and

suits with those giant,

568
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,070

deal for that game or show you want to go

571
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,640
to. And none of those older
tickets sites want to change that.

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,170

585
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,070
yes, this is one of my favorite times
of year because I get to, you know,

586
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,020
hang at home for once,
you know,

587
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:17,270
sit by the fire and I got
all the sports packages, uh,

588
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,200
asked me if I got the NHL
Center ice package. I, yes, I do

589
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,640
ask me if I got the NBA hardcore,
whatever the fuck they call it of Cory.

590
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,520
I got that too.
Okay.

591
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,210
And asked me if I got NFL
Sunday ticket. Yes, I do.

592
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,800
I got all three so I can watch my
patriots, myself, sticks and my Bruins.

593
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,620
And what I've noticed with the
Celtics and the Bruins. Okay.

594
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,220
If the Celtics Luiz Isaiah Thomas,

595
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,870
it's fucking over.

596
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,110
They lose like they lost like fucking
three in a row and he comes back and all

597
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:54,390
of a sudden when that Memphis
game was fucking incredible.

598
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,830
But my DVI shut off with like five seconds
of going over time. I think we want,

599
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,620
um,
and then the Bruins,

600
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,100
if Chiron goes down where that spend the
thing the whole time though. But um, um,

601
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,110
you know what? I've been
bitching about Michael O'connell.

602
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,410
When you rebuild a team,
it takes at least two to three seasons.

603
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:14,910
So we'll see which direction he's going
in. I don't know. I don't fucking know.

604
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:18,300
But it's been tough to watch in
this year cause I love him and uh,

605
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,770
and I loved a lot of the guys they got
rid of and it's hard watching them on

606
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,660
other teams doing fucking great,
you know,

607
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,310
I know there's a salary
cap and all that shit.

608
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:30,180
I'm going to quit fucking
pitching. Um, so anyways,

609
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,900
I guess that's the podcast here
near you're gonna fall asleep.

610
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,650
I don't know. Oh, Jesus. Well, you know,

611
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,210
I'm glad I knocked this thing out before
you fell asleep. Um, everybody had them.

612
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:48,040
I got no energy. It's all right. Everybody
have a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

613
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Happy Hanukkah. Happy Kwanzaa.
Happy holidays. Jewish people.

614
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:56,290
I help you have the best fucking
Chinese food. That sounds great though.

615
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,750
Not spend it all that fucking cash.
You just have Chinese food.

616
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:02,560
Go to a fucking movie. Uh, Greg, does that
sound? That sounds great. I liked that.

617
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,330
I think we ought to add that celebration

618
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,810
on the 26th right? We'll do that.
[inaudible] Christmas, everybody.

619
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,930
That's it. Happy New Year. I'll
talk to you on Monday anyways,

620
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,660
but I hope you guys all have a happy,
safe one and all that stuff.

621
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:20,290
And I thank you for everybody
who's been listening all year. Uh,

622
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,900
it is a privilege to do this.
All right, go fuck yourselves.

623
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,190
Get conscious and I'll talk
to you on Monday. Yeah.

624
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,953
[inaudible]

625
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,980
[inaudible] you can,

626
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,880
you can sit around and wait for the call.
You're

627
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,340
waiting for someone. Yeah. You will

628
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,930
sit around and wonder what to mom,
Dad,

629
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,830
uh,
uh,

630
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,253
uh,

631
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,603
[inaudible] [inaudible]

632
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,140
[inaudible] Ah, Fuck Huh.

633
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,463
Uh

634
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,543
Mmm.

635
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,890
Happy holidays.

636
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,900
It's the Monday morning podcast.

637
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:40,280
I do like that little second grader
fucking recital. It was horrible.

638
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,840
I thought I was going to get through it
in one take. I should have been asking.

639
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:46,700
I shouldn't,
that's like the kind of guitar playing.

640
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,500
You hear it a benefit and whatever the
benefit is like whatever the disease it's

641
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:55,730
for.
Like if that guitar playing,

642
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:59,990
like I would have the disease that you
guys were raising money for and then in

643
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:02,570
the end they wheeled me out
and they'd be like, Hey,

644
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,470
here's a guy who has the disease that
we're trying to stop and now he's going to

645
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:09,410
play the guitar for you.
That's how I just played the guitar.

646
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,060
But I don't give a fuck. You
know, I can't help it, you know,

647
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:19,110
I can't help it if I'm fucking not even
gonna say multitalented it's not the

648
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,890
word. What's the reverse
of multi one dimensional.

649
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,560
I can't help it if I'm a one trick pony.
Anyways,

650
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:29,150
this is the Monday morning
podcasts for the, uh, uh,

651
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,870
the week of Christmas,
which is why I had my little recital.

652
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,320
Um, you know what's hilarious is last
year, um, besides my guitar playing,

653
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,150
um, it was last year I took
off, I didn't do a podcast on

654
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,650
the week of Christmas or the week of new
years and everyone thought it was cause

655
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,570
I, you know, I was taking
a vacation or whatever.

656
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:55,490
But the reality is is because I was
traveling and holiday travel sucks.

657
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,140
So as many of you know, this year, I
was like, you know what? Fuck this.

658
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,060
Fuck everybody.

659
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,230
I'm not going home for the holidays
because I'm not dealing with that planes,

660
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,430
trains and automobiles shit.
And I gotta tell you, man,

661
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,550
the smartest goddamn thing I ever did.
I don't what that says about me,

662
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:17,180
but I'm not spending it with my family
and I am absolutely fucking elated.

663
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,210
You know,
I'm not saying I don't like my family,

664
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,950
I'm just saying I don't need to go see
them when everyone else is going to go

665
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:29,720
see their family because,
uh, because it sucks.

666
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,670
I had a buddy of mine to,
you know,

667
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,160
trying to fly back east with
all this snow and all this shit.

668
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,920
He's down in Orange County calling me up.

669
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,190
That same situation I was in last year.
Do you believe?

670
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,310
Did really please go to two blue,
blue, blue, blue, blue. And I was like,

671
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:49,760
thank God,
thank God I made the right choice.

672
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,530
Fucking excited. I got a
Christmas tree. I got stockings,

673
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:00,690
I got a Ukulele. I mean, what more do
you need? What more do you fucking neat.

674
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,160
I don't know. Some inner peace maybe, but
I don't want to get greedy. Um, I'm, I'm,

675
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:09,620
I'm two inches away from
getting a dog. People, I know,

676
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,750
I've said it for about
two years on this podcast,

677
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:15,230
even though I've only been doing them for
a little over a year, I'm freaking out.

678
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm terrified to get a dog because
I'm like, you know, what, if, uh,

679
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,950
what if I want to take off for a
couple of days? I mean, I don't,

680
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,490
I've never had to take care of
anything in my life, you know, and uh,

681
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,590
never been at a movie going,
Oh my God,

682
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,260
what if it's taking a shit
in my living room? You know?

683
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,390
I don't want to be thinking that,

684
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,540
especially at this time of year when
there's all these great movies are out,

685
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,210
you know, speaking of which, um,

686
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,080
somebody sent me a great email and said,

687
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,960
we'll get back to the dog thing.
I want to get a dog.

688
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,680
And if I get a dog and getting a fucking
bulldog and I'm going to a breeder,

689
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,300
I know a lot of people, oh my God,
you should rescue a dog. You know,

690
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,350
I don't have time for you. Do you
understand me? That's your cause.

691
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,360
You go down there and you, you, you
get all those, you get all those dogs,

692
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,480
you'd go down and you get them that I've
already learned how to fetch and they

693
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:13,380
just completely over everything.
Nothing's exciting anymore.

694
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,780
You know what I mean?
I mean,

695
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,900
why don't I just pick up a fucking
divorce waitress with three kids that hate

696
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:21,330
her, you know? And, and
bring that into my life.

697
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:25,590
And I'll just surround myself with people
who are just fucking over everything.

698
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,420
You know? Sometimes I, Hey, I just
really say stupid shit. I don't,

699
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:33,420
I don't feel any of that. You know
what? I went down to the shelter,

700
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:36,830
I wanted to rescue all the dogs and
I don't fucking know. I don't know.

701
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,650
I'm talking about,

702
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,670
I'm just trying to kill time people as
I'm trying to find that thing about the

703
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:44,280
movie reviews. Yeah. Somebody sent
me an email and they said, hey bill,

704
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:46,800
I haven't heard movie
your views in awhile.

705
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,130
Now some of my longtime
listeners of the podcast,

706
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,510
remember we used to have people write in
because I went and I saw a shitty movie

707
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:55,830
one time and I was pissed at,
you know,

708
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:59,970
I lost my 10 bucks or whatever
the fuck that charging now. Um,

709
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,230
so people started, you know,
thrown in that 2 cents. So
here's some movie reviews.

710
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,190
This guy said,

711
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,390
punisher war zone and
he gives it three stars.

712
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,710
Punish your war zone.
What the fuck is that? Um,

713
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,250
evidently he says there's tons of
over the top violence and shooting.

714
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,640
It doesn't try to be realistic at all.
Like the last one,

715
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,830
the first punisher warzone tried to be
real. That's funny with that name. Uh,

716
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:30,570
the story was very basic
with no real twist. You know
what? I can appreciate that.

717
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,570
Okay. So it's like commando.
They fucked with them.

718
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,800
He got in his Bronco and he kicks
ass and then he wins. I like it.

719
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,310
I'm going to, I'm, you know
what, I'm not going to go see it,

720
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:44,190
but I will watch it on. Um, that'll
be the new part of the movie reviews.

721
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:46,380
I'll let you know if I'm going to
see it. I'm going to see that. Okay.

722
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,870
You guys still filled?
Now does this make any holidays?

723
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,630
I'm going to go see punish your
warts and, all right, I'm gonna,

724
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,640
I'm gonna sit on my fucking huge
couch and I'm going to watch it. Um,

725
00:46:56,641 --> 00:47:00,690
the next review he did, the day the earth
stood still, he gave it three stars.

726
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,260
Guys, very, uh, he's very
liberal with the stars here.

727
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,430
Some people who are in the theater with
me were pissed at it when it ended,

728
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,860
but it's a remake and I
knew it was going to happen.

729
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,630
It isn't really supposed to be an over
the top independent stay blockbuster.

730
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:17,430
It's more story oriented.

731
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,630
And there was some surprise stars that
I didn't know were in it like so and so

732
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:25,200
and so and so. Well thanks for
ruining it for me. And I give a fuck.

733
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,980
I'm not really into those cameos. I hate
when people get excited about cameos.

734
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,920
[inaudible] time cruise kid had,
I had no idea he was in it. Yeah.

735
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,190
What'd be more surprising if like
one of your relatives walked in?

736
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,850
It's not like Tom Cruise isn't an actor.
You know,

737
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,910
it's not like he hasn't been
doing movies for 25 years.

738
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,170
I can't believe that actor all of a sudden
showed up in a movie and was acting.

739
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,300
I was really blown away. Um,
oh, I'm going to pissy mood.

740
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,360
Um, let's see. Oh, this is the
two movies I saw this weekend.

741
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,740
I saw the wrestler with Mickey Rourke,
which was fucking awesome.

742
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,890
And, uh, any, if you're a
fan of wrestling, if you're
a fan of Mickey Rourke,

743
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,700
you got to go see it. He's
fucking great. And, and, uh,

744
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:16,570
they really capture the
more ronic wrestling fan,

745
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,040
which I was perfectly.
And then I also saw that movie,

746
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,940
I'm milk starring Sean
Penn as Harvey Milk.

747
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,940
And I got to admit,
I was shying away from that movie.

748
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,880
I wanted to go see it because
I love Sean Penn, but every,

749
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,950
a male friend of mine was
saying, I was like, yeah,

750
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:38,830
I want to go see that movie milk. Uh,
did you see it? And they'd be like, yeah,

751
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:42,160
I saw it, but I just to warn
you, a lot of male kissing,

752
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,850
which is not a,
uh,

753
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,690
that's not a selling point with
a lot of guys, myself included.

754
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,940
And I was sitting there going, but I've
got to go see it. It's Sean Penn and um,

755
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,140
I don't know, there wasn't
a lot of kissing, but it,

756
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,990
after a while you sort of get used to it,

757
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,190
which I don't know if that's a good thing.
I'm really on the fence about that.

758
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,700
I don't know what the fuck. You
know what I mean? It's weird.

759
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:13,870
If I was on like a youporn or to bait,
and I was watching two guys kissing,

760
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,740
people will be looking at me like, dude,
what the fuck is wrong with you? You know,

761
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,720
what's your deal? You got
something to tell me. I can't
just sit there and be, oh,

762
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:27,220
it's just a porno. You
know, this is a, you know,

763
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,380
this is the, then he go see a movie
and then all of a sudden it's okay,

764
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,880
this is art. This is art. I don't
know. It wasn't that big a deal.

765
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,080
It wasn't an Sean Penn was fucking
unreal. And, uh, it was an amazing,

766
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,290
amazing movie with a lot of male kissing.
You know,

767
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47,080
I gotta admit this the first time I've
seen an amazing movie that had a lot of

768
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,370
male kissing. I think they
started a whole new genre. Um,

769
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,030
so I don't know. You know
what I'm, because I have OCD,

770
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:58,030
I plan on seeing like fucking
nine more movies this week.

771
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,380
There's some mob movie I wanted to go see.
What the fuck was the name of that.

772
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,400
I'm going raise here.
This is Mrs Typical me.

773
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:08,530
Like I haven't seen a movie
in about eight months.

774
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,250
And then I go and I see one movie. Then
I'm like, I'm going to go see everything.

775
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,460
It's like, I don't understand why I
can't. This is why I don't do drugs.

776
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:21,040
I'm going to go see a Gamora, g. O,

777
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,050
m, O, r, r, a. H.

778
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,470
Evidently it's a mob movie
cause I gotta wash off that,

779
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,480
that male kissing to prove to myself in
a cinematic way that I'm still a man.

780
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,840
Um,
I'm going to go see this movie.

781
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,920
Evidently it's a mob movie that kind of
takes away all the Glam of being in the

782
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:42,230
mob. You know what I mean? I
mean, when you watch good fellows,

783
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:46,880
you don't really think like, wow,
thank God I never joined the Mafia.

784
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,570
You know, you, you, you
know you want the cars.

785
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,450
I don't know. You want the fucking, I
dunno. I can't say the women let me,

786
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,180
I'm pretty fucking nasty and good fellas.

787
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,750
You know what it was that girl with a
cold sore just ruins it for every woman in

788
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:05,151
that.

789
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:08,180
Then I just think they all have herpes
and then it just fucking ends it for me.

790
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,080
Can I just miss this up here?
Sorry guys.

791
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:16,040
This is going to be another slow podcast.
Fuck yourselves. I'm on vacation.

792
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,630
All right, let's get to the
podcast question. Sally. Um,
if you new to my podcast,

793
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,660
people send me podcast questions every
single week and I try and answer them to

794
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:30,890
the best of my ability. Um,
so here we go. Podcasts,

795
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:35,930
podcasts came even talk question
number one. Uh, Bill, uh,

796
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:39,320
I have a question for you as
a well-informed hockey fan.

797
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,020
What are your thoughts on the Chicago
Blackhawks chances this season? Um,

798
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,300
also what the fuck? Why the fuck
did the Bruins get rid of Thornton?

799
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,220
Uh, what do they get rid of? Thorton?

800
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,220
Cause they didn't feel like they could
lead them deep into the playoffs.

801
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,770
He played on a Bruins teams that people
felt they didn't have any heart and

802
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,210
cause he was the big paid guy. They
blamed him, which was a, wasn't fair.

803
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,320
All I know is we didn't get shit from,
we didn't get shit for the guy.

804
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:13,100
How do I think the black are going
to do this year? Uh, transition year.

805
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,040
They're not going to do shit.
Speaking of that,

806
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:19,010
let's talk about the New York Yankees
and them throwing their fucking wallet's

807
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:23,150
around. Huh? It's Monday and I've
heard that. I haven't watched ESPN yet,

808
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:26,990
but I heard they had this
close to signing Manny Ramirez.

809
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:30,860
So they signed cc Sabathia
that white dudes from Toronto,

810
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,070
the pitcher and uh,
I dunno,

811
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,030
I fucking love as a red sox fan.
I'm loving every second of it.

812
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,010
That's exactly right. Go ahead and
do the exact same fucking thing.

813
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,300
It's like watching an alcoholic,

814
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:50,530
just making the same fucking mistakes
over and over and over again thinking that

815
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,160
you're going to get a different result.

816
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:57,440
You've had a rod cheater in GMB
just in your fucking in field

817
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,140
for the last five years or whatever.
Or at least Jeter in GMB,

818
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,880
that Combo you had to send me, you
haven't won shit. You haven't won shit.

819
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,170
And Randy Johnson with those three
guys behind them. Plus, I mean,

820
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,640
look at the look at the list to start.
When the Yankees were the shit,

821
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,830
they got it from their farm team.
I don't know.

822
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,120
And then they would pick up these fucking
nerds along the way. Paul O'Neill,

823
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,750
who knew Lee was great. Scott Parotias
Knoblauch, you know, they just,

824
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,210
I don't know.
I don't know what they're doing.

825
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:34,600
They always go out and they get the
fucking big swinging Dick and then you,

826
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,160
you got, you got too much
swinging dick in your clubhouse.

827
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,840
There's, you're not
going to win. You can't.

828
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,430
If it was just that fucking easy,
the Yankees would win it every year.

829
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,910
Wouldn't they look a little bit
over? Not The fucking, the red sox.

830
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,900
Try doing that one year, I remember
that year we got a Eric Gun. Yay.

831
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,190
That guy almost fucked up our whole
season last year we got that big bloated

832
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,200
steroid jackass. Remember
that? And we'd already added a,

833
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:08,250
what's his face there in right field?
I swear to God the second the season as,

834
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:10,530
I can't even remember anybody's
name. I was going to say, Trot Nixon.

835
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,210
Know the new guy a fucking junior. Felix,
what the fuck is his name out there?

836
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,740
The guy everybody says is a cunt and
he doesn't do well during the season.

837
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:22,290
And then he shows, he shows
up in October. That guy,

838
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,090
I thought this the red sox
last year were very, uh, 2007.

839
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,470
We're teetering on that
Yankee esque sort of thing,

840
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,520
but they still had like four or five guys
from their, uh, from their farm team.

841
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,630
I don't understand what the Yankees are
doing, but I hope they keep doing it.

842
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,101
I hope they do it.

843
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:46,101
I hope they have a fucking $500 million
team and they get bounced out in the

844
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:47,671
first round.

845
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:51,660
That's going to be fucking a list of my
favorite part of the year in baseball is

846
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:56,661
when they pan down that Yankee dugout
and you just see one fucking zillionaire

847
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,250
to one hall of Famer after another.

848
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,400
Just fucking sitting there with that
look on their face and like, God,

849
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:10,050
Jesus Christ looks like, well on
all the early again this year.

850
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,160
I don't fucking know. You know, I
don't know. But I will say this,

851
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,570
Manny is what the money and uh,
he's definitely worth the fucking money.

852
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,500
Cc Sabathia only because he's 26,

853
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,570
but I gotta tell you, man, that
guy is built like Bartolo Cologne.

854
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:28,950
All right?

855
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,970
And you can't walk around with that
sack of potatoes hanging right over your

856
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,940
dick for too long before you
started having lower back pain.

857
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:38,700
You can't pitch anymore.
It's like broads with big tits.

858
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,240
They can ride it out to like 35, 37. And
after a while they're like, listen man, I,

859
00:55:43,241 --> 00:55:47,370
I can't go today. I just can't do it.
You know, I'm fucking, my arm is shot

860
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,750
and see under their career and
they get their titties reduced.

861
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,920
So cc Sabathia needs to
stop going to the fucking,

862
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,380
what the fuck would he go
when to cc?

863
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:05,430
Sabathia seeing all of garden guy.
He's got the money though.

864
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,900
I don't know what he's doing.

865
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:10,560
He looks like he just has like one
of those MTV cribs refrigerators.

866
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,720
You know what I mean? When
they got like, you know,

867
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:17,990
they got like a case of fucking cocacola
and every bag of fucking junk food.

868
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,010
You know what?
I'm convinced fat people eat at night.

869
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,580
That's where they get fed because if you
hang out with a fat person, you know,

870
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,890
you hang out with them all day long.
They just sorta eating when you eat. Eh,

871
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,520
maybe they'll get an extra fucking
cheeseburger at Mcdonald's,

872
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,720
but they don't go anything crazy.
I think it's at night, at night,

873
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:41,230
that's when they get up and they just
start going through the cupboards and they

874
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,630
just,
they just start throwing the fuck down.

875
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,440
I think that's what cc Sabathia is going
to be doing on the road with any luck.

876
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,250
Um, I dunno. What the fuck are
you gotta do? Um, what else?

877
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,750
I'm going to keep talking to a sports.
I think I'm going to piss off everybody.

878
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,020
At least half in New York.
You've got so many fucking teams met fans.

879
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:03,760
Probably enjoyed that. What about those
jets? Huh? Can you fucking believe it?

880
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,200
They choked against the Goddamn Seahawks
and they're the patriots right in the

881
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,780
thick of it. And I know what you're
going to say. You can say Bill,

882
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,790
you fucking bandwagon.
Well,

883
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,090
that's bullshit because I got a
bet with the shred and Reagan show,

884
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:18,610
which I'm going to fuck. Fuck, I
didn't call him. It's too late.

885
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,840
The shred and Reagan show out in Buffalo,
New York.

886
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,950
I bet them the fucking week
when Tom Brady went down,

887
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:30,550
Reagan was talking all this shit,
and I hope he's listening to this.

888
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:34,660
He was talking all this shit.
Bill Belicheck is a punk.

889
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,740
He's never one without a superstar
quarterback, Yada, Yada, Yada.

890
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:42,160
All this fucking crap. And I said,
let me tell you something, Reagan,

891
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,680
let me tell you something.
And Reagan,

892
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,100
not only other patriots
can have a winning season.

893
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,690
They are going to fucking
win the division. I called
that after Brady went down,

894
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,580
called the, I bet him 50 bucks. If I
lose, I own 50 bucks. But if I win,

895
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,030
Reagan has to read an,
uh,

896
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,360
an on air apology to build
Bella check that I get to write.

897
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,513
It's going to be great.

898
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,290
Now he negotiated it down to only
six sentences. It can only be,

899
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,960
the apology can only
be six sentences long,

900
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,310
but he's not familiar with
my ability with conjunctions.

901
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,583
All right,

902
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,990
that fucking thing is going to be a page
and a half of what a brilliant coach.

903
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:29,530
Bill Belichick is there. Those guys on
ESPN was saying that Shit, you know,

904
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,160
he's never worn with Dota superstar
quarterback and neither did Vince Lombardi

905
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,500
needed a chuck Noll. Neither the
Tom Landry, neither did Bill Walsh.

906
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,160
Those guys all suck.
Joe Gibbs,

907
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,650
Joe Gibbs never really had
a superstar quarterback.

908
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,320
Doug Williams was a superstar who
just played for the Buccaneers.

909
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,920
You know what I mean? So maybe he did,
but he didn't want mark ripping and

910
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:56,650
Joe financial ties. One was on the
fence. Who's like Apollo Neal level guy.

911
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,320
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about. All I know is next week,

912
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,230
although this is what,
this is what I love about this situation.

913
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:07,150
Next week in New York can actually help
Boston have a great fucking new years.

914
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:12,610
If they can beat the shit out of the
dolphins, if they can show up, huh?

915
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:17,670
Your punk ass team will show up and when
a Goddamn game going out to Seattle and

916
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,190
lose and you guys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, why am I picking on jets?

917
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:26,450
Fans actually feel bad for you guys if you
didn't have man genie, man. Genio like,

918
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,380
all right.

919
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,560
He drove the getaway car all those
fucking years and then he read it out.

920
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:33,740
Bill Belicheck. Oh look, he's robbing
a bank. Dude. You're driving the car.

921
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,100
Shut the fuck up.
Fucking baby.

922
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,850
All right.
Am I even doing questions at this point?

923
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:43,070
I'm just talking shit about sports.
How about those Bruins?

924
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,850
How about those Celtics? Huh? I
didn't need to go home for Christmas.

925
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,560
The fucking Boston teams
of bringing it home for me.

926
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,910
It got the NHL package.

927
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,970
I've only watched the first period
of the Saint Louis Blues game.

928
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,560
Don't ruin it for me. Don't be a spoiler.
All right, question number two. Bill.

929
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,180
What do you think of MTV? Swisher sweet.
Jesus Christ. I can read out loud.

930
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,180
I'm fucking Moron, Bill. Let's go slow.

931
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,950
What do you think of MTVs sweet 16 show

932
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,320
and part two. What did you do
for your sweet 16? All right,

933
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:23,210
what do I think of the sweet 16
show? Uh, it makes me angry. Um,

934
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:26,180
I try to keep my mind that there
are only 16, but I just really,

935
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't like dumb cunts,
you know,

936
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,430
I don't like it when I'm walking down
the street and I'm certainly not going to

937
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,700
watch your show about it. So,
uh, that's how I feel about that.

938
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,400
And what did I do for my sweet 16?

939
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:40,790
I went down to the DMV and
I got my learner's permit.

940
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,430
That's what I did was I was a big deal
for me learning how to drive and, uh,

941
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,680
what did I do? I have no
idea. I have no fucking idea.

942
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:56,150
I don't remember that Shit
fucking 24 years ago. Uh,

943
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,690
number three. I like how I took
that question and literally like,

944
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:02,300
what did you do for your sweet 16, you
know, I guess I was supposed to be like,

945
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:06,740
well, I put ribbons in my hair. I
literally took it like straight up,

946
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:10,400
like I have no idea what I did.
That was 24 years ago.

947
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,640
Well thanks for sucking all the
comedy out of that question, Bill.

948
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,670
Sorry about that. Whoever wrote
that, he sent me up. Beautiful.

949
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:19,370
You loved it over the net and
I took a big swing and a miss.

950
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,410
Kind of like a rod and October. Oh,
he's killing the Yankees. All right.

951
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,963
Nah,

952
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,830
there's somebody right now who already
has a fucking Manny Ramirez poster

953
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:34,910
hanging over his bed.
Fucking Ballston to Townsel fucking lame.

954
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,560
Everything fucking closes you fucking tool
in the fucking morning. What the fuck?

955
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,130
Yeah. We also go out at seven 30
at night and we start drinking.

956
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:47,360
You fucking jackass is still putting
on Cologne at 1130 at night. All right,

957
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:50,060
so fuck you and your city
that opened is open all night.

958
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,040
What a crock of shit that was.
You know what?

959
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:56,120
I'm first moved in New York another time
I took it literally like when they said

960
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:59,450
New York, the city that never
sleeps, it's open all night long.

961
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,770
I thought that meant everything.
Like banks, hardware stores.
You know what I mean?

962
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,640
Like I go, I could buy a lamp at like,
you know, three 30 in the morning.

963
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,480
But no, it does. It does shut down
and people do go to sleep and,

964
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:14,720
but their bars do stay up until four
in the morning. Other than that,

965
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,140
I fucked that. It's the greatest
Goddamn city. It's our Paris.

966
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,460
I'm not even gonna lie to you.
It's fucking awesome. I love it.

967
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,680
But I really don't like their sports
teams. Um, okay. If you didn't notice,

968
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,490
all right,

969
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,520
why don't you get back to the questions
and stop making it so fucking personal

970
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:30,181
with one city.

971
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,300
There's other cities listening and other
countries hello to all the people in

972
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:37,220
England that I've been getting
questions from lately. Um,

973
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm going to be over that next year. You
mother fuckers. Um, so, uh, you know,

974
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,750
I don't know. Whatever it is you do
to get prepared for comedy shows.

975
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,240
What do you do in England?
Do you guys really,

976
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:52,380
pork chops for breakfast actually
watched that show. You are what you eat.

977
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,860
You know, which made me feel a lot better
about how out of shape this country is.

978
01:02:55,861 --> 01:03:00,861
When I saw all those people over there
like you know w what do you start?

979
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,820
You did well I start my day,
I have like,

980
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,660
I have a couple of fry ups and
for you Americans listening,

981
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:11,070
a fry up is rather than just making
it an egg over easy, you know,

982
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:14,610
cooking it and butter fried frying an egg,
they actually,

983
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,140
from what I gather from the
footage, because it's not
like they have the recipe,

984
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:24,141
they pour like cooking oil
into a pot and they boil it.

985
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:27,030
It's almost like you're
poaching an egg in Greece.

986
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,950
So they have like four of those to start
the day. And then they have laid out,

987
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,330
have like these little fucking,
I don't know,

988
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,130
these little pork sandwiches and
they're really big on Indian food.

989
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,440
Why do you guys have so
many Indians over there?

990
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,020
Literally people from India is at the
whole Winston Churchill thing, you know,

991
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,590
that's another book I started
reading and I never got through.

992
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,860
I really wanted to get through that
book so I can sound intelligent at some

993
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:54,010
point. It was a whole book about
the relationship between, oh,

994
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,520
was it Winston Churchill and Gandhi

995
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,770
gets fucking whacked. Just,
you know, it's unbelievable.

996
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,940
All these people out there who think
that they're being dangerous on stage and

997
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:08,340
type of, you know, if nobody's
made an attempt on your life,

998
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,270
you're not saying anything.

999
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:12,510
That's when you know that you're
on stage saying something,

1000
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:16,230
I think is when somebody tries to fucking
shoot you in the back of the head at

1001
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,530
that point. Right. Then
you're saying something,

1002
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,790
but you know enough with
all these dangerous artists.
I really hate that shit.

1003
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:28,080
When people take, they had head
shots and they have like a, you know,

1004
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:31,740
they have like a piece of tape
over their mouth, like, like the,

1005
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:34,410
the government put it, you know,
that piece of duct taping lunch.

1006
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:39,300
Stupid fucking like, Ooh, he's
dangerous. He's doing some spoken word.

1007
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,850
He figured out a word that rhymes with
Illuminati. Everybody run for cover.

1008
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:49,560
He's going to sing a song about the
work and man, you're not dangerous.

1009
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:53,730
Okay, okay. Is he dangerous?
They try to kill you and they do.

1010
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,980
All right. Okay. You know, did
fucking Martin Luther King,

1011
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:03,200
I have a poster of himself with the
fucking, you know, and you know,

1012
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,690
piece of tape over his mouth and shrugging
his shoulder like, ugh. Well eat.

1013
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,020
What did they do? He booked
the good day. All right. Um,

1014
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,690
let's get back to the questions.
Question number three though.

1015
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:20,230
Have you ever been dealing with the
case of the runs all day and had to go

1016
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,450
onstage? Tough it out, cold
sweats, bubbling stomach,
stomach and all, you know,

1017
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:29,200
I love this question as he could have
asked me anything and I would have

1018
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:34,120
answered it. And he just basically
said [inaudible] go on stage and like,

1019
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:38,830
yeah, to take a shit really bad, you
know, like, well what was that like?

1020
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,680
Did that ever happen to me? Uh, yeah,

1021
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:46,030
it's happened to me a number of times and
I've been doing it for almost 17 years.

1022
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,010
Um, I've had an untimely fucking
salad that went right through me.

1023
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,200
Garlic is another thing
I don't do well with.

1024
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,150
And the amazing thing is the second
you go on stage, for the most part,

1025
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,460
it stops, uh, I don't know,

1026
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:05,140
some sort of survival adrenaline thing
kicks in that, uh, just says, oh,

1027
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:08,860
wait a second. We're not shitting.
No, we're not. No, we're not. Okay.

1028
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:10,540
So you just need to
shut down that thought.

1029
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,350
You need to sit there and wait until I'm
done with this stuff that I've had the

1030
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:17,920
hiccups right before I went
on stage going, oh my God,
I have hiccups. What am I,

1031
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,470
what am I going to do in the second
I get out there? They go away.

1032
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,580
I don't know why, but they do. So
yeah, I've, I've had to do that.

1033
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,710
I've heard stories of comedians
literally being onstage,

1034
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,230
stopping the show and just saying, I
have to, uh, I have to lead now. In fact,

1035
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,940
I want to say Dana Gould told a story
like that the other day on the Adam

1036
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,780
Carolla show. Um, I dunno.

1037
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,760
I Dunno. I can't remember. Anyways, let's
get back to the question. Say Shall, okay,

1038
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,420
here we go. Um, let's see. Let's see.
Let's see. Question number four. Bill,

1039
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:53,290
if you could be with
the girl of your dreams,

1040
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:57,250
any girl marry her,
have great sex every night,

1041
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:01,060
everything was great and you were happy,
but you had to sleep with one guy.

1042
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,870
Any guy in the whole rural world,
who would the guy be?

1043
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,340
And who would the girl be?
Great fucking question.

1044
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:13,480
Let's get with the guy. That's
the easy one. That would be, um,

1045
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:17,620
one of those unbelievably
over the top gay guys.

1046
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,950
You know,
those guys who were just like this.

1047
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:28,000
So they're the ones who actually,

1048
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:31,420
they get gay bashed and the reason they
get gay bash, just because there's,

1049
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:34,090
so putting out a female vibe,

1050
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,830
it confuses the mail.
That's why they, you know,

1051
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:43,360
and if you're not, you know, if you're
a psycho, you get so pissed. Like,

1052
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:48,600
why am, why am, why am I
feeling like this? This is a
female. When it's a guy, you,

1053
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,460
you just start punching it because you
don't know how to, I don't know. Well,

1054
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,920
I don't know the motivation behind fucking
gay bash and all I could say, yeah,

1055
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:00,820
I would find the most, uh, over the top,

1056
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:04,090
but not like that dude on willing
grace cause he's still a dude.

1057
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,340
He's just sort of skipping around
I guess the most of feminine.

1058
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,950
I'm trying to think maybe like one
of those, uh, if it's like Filipino,

1059
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,270
some little Asian hairless dude,

1060
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,590
I go that way. You know what
I mean? Yeah. I go that way.

1061
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,410
Um, and if it had to be any girl in the
world, who would it be? Ah, Jesus Christ.

1062
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,260
Um, I dunno. Everybody
goes with somebody famous,

1063
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,990
what would it be? You know what
I want, you know what I do?

1064
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:46,430
I would go back to my
adolescence when I was innocent.

1065
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,310
And you know,
when you back then,

1066
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:53,230
when you actually looked at a girl and
you had like a number that way, that uh,

1067
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:58,160
what the for that Biloxi blues with a
guide just described that that little mini

1068
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:58,911
heart attack,
you know,

1069
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:02,330
when you lean back in a chair at
a couple of girls back in the day,

1070
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:05,540
when I looked at him,
I felt that like that lightening bolt,

1071
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:08,960
which only happens when you're
young, when you get older, you just,

1072
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,690
you just spent through it too many
times. And again, I look at those shoes,

1073
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,350
she probably likes to get
tied up. How old is she? 28.

1074
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,180
She's probably on her second fucking
major relationship, you know,

1075
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,960
let's find out if her
parents are still together.

1076
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:23,480
That's always a good fucking
measuring stick. You know,

1077
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:28,010
you start thinking like that and he just
lose it. So I would go back then and uh,

1078
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:33,020
yeah, I would do, and I'm not
gonna say the girl's name,
probably a girl back then.

1079
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,890
Well,

1080
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:36,560
one of the two or three girls back there
that fucking made me out of a heart

1081
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:38,870
attack. I would hook up
with them. You know what,

1082
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:43,200
that was actually a very sweet answer.
I Bet I have a lot of females going. Ah,

1083
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,630
I see. Really sweet. He does have a census
site and there's a bunch of guys. What?

1084
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:51,510
I'm fucking queer. Um, all right,

1085
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:56,360
question number five,
Bill. I was searching,

1086
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,020
I was searching through youtube and
I found this interesting video file.

1087
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:05,021
It was Jesse Ventura talking about how
most of September 11th was caused by our

1088
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:09,710
government. And I'll fill
you non wrestling fans are
political people out there.

1089
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:14,600
Jesse Ventura used to be a professional
wrestler, went by Jesse the body Ventura.

1090
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:18,830
And one of my favorite things that
they used to call Tito Tito Santana.

1091
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,850
Santana used to call him Chico Santana.
And uh,

1092
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:27,830
he was part of the tag team champion. Uh,
what was it? Larry's Abisko Bisco Tony.

1093
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,900
Gloria. Who the fuck was Tito Santana?
Was He with Ivan Pushkey? Tito Santana?

1094
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:37,310
Let me, I don't care about no
cheat. Go Santana. He was awesome.

1095
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,170
And then he also said that Song Jessie's
girl was about him. Um, but anyways,

1096
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:46,850
he was also a fucking, was
he a senator in Minnesota?

1097
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,030
So anyways, that's the guy's background
with my fucking digression there.

1098
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,860
Say a former wrestler, former senator I
believe, or a representative of Minnesota.

1099
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,141
And anyways,

1100
01:10:56,141 --> 01:11:00,710
he was talking about how most of September
11th was caused by our government and

1101
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:03,830
how we blew up the two World
Trade Center towers towers.

1102
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:09,290
He said from his experiences in the navy
seals that buildings don't fall at the

1103
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:13,350
rate of gravity. Your
thoughts, thanks again. Um,

1104
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,380
my first gut feeling is they don't teach
you how to implode a skyscraper when

1105
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:22,920
you joined the Navy seals.
And um,

1106
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,920
buildings don't fall
at the rate of gravity.

1107
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,260
I don't feel that they teach
you that in the navy seals.

1108
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,020
I think they teach you
how to swim underwater,

1109
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:35,610
how to cut somebody with a knife from ear
to ear and not have any guilt over it.

1110
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,750
How to move stealthily, how to kill
people. I don't think at any point,

1111
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,100
I'm trying to think of anything that
the navy seals were accused of any

1112
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,670
skyscraper implosions
that they were accused of,

1113
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:52,140
but our government denied any sort of
knowledge of granted it would be top

1114
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,460
secret.
Um,

1115
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:58,300
I'm guessing he went on
youtube like me and a watch,

1116
01:11:58,301 --> 01:12:03,070
the same conspiracy
theories that I watched, uh,

1117
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:07,530
those same videos and now he's trying to
act like he came up with it himself to

1118
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,370
make himself sound a little
more intelligent by throwing
in the navy seals thing.

1119
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,490
You know, from my experience
in the Navy Seals, uh,

1120
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:19,470
buildings don't fall at the
rate of gravity. Really.

1121
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,860
Did they teach you that
when you're putting on your
flippers, you jackass when,

1122
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:27,390
when the fuck did they teach you that?
You know what I mean?

1123
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,440
I'm sure they tell you how to climb up
the side of a building, but, you know,

1124
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,210
I don't really think it's
in, you know, we have,

1125
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,630
we have six teams to take down buildings.

1126
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,140
We don't have fucking eight guys
in frog suits do that. You know,

1127
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,470
I think he's just throwing it out there
that's like, well, you know, a bill,

1128
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:47,730
what do you think about September
11th? Well, my experience as a,

1129
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:51,930
a headlining con comedian around the
country leads me to believe that a

1130
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,440
building's don't fall at the rate
of gravity. So, uh, yeah. Uh,

1131
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:02,100
excuse me. I have a third show tonight,
you know, if he was an architect,

1132
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:03,660
I would believe that.
Um,

1133
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,350
I guess you're asking me what
am I thoughts do I think,

1134
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,380
I dunno what happened on September 11th.
I know there's a lot of,

1135
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:13,860
there's a lot of questions and I don't
feel like we're being told the whole

1136
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,730
story. And I'm not saying our government
did it, but I don't know what happened,

1137
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:19,050
but I know it's not what they told me.

1138
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:24,120
I think they told you some
of what happened and then
other stuff they felt like

1139
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,110
they couldn't tell you.

1140
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:29,280
And then other shit they use to manipulate
shit so they could do some other shit,

1141
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,860
which is why we're all in a big
bag of shit right now. All right,

1142
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:36,180
question number six. Bill parents
named their kid. Uh Oh yeah.

1143
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,930
I saw this story to parents named
their kid, one of their kids,

1144
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:44,820
Adolf Hitler and another one area nation.
I think it's great.

1145
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,660
Now we can keep an eye on the
little fuckers. Oh, wait a minute.

1146
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:53,100
That's my response. I was like, wow,
this kid agrees with me. Um, yeah,

1147
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:57,990
I do think it's great. I think
it's, it's for that exact reason.

1148
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,543
You know what I mean?

1149
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:04,790
The next Adolf Hitler is not going to be
named Adolf Hitler or airing a nation.

1150
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,140
His name is going to be like Mike
or Jason. You know what I mean?

1151
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,510
It's, you know, I don't know. I don't
know how to fuck you explain it.

1152
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:18,520
It's like any, anytime somebody
comes along and look, oh dude,

1153
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:23,410
he sees the next Jimmy Hendrix. You
know, it's like there's never another,

1154
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,720
Jimi Hendrix is never going to be another
eight or they're not gonna be another

1155
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:29,650
fucking guy with the same name. You
named a kid Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin.

1156
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:34,150
They're not going to walk. They're
not going to do anything. You just,

1157
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,340
you gave them a tattoo.
You know Adolf Hitler came to power.

1158
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,620
He actually ran for office when new,

1159
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,460
nobody knew the name Adolph Hitler.

1160
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,010
And he got in there and once he
got in there with these guys,

1161
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,630
that's when he started doing shit.

1162
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,590
So if this little fucker ever runs
for all for, for office, he can't,

1163
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,180
you know,
it's great.

1164
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,680
That just hung a sign around
them. Hey, attention. My, uh,

1165
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:08,670
my parents were fucking maniacs
and I'm filled with hate. You know,

1166
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,890
he can't run for office. Who you, who
you voted for? You vote for Obama.

1167
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,090
You voted for a fucking, uh, John McCain.

1168
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:19,960
Are you voting for I Adolf Hitler
and his running mate. Arian nation.

1169
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:25,060
I think all racist should name their
kids. Stuff like that, you know,

1170
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,710
just, you know, name them,
fucked up, names like that,

1171
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:32,710
and then they can all giggle about it.
Hey, there's little Adolf and then we'll,

1172
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,590
you know, it's like the, you know,

1173
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,660
I don't know how many times could
I make the same fucking point.

1174
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,260
[inaudible] I really don't give a shit.
Um, I don't think it's offensive either.

1175
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:42,670
I think those people can name their kids,

1176
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:46,800
whatever the fuck they want to
name them. And, uh, like I said,

1177
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,920
some major red flag.
Dad,

1178
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,820
can I go to my friend's house? Yes. Uh,

1179
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:59,910
well what will we go? Oh, you want him
to Steve's house? No, Adolph eight.

1180
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:05,090
His kids' names. Adolph. Yeah.
What's his last name? Hitler

1181
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:11,770
saw y'all. Can I go? No, no,
you can't. Why not? Well,

1182
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,633
I'll explain it to you.

1183
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:16,360
Like why don't we sit down and watch the
history channel together? I know. Water.

1184
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:21,160
What's boring? Shut the fuck up. You
Little Brat. Question number seven. Um,

1185
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:24,430
since you've been traveling across
the country for the past decade or so,

1186
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:28,210
what's the best urban
legend you ever heard of?

1187
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,750
Okay. Urban legends. Uh, I've
heard so many good ones. Um,

1188
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:36,550
I,
well I grew up in the 80s,

1189
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:42,180
so there was a lot of fear
about aids during that time.

1190
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,770
And um, I remember there was
an urban legend about a guy.

1191
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:50,140
He's in a bar,
he makes this chick,

1192
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:52,960
she's totally smoke and looks
like a fucking supermodel.

1193
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,200
They go back to her place,
you know, whenever her hotel,

1194
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,680
she gives him the best blow job ever
and the bang and I would fly out of the

1195
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:00,970
greatest fucking night ever.

1196
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:06,480
He wakes up the next morning she's gone
and he walks into the bathroom and then

1197
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:10,760
on the mirror is written in lipstick.
Congratulations.

1198
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:15,170
Now we both have aides because
evidently he didn't use a condom.

1199
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:19,160
And I remember being in a room when a
warehouse believing every word going,

1200
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:24,320
really do what we do. Where, where
did that happen? I don't know, Dude.

1201
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:29,120
I think it was in Rhode Island.
I was a moron.

1202
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,900
I liked that one. And I liked a, there
was another one out there about a guy,

1203
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:38,030
he meets a girl in a bar
and uh, she says, hey,

1204
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,910
and she's totally smoking. And
she says, Hey, this is the deal.

1205
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,990
You can come back to Mike's Place.
You can do whatever you want to me.

1206
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,310
But in the end I get to do whatever I want
to you guys like, yeah, Shit, fucking,

1207
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:50,870
let's go. So, you know,

1208
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:55,250
he does everything you could possibly do
with the woman you know, has an orgasm,

1209
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:58,400
everything's great. And she
goes, okay, now it's my turn.

1210
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,840
And she ties him down to
the bed. So he's like, okay,

1211
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:07,130
she's under this freaky Dominic's or
shit, whatever. She walks out of the room,

1212
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:08,091
you know,

1213
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:13,091
closes the door and all of a sudden the
door fucking kicks open and there's a

1214
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:17,960
black dude dressed like Batman and he
comes in and he fucks the guy in the ass.

1215
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,140
And I actually believed it. Like that
totally made sense to me. I was like,

1216
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:25,530
once again,
1819.

1217
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,780
Where did that happen? I don't
know. I think it was in Chelsea.

1218
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,500
Um, yeah, probably that one. And then,
then anyone, any of the firecracker,

1219
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:41,810
urban legends,
you know,

1220
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,620
somebody put an mad and somebody's
back pocket and blew half his ass off.

1221
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:50,450
I always liked that one. Um,
yeah, I would say that. All right.

1222
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,370
And it's the second part
of the question also.

1223
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:56,870
Do you believe in Spooky
Supernatural Shit? No. Yes or no?

1224
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,080
I believe in outer body experiences.

1225
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:04,850
I believe in some sort of a,
I don't know.

1226
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:07,960
I don't even know after life,
but so just some shit that we don't,

1227
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:11,720
we don't understand that we can't tap
into. I definitely believe in that,

1228
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:17,180
but I don't believe in ghosts
like there that you know,

1229
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,110
that they're going to haunt me. I
just don't get what it goes. Can Do.

1230
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,180
You know, it's invisible.
I can't see it. Okay.

1231
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:30,720
So what does it rattles a land
and it goes boom. All right.

1232
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:35,330
Now that I get used to that, um, you know,

1233
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,690
the worst he can just be as a pain in
the ass, just not shit off my dresser

1234
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,190
and then just be like, really? Then
I can just fuck with him mentally.

1235
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,880
Just torture stick really
well, maybe that's why. Maybe
that's why you're a ghost.

1236
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:47,630
You ever think about that?

1237
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:50,870
Maybe you're just a content life in
your punishment is you don't get to go

1238
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:55,040
anywhere and now you're
trapped in my awful apartment,

1239
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,460
you know, kind of a fucking
loser. Ghosts are you,

1240
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,890
why aren't you out there looking up
women's skirts and we get gay ghost.

1241
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,980
Once you go fucking float
over to a west, uh, west,

1242
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,330
it's plenty of dudes over there.
You know, we'll get their balls.

1243
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,790
I ain't know what I'm talking
about here. All right. Um, anyways,

1244
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,930
he said my girlfriend is obsessed with
that show goes hunter hunter hunters.

1245
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:25,320
And I find it ridiculous. Uh, yeah,

1246
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,870
I find that shows that
shows that's fucking stupid.

1247
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,380
It's all all in the editing and they
act like they're going to find something

1248
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,980
and they don't and they never quite
get like a good angle on the ghost.

1249
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:39,060
You know? It's like if you
had a good angle on the ghost,

1250
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:42,870
you have kept the footage and you
would've just could have sold it to any

1251
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,900
network out there for millions of dollars.

1252
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:48,180
We finally have proof that goes exist,

1253
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:53,280
but they never do until we shaky
handheld Blair witch shit. All right,

1254
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,610
question number eight. Um,
bill doing sets every week,

1255
01:20:56,611 --> 01:21:01,500
do you ever get bored of your own
stories? Jesus Christ? Yes, absolutely.

1256
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,880
Which is why, and thank God I do. If I
didn't, I would never write any new jokes.

1257
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:10,320
Absolutely. Absolutely. And what ends up
happening is if it's a seven minute joke,

1258
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,120
it becomes a five minute joke.

1259
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,600
It becomes a two minute joke and then
it just becomes a joke that disappears.

1260
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,220
It's kind of like,
you know,

1261
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,610
you ever like break your arm or
something and someone's like, dude,

1262
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:21,540
what happened to your arm?

1263
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:26,660
And you tell the first person you tell
in total detail what happened to your arm

1264
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,890
and it takes like fucking 10 minutes.

1265
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:31,410
The next guy who tell you
start telling it again.

1266
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,390
You can fuck he going
over the same shit again,

1267
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,980
becomes eight minutes and then the very
end, it's just what happened? Your mom,

1268
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:39,240
dude, I fucking fell down and go fuck
yourself. What do you think happened?

1269
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:43,920
It bent in a way. It wasn't supposed
to bend in a broke. All right,

1270
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,730
what happened to your face? All
right, question number nine.

1271
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,720
How far into this podcast,
how are we, how many?

1272
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:54,000
I'm trying to shorten these things
because they're getting ridiculously long.

1273
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:59,970
41 minutes. Jesus Christ. I should
sell cds at the end of this. All right,

1274
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:03,600
question number nine, and I'm going
to wrap this up real quick. Um, Bill,

1275
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:07,410
are there any movies that you,
that you know are God awful,

1276
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,760
but for whatever reason you love them
anyways? Oh, I like this. This is,

1277
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,070
this is a good story here.

1278
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:18,420
Listen to this shit he says for me is
John Claude van Damme bloodsport and

1279
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:22,620
kickboxer reasoning being is I was about
nine or 10 when those movies came out

1280
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,970
and they were the first movies.

1281
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:28,470
My Dad let me stay up and watch with
them even though my mom disapproved and I

1282
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:33,210
saw kickboxer for the first time in a
while the other day and it really might be

1283
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:34,860
one of the worst movies of all time,

1284
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,910
especially the part where van Damme
gets punched square in the face about 15

1285
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:43,911
times and rapid succession at the end
of the round and at the end of the round

1286
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,250
the bad guy tells van dam
that he fucked his girlfriend.

1287
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:52,580
At which point van Damme spends the
rest of a in between rounds demanding to

1288
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:57,450
know the truth about his new girlfriend.
He says,

1289
01:22:57,451 --> 01:23:02,250
if I were in the middle of a fight with
the grand champion of underground death

1290
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:05,650
matches, would you actually
give a shit at that point?

1291
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,670
Who some girl you met two
weeks ago? Fuck yeah, exactly.

1292
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,010
And I'll never forget
the part with a bad vet.

1293
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:16,570
Bad Guy's boss finally gets what's coming
to him because my dad would always be

1294
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:19,480
going take that you
Cambodian son of a bitch.

1295
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,880
I don't even think the guy was supposed
to be Cambodian, but I, but if I see them,

1296
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:28,400
movie's going to be on, on
Cinemax 20 years from now.
Still sit down and watch it.

1297
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,430
Yeah, I got movies like that. Um,

1298
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:35,431
I think I already talked about this one
airport in 1975 if he ever get a chance

1299
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:36,520
to watch that movie,

1300
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:41,170
that's the movie that basically the
movie airplane was making fun of.

1301
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,380
I believe.
And believe it or not,

1302
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:49,180
air as funny as the movie airplane
is airport 1975 is even funnier.

1303
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:52,810
Just to give you a quick recap of,
of what the store at what it is.

1304
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:56,980
It's a commercial airliner. You
know, some guys in a private plane,

1305
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,580
he has a heart attack and has a
head on collision with like a DC 10,

1306
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:06,060
which sucks one of the pilots out of the
front and blinds Efram Zimbalist Jr at

1307
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:10,660
which point a stewardess who
I swear to God has a lazy eye,

1308
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:16,050
has to fly the fucking plane and it stars
an unknown Erik Estrada who plays the

1309
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:21,910
character of I believe heck
door and has one line in it.

1310
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:26,470
It's that fucking good. All right,
what am I going to end with here?

1311
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,030
Um, let's end with a wishing all you
guys are merry Christmas. So it be guys,

1312
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:35,680
you know, you're Jewish, had
happy Hanukkah. Um, if you're,

1313
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,730
uh,
is it just black,

1314
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:41,680
the only black people or is that
African Kwanza Happy Kwanza Duration?

1315
01:24:41,681 --> 01:24:44,360
I don't know what you do
there. A old Jewish people, uh,

1316
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:49,180
have y'all have excellent Chinese food
on Christmas Day? I learned that little,

1317
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:54,310
uh, that little tradition the other day.
Oh, here's a question I have for any, any,

1318
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:57,700
you technically savvy guys out here
cause I really want to up the quality of

1319
01:24:57,701 --> 01:25:02,290
these podcasts. If people keep talking
about this tapping, wait a minute,

1320
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,180
is it this noise?
Is that the noise?

1321
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,060
If that's the noise. Yeah, that's
me scrolling down on my computer.

1322
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:16,330
I think we solved it.
Um,

1323
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,920
son of a bitch anyways,
so I want to up the quality.

1324
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:25,420
So let me know if that's the tapping
sound because some people were saying it

1325
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:28,750
was my laugh saying I left like Popeye
and annoyed them. Or is it this,

1326
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:34,120
is that really annoying you guys?
Um, anyways, this is my question.

1327
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:37,420
I saw something, I was
listening to a, what's his face?

1328
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,580
Little Stephens underground Christmas.

1329
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:44,110
If you guys ever listened to his show
notes on Sunday nights, check out locally.

1330
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,700
He's just said plays on this underground
music plays great music and I love the

1331
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:52,660
way he talks.
A little Stevens underground Christmas,

1332
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:57,040
we got the limo moves. I can't even do
what this fucking the coolest dude ever.

1333
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:00,400
But anyways, he was talking about
this shit on there called the uh,

1334
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:02,140
the Olympus ls 10.

1335
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,470
And evidently it's this
fucking unbelievable recorder.

1336
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:10,940
You can record 12 hours with a
shit on it. Bands can use it. Like,

1337
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:14,480
that's how much quality is that you can
just set it in the middle of the room

1338
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:15,560
and it picks up everything.

1339
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,070
Like that cheesy guitar playing that
you heard at the beginning of this.

1340
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,040
You could have really
told how awful it was.

1341
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:25,700
If I get one of these devices
and any you tech geeks out there,

1342
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,290
I want to know if this thing is worth it.

1343
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,550
The ls 10 if I start recording my
podcasts on this, then uploading them.

1344
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,360
It's really adding an whole extra step
to the process. But I would like to,

1345
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:37,850
you know, I'm getting a ton of
listeners, I'm not gonna lie to you,

1346
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:41,240
the podcast that kind of
starting to blow up. You know,

1347
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,910
I think I'm in a triple
digits at this point.

1348
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:48,200
I know I've been joking San only have 14
listeners, but I really think I got a,

1349
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,850
I think I have about 106 at this point,
so I'm gonna,

1350
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:57,530
I'm gonna try to, uh, you know,
try to up the quality here in 2009.

1351
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,020
Um, and with that I got an idea.
How about for next week's podcast?

1352
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:05,210
You guys send me in some
New Year's resolutions,

1353
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,430
how are you going to
turn your lives around?

1354
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,340
You know how you do this every
year you lie to yourself,

1355
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:13,790
you're gonna make your life a
little bit better. You know,

1356
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:19,040
send me those in. And with that I'm going
to end this podcast here. I'm going to,

1357
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:23,510
well actually hype a couple of dates
I have coming up. Um, all right,

1358
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:28,040
this is the big one. I'm at the
Improv in Tampa, Florida and I,

1359
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,980
last time I was there, you know, I dunno,

1360
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:33,050
I didn't do so well as
far as drawing people.

1361
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,540
I know it's kind of off the
beaten path down there in Tampa.

1362
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:40,640
Maybe the hang over a
year fucking devil rays,

1363
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,880
which kicked the shit out of my red
sox while we took you to seven games.

1364
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:46,130
So you guys are definitely the
better team. Maybe you guys,

1365
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:50,660
you know the lightening aren't doing so
well that kind of an okay team come out

1366

1367

1368
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:00,860
I wrote a brand new hours stuff and
I'm also going to be at the Improv in

1369
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:05,660

22nd through the 24th.

1370
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:10,910
And then I'm making a hometown stop in
Boston at the Wilbur theater on February

1371
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:14,390

you guys can come out. Um,

1372
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,690
I'm going to be really
rested up over the holidays,

1373
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:22,670
so I'm going to be extra funny.
I guaran fucking tee it and uh,

1374
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,900
and that is it. I didn't quite get a
chance to get to some of this shit.

1375
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,240
I got a couple of Nice reviews

1376
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:33,710
on my podcast here.
This is all garbage time.

1377
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:35,030
You don't even have to
listen to this ship it.

1378
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:38,300
Here's a couple of Nice reviews I got.
And then I have another one,

1379
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,780
another segment that I like to call back
down to earth where somebody trashes

1380
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:45,530
May. So here we go. Here's
a couple of Nice one. Um,

1381
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,330
thanks for making me laugh all day long.

1382
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:51,530
I just finished listening to all of your
podcasts. How the fuck did you do that?

1383
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,360
I'm trying to get my
wife to listen to them,

1384
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,450
but she doesn't think it's
as funny as I think they are.

1385
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:59,990
Anytime I have my headphones
on and I'm laughing, she says,

1386
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:04,590
are you listening to your boyfriend
bill? Too Funny. Keep up the great work.

1387
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:09,090
Don't you love when fucking women do shit
like that? Look at that. She's jealous.

1388
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:13,110
She's jealous that you get, I, you know
what? You should play this part for her.

1389
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:16,110
What's her name? Give me your
name next week. I'll, I'll have,

1390
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:18,720
I'll give her a little talking to,
you know,

1391
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:23,750
and I'll be nice even though she doesn't
think I'm not funny. You know this. Look,

1392
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,790
if you want to hold on, you know I'm
gonna do it right now, sweetheart.

1393
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:29,610
If you want to hold on to your boyfriend,
he can't suffocate him. All right?

1394
01:29:29,611 --> 01:29:34,410
If he likes walking around, listening to
another man and his headphones, you know,

1395
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:36,990
show us a little gay. I
understand that. You know,

1396
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,270
he's getting in touch with
his feminine side. All right?

1397
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:42,600
But what you need to do is you
need to be an adult here. Okay?

1398
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:46,410
You have to understand that.
No matter how stupid you think it is,

1399
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:50,040
it's one of his hobbies and
you have to respect that. Okay?

1400
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,530
Don't do what Jennifer Lopez did.

1401
01:29:52,531 --> 01:29:55,200
The Ben Affleck during their
year and a half relationship.

1402
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:58,050
What are you going to do?
Dress him up like a little Ken doll.

1403
01:29:58,051 --> 01:30:00,330
Stick them in a Tuxedo.
Huh?

1404
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,270
He can walk around smiling,

1405
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:07,380
pretending he's happy and everybody sees
them misery behind his eyes, you know?

1406
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:11,370
And then one day, you know, you
just, you just, yeah, I don't know.

1407
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:15,780
You just see him crouched over in front
of his laptop looking at porn or just

1408
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:18,270
something, something awful
and you're going to blame him.

1409
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:21,150
You going to blame his childhood. You
know what? It's you lady. All right.

1410
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:25,080
So why don't you back off during
the holidays. Okay. All right,

1411
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,970
next one.
Hey Bill,

1412
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,880
I think your podcast should come
with the public service disclaimer.

1413
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:34,560
Since I fly a lot, I catch up on
your podcasts during flights through,

1414
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,560
I get such a kick out of this if people
are actually downloading these things

1415
01:30:37,561 --> 01:30:40,890
and listening to them. This is
really cool. And so anyways,
on a plane and he says,

1416
01:30:40,891 --> 01:30:44,460
I sat next to this older lady during
a recent flight back from Portland.

1417
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,330
It was your podcast about
chips and the 20 car pile ups.

1418
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,870
I was frigging laughing so hard.
I couldn't breathe.

1419
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:55,260
I thought I was going to be escorted
off the flight by air marshals.

1420
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:59,630
This poor lady must've thought I
was a some psycho. All right. Yeah.

1421
01:30:59,631 --> 01:31:03,210
That's awesome. That makes me feel
good. Next one, one more good one,

1422
01:31:03,211 --> 01:31:05,760
and then I'm going to bring myself back
down to earth with somebody who trashed

1423
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,790
me. All right, Bill. Then yesterday, uh,

1424
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,270
it was the same one yesterday I was with
my older daughter and we were listening

1425
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:13,104
in the car.

1426
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,940
This was a podcast about being a boxer
and reacting to punches by shrugging your

1427
01:31:17,941 --> 01:31:20,370
shoulders and turning your head. I, yeah,

1428
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,770
that's how I react to when somebody
tries to punch me in the face.

1429
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:24,090
I don't try to slip the punch.

1430
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,050
I just bring my shoulders up to ear
level and then I turned my head away

1431
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,280
to,
I never want to fight anyways.

1432
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:34,950
He said we were both
crying and gasping for air.

1433
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:37,980
I could barely see the car in front of me.
Good God.

1434
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,440
Warn people they should not be in public,
uh,

1435
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:44,010
or operating heavy machinery
when listening. All right,

1436
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,870
so that's the good review section.

1437
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:50,850
Now here is the back down to earth
section of the podcast. Bill,

1438
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,260
glad to see you've been working on,
you're reading out loud skills.

1439
01:31:55,290 --> 01:32:00,290
You sound like a special ed kid that
didn't bother getting out of the bus when

1440
01:32:00,401 --> 01:32:01,690
it arrived at school.

1441
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,250
I wonder how many times you've been in
public places reading up out the podcast

1442
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:11,140
questions into your phone and people
have walked by and thought, oh, how nice.

1443
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:13,990
The mentally challenged man
over there is learning to read.

1444
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,660
I guess he's really
coming along because he,

1445
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:22,090
he's only sounding out every other word.
Know what's great about that.

1446
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:23,830
Not only is that absolutely correct,

1447
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:27,670
I actually had difficulty reading out
loud the thing that he said, insulting me,

1448
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:32,500
saying I can't read out loud about
to shade to shade at Buddy. Um,

1449
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:35,680
anyways, happy holidays, deputy buddy.
Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.

1450
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:39,130
Happy Kwanzaa. And if you don't celebrate
any of it, I hope you have a good break.

1451
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:43,660
While the rest of us are spending money
on people that we resent on some level,

1452
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:47,170
um, that is it. Um, let me know
your new years resolutions.

1453
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:52,171
Please keep the podcast questions coming
and I hope in January I can have some

1454
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:56,590
sort of update on my European tour
that I'm going to be doing, um,

1455
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,453
next year.

1456
01:32:57,670 --> 01:33:02,670
So for my seven listeners in the U
K A I dunno if you guys celebrate.

1457
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:07,720
Do you guys have Jesus over there? I
know you have Mcdonald's. All right.

1458
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:10,840
God bless. Take it easy.
Talk to you next Monday.

1459
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,610
So

1460
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,720
maybe somewhere down the road,

1461
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:40,420
maybe somewhere down the road when
somebody,

1462
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,473
the

1463
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,950
car I drive.

1464
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,760
I'm just glad to be here.
Happy to theme that.

1465
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,600
It doesn't matter if you

1466
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,513
said

1467
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,553
right.

1468
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,263
[inaudible]

1469
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:24,870
[inaudible].
