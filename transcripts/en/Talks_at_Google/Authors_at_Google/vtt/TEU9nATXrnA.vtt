&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Hi everyone, and thanks
again for coming to another

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.790
authors at Google event here in the San Francisco
office.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.500
Today we are very pleased to have Dan and
Corey join us. They are the cofounders of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500
the record setter.com.
Dan has actually come back to San Francisco

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
[inaudible] and he's a
world record fanatic for now since the age

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:21.670
of 10. And proudest
to have set the 11 RecordSetter world records.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.130
Less proud however that ten of them
have been beat. Former advertising exec who

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.940
created two Super Bowls, Dan now
resides over in Brooklyn, but we won't hold

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.720
that against him. Corey is an entrepreneur
who's

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.620
been working in web development since 1967.
And probably holds the, 1967, Actually

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.640
1867. 1997. And probably holds the world record
for the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.190
longest time to watch Amazing Horse while
working.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.309
You'll hear about that hopefully today. [laughter]
Corey also lives in New York City. They're

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.720
here to talk about RecordSetter which is a
new book that they've come out with which

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:12.469
celebrates over 300 of the loudest,
longest, slowest, weirdest and coolest, and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.670
most difficult to break records ever set.
Please

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
join me in welcoming Dan and Corey.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
[Applause]

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.670
&gt;&gt; Dan: Hello, everybody. How is it going?
Can you hear us

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.930
at the back? Allrighty. [giggling] My name
is Dan. This is

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.560
Corey. Thank you Nick for having us here and
thanks

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.469
to all of you for coming. So we're going to
be talking

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.420
about world records. I always like to say
this project

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.520
began when I was 10 and got my first Guinness
Book of

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.020
world records and just fell in love with the
concept of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.399
World Records and fell in love with this whole
concept of world records. It was just this

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.810
amazing book that you could pore
through and see all these amazing people around

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.149
the
world. I just love this sentiment of billions

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.989
of people
on this planet. I love the idea that, you

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.549
know, these
people were actually the world's best; the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.869
number one in
a particular area. So I always just said,

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.399
"You know, I
want to be a world record holder someday.”

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.039
That just
seemed like a cool thing. So I was a 10-year-old

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.000
boy. I
went off in college got a little more serious

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.890
about it and started researching setting a
Guinness world record. I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.970
once tried to woo a girl to have a go at ravioli
eating. Because I kept looking through the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.099
book and I
thought maybe I could be a speed eater. I

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.260
A, realize I'm
not a very fast eater and B, she was totally

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.780
unimpressed
by this. [laughter] But you know, but my love

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.650
for world records
continued and as Nick mentioned, I have a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.470
previous
career in advertising. I was a creative working.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.549
My
last full-time job was at Goodby Silverstein

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.549
here in San
Francisco. So I came out here in 2002 and

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.939
went out with
some friends to Burning Man Festival. Any

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.720
people
who've been? [giggling] Alright. Cool. Woo

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.370
woop! So you know went out to burning
man. Totally intrigued by it. Had my mind

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.500
totally blown
away by mass creativity. People pouring their

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.370
hearts and
soul into major projects none of which were

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.940
related with
commerce. You know, things that people love

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.379
to do and that ranged from dance and performance
and

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.430
art and music and on and on and on. So I was
just

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.359
super excited by what was happening. And after
going for

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.730
a couple of years, just felt more and more
of this desire

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.639
that I was going and taking it in but I really
wanted to

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.489
build something, that's a big part of the
Burning Man

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.530
spirit of build something and pour your own
heart and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.489
energy and soul into the entire community
and experience.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.701
Some friends and I had a dinner in the Tenderloin.
It's

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.249
a little Thai restaurant on the corner, I
forget the

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:01.439
name of it. But we just sat down all right
we need an

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.359
idea for our Burning Man camp because deadlines
are

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.680
getting close and we want to do something
awesome. A

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.620
bunch of ideas were kicked around. I brought
up my love

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.389
of world records. I was like, "Hey guys, why
don't we

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.070
create a world record theme camp. And we'll
just figure

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.090
it out and let people set Burning Man world
records.” It

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.460
was a very loose idea but finally everybody
kind of

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.900
rallied around it. We called ourselves the
Playa Book of

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.711
Records and went off to the desert. This was
in 2004, went off to the desert. Somebody

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.960
had suggested as an
homage to wild world of sports that we wear

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.710
yellow
jackets. They were not nearly as fancy as

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.150
these. These
were going off to thrift stores and going

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.760
on Ebay to find yellow
jackets. You don't see these often. They're

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.729
hard to
find even on the Internet. So we just went

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.010
off and we
just wore yellow jackets and said we're the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.590
Playa Book of
Records, does anybody want to set a record?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.810
And it was
just a very open brief. And people came up

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.250
and were
like, "Anything? Like it doesn't have to be

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.080
something
like Guinness recognizes? It doesn't have

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.470
to be
something you guys decide is cool or not?”

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.280
And we were like, "No, set a record we're
going to document it and we're

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.259
going to make you a world record holder."
We would see

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.680
feats , we can show you some of these videos,
we would see feats like the fastest accordion

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.069
rendition of the "Devil
Went Down to Georgia." And then a woman came

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.699
up with a
super deep inny and she set a world record

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.240
for the most
blueberries fit in a belly button. [laughter]

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.449
And then we had a guy
who came up on those spring stilts and he

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.330
did the most
consecutive back flips on stilts. And so it

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.120
was like, most balloon dogs created in one
minute.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.560
The creativity was just pouring out of all
these people.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.270
It's a creative community and people really
seem to enjoy

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.460
this open assignment. So our camp continued
to grow.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.210
Like, we went back and we were there for five
years from

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.009
'04 until '08. And you know, then we standard
to create

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.009
leader boards. And so, we would have people
see the

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.000
other world records that existed. And now
you've got

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.940
people creating records. And you've got other
people

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.310
saying "Wait a sec, like the world record
for most

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.110
quarters fit in a nose is only 3.? Like get
me some records.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.849
I want to beat that record." And so, that
starts getting

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.659
competitive. You know, then we would come
back the next

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.910
year and people would run off and say like
"Where's the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.460
leader board? Do I still hold my record from
last year

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.610
because it means so much to me." And I'd be
"No dude, someone beat it.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.020
And do you want to come back and try to win
it back?" The

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.450
competition was growing. The creativity was
blossoming.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.740
It was wonderful to see all this happening.
During these

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.360
years it was when Wikipedia was starting to
revolutionize

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.009
the encyclopedia and people were realizing
wow there can

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.600
be something much bigger and more community
driven and

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.750
participatory than the Encyclopedia Britainica.
And with

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.509
that kind of spirit, you know as this project
grew at

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:18.110
Burning Man, there was, you know, the beginning
thoughts

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.699
of like wait a second why does this have to
just be in

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.490
the desert five days a week every single year?
How on

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.000
earth can this be put into the world at large
and get

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.600
everybody playing? So then I went to a summer
camp in

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.289
New Hampshire spent a week doing it with kids.
I just

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.300
wanted to try it with kids and the kids were
even more

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.060
creative and ,more outrageous than the people
at Burning Man.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.419
It kept growing. I met Corey in 2006. I had
known his

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:54.150
wife from my years in advertising. She's a
photographer.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.949
And we met here in San Francisco. They were
visiting.

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:01.539
We went out for dinner and then to see RATATAT
at the

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.430
Great American Music Hall. Woo woo! And basically
while

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.169
the band was playing we were just. I was all
fired up.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.349
I had just come back from Burning Man. I knew
that

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:19.139
Corey. I'll let him tell about his technological
background. But I didn't really know many

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:24.719
people in
technology. And so, I basically spent a night.

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:29.160
We just
started talking about like, if and how this

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.360
thing could
go on to the Internet. So.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.849
&gt;&gt; Corey: Yeah, you know and for me, it just
sort of made

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:39.840
perfect sense. My immediate reaction was more
about

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.280
like, you know, wait a second why do a group
of guys in

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.980
England get to decide what world records should
exist and

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.690
what ones shouldn't exist? The whole reason
the Internet

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.000
exists is for people to argue about stuff
like that. And

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.710
we have, obviously, we live in the age of
video.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.410
That's accessible to everybody now. And we
put the two

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.140
together. And like we said, we didn't even
get to watch

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.260
the concert. We were just talking about the
idea the

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.370
whole time. So.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.260
&gt;&gt; Dan: So yeah. So then Corey went back to
New York. I was

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.560
still working here in San Francisco and we
became pen

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.720
pals and started figuring out what the database
was going

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.780
to look like. Again, I'm technologically somewhat
incompetent. So Corey was the zen master and

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.040
patient zen
master as we started to build this thing together.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.840
I
eventually quit here and I moved back to New

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.370
York for
life reasons. And but, you know, then obviously

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.050
we
started working more closely together and

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.740
went into a
shared office space. And we really boot strapped

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.120
this
thing for a couple of years. I was doing some

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.850
freelancing and advertising. Corey was working
on

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.180
another startup at the time. But we just,
it was just

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.620
like this big hobby that was just something
we knew we

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.500
wanted to put on the Internet. We didn't know
if it was

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.320
going to be. Our original aim was URDB the
universal

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.030
record database.org. So we had lots of debates
about

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:19.160
whether this should be a for profit or a nonprofit
or not for profit. But

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.060
we just knew we had 150 world records from
Burning Man couple dozen from the summer camp

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.400
in New Hampshire. And
we just said like, "We've got to put this

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.090
thing on the
Internet least for people to see these world

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.310
records and
hopefully we're going to be able to build

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.791
a tool for
everybody to play along and seeing world records

00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.810
that
they think they can beat. Documenting themselves

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:47.290
on
video and up loading it.” And/or saying

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.510
"I want to create
a totally new world record myself." So we

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.500
built the thing
for a couple of years. And launched in beta

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.860
just under
three years ago at the end of 2008. And the

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.000
last three
years has been like a crazy adventure. So

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.380
we have a
short brand video about record setter which

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.910
I think will
kind of begin to fill you in on what's been

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.550
happening. Then
we can begin to tell you about the book and

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.700
tell you
about some more amazing records.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.720
&gt;&gt; Corey: You know, what we need to do is
audio.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720
&gt;&gt; Dan: Mm hmm.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:31.830
&gt;&gt; Corey: Will this audio work do you think?

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:45.740
&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:13:02.240
&gt;&gt; Corey: Plug that in? Cool.
Sounds like it's going to work.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:30.060
&gt;&gt; [Video plays. Electronic music].

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:55.550
&gt;&gt; Dan: All right. So yeah. That's, that in
a nutshell is

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.570
what we're building. So I don't know if you
have had a

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.550
chance to see the website, but it really is
just, we

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:07.740
have over 10,000 records now, primarily video.
And

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.950
we're really just trying to continue to lower
the bar for

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.010
setting a world record. And changing them
from something

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.110
you read about in a book that comes out once
a year to

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.240
something that you can participate in and,
you know,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.470
everybody from young kids to groups to, you
know,

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.510
companies and beyond can get involved with.
So we were

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.110
laughing this morning that, you know, we're
a digital

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.120
company and record setter.com is the core
of what we're

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.570
building and yet it's this book that gets
us invited to

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.550
come and speak at Google. [laughter] So. We
can.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:51.070
&gt;&gt; Corey: Do you want to talk about where
the book came from and--

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.780
&gt;&gt; Dan: Sure. Yeah, so as this thing grew.
I mean, we've

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.790
had, you know, we're still a very small team.
We only

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.310
have 7 people in New York City. We have some
funding.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.170
We can happily answer questions about the
business side.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.490
Happy to talk about any side of the company
that you'd

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:15.320
like. Thanks to some appearances on Jimmy
Fallon and other live events and so forth

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.080
we talk to some book
publishers and teamed up with a company called

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.870
Workmen
who are awesome and spent the last couple

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:29.440
of years
building this book. So it was a really interesting

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.930
challenge. You know, I mean people talk about
like will

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.720
Wikipedia ever release a book? And it was
kind of a

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.070
similar challenge with how do you, with thousands
of

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.800
records choose what's the best stuff and does
it make

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.790
sense to make a book? I mean, a lot of interesting
questions

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.910
that we had to ask because we were producing
this. But,

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.680
you know, we felt ultimately that print still
is alive.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.800
And this, you know, we've been on tour across
the country

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.370
right now. And we're seeing like, especially
kids and

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.380
teenagers. And people in their 20s, 30s, and
40s as

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.730
well but really still a lot of reading books
of world

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.930
records. So we felt it still made sense for
us to

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.830
actually put out a print book. And we're going
to be

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:24.620
making this a series and getting it into school
classrooms and so forth. We really tried to

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.870
rethink what
a book of world records is. You know, obviously

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.990
we love
the Guinness book and have seen it for years,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.060
but we
wanted to make something that wasn't just

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.660
a book you
would read, but it was actually filled with

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.220
tips on how
to set world records yourselves. And then,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.050
there's
hundreds of these records begging to be set.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.120
We'll get
into some of our favorite records, but I just

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.500
flipped
open this page and a record begging to be

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.720
set is the
fastest time to Google every member of Nsync.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.310
So if
everybody in this room would like to set a

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.500
world record
this weekend, document yourself on video Googling

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.240
every
member of Nsync and we'll document it on our

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.759
videos for
other Nsync aficionados to challenge.

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:13.089
&gt;&gt; Corey: Google aficionados.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.980
&gt;&gt; Dan: Google aficionados.
The book is filled with a

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.329
lot of world records. I think you guys are
getting the

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.679
spirit that we're much more open than any
other world

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:26.069
record organization. We'd like to try to not
judge

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.740
people's categories. Our very simple rules
are that your feat

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.510
has to be quantifiable, breakable and you
have to provide sufficient

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.080
media evidence. Because we were coming to
Google, we

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.649
pulled up the most medical symptoms Googled
in 30

00:17:41.649 --> 00:17:47.049
seconds. Biana Fay, this is a woman in Brooklyn.
She describes

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:50.531
herself as a low-grade hypochondriac who delights
in

00:17:50.531 --> 00:17:54.259
Googling minor bodily sensations after scaring
herself

00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:58.450
they might be the first sings of a serious
illness. Years

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.500
of freaking out about suspected malignant
moles that

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.629
happened to be dropped flakes of chocolate,
true story, gave her the

00:18:05.629 --> 00:18:08.740
confidence to set this record. Perfectly healthy
as she

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:15.190
prepared to type in a litany of symptoms from
quote "Funny poops to itchy ankles." She took

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.330
a
minute to reassure all viewers with words

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.649
of calm. If
any of these things are happening to you,

00:18:19.649 --> 00:18:21.700
just know
that I've been through them and am totally

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:28.940
fine. So Biana Googled 7 symptoms in 30
Seconds and we have criteria like, we definitely

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.700
want to create legitimate rules that people
have to follow.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.110
So you must use Google to perform the searches.
You may

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.960
not use Google's autocomplete features. Anybody
in the

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.400
room working on the autocomplete project?
And search queries must

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.940
refer to a medical symptom or complaint. So
if we have any

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.450
hypochondriacs here who would like to have
a go at beating that record. I

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.360
person little think that's kinda a beatable
one.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.600
&gt;&gt; Corey: Yup.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.049
&gt;&gt; Dan: Yeah. You want to
choose a favorite?

00:18:56.049 --> 00:19:03.799
&gt;&gt; Corey: Yeah, well we have a we did a project
with Weiden+Kennedy up in

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.950
Portland and they set an amazing record. I
have to find

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:12.419
the exact language, but the longest office
chair chain

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:17.009
pulled by a motorcycle. So they have a motorcycle,
a bunch

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:21.500
of office chairs, [laughter] pulled that down
the street out of

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.690
Portland. And then the most bizarre thing
happened at

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.950
the end. As they were preparing to do their
record, somebody

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:34.100
noticed then quarter back Joey Herrington
at the piano

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.730
store across the street. They invited him
to join their

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:43.240
record and the last chair is filled with Joey
Herrington playing a keyboard has they're

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.169
pulling down
the street pulled by a motorcycle.[laughter]

00:19:46.169 --> 00:19:47.169
It's amazing.

00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:50.470
&gt;&gt; Dan: And what's so interesting we see all
these records

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.091
like this. That's an awesome outrageous feat.
That's

00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:58.810
not ever going to become competitive. While
that record

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:04.620
still stands that this inspired people at
to set a record

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.090
for the longest office chair train pulled
by a golf cart.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.170
They were going to try to beat the record
but they

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.309
weren't allowed to bring a motorcycle into
a studio so

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:21.149
they tweaked it with a golf cart. And then
a small town

00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:25.460
in Nova Scotia, Canada. People love beating
Jimmy

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.700
Fallen's record so they tried to take down
the record.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:37.350
So they beat his record and pulled more office
chairs

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.200
behind a golf cart. And you know, the competitive
element I think the something that we get

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.490
really excited
about. Sometimes people will say, "are you

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.249
guys just
have that sort of youthful spirit of everybody

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.720
do something
and we're going to give everybody a gold medal.”

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.399
That's
certainly that's part of the spirit. We recognize

00:20:57.399 --> 00:21:03.919
holding a world
record boost in self-esteem and a feeling

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:06.200
of achievement
that comes from that. But we don't want to

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.450
just be a
feel good thing. And we love competition.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.879
Nick
mentioned I've set a dozen records and they've

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:17.899
actually
all been beaten now. [laughter] Because I'm

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:20.870
the president of the
company and you know when I put up a new record

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.909
it will
get taken down. The first time it happened

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:25.999
to me it was
a very surreal experience. I had set at Burning

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:29.009
Man the world record for the
most times whistling happy birthday in one

00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:33.600
minute. And
we launched the site and we had the video

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.500
and one day a
submission came in from one teenage jerk from

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:44.360
San Diego
who had fit in one more happy birthday rendition.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.049
It's almost like somebody is covering your
song.

00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:50.850
It's really magical to watch these people
create these

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.130
really long tail record categories and then
watch them

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.249
evolve into something. You may have seen on
the front of

00:21:58.249 --> 00:22:00.919
the book. We have this guy here. This is one
of the

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:03.590
first submissions we ever got at record setter.
It came in

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:09.259
from Australia guy named Daniel Fowler. He
set a world record for the most giraffe tattoos

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:12.529
on a
shoulder and he sent us in a photo of him

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:17.620
with one giraffe. And he said like, "Alright.
You said that your rules are quantifiable,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:23.970
breakable media
evidence. This is all of that. It's one."

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.820
We laugh but we're also
like he gets the spirit of this. This is a

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.249
total
experiment. It's an ongoing work in progress.

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:34.769
And he
started the bar somewhere. And we thought

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:38.610
that record
was just going to sit. And then a, it goes

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.201
back to San
Diego -- a radio station in San Diego. They

00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:44.039
started
doing RecordSetter world record Wednesdays.

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:46.950
And one
morning they said, "Okay, everybody there's

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.390
this record
held by this guy in Australia named Daniel

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.090
Fowler who has one giraffe tattoos
on his shoulder and we've brought in a local

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.650
tattoo artist and we'll provide free tattoo
to any

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.509
listener whos willing to come in and get at
least two giraffe tattooed

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:06.909
on their shoulder. God bless San Diego. Like
about a half

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:10.620
a dozen listeners called up. Me, me, free
tattoo, like I

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.460
got nothing going on today. And this guy named
Mike

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.179
McDonalds, he took the day off of work. His
girlfriend

00:23:17.179 --> 00:23:25.269
was kind of ticked off. And he got three giraffes
tattooed on his shoulder. So then obviously

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:28.059
the guy in
Australia, Daniel Fowler, had his mind blown

00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:30.970
like what's going on here?
I just did this as kind of a joke and now

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.590
I've spurred
on. To us we always say that was a day for

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.559
better and
for worse this thing is working because people

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:43.110
are
competing against each other in all these

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.200
totally new
categories. Two months later I came into our

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.869
office in
New York and like everybody was like all giddy

00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:53.570
and I was
like what's going on what's going on? And

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.490
it turned out
Daniel Fowler the original guy in Australia

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.360
who had one
giraffe tattoo had gone out and he got three

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.460
more
giraffe tattoos. And sent us, you can see

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:10.169
him on the cover. He could not have been
more proud of the fact. It's the most cocky

00:24:10.169 --> 00:24:13.870
look I think
I've ever seen a human being give. We were

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.330
just down in
San Diego and Mike McDonald is still like

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:22.679
planning to
take this record back. [laughter] But, you

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:27.269
know, we also have
and so we have like, like we're so open. So

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:29.659
we don't
want to just be ironic records. We don't want

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:34.190
to just be
stupid records. Like we have, we've just are

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.139
discovering all these communities of people
that never

00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:41.490
really fit into the Guinness box. Ranging
from like a

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.230
ski ball tournament that love, that we would
recognize

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.169
all of their feats as world records. Most
balls rolled

00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:56.119
in 30 seconds or whatever. We have these pushup
champions around the world who are using our

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:59.529
platform now
and competing in categories like the most

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:07.799
one arm pushups in one minute while
wearing a 60 pound backpack. We've worked

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:12.429
a bunch with
charities. I guess we can pull up the Livestrong.

00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:13.690
&gt;&gt; Corey: [Inaudible]

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:23.419
&gt;&gt; Dan: We've done a partnership, there we
go. We've been doing a

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:28.990
partnership with Livestrong for the last year
plus.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.740
This was a breast cancer related record. Yeah,
but most

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.899
cigarettes ripped in half and the longest
drumming marathon to raise money for

00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:40.690
cancer research. The fastest time for young
adult cancer

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.200
survivors and their supporters to pull an
airplane 15 feet. So Livestrong

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.809
has they recognize that for years all they've
offered

00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:52.590
are you want to get involved you have to bike
across the

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.850
country or run a marathon and they're realizing
world records

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.810
can be this new way to engage the community
and people who

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.279
may not be interested in, you know, running
a marathon or

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.600
biking 4,000 miles but want to get involved.
So we've

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.779
been working with them. This is an amazing
video. This

00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:20.470
is one of my favorite records. Well, there's
a bunch of

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.640
good ones in here. You can see fastest time
to solve two

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.259
rubix cubes while playing Guitar Hero. You
guys want to take a peek at this?

00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:40.779
This in this kid is a shredder. {Video plays
guitar riff music]

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:54.509
&gt;&gt; Corey: He's showing his set up there.

00:26:54.509 --> 00:27:16.089
&gt;&gt; Dan: There he goes.
There he goes. [laughter] Oh yeah. [inaudible]

00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:35.830
&gt;&gt; Corey: All right. We're going to skip
ahead. All right. You get the idea.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:42.470
&gt;&gt; Dan: But are any of you
guys guitar hero experts/rubix cube solvers?

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.730
Because
this could be a fun new weekend activity.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:51.799
All of these
categories, we see these things come in and

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:54.799
we never
know which ones are going to become competitive.

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:58.850
You
know, Corey talks about imagining the way

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.369
that pole vault
came to be an Olympic sport. And it probably

00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:05.230
just began
with a couple of dudes with a stick and a

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.090
shrub and they
were just saying who can plant this thing

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:12.820
and fling
themselves over it. And they certainly were

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.309
not thinking
like this is someday going to be a global

00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:18.070
competitive
sport in which there are going to be wind

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.900
rules and you
have to use the right composition for your

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.570
pole and on
and on. All of these categories if you look

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.249
at any one
as a standalone category it might seem a little

00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:37.210
bit frivolous. But
our spirit is we'll see competition in I mean,

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.570
again like
from the giraffe tattoos to this is a great

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.200
category
also in the book. It's the most times smiling

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.070
while
listening to "Beat It." And this is became

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.129
a competitive
category. It was a girl in Philadelphia, Allison

00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:55.360
Harris who right after Michael Jackson passed
away she

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:03.840
wanted to make tribute through a world record.
Because I

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.950
just think it's so charming. She made this
-- let's see.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.899
She made this video. And then it got beaten
by another

00:29:12.899 --> 00:29:20.750
fan. There we go. So this, let me just find
the

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.539
original one. This is the current record holder
Christa.

00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:24.729
And she's featured in the book. Here's Allison.
[Video plays]

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:45.090
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Allison Harris and I'm going
to break

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:53.700
the record for most times smiling while listening
to

00:29:53.700 --> 00:30:06.619
Michael Jackson's song "Beat it." [inaudible]
[Beat It by Michael Jackson plays]

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:07.699
[laughter]

00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:16.710
&gt;&gt; Corey: It becomes an endurance challenge
for a four minute

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.389
song. Very sore facial muscles.

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:24.889
&gt;&gt; Dan: So you get the idea. Again all these
categories that

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:28.239
you just never know what's going to inspire
people and

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:31.980
where these things are going to lead to. A
category in the

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.169
book which has become kind of a global phenomenon
is the

00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:39.529
longest high 5. So these two guys in Canada
in Toronto

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:42.509
who call themselves the record collection
lined up

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:46.580
about three miles apart in downtown Toronto
on Young

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.539
street and they made rules you have to keep
your hand up

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:54.960
the entire run which is not easy to keep your
arms up for this length of time and

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.100
they had cameras follow them and they just
ran towards each other and completed what

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.929
was
literally the longest high 5. And it was such

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:07.159
a cool
video, such a fresh idea. So simple. And then

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:12.470
that
inspired two guys in Australia to step up

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.159
and beat the
world record. And then, they.

00:31:15.159 --> 00:31:17.629
&gt;&gt; Corey: An equally entertaining video.

00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:19.779
&gt;&gt; Dan: There was some controversy in their
attempt because

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:25.280
one of the guys on his run gave a quick high
5 to a passerby and there was headed debate

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.169
in our community about
whether that should make it, he kind of cheated.

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:33.679
We let
the existing record holders agree it should

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:36.259
be accepted.
And then it recently got beaten by a pair

00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:41.350
of guys in
Illinois. And now the guys in Toronto are

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.539
training. The
guys in Australia are training. To me that's

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:48.400
an example
of like okay this thing could turn into a

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.269
global
phenomenon. We have 10,000 of these things

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.960
and people
are creating new categories every day. Yeah,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.320
so we're
seeing a lot of fun things..

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.539
&gt;&gt; Corey: Should we leave--

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:03.179
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think you have five minutes or so.
Can you take some questions?

00:32:03.179 --> 00:32:05.159
&gt;&gt; Dan: Sure. And then we're going to get
you guys to set a

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:08.639
world record. We have one we'd like for you
guys to set.

00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:09.909
But please, let's do a couple of questions.

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:11.980
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Are you guys for profit and do
you have companies are

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:18.099
you going to companies to get them involved
like at Ford or [inaudible].

00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:24.100
&gt;&gt; Nick: Could you repeat the question?

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.090
&gt;&gt; Dan: Sure. The question was whether we're
for profit and

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.530
whether we're working with brands. The answer
is yes and

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.169
yes. A big part of our business model is built
around

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:36.259
not just traditional advertising but creating
branded

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:39.309
content. So, you know, an example we always
give is the

00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:41.730
fastest time to open a bag of Skittles and
sort them by

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.980
color was a record category that somebody
just created

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.779
and that's been beaten five or six times.
So now we've

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:50.850
just done a partnership with Stride gum where
there are

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:55.139
100 long, lasting world records that were
pushed out to their Facebook fans two and

00:32:55.139 --> 00:33:00.370
a half million fans. One record a day and
we got over 1,000 UGC videos in the

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:05.710
3-month period. So yeah, we do live events,
but the core of our brand partnerships are

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.610
digital.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:12.419
&gt;&gt; Corey:We debated the non-profit thing for
a while and I think

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:17.440
I read musicbrainz.org. It think they are
The non-profit around music. And

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.070
the guy was saying he was going to try to
go to

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.779
conference and needed somebody's couch to
sleep on. We

00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:32.399
said alright, we can't do that. We need to
be able to feed

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:35.629
ourselves and grow our team. So.

00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:37.519
&gt;&gt; Dan: Hey Michael.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.399
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible].

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:43.629
&gt;&gt; Dan: Yeah. I mean, this is definitely an
issue. Sorry --

00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:46.639
the question is what kind of liabilities issues
we're

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:50.039
dealing with. It's certainly a topic that
we're very

00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:53.360
conscious of and aware of. We have a set of
principles

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.330
that we push out to our community. The first
and biggest

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:01.360
one being, "don't hurt yourself; don't hurt
others; don't

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.799
hurt the environment.” We're not the hugest
fans of

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:08.870
consumption eating records. We say very explicitly
if

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.390
you have any concerns about the safety of
your records

00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:15.450
please contact us first or talk with the most
responsible

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:20.490
person that you know. And yeah. I mean, I
think we try

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.860
to curate the site in a way that will let
some of

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.880
those records live in the corners, but we
really are

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.070
trying to create a culture based around, you
know, world

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.250
records that are truly raising the bar of
human

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.320
achievement in some manner.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.200
&gt;&gt; Corey: I think there's also something to
be said for in a

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.650
lot of ways one of the main differences between
us and

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.740
Guinness is that those are Guinness' records.
That's

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.720
their body that they kind of sanctioned this
is the

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.410
record they want people to break. And I think
our model

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:53.919
is the records belong to the people that are
creating,

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:57.300
setting the records. So I mean, I think the
legal

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:02.940
distinction may not matter. But I think there's
something to like when you set a RecordSetter

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.890
set a
world record, that's your property. That's

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.470
your thing.
Whoever sets the new record gets to set the

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:16.570
rules. So
they're sort of owning how it will get shaped.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:17.570
You know,
for things like the book obviously, were not

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.570
going to put in something dangerous in there
but.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.339
&gt;&gt;Nick: So for time, if were going to set
a record we probably should get to it.

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:27.410
&gt;&gt; Dan: Sure. So since we're here at Google,
we look through

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.680
and we found some amazing Google records we
have. I

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.660
mentioned the medical symptoms one. We have
like most I

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.920
think e-mails in unread e-mails I think. But
this is

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.510
one that we felt we could beat. And I think
we're going

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:46.790
to have enough people to do it. This is the
largest group simultaneously searching the

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.932
same thing on
Google. This was.

00:35:48.932 --> 00:35:49.932
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:35:49.932 --> 00:35:50.932
[cheering]

00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:56.670
&gt;&gt; Dan: This was a summer camp, tech camp
in Arizona.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:02.950
[Video playing in background]

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.880
&gt;&gt; Male in video: We're going to have the
largest group of people

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.790
searching for the same thing at the same time.
And we're

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.800
searching ID tech. So here we go. Let's all
type it in.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.420
&gt;&gt; Dan: All right. So this is the category
that's been

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.970
created. Do any of you guys have a suggestion
of

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.090
something and does everybody have, I imagine
everybody

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.790
has a device of some sort? A computer or -- can
we make

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.990
sure we're going to get 17 people we can participate?
We

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:28.280
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
--

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.830
&gt;&gt; Corey: We can pull some people out from
the hallway.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.140
&gt;&gt;Female #1: We can grab some people.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:39.310
&gt;&gt; Dan: All right. Let's do it. Okay. And
who has are

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.870
you going to shoot that on your phone.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.630
&gt;&gt; Corey: I can, yeah. Tell them they'll get
a world record holder

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.280
patch if they participate.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.220
&gt;&gt; Dan: And we need a word..

00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:13.460
&gt;&gt; Corey: Yeah, we need a term to search for.
What's the name of a conference room in here.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.750
Have
any clever?

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.040
&gt;&gt; Dan: Hi Michael.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.040
&gt;&gt; Corey: Rusty badger or something like that?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.619
&gt;&gt; Male #3: There's a Dirty Harry.

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:22.910
&gt;&gt; Corey: Dirty Harry?

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:26.680
&gt;&gt; Dan: Dirty Harry. Do you guys want to do
that?

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.030
&gt;&gt;Nick: How about we do a word [inaudible].

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.700
&gt;&gt; Dan: There we go.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.710
&gt;&gt; Corey: Good suggestion.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.380
&gt;&gt; Dan: There we go.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.190
&gt;&gt; Corey: It's your record so [pause] I'm
ready. So what are we

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.160
searching for? The meaning of Google spelled
mathematical way?

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.610
&gt;&gt;Nick: Or just, yeah, search for g-o-o-g-l-e.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.610
&gt;&gt; Corey: Okay..

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.060
&gt;&gt; Dan: So let's wait until we have, yes.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.960
&gt;&gt; Corey: I'm ready to go.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.120
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120
[laughter]

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:04.250
&gt;&gt; Dan: [clears throat] Okay. We're here at
Google San Francisco trying to

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.220
beat an existing record setter world record
for the most

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.220
people to simultaneously search the same thing
on Google.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.060
The current record is held by a technology
camp in Tempe,

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.650
Arizona. This summer they got 16 people to
get together

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.340
and all Google something at the same time.
We are

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.250
now trying to get more than 16 people to get
together and Google something at the same

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:32.030
time. Suggestion from the room was to
Google G-o-o-g-o-l, the original word googol.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:37.210
So if
everybody could prepare the word googol. And

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.210
then—

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.609
&gt;&gt; Corey: I will come around and confirm that
we have all searched.

00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:47.670
&gt;&gt; Dan: Okay. Yes. The most people to simultaneously
Google

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.400
the same thing at the same time.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.590
&gt;&gt; Corey: Everyone ready? You want to count
us down.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.410
&gt;&gt; Dan: Let's make the Googling happen.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.310
&gt;&gt; Corey: 3, 2, 1 -- go..

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:08.120
&gt;&gt; Dan: See? Some of these -- let's see some
screens. All

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.740
Right, googol, googol, googol, yes, this is
looking

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.740
kosher.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.880
&gt;&gt;Male #4: The tensions mounting.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.920
&gt;&gt; Dan: We are looking good.
[laughter] Let's see these screens.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:26.840
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I won the world's most largest
toaster. And I.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.570
&gt;&gt; Dan: Lots of screens. Oh yeah, this is
looking good.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:35.560
&gt;&gt; Corey: Dan, you need to search, you need
to search, your 16.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.640
&gt;&gt; Dan: Oh, okay, hold on.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.810
&gt;&gt; Female #2: But that one was beaten recently,
actually so.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:49.310
&gt;&gt; Dan: I'm going to add in my search. Hold
on. Ohh, ohh, okay.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:54.950
G-O-O-G-O-L. And it's coming. It's coming.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:40:01.530
&gt;&gt; Female # 3: But how do you know?

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.350
&gt;&gt; Dan: How do we know what?

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:07.280
&gt;&gt; Like what if maybe more than this group
of people have

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.360
searched Justin Bieber.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.480
&gt;&gt; Dan: So there's the spirit.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.890
&gt;&gt; Corey: So there's 17.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.620
&gt;&gt; Woo. [applause]

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.350
&gt;&gt; Corey: Congratulations.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.430
&gt;&gt; Dan: So we're going to wrap up, but that's
an excellent

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.890
question that was asked. How do we know this
is an

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:23.540
existing world record? Our general spirit
is that it's a record

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.870
until proven otherwise. So if a group of Bieber
fans see

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:31.390
this record and they say "Why, at Bieber fest
'09 we had 300

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.740
people Google' Justin Bieber is cute' at the
same time."

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.690
Great, give us the evidence. Submit it to
RecordSetter

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.400
and we'll recognize your feat. It's all a
work in

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.340
progress. And that's, you know, it really
is such a

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.040
pleasure that we get to make this our full-time
job now. [laughter]

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.010
Like, we couldn't be having more fun. And
we really feel

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.150
we're doing something that's interesting and
exciting and

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.410
participatory and you know ties into all the
things that

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.580
make the Internet wonderful. So thanks for
coming. And

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.880
we'll stick around if you guys have any more
questions.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.310
&gt;&gt; Corey: Come get a patch. A world record
holder patch.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.590
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Oh, wow.
[Applause]
