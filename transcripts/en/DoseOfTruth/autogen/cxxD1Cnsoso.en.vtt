and he lighted upon a certain place and

that place and put them for his pillows
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500
that place and put them for his pillows
which seems to indicate very bad

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
which seems to indicate very bad
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.770

that place to sleep and he dreamed and
beheld a ladder set up on the earth and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
beheld a ladder set up on the earth and
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.380
beheld a ladder set up on the earth and
the top of it reached to heaven and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
the top of it reached to heaven and
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600
the top of it reached to heaven and
beheld the angels of God ascending and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
beheld the angels of God ascending and
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580
beheld the angels of God ascending and
descending on it and behold the Lord

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
descending on it and behold the Lord
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289
descending on it and behold the Lord
stood above it and said I am the Lord

so this story of Jacob's Ladder has

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
so this story of Jacob's Ladder has
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999
so this story of Jacob's Ladder has
really possessed the imagination of the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
really possessed the imagination of the
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190
really possessed the imagination of the
West and there's a reason for that it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
West and there's a reason for that it's
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319
West and there's a reason for that it's
because it's an archetypal story because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
because it's an archetypal story because
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.999
because it's an archetypal story because
the idea of a ladder that reaches to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
the idea of a ladder that reaches to
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800
the idea of a ladder that reaches to
heaven is one of the oldest ideas of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
heaven is one of the oldest ideas of
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.960
heaven is one of the oldest ideas of
mankind so you find it widely

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
mankind so you find it widely
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730
mankind so you find it widely
distributed among the shamanic cultures

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
distributed among the shamanic cultures
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620
distributed among the shamanic cultures
for example and it's a hallmark of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
for example and it's a hallmark of
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450
for example and it's a hallmark of
psychedelic experience that's another

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
psychedelic experience that's another
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160
psychedelic experience that's another
way of thinking about it which is a very

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
way of thinking about it which is a very
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.889
way of thinking about it which is a very
peculiar thing so there's one

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899
peculiar thing so there's one
 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.569
peculiar thing so there's one
representation of of the ladder you see

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
representation of of the ladder you see
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.389
representation of of the ladder you see
god up at the top there peeking out from

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
god up at the top there peeking out from
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.030
god up at the top there peeking out from
the clouds now you know that's sort of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
the clouds now you know that's sort of
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.420
the clouds now you know that's sort of
where we get the idea that God is in in

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
where we get the idea that God is in in
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010
where we get the idea that God is in in
heaven and then heavens up in the sky

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
heaven and then heavens up in the sky
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.580
heaven and then heavens up in the sky
and and that's an easy story to make fun

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
and and that's an easy story to make fun
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649
and and that's an easy story to make fun
of because you know we've gone up to the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
of because you know we've gone up to the
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780
of because you know we've gone up to the
moon and there's no God there and and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
moon and there's no God there and and
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.680
moon and there's no God there and and
but but this this is not a reasonable

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
but but this this is not a reasonable
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.170
but but this this is not a reasonable
way of conceptualizing what these

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
way of conceptualizing what these
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.350
way of conceptualizing what these
experiences are about

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
experiences are about
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.230
experiences are about
these experiences what this is the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
these experiences what this is the
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.270
these experiences what this is the
opening up there that's more like an

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280
opening up there that's more like an
 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130
opening up there that's more like an
opening into an alternate dimension

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140
opening into an alternate dimension
 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.840
opening into an alternate dimension
that's a better way of thinking about

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850
that's a better way of thinking about
 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.670
that's a better way of thinking about
it's beyond like from from the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
it's beyond like from from the
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.230
it's beyond like from from the
judeo-christian perspective one of the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240
judeo-christian perspective one of the
 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.460
judeo-christian perspective one of the
things you have to understand is that

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
things you have to understand is that
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.040
things you have to understand is that
God is beyond space and time he's not in

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
God is beyond space and time he's not in
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.320
God is beyond space and time he's not in
the universe he's outside the universe

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
the universe he's outside the universe
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.710
the universe he's outside the universe
in some manner and so the idea that that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
in some manner and so the idea that that
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.240
in some manner and so the idea that that
you have an experience of God and it's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
you have an experience of God and it's
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.120
you have an experience of God and it's
up isn't the OP is the best that the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
up isn't the OP is the best that the
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.490
up isn't the OP is the best that the
human imagination can do with what's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
human imagination can do with what's
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.560
human imagination can do with what's
essentially a form of extra dimensional

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570
essentially a form of extra dimensional
 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.350
essentially a form of extra dimensional
experience or that's the the best way to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360
experience or that's the the best way to
 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.240
experience or that's the the best way to
conceptualize it and these experiences

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
conceptualize it and these experiences
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.400
conceptualize it and these experiences
aren't rare you know they they make the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
aren't rare you know they they make the
 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.650
aren't rare you know they they make the
they make up the core of of the shamanic

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
they make up the core of of the shamanic
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.960
they make up the core of of the shamanic
tradition and so there's an intrusion of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
tradition and so there's an intrusion of
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.760
tradition and so there's an intrusion of
the ancient shamanic tradition which is

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770
the ancient shamanic tradition which is
 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.550
the ancient shamanic tradition which is
tens of thousands of years old into the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
tens of thousands of years old into the
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.110
tens of thousands of years old into the
biblical stories at this point

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
biblical stories at this point
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.070
biblical stories at this point
now why Jacob had a essentially shamanic

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080
now why Jacob had a essentially shamanic
 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.750
now why Jacob had a essentially shamanic
experience is very difficult to tell

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
experience is very difficult to tell
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.160
experience is very difficult to tell
because we don't know what these old

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
because we don't know what these old
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.870
because we don't know what these old
people were up to right and we don't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
people were up to right and we don't
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.590
people were up to right and we don't
know how much of the archaic tradition

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
know how much of the archaic tradition
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.240
know how much of the archaic tradition
archaic religious tradition was still

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
archaic religious tradition was still
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.210
archaic religious tradition was still
extant at that point in time but we

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
extant at that point in time but we
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.710
extant at that point in time but we
certainly do know that our ancient

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
certainly do know that our ancient
 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.130
certainly do know that our ancient
forebears were using psychedelic

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140
forebears were using psychedelic
 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.199
forebears were using psychedelic
substances constantly like Amanita

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209
substances constantly like Amanita
 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.940
substances constantly like Amanita
muscaria mushrooms for example which

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
muscaria mushrooms for example which
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040
muscaria mushrooms for example which
were widely used in India before they

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050
were widely used in India before they
 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.930
were widely used in India before they
became extinct that's the theory anyways

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
became extinct that's the theory anyways
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.000
became extinct that's the theory anyways
that seemed to be the basis of the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010
that seemed to be the basis of the
 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.790
that seemed to be the basis of the
chemical soma which much has been

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800
chemical soma which much has been
 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.270
chemical soma which much has been
written about and so we here ever this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280
written about and so we here ever this
 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.550
written about and so we here ever this
as a dream or as a vision and perhaps

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
as a dream or as a vision and perhaps
 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.080
as a dream or as a vision and perhaps
that's what it was but perhaps that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090
that's what it was but perhaps that
 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.030
that's what it was but perhaps that
wasn't what it was either and perhaps it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
wasn't what it was either and perhaps it
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.280
wasn't what it was either and perhaps it
was an experience that was induced by or

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
was an experience that was induced by or
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.699
was an experience that was induced by or
by the same processes that shamanic

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709
by the same processes that shamanic
 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.170
by the same processes that shamanic
people have always induced these

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
people have always induced these
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.340
people have always induced these
experiences and so we're gonna go

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350
experiences and so we're gonna go
 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.350
experiences and so we're gonna go
through this a little bit so anyways

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360
through this a little bit so anyways
 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.060
through this a little bit so anyways
there's a there's a connection between

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070
there's a there's a connection between
 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.860
there's a there's a connection between
heaven and earth that opens up that's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
heaven and earth that opens up that's
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.220
heaven and earth that opens up that's
that's that's the that's the vision and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230
that's that's the that's the vision and
 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.990
that's that's the that's the vision and
there's messengers moving up and down

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
there's messengers moving up and down
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
there's messengers moving up and down
now one way you can conceptualize that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010
now one way you can conceptualize that
 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.710
now one way you can conceptualize that
is psychologically as we already

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720
is psychologically as we already
 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.160
is psychologically as we already
discussed that you know there there are

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170
discussed that you know there there are
 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.990
discussed that you know there there are
forces within you that are active and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
forces within you that are active and
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.479
forces within you that are active and
alive and you can think of them in some

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489
alive and you can think of them in some
 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.729
alive and you can think of them in some
sense as messengers of the higher self

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
sense as messengers of the higher self
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.620
sense as messengers of the higher self
and so you could think about this as an

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630
and so you could think about this as an
 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.670
and so you could think about this as an
image of a psychological reality but

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680
image of a psychological reality but
 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.490
image of a psychological reality but
and so we can stick with that but but

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
and so we can stick with that but but
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.780
and so we can stick with that but but
here's some of the representations that

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790
here's some of the representations that
 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.760
here's some of the representations that
have been made I really like the one on

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770
have been made I really like the one on
 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.340
have been made I really like the one on
the right that's William Blake I like

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350
the right that's William Blake I like
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.700
the right that's William Blake I like
the helix idea and I don't think that

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
the helix idea and I don't think that
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.340
the helix idea and I don't think that
that's that's fluke there are helixes

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350
that's that's fluke there are helixes
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.990
that's that's fluke there are helixes
and double helixes and all sorts of

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000
and double helixes and all sorts of
 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.629
and double helixes and all sorts of
imaging imagery very ancient and very

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639
imaging imagery very ancient and very
 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.520
imaging imagery very ancient and very
modern that are associated with both

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530
modern that are associated with both
 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.070
modern that are associated with both
healing and with this kind of vision so

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080
healing and with this kind of vision so
 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.920
healing and with this kind of vision so
and you see it in the Blake

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930
and you see it in the Blake
 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.390
and you see it in the Blake
representation God is associated with

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400
representation God is associated with
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.240
representation God is associated with
well really with the Sun and with light

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250
well really with the Sun and with light
 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.370
well really with the Sun and with light
and and you see that on the left as well

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380
and and you see that on the left as well
 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.740
and and you see that on the left as well
that wherever God is is where light is

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750
that wherever God is is where light is
 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.900
that wherever God is is where light is
and so that's a very interesting idea as

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910
and so that's a very interesting idea as
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.050
and so that's a very interesting idea as
far as I'm concerned as well
