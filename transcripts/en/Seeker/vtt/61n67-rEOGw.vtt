00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.090
I don't think ancient humans were complaining
about pains from how they "slept funny," so

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:15.740
if we're the same species, what's wrong with
us?

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.490
Aches and pains are just part of life, but
do you think our cave, tree or grassland dwelling

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.710
ancestors gave a crap about little aches?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.439
Maybe they just didn't get them as much.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.460
A story making the rounds this week claims
to have an answer -- our posture is bad; like,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
really bad.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.950
A California acupuncturist with chronic back
pain travelled the world exploring cultures

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.820
where chronic back pain wasn't common and
attempted to reverse engineer their lifestyle

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.820
choices.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
She observed cultures where women and men
spent their days working in fields, carrying

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.480
heavy objects on their heads, or quote "hunched
over weaving, for hours," and noted that none

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.320
of them had back pain, even though many were
very old.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.520
Her explanation?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Posture.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.610
Based on her observations, the spine shouldn't
form an S, but a J. Looking at these people,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.690
late 19th century medical texts, and statues
from ancient cultures, all told her we were

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.180
messing with our spines!

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
This is a totally plausible reason for pain,
evolution guided us to the proper posture

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.250
-- and our social culture has altered it -- but
this wasn't a scientific study, just a number

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.330
of case studies.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.590
That being said, there are a number of studies
saying we Americans (and many others) probably

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.310
ARE doing things wrong.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.710
There's a TON of talk around the office about
how we sit in hairs, and my mom used to yell

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.460
at me about slouching.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.580
If the acupuncturist I mentioned is right,
then sitting up straight COULD help, but if

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.140
non-science isn't enough, studies from San
Francisco State University have found keeping

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.380
up straight when seated correlates with generating
more positive memories, whereas walking slumped

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.160
decreases your energy levels.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.790
So listen to my mother, and fix your posture!

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.650
You'd think something you do once a day (or
maybe more!) you'd be good at, but you might

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.340
want to sit down for this one: you're pooping
wrong.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.659
Evolution didn't involve toilets.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:10.939
Not even once.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.230
Instead, humans would, like other animals,
squat!

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.629
Our human anatomy isn't made to push out a
half-pound (120g) of waste while sitting down,

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.700
instead, we’re supposed to be squatting
with the thighs running parallel to the abdomen!

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.329
A 2003 study in Digestive Diseases and Sciences
found people who squatted pooped faster, and

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.109
with less effort than those on a toilet!

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.209
A separate study from 2010 x-rayed people
while they pooped out a fluid that had been

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.480
put INTO their colons and they found abdominal
strain was way lower for squatting than sitting!

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.680
I love science.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:03:00.969
You don't have to rip the porcelain throne
out of the bathroom though, just get a shorter

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.419
one, or even put a stool underfoot to help
align your legs and abs!

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.650
Since the late 1500s when the flush toilet
swirled into our midst, we've been pooping

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.760
wrong -- and now we're having problems with
our our bowels.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.139
Pooping wrong creates all sorts of problems
with constipation and, more seriously, the

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.769
abdominal strain causes painful swelling and
bleeding of the veins around your anus -- that

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.959
is hemorrhoids!

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.540
In the US, eighty percent of the population
will have a sleep-related back problem at

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.040
some point in our lives, and yet… we treat
the symptom not the disease.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.409
We spend one third of our lives asleep, but
we're terrible at that too.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.069
Sleeping on our stomachs is bad for the spine,
the fetal position hunches the back and leads

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.830
to neck AND back pain.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.939
Sleeping on medium-firm to firm mattresses
FAR better for the alignment of the back than

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.059
too soft or too hard.

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:56.069
And if you don't want to swap mattresses,
at least switch to sleeping on your back;

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.949
it's supposed to be the best for a natural
spine position.

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.870
Again, think about our evolution, we didn't
evolve to sleep on a pillowtop, but on a thinly

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.980
cushioned patch of grass or dirt.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.900
Today, about one-third of Americans in their
50s have some kind of chronic pain in their

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.159
neck or back; another quarter have pain in
their knees or legs, and another 18 percent

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.049
reported more general pain.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.080
According to a Gallup poll, chronic pain increases
from age 25 to 60 before it levels out.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.910
There are a number of correlations to obesity,
lower income, but overall -- enjoy your early

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.940
20s, because after that you start FALLING
APART.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:55.190
Regardless, with a few simple tweaks, we can
all sleep, walk, sit 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:05.389
and poop better.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.370
Thanks science.
