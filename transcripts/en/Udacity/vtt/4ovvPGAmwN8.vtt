00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.719
Selecting by tag is less than helpful.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.140
In fact, if you think you need to use jQuery to select all of a specific tag on

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.060
a page, you might want to rethink what you're doing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.310
because there's probably a better way to accomplish what you're trying to do.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.880
Usually, we only want to select a handful of DOM elements for changes.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.530
Classes offer a more specific selector that's much more

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.470
applicable to the real world.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.810
To select all elements of a certain class name,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.900
simply pass the class name with a dot in front as a string to the jQuery object.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.990
For instance, if you want to select all elements of class green, you could call

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.320
the jQuery object and pass it a string of a dot followed by green.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.640
This string that you're passing in looks a lot like a CSS selector, and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.090
that's because it is.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.820
In fact, any valid CSS selector is also valid in jQuery.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.800
For this quiz, you'll be working with the sample page again.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
I want you to select all elements of the class article-item, and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090
save them to variable articles.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.560
Once again, you can check your work by console.logging the resulting

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.370
jQuery collection.
