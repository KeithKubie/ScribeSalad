00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.828
This line y equals, that our curve heads towards, but never quite reaches as x

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.362
goes to positive infinity and to negative infinity is called a horizontal

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:12.040
asymptote. Let's look at another rational function and see if we can find its

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.386
horizontal asymptote. In fact, why don't we return to that other function we

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:21.692
were working with before. f of x equals 1 over 3x. What is its horizontal

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:25.380
asymptote? Make sure that the answer you give is the equation of a horizontal

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.340
line.
