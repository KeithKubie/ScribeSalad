00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.140
Of course, optimizing the number of bytes transferred is important.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.630
You may expect that optimizing network usage just means minimizing

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.670
the number of bytes transferred. Things like, don't send a

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.190
multi megabyte image to a phone when it's only going

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.329
to be rendered at a small pixel size. That's certainly

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.020
part of it, but there's other things at play, too.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.250
And in the end, all of these things are important.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.390
How often we send requests needs to be optimized for the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.300
latency of the particular cellular network, and we

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.470
have to be careful about the power consumption, as

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.740
well. Although it's less important now, we do still

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.410
need to optimize for the maximum allowed TCP connections.
