Next up--
Ebony And Ivory Tower.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.806
According to a <i>New-sweek-- </i>
as I like to call it--

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.608
article that came out today,

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:12.913
the awesomest president-elect
ever, Donald Trump, is

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.281
putting his business interests
ahead

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.749
of what's best for the U.S.,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.751
which is not cool,
because you're supposed

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.686
to represent the interests
of the people,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.523
or person who got you elected.
Uh...

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.959
-Trump... Trump...
-(laughter and groaning)

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.862
Trump dealt with the damaging
<i>Newsweek</i> story head-on

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.832
by ignoring it and hanging out
with Kanye West at Trump Tower.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.134
-(laughter) -We've been friends
for a long time.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:37.771
Life. We discussed life.

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.978
(laughter)

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.381
Now, I'm going
to play this again, and

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.483
I want to you watch this
and think about this.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.151
Kanye looks like
a (bleep) android.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.853
Watch. Look, look, look.
Play it again.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.888
-Play it again. Watch. -We've
been friends for a long time.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.123
WOMAN: What did you guys
discuss?

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.824
Life. We discussed life.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:03.664
-He's not processing.
-Processing. -(laughter)

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.098
This is... I'm... This...
You know what?

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.067
This is Kanye Westworld.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.837
-(laughter)
-Kanye later tweeted that

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.307
he met Trump to talk about
multicultural issues which...

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.844
(laughter)

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.779
I believe as nearly
as we could figure

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.482
that mainly involved
teaching him this handshake.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.687
-(indistinct chatter)
-FEIMSTER: Oh, yeah. Oh!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.922
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.458
-Look at. Look at that guy.
-Look at the side of him.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.661
That guy's like,
"I cannot believe this (bleep)!"

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.164
-Right. -(laughter) -KASHER:
He's just like, "You just

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.867
nailed that handshake so hard,
Trump!"

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.103
-(laughter) -The writer
of the <i>Newsweek</i> article claims

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.571
that Trump is trying
to distract people

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.373
from his conflicts of interest,
which seems

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.208
pretty farfetched, uh, becau...

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:50.410
Wait. We were we just
talking about?

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.145
-(laughter)
-Oh, you guys,

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.548
-Trump and Kanye are buddies.
-FEIMSTER: It worked!

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.984
-(laughter)
-Comedians, the next time

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.652
there's a big story
he wants to bury,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.255
who will President-elect Trump
meet with? Kurt.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.992
Himself in a mirror whispering,
"What have I become?"

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.660
-HARDWICK: Yeah, all right.
-(laughter)

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.796
-Points. Yeah. Moshe.
-Uh, Leonard Cohen.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.165
Or, uh, uh, Prince.
Or... hopefully.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.433
-HARDWICK: All right.
-Ow!

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.235
-HARDWICK: Points.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.538
-Fortune Feimster. -I think
he should just go for it.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.673
Meet with Vladimir Putin,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.476
they both take their shirts off,
just lather themselves

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.279
in spray tan,
ride horses into the sunset...

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:25.379
-HARDWICK: Yeah.
-...and never come back.
