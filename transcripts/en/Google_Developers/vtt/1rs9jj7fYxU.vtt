00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.109
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.740
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.680
My name is Claudio.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.030
I'm an engineer on the
Google Drive SDK

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.300
Developer Relations team.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.360
And this Eric, our
tech lead for the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.970
documentation on the same team.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.620
Welcome, Eric.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.980
This is the first time
for you live.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.540
ERIC GILMORE: Thank
you, Claudio.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.140
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And today,
we want to talk about our

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.860
documentation.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.950
We got a lot of feedback
on our documentation.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.140
And Eric spent a lot of time
working through that feedback,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.720
and he's going to share some
of the results with you.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.360
ERIC GILMORE: I hate to start
by correcting you, Claudio.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540
But a lot of feedback is
a slight exaggeration.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.370
And we always want
more feedback.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.090
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.360
ERIC GILMORE: That's why the
very first thing we're going

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.260
to show you when we switch to
this monitor is a new feature

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.610
in our SDK documentation, which
is this link here at the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.990
upper right, which you
can use to send

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.360
feedback directly to me.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.849
I'll share it with the
team, of course.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.750
And we'll act on your feedback
as quickly as we can and as

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.970
thoroughly as we can.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.310
But this right here, I'd like
to show you, is the link.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.600
You can type some things,
hopefully something a little

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.980
bit more intelligible
than that.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
and remember,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.860
he is the tech writer.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.760
So that was absolutely
meaningful.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.240
ERIC GILMORE: And I think
this is a great feature.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.250
You can actually highlight
screenshots, verbiage,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.110
whatever you'd like
to talk about,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.880
and submit that feedback.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.260
What about the other button
there, the blackout?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.425
ERIC GILMORE: Ah.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:42.590
If you want to remove some
information that you would

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.210
like to hide from the world,
personal information about

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.340
yourself, pictures of your
children, your name, whatever,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.200
you can black it
out like that.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.160
And that is what we'll
see when you send the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.560
feedback, like so.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.990
ERIC GILMORE: We encourage
you to use this link.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.950
Please use it.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.060
We want more feedback.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.490
That's really what I'm saying.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.360
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
That's great.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.520
So you said there was a
link on that top right

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.560
corner of the page.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.700
Is that available everywhere?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.200
ERIC GILMORE: That should be
available on every page,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.030
starting from our landing page
to the deepest details in our

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.870
documentation, including some of
the pages that we're going

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.430
to talk about today,
which is here.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.930
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.210
And that is not the only way
for people to give us

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.890
feedback, right?

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.920
If they have questions, they
also have other channels,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.230
including Stack Overflow, which
is our main channel for

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.840
developer questions.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.790
ERIC GILMORE: Sure.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.150
And if you'd like to ask
questions about the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.830
documentation or give feedback
about the documentation there

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.950
or in this form, either
way is terrific.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.740
Just make sure that you feel
free to give us your feedback.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.020
And so I said we got
a lot of feedback.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.090
Well, let's say we got
some feedback.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.670
And what kind of feedback
have we got?

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.050
ERIC GILMORE: Well, most of or
feedback has centered around

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.670
the Getting Started experience
for our Drive SDK.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.680
And acting on it, we've made a
few changes to this page that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.010
we're demonstrating right now.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.010
The main common thread in the
feedback we received on this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.780
page is it was a little bit
confusing what your options

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.360
are for integrating
with Drive.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.720
At the moment, we have basically
two levels of

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.890
integration.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.890
One level of integration is
basic drive API access, which

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.890
enables you to make calls
to the API and receive--

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.740
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So, for
instance, whenever you want to

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.470
write a script or install an
application that reads your

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.080
file, writes files to drive,
even a web application is, of

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.650
course, fine that wants
to access your

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.120
files on Google Drive.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.930
But you don't want your
application to show up

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.320
on the Drive UI.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.140
And if instead you want to, you
can also get that, right?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.900
ERIC GILMORE: Yes.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.360
Without giving too much away,
we may have more options in

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.830
that general area soon.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.830
But currently, there's that
level, which to get that level

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.240
of integration, all you need to
do is enable the drive API

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.380
in your API project.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.430
More involved, more complete, we
think more featureful level

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.120
of integration is integrating
with the drive UI

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.400
and Chrome Web Store.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Why would
a developer do that?

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.350
ERIC GILMORE: Well, a developer
might very well like

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.770
to have the open width and
create new behavior that we

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.310
provide in the Drive UI, which
is essentially what you'd find

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.440
in Windows or Mac file systems
where you open a document with

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440
a particular application.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do we
want to show that?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.210
ERIC GILMORE: I think
we might.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.460
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.990
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
start with Create.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.250
Here are a number of wonderful
Google formats you could use

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.480
to create documents, but to
create documents with

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.300
applications integrated with
Google Drive, you come to this

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.370
More option.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.830
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And you
install an application first.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.240
ERIC GILMORE: Ah, there
aren't any Google--

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.330
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Really?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.030
Any third-party applications?

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.960
So maybe we want to install one
from the Chrome website?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.750
ERIC GILMORE: Let's do that.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.250
Great idea, Claudio.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.010
Fortunately, here is the entire
collection of Drive

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.840
apps that we can select from.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.620
What do you think, Claudio?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.210
This is your account.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, that's
my personal account.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.230
So feel free to destroy it.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.415
ERIC GILMORE: How about Loupe?

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:37.445
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Loupe
seems great, yeah.

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.830
ERIC GILMORE: OK,
sign in to add.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.120
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, because
we need to sign in.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.430
We opened this page
before loading.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.940
Just reload the page,
and I'm signed it.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.760
So now it knows that I'm me.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.630
And we can actually install
an application.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.830
ERIC GILMORE: At Chrome.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So that's
all you need to install an

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.330
application.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.520
Just goes to the Chrome
Web Store, just click

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.940
once, and that's it.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.150
ERIC GILMORE: The applications
that you've installed will

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.340
show up in your New tab page.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.470
So every time I open one of
those, I'll have the option of

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.320
going straight to Loupe.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.980
Or where we started with
this discussion--

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.300
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.690
And as soon as we go back here--
so we refresh the page.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.880
And we get a message
saying that an

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.640
application was installed.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.270
And in this case, it's Loupe.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.610
And so now, we can create
a new Loupe collage.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.100
Of course, I have
to authorize it.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.350
Feel free to authorize the
application on my behalf since

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.250
you're using my account.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.440
ERIC GILMORE: Let's see.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.790
It's not asking for anything
too particular.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.120
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, we
know this application.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.400
It's very good.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.670
ERIC GILMORE: We've
allowed access.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
And then, you can

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.000
create a photo collage.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.940
And that's what Loupe can do.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.500
ERIC GILMORE: We don't
need to go that far.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, we can
go back to the Drive UI.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.090
What about the Open-With?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.610
ERIC GILMORE: Now, do you have
an image file in here?

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.100
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I might.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.130
But even the first file, which
is a PDF, can be something

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.290
that I can open with
something else.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.420
ERIC GILMORE: Can we open
that with Loupe?

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.990
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, it's
probably not confidential.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.950
Not with Loupe.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.840
We have Google Drive here.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.320
ERIC GILMORE: This
is interesting.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.720
I think you can see
pretty clearly how

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.940
Open-With is going to work.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.210
We go to this contextual menu.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.820
We select from installed
applications.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.540
For this particular type of
file, our only option appears

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.970
to be the Google Drive Viewer.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.320
But here's something that I'm
very happy to show you, is

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.370
when we open this file in the
Google Drive Viewer--

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And I'm glad
that you opened a file

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.790
that is not confidential.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.340
It's not my private document.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.520
I'm glad you did that.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520
ERIC GILMORE: Excellent.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.550
Down here, we can actually get
a filtered list of Drive apps

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.280
that are capable of opening
that type of file.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.400
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Can
you go back to that?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.310
I didn't see it.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.810
ERIC GILMORE: Sure.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.880
Can we go back to it this way?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh,
it's another topic.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.420
ERIC GILMORE: We have
to do this again.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.600
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, so here
you said in the bottom

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.580
left corner, we have a new icon
that's added that can

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.720
discover apps that can open
this kind of file.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.310
So we, under this new feature
which checks what file you're

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.240
looking at, and says, well, I
can open this file with a

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.820
Google Drive Viewer, and
you're seeing it.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.190
But if you want, there are
other applications in the

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.980
Chrome Web Store that can also
open the file that maybe have

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.220
additional functionalities.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.310
And you clicked on it.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.690
And then in the next stop then,
you see that there are

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.470
two applications in the Chrome
Web Store that can open that

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.890
specific kind of file.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.360
And so if you want, you can
just install one and go

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.490
directly from there.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.159
ERIC GILMORE: Now, this is one
of the reasons that you might

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.610
want to integrate with Chrome
Web Store and have the full UI

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.330
integration.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.250
That's essentially an upsell on
your application that lets

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.440
people know that you can open
these documents with your app.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.660
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's make it
clear because this changed

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.240
since Version 1 of
the Drive SDK.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.830
In Version 1, you had to
integrate your application

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.360
with the Chrome Web Store
for it to work.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.950
Now, with Version 2 of the API,
which we launched the

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.390
Google I/O a month ago, the
installation requirement is

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.940
not a requirement anymore.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.840
So you can write your
application that uses the

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.930
Drive API, and it works.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.770
But if you want some marketing
material, if you want your

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.140
application to be promoted in
the Chrome Web Store, you can

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.100
do an extra step and integrate
it with the Web Store and get

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.390
all these features so people can
more easily discover your

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:28.710
application.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.610
ERIC GILMORE: Exactly.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.970
So in this sense, Chrome Web
Store is a distribution and

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.870
marketing tool, and
a powerful one.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.921
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:40.780
Did we get any more
feedback on this

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.540
specific part of the page?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.050
ERIC GILMORE: Well, we did get
some feedback on the Drive SDK

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.980
console and some confusion that
exists between the IDs

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.505
that you need to specify
in order to have the

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:55.530
full Chrome Web Store.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.510
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, maybe we
can take a look at the APIs

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.940
console and see how
that works.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.225
ERIC GILMORE: All right.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:01.850
Let's have a look.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.630
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So this
is still my account.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.370
And this is a project I have
that is fortunately related.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.830
And so in this APIs console,
we basically define our

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.110
project and generate the
credentials that we're going

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.340
to use to authorize a request.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.850
So in the API Access tab, we
see that we generated some

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.120
credentials, and my application
is a web

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.750
application.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.720
So what I'm using is a client ID
for web application, which

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.960
is that string there.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.040
And then you also need a client
secret, which of course

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.725
now is public thanks to Eric.

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.980
So I'm going to revoke
it any time soon--

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.470
ERIC GILMORE: You'd better
revoke that quickly.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: --so that
no one else can use.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We mentioned
the client ID many

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.500
times in our documentation.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.890
So whenever we talk about client
ID in the Docs, the

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.760
client ID is that string there,
which is usually some

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.120
numerical string dot apps dot
Google user content account.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.990
Don't rely on that format.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.010
It is a string.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.190
That's all you need to know.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.350
ERIC GILMORE: And when we say
client ID, we mean this entire

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.280
string, including the text.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.170
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes, so the
client ID is the entire

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.290
string, which looks like
a URL, but it's not.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.400
It's just a string.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.350
It's part of your credentials.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.440
There's another ID we often
mention in our docs.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.090
And that is the app ID.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.800
The app ID can be found
in the Drive SDK

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.190
top of the APIs console.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.210
So in the API access, you
generate credentials for any

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.770
kind of applications.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.700
But when you want to work, when
you want to build a Drive

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.900
SDK application, you also get
this extra tab, which allows

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.050
you to specify more features
of the same application,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.220
including your icons, including
what file types your

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.340
application can open,
and so on.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.690
And the first thing you see on
this page is the application

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.530
ID, or app ID, which
is just a number.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.700
And it's right there
below the title.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.460
ERIC GILMORE: I think the
source of some of the

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.500
confusion may have been that
the client ID generally

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.630
includes this number at the
beginning of the string, which

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.610
is the client ID.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But you
shouldn't rely on that.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.190
So don't take the client ID,
strip some parts, and generate

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.170
the app ID on your own,
and things like that.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.570
Any time you need to refer
to the app ID,

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.300
go to the APIs console.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.890
And anytime you need to refer
to the client ID, go to the

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.250
other tab in the APIs console.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.080
ERIC GILMORE: Exactly.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.770
And just to remind you, that
other tab is the API Access

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.230
tab where you'll find
the client ID.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.600
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.560
And before we close the section,
I just want to remind

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.180
you that in order for you to
have the Drive SDK tab in your

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.000
project, you have to go to the
Services tab there and enable

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.740
the Drive API and the
Drive SDK services.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.450
So we did that in advance.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.580
You will not see the Drive SDK
section until you enable that

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.590
here from Services.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.780
So let's say you want
to create an

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.590
application, just to summarize.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.940
First, you go to Services,
enable Drive

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.160
API and Drive SDK.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.240
Then you go to API Access
and generate your

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.810
client ID in secret.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.050
And then you specify the
additional parameters in the

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.850
Drive SDK section.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.020
ERIC GILMORE: Right.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.480
What Claudio has just
described is

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.820
detailed in this page.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.330
And if you have any difficulty
with it, please hit the

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.530
feedback button and
let us know.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.080
Yeah, we have a feedback
button now.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.310
And also, we cover the
same steps in the

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.680
tutorials we have.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.850
Because in our recommendation,
we have guides, we have the

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.130
reference, but we also
have tutorials.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.030
ERIC GILMORE: Should we
look at those briefly?

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.870
ERIC GILMORE: This is one of the
most popular areas of our

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.010
documentation.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:58.350
We're basically an end-to-end
Drive app example for any one

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.210
of these languages--

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.020
Java, Python, PHP,
Dotnet, and Ruby.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.780
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And we can
say we have one for Go in the

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.290
works, which is almost ready.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.230
We just need to make it nicer.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.360
And it's going to be
published soon.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.210
And all these tutorials have
a set-up section where we

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.600
explain basically
the same thing.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.530
ERIC GILMORE: Yes.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.140
Claudio, you mentioned
revoking access.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.500
Do you want to actually
take care of that now?

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.430
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We can
do that any time.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.200
So you have two things
you can do here.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.650
I actually mentioned one.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.100
But we should make it
clear there are two

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.250
things you can do here.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.400
The developer can go back
to the APIs console and

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.760
regenerate the client secret.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.610
So right now, anyone who was
watching this video can see my

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.240
client ID and client secret.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.740
They can copy those
credentials.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.960
ERIC GILMORE: Make sure
you tell them how.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.910
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
I'm explaining

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.790
how to hack my account.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.450
That is going to be fun.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.310
So you can take those
credentials, and you can use

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:08.000
them in your application to
behave like my application.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.810
And so the developer, in this
case, has to go to the APIs

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.400
console, go back to the API
Access tab, and click on

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.320
regenerate client secret so that
the old one is not valid

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.680
anymore, and all the
APIs requesting to

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.050
use that will fail.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.485
And I will be the only one
knowing it, so I will

00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:29.100
not show it to you.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.440
And I will be only one
that can use that.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.170
ERIC GILMORE: Could that also
be useful for testing to

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.310
regenerate client IDs?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.710
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That can
also be useful for testing

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:43.120
because your application should
be able to handle all

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.570
failure use cases.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.560
So there can be errors anywhere
in the interaction

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.540
between your application
and the Drive API.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.830
So in your code, you should take
into account that your

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.640
application might not be
authorized anymore.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.820
The user might have uninstalled
the app and so on.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:10.340
And one thing you can do to land
into one of the scenarios

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.780
is you go back your APIs
console, change, regenerate

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.270
your client secret, and see
what happens, and behave

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.520
accordingly.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.530
And that is on the
developer side.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.020
There is also a part
for the user.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.970
So users install the
application.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.020
You've seen me installing
Loupe.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.110
And when I did, the first time
I started the application, I

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:40.310
granted it access to some
specific files and documents

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.080
that I wanted the application
to open.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.830
But at any time, I can, of
course, uninstall the app.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:51.250
But I also can simply revoke
access to the application and

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.940
force the application to ask me
for access again the next

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.770
time I want to use it.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.560
So the application is still
installed, but it is not

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.180
allowed to do requests
on my behalf.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:08.260
If I want to revoke access, I
have to go to my account page.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.510
And there, I have a list of
applications in size that are

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.849
authorized to access my feeds.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.359
This is a long list.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.060
This is all the applications
I've tried and so on.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.839
But one of them is going
to be Loupe.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.160
And next to it there will
be a button that

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.589
says, Revoke Access.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.206
And--

00:17:29.206 --> 00:17:30.470
ERIC GILMORE: It's not going
to be easy to find.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.620
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.140
Well, you opened
something else.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.390
Anyway--

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.950
ERIC GILMORE: I'm glad you
mentioned this, Claudio,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.630
because it is, in fact, part of
the feedback we received.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.160
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh, I see.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.210
And this is also a very
important use case for

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.470
developers to handle.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.840
So you should take into account
that at any time, the

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.280
user can revoke access
to your application.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.760
So maybe you have
a valid token.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.780
That token might be invalid
any second.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.120
So if that happens, you as a
developer have to take the

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.570
user back to the Grant
Access page and ask

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.170
for permission again.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.240
ERIC GILMORE: And handling
that case is important--

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Our
tutorials do it.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.560
So if you use our sample
applications in the five

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.620
languages that we listed, you
will see how we handled that

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.750
specific case.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.120
And the mechanism is basically
what I said.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.810
Take the user back to the Grant
Access page and get a

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.400
new valid token.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.880
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, will
it make you mad if I revoke

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.730
access to uefa.com?

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.060
I think that's not for work.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.175
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, this
is not my work account.

00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:33.520
ERIC GILMORE: Oh, all right.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.245
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Anyway, you
can do it because that was for

00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:36.910
the Euro Cup.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.140
So important business
application, and it's probably

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.600
not there anymore.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.660
ERIC GILMORE: The UEFA
wasn't really good

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.410
news for your country.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:45.990
So--

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.110
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No,
we lost in the final,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.080
so it's no big deal.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.350
OK, did we get any other piece
of important feedback that we

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.590
want to talk about now?

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.810
ERIC GILMORE: Well, we enabled
this new feature, which allows

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.330
anybody reading the documents to
give us feedback yesterday.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.360
And we've already received one
helpful comment, which was

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.820
some of our users want to see
a PDF format or maybe an F2B

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.630
format of our documentation.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.830
And we're going to look at
that in the near future.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.890
But frankly, we need
more feedback.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.390
So I'm going to urge you once
more to give it to us through

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.670
this link or through
Stack Overflow.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.530
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: One of the
feedback I got yesterday

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.340
before this link was there was
a face-to-face interaction

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.210
with a developer.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:33.570
And they asked me how to get
all the updates on our

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.070
documentation, our
feeds, our API?

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:41.050
So how do we always know what's
new with the APIs?

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.870
What channels do we
have for that?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.540
ERIC GILMORE: Well, one simple
static channel is to look at

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.740
our release notes, which
we update periodically.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.750
The latest changes are listed
at the top of these sections

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.420
and should give you the
information on things that

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.280
we've changed most recently.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.210
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So, for
instance, just mentioning the

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.080
first item in this list
was a very, very

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.020
heavily requested feature.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.560
It was a way for developers to
expose a publicly available

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.070
link to a document.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.790
So you have a document
you store

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.070
somewhere on Google Drive.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.930
And you want this document to be
downloadable by anyone with

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.290
no authentication required.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.220
And this is now available.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.330
And now each element in the
files list, in a list of files

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:37.780
you get with the API has a field
called Web Content Link,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.820
which is the link
to the document.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.250
And it's publicly accessible to
anyone, of course, if the

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.170
document is publicly
accessible.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.160
So I mean it's always up to
the user to decide who has

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.220
access to a document.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.240
But if the document is now
public, it's also going to be

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.580
listed in that field.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.460
ERIC GILMORE: And wherever we
can, we link you into the

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.550
relevant areas of the
documentation where you can

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.850
see details on these features
that are recently released.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.750
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And,
in fact, that's a JSON

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.170
representation of the
file on our API.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.570
What I also required today--

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.650
the guy who asked me yesterday
about the channels, I said

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:23.960
that we have another channel
that we use for updates and

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960
people can subscribe to.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.400
And that is our blog.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.290
So we have a blog that
is called Google

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.090
Apps Developer Blog.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.000
Maybe we can open it.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.260
So you can just search for
Google Apps Developer Blog.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.130
ERIC GILMORE: I think
that would be it.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.055
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Which
is googleappsdevelo

00:21:39.055 --> 00:21:40.980
per.blogspot.com.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:48.670
And we frequently post updates,
tips and tricks, and

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.000
any other thing related to
the Drive SDK in the

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.940
other Google Apps API.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.660
ERIC GILMORE: I particularly
like this latest post.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.920
It's by Claudio Cherubino.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, must
be a great developer.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.990
ERIC GILMORE: Five things you
didn't know you could do with

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.120
the Google Drive API.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, I
decided to share my secrets.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.000
So yeah, this has been
posted yesterday.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.600
So we post very, very
frequently.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.320
So it's usually every
other day or so.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.900
And we go into detail
for some feeds.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.040
Or we explain some of things
that were not clear and so on.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.940
And of course, you can add
comments to the post if you

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.150
think something is not clear
or have questions.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.010
But if you have feedback, I
would say, as Eric said, you

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.990
should use the Feedback
Link in the doc.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.130
ERIC GILMORE: Yes, yes.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.250
Let's not forget about
that Feedback Link.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.060
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Don't
forget about it.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.570
Yeah, what we want to say today
is that if you have to

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.170
remember one thing from this
video is that there's a

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.370
Feedback Link in our doc that
you can now use to give us

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.420
more feedback because we
want more feedback.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.520
ERIC GILMORE: Yes, we do.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.810
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, and I
think with that, we can wrap

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.960
up for today.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.220
Thank you very much
for watching this.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.970
And see you next time.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.930
ERIC GILMORE: Thank you.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.530
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: See you.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:14.333
