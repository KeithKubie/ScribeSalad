00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.660
Think back to the beginning of this

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.010
lesson. Where we considered a computer system that

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.070
was displaying graphics for a video game.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.200
Playing music or browsing the web. Seemingly all

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.350
of them at the same time. All of these applications need access to the physical

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.520
hardware And they have to be made to

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.820
share nicely. No hogging the CPU, no overwriting

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.050
each other's coder data. This becomes then the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.940
job of the operating system, to protect these

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.040
applications from one another, and to protect an

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.070
application from itself. While getting out of the way

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.410
as quickly as possible so that these applications

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.650
can do what they need to do in order

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.600
to get their jobs done. Now we will

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
discuss the abstractions in an operating system. From managing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.790
the hardware safely and efficiently. Particularly we'll

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.040
focus on the processor and the memory.
