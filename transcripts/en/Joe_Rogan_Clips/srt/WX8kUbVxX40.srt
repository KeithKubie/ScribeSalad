1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,860
The Joe Rogan experience. 10th Planet is
downtown. Right near where you places,

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,670
yeah. Yeah. So your studio,
you, Oh, you're set up. That's,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,090
that's real close to 10 planets. Jujitsu.
Yeah man. Just let me know. I'll set,

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,290
I will man. Avoid any flat
earth conversations that
come up. Oh, I, you know,

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,800
like ears and keep moving. I get those
from, I get those from time to time.

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,120
You know, I get the flat or stay
the fuck off of Youtube, man. Man.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,070
Yeah, they get confused. Yeah,
that's it. That's the craziest shit.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,600
Cause I always argue like this about
the flat earth, right? So, hey listen,

9
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,360
if we got a flatter,
there's the edge. Right?

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,870
And there's always thrill seekers
looking to do something thrilling.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,640
And there's always a thrill seeker that
fucks up and falls right off of that

12
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,690
edge.
Right.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,220
So how many motherfuckers would be fallen
off the edge of the earth if we really

14
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,400
had one? For sure. You
know, there'll be climbers,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,080
there'd be a bunch of dudes who would
try to hang off the edge to take selfies.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,200
Think about it.
Right?

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,660
12 people this year have died at
the Grand Canyon, the Grand Canyon.

18
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,590
It was that really that many,
that many so far in this year.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,010
And some people die of a heart attack
there because you know it's too much for

20
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,330
them to be on that little
bridge that they have there,

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,200
that that extends past the
edge of a canyon. They,

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,590
they put in a little Bridgeway
so that you can go and look down.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,770
People have heart attacks, two people
that have had heart attacks from that,

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
but the other guys are the ones trying
to do selfies of fallen off fucking

25
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:36,930
bridge in plummeting. Right. So
you gotta think, man, if we had,

26
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,130
if we had a flat earth,

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,810
how many people would be visiting
the edge off taking a selfie? Man,

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,490
there's no, you know, come on. No doubt.
There'd be teams of people, teams,

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,950
they would travel the flat earth and
they would, they would like rope.

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,120
We apparent like, like Alex Honnold
would probably try to climb off the side.

31
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,140
We'd hear it on the news.

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,940
Another person who has died from
falling off the edge of the earth. Yeah,

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,070
it would be 100% that'd be our hundredth,

34
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,360
the flat out people will tell you though
that the government guards that yeah.

35
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:10,260
Not and are right. Yeah. You can't
go near it pro. Yeah. Battleships.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,680
Well there wouldn't be just one edge
though. Right? That's true there.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,640
They didn't think that through. Yeah. No,
there'd be several ledges if we're flat.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,070
Yeah. But see you gotta
have that Youtube mentality.

39
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,470
You gotta put your head in a little box,
leave it in there.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,420
Fucking turn the oven box on and stick
your head in the government's plucking

41
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:32,310
vee edge, man. You can't get
near it. Yeah, we're, it's
like we're living in a dome,

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,210
you know, that's, that's the
one. Yeah. The Dome, the Dome
theory. There's no space.

43
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,750
Space is fake. Man. Pizza spoke too much.

44
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,210
People want to believe in some
crazy shit. You know, I want to,

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,410
how much of them were stoners?
Like most of them. Right?

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,930
How many of them are microdosing?
Okay. Yeah, probably cause you know,

47
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:56,280
cause cause that's a thing now everybody's
like fucking microdosing right now.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,740
And it's not bad for you. They say it's
actually, you know, kind of good for you,

49
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:04,090
but Ron White's doing it, but runaway
microdose is a silicide man every day.

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,450
He has never felt better in my life and
they like to talk when they're micro

51
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:12,760
dosing. Yeah. Especially sole
assignment. You just have these ideas.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,410
That's the thing. You have ideas in your
mind becomes open to shit that normally,

53
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:21,100
you know, you're closed off
to obviously, you know. Yeah,

54
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,010
but I think they think
that the earth is a disk.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,780
I think that's what I've heard recently.

56
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:30,400
They think it's a disc [inaudible] I'm
sort of a floating disc in and then we

57
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,400
live in the firmament or something like
that and it's like some sort of a cover

58
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,090
over the top of the disc and that's what
the, here it is. What does this Jamie,

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,290
just the cruise, the cruise next
year. The flatter the roost. Yeah.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,430
Oh my God.
Is that real?

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,930
Eventually they're going to get to the
fucking glaciers and they told you the

62
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,220
wall, the flat earth. I hope they jump
out and get eaten by a polar bear.

63
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:55,780
That's the funniest shit has
to use like gps to get around.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,900
So, ah, I mean, good
luck with that. You know,

65
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:02,320
how many scientists do they have
on their side? Oh, all of them.

66
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,410
That's the funniest shit. It's
fucking ridiculous. There's, there's,

67
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,120
there's gigantic satellites that take
huge high resolution photos of the earth

68
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,950
every 10 seconds from orbit,
from thousands of miles out.
Those are doctored. Yeah.

69
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,430
It's just the whole thing is so fucking
stupid of all this shit to believe in,

70
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,770
like to invest any energy in that.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,410
Like why would someone lie
about the shape of the earth?

72
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:30,700
That's the dumbest part about [inaudible]
know what I think is, is, um, before,

73
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,030
um, the internet and all these different
platforms where you can get information.
