Jemima you asked a really interesting

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:11.919
Jemima you asked a really interesting
 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.279
Jemima you asked a really interesting
question do the tides affect the water

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289
question do the tides affect the water
 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.770
question do the tides affect the water
in our body now the simple answer is no

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780
in our body now the simple answer is no
 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.589
in our body now the simple answer is no
but let's talk about why that's true the

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599
but let's talk about why that's true the
 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.259
but let's talk about why that's true the
tides are caused every day by the moon

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269
tides are caused every day by the moon
 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.269
tides are caused every day by the moon
and the Sun stretching the earth the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279
and the Sun stretching the earth the
 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.919
and the Sun stretching the earth the
gravity actually stretches the earth

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929
gravity actually stretches the earth
 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.589
gravity actually stretches the earth
apart just a little bit now the earth is

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599
apart just a little bit now the earth is
 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.599
apart just a little bit now the earth is
a very large object but think about

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609
a very large object but think about
 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.090
a very large object but think about
smaller things now do you haven't

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100
smaller things now do you haven't
 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.270
smaller things now do you haven't
noticed tides on a lake for a very large

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280
noticed tides on a lake for a very large
 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.040
noticed tides on a lake for a very large
lake like the Great Lakes there might be

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050
lake like the Great Lakes there might be
 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.779
lake like the Great Lakes there might be
a little bit of a tidal difference every

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789
a little bit of a tidal difference every
 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:40.920
a little bit of a tidal difference every
day but it's actually kind of hard to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930
day but it's actually kind of hard to
 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.170
day but it's actually kind of hard to
measure what a smaller lake or a pond

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180
measure what a smaller lake or a pond
 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.029
measure what a smaller lake or a pond
what about something like a swimming

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039
what about something like a swimming
 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.340
what about something like a swimming
pool I think even in your own experience

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350
pool I think even in your own experience
 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.260
pool I think even in your own experience
you can see that smaller objects don't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270
you can see that smaller objects don't
 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.479
you can see that smaller objects don't
really have any tidal differences across

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
really have any tidal differences across
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.310
really have any tidal differences across
the day and that's just because of the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320
the day and that's just because of the
 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.639
the day and that's just because of the
size as we said the tides are caused by

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649
size as we said the tides are caused by
 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.229
size as we said the tides are caused by
the gravity of the moon and the Sun

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
the gravity of the moon and the Sun
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.599
the gravity of the moon and the Sun
stretching the earth but now take it

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609
stretching the earth but now take it
 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.000
stretching the earth but now take it
down to a really really tiny scale over

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
down to a really really tiny scale over
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.710
down to a really really tiny scale over
really small scales that just isn't much

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720
really small scales that just isn't much
 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.570
really small scales that just isn't much
of an effect you really can't sense it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580
of an effect you really can't sense it
 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.870
of an effect you really can't sense it
at all it just becomes unimportant now

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880
at all it just becomes unimportant now
 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.700
at all it just becomes unimportant now
the interesting thing is that this would

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
the interesting thing is that this would
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.230
the interesting thing is that this would
not be the case if we were around

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240
not be the case if we were around
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.719
not be the case if we were around
something like a black hole if you were

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729
something like a black hole if you were
 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.850
something like a black hole if you were
around a black hole which is a dead star

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860
around a black hole which is a dead star
 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.100
around a black hole which is a dead star
and say the mass of the black hole was

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110
and say the mass of the black hole was
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.649
and say the mass of the black hole was
about 20 times the mass of the Sun a

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659
about 20 times the mass of the Sun a
 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.719
about 20 times the mass of the Sun a
black hole like that is actually not

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
black hole like that is actually not
 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.420
black hole like that is actually not
very physically large you have all that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430
very physically large you have all that
 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.789
very physically large you have all that
mass but the black hole itself may only

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799
mass but the black hole itself may only
 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.039
mass but the black hole itself may only
be now stay on the order of about 30

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049
be now stay on the order of about 30
 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.710
be now stay on the order of about 30
miles across that means you have all

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720
miles across that means you have all
 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.230
miles across that means you have all
that mass packed into a tiny little area

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
that mass packed into a tiny little area
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.319
that mass packed into a tiny little area
if you were near by a black hole that

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329
if you were near by a black hole that
 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.630
if you were near by a black hole that
means there really would be a detectable

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
means there really would be a detectable
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.480
means there really would be a detectable
gravity stretching across something as

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490
gravity stretching across something as
 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.760
gravity stretching across something as
small as your body and not just the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770
small as your body and not just the
 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.649
small as your body and not just the
water in your body would feel that as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659
water in your body would feel that as
 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.260
water in your body would feel that as
you got closer and closer to a black

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270
you got closer and closer to a black
 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.959
you got closer and closer to a black
hole you would actually feel your head

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969
hole you would actually feel your head
 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.270
hole you would actually feel your head
stretched away from your feet there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280
stretched away from your feet there
 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.789
stretched away from your feet there
would be tidal forces just like the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799
would be tidal forces just like the
 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.139
would be tidal forces just like the
earth goes through with the Sun and the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149
earth goes through with the Sun and the
 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.450
earth goes through with the Sun and the
moon but next to a black hole the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460
moon but next to a black hole the
 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.130
moon but next to a black hole the
gravity is so extreme

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140
gravity is so extreme
 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.139
gravity is so extreme
there would be tides over something as

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149
there would be tides over something as
 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.600
there would be tides over something as
small as a human body get closer and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
small as a human body get closer and
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.310
small as a human body get closer and
closer to a black hole and your head

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320
closer to a black hole and your head
 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.900
closer to a black hole and your head
keeps getting stretched more and if you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
keeps getting stretched more and if you
 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.910
keeps getting stretched more and if you
keep taking stretch that way and you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
keep taking stretch that way and you
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.780
keep taking stretch that way and you
could actually turn you into a stream

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
could actually turn you into a stream
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.330
could actually turn you into a stream

name for this it's called
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.940
name for this it's called
spaghettification from the word

spaghetti if you got close to a black
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.709
spaghetti if you got close to a black
hole there would be tides over your body

that's small that would rip you apart

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909
that's small that would rip you apart
 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.369
that's small that would rip you apart
into basically a strand of spaghetti

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379
into basically a strand of spaghetti
 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.490
