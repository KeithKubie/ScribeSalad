00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.771
 - Tonight on Clock
 Ticking on a Screen,

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.506
 we'll investigate the
 question that has been

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:11.044 size:84% position:42%
  baffling limited Spanish
  speakers for generations.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's right, we
 will finally answer:

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.348 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  Donde esta la biblioteca?

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.187
 I began my search at the place

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.256 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the biggest
concentration of people

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.260 size:84% position:42%
  who've taken seven years
  of Spanish and forgot it,

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.795 size:88% position:44%
 Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.329 size:84% position:42%
  Although this was
  a traditionally

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.365
 Spanish speaking neighborhood,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:36.269
 it seemed to me that
 things had changed.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.137
 No one seems to have an answer

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.506
and I was stuck.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.512
 So I decided to ask an expert.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:47.813 size:84% position:42%
  This is Ken Bray.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.151 size:84% position:42%
  Bray has spent his entire
  adult life obsessively

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:57.090 align:start position:0%
  trying to figure out,
  donde esta la biblioteca?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.825
Ken is also an expert in many...

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.394
(multiple conversations)

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.628 size:84% position:42%
  Do you guys mind?

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm doing the biblioteca
walk and talk.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.231
- Okay.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.332 size:84% position:42%
  - Thank you, no big deal.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.334
 It's fine, thank you.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start position:0%
 Many consider Ken the
 premiere biblioteca expert,

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.342 align:start position:0%
 while others think he's a
 conspiracy theorist gone mad.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.311 size:84% position:42%
  He also happens
  to have the voice

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start size:88% position:13%
 of a sweet vulnerable
 nightingale.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.851 size:88% position:44%
 â™ª Donde esta la biblioteca?

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.792
 So Ken, you've spent
 you entire adult life

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.760
 searching for la biblioteca.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:37.330 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Are you any closer
  to finding it?

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.698
 - Of course.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.600 size:84% position:42%
  The signs are everywhere.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.868
Open your eyes.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.103
 - I'm sorry.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:45.338 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I want you to
 look at this dollar.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:45.872
Do you notice anything?

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.140
 - No.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - How about if I take
 this dollar and I
 fold it three times,

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.642
 now what do you see?

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:50.610 size:88% position:44%
 - A Dorito.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.345
 - A symbol for la biblioteca.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Have you seen this
  symbol before?

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.214
 - I can't say that I have, no.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.182 size:88% position:44%
  - Have you seen the inside
  of a dictionary, before?

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.316 size:88% position:44%
 - Of course, everybody has.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.217
 - Same symbol.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.252 size:88% position:44%
 Have you see Cool Runnings?

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.586 size:84% position:42%
  - I have.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.222 size:84% position:42%
  - It's been sitting on my
  DVR for like three weeks

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.290 size:84% position:42%
  and I can't find
  time to watch it.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.191 size:88% position:44%
 - You must.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.025 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Everybody keeps
telling me to watch it.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Uplifting,
 uplifting yet comedic.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.328
- Cuba Gooding.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.897 size:84% position:42%
  - Cuba Gooding,
  he's not in that.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.764
- Shit.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.939
- I didn't know what to believe.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:23.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, I decided to go
straight to the source,

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.211 size:88% position:44%
 where it all began.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.886 align:start position:0%
 Now Mrs. Lopez, you've
 taught Spanish for 25 years,

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.720
 is that right?

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:35.655
 - Yes.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.323 size:88% position:44%
 It is my life long passion.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.391
 - Wonderful.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.492 size:84% position:42%
  Now isn't it true

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.694 size:88% position:44%
 that the first thing that
 you teach your students is,

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:44.230 size:84% position:42%
  donde esta la biblioteca?

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.532
 - Yes, it's important to know.

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.667
 - Wonderful.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.269 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now where is la
biblioteca, Mrs. Lopez?

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.704 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.773
Would you like a cookie?

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.575
 - I really shouldn't.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.512
 Mrs. Lopez, where did
 you get that tattoo?

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.747
 What's going on here?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.748
Hold on.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:04.217 size:84% position:42%
  - This interview is over.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.817 size:88% position:44%
  - Your English is
  impeccable, woman.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.419 size:88% position:44%
 I know that symbol.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.787 size:88% position:44%
  The people deserve
  to know the truth.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.757 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  (speaking Spanish)

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.393 line:0%
- Oh, bathrooms and puppies, eh?

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:15.861
 What do they have to
 do with one another?

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Logically, it doesn't
 make any sense.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.564 size:88% position:44%
 I'm going to get to
 the bottom of this.

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.567 size:88% position:44%
  - Uh, huh, uh, in Espanol.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.339 line:0%
 - Okay, (stuttering)
 (speaking Spanish)

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.406
- Ooh, muy bien.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.241 size:88% position:44%
  - Gracias.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:28.874
 - You're a dead man.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:29.709
 - No.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.377
 - You're a dead man.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.347 align:start position:0%
  - I had to figure out
  how it was all connected,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.483 size:88% position:44%
 so I gathered every
 resource I could.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.722 size:88% position:44%
  I knew I had to go deeper.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.424
That monkey's evil Dora
and we both know it.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:48.427
 And like any good reporter, I
 decided to use my surroundings

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.265
 and interview one of
 Mrs. Lopez's students.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.836 align:start size:88% position:13%
Do you know where I
can find la biblioteca?

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.439
 - Why don't you just
 ask a Spanish person?

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.242 size:88% position:44%
 Shitty, Bruno Mars.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.744
- You're right.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.312 size:88% position:44%
 - [Boy] Ow.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.613
 - Thank you.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:08.481
- Dick.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Sir, do you know
where la biblioteca is?

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:14.353
- La biblioteca?

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.388
 - Yes.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.022
 - Of course.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:16.856
It's right over.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.258
 No, not again.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.661
(exciting music)

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.996
- Mrs. Lopez, stop that.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.464 size:84% position:42%
  Stay right there.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.268
(exciting music)

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:38.011 size:88% position:44%
 Mrs. Lopez.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.683
 It looks like for now, the
 whereabouts of la biblioteca

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.585
 will remain unknown.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.856 size:88% position:44%
 - Excuse me, sir,
 can you wrap it up?

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.391 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The library's closing
 in five minutes.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.026 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.394 size:88% position:44%
 Lost track of time.

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.463
 Let's wrap it up boys.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.297 size:88% position:44%
 All of you.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.368 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And you too, you're
 part of my crew.

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.770
- Tonight on Solving
Things in a Trenchcoat,

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:08.074 align:start position:0%
 we'll examine the
 disappearance of Walter Odina,

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.409 size:88% position:44%
 also we'll find out

00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:11.611
 quien es Pablo

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.548 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and why is he
 always by la playa?

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:17.617
Tune in.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.921
Exit's this way.
