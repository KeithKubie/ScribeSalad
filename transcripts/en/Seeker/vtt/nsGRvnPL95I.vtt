00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.480
Our solar system is unlike any other discovered
in the cosmos to date, and a rogue baby Jupiter

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.040
might be the reason why it's so weird - and
even home to life.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.760
The Solar System consists of four inner planets:
Mercury, Venus, Earth &amp; Mars.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680
They're known as terrestrial planets because they're

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.380
made up of mostly heavy metals like iron and nickel.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.900
In comparison to other planetary bodies, they're
pretty small and their atmospheres are thin.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.820
Meanwhile, the gas giants in our outer solar system

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.080
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - are much larger.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.400
And unlike other observed gas giants in the cosmos, they're really

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.320
far from their parent star - our Sun.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.870
So why exactly is our solar system so diverse
and spread out over billions of kilometers?

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
For centuries, our solar system was the only
model we had to learn from, but thanks to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.190
NASA planet hunters, like the Kepler Space
Telescope, that all changed.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.690
We've discovered more than three thousands
exoplanets orbiting other stars and a portion

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.829
of them reside in multi-planetary systems.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.580
So far, scientists have found that the 'typical'
multi-planetary system, consists of a few

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.520
super-Earths - extrasolar planets with masses
larger than our own planet

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.000
but less than the gas giants.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.869
They tend to be similar in size, with evenly
spaced out orbits and are located closer to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.670
their stars than Mercury is to the Sun.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.650
We really can't say for sure why our solar
system is so different than others, but some

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.640
scientists point to our largest planet as
a possible explanation.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.100
One theory take us back to the formation
of the solar system billions of years ago.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.600
It claims that the Sun was once surrounded
by first generation inner planets on their

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.159
way to becoming "super-Earths".

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.649
As the planets were forming, it's believed
that young Jupiter began migrating inward

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.920
in a scenario known as the 'Grand Tack'.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.560
It claims that, as Jupiter moved towards the
Sun, its gravitational perturbations caused

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.780
the planets' orbits to overlap, resulting
in catastrophic collisions.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.200
Some of the premature planet pieces were sent
spiraling into the Sun,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.460
while others remained floating in space.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.890
Jupiter was allegedly pulled back towards
its current location when Saturn began to form,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.110
allowing for the remnants of its havoc to
form into a second generation of planets or

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.580
the inner solar system as we know it today.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.360
If true, the Grand Tack scenario helps explain
why the terrestrial planets are much smaller

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.560
than typical super-Earths.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.960
Some scientists believe Jupiter's messy
migration could

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.880
also explain how liquid made it to Earth.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.350
As the gas giant wandered back out into space,
its gravitational pull latched onto asteroids

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.160
that formed beyond the snow line, which is
the distance

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.740
from a star where icy compounds can condense.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.300
Jupiter flung icy space rocks inwards
to the asteroid belt

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.840
and the region where Earth was forming.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.200
It's believed that these icy asteroids would
have delivered enough ice to account for Earth's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.510
oceans - essentially providing us with the
building blocks for life.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.950
So the Grand Tack claims that if juvenile
Jupiter hadn't swung through our early solar

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.580
system like a wrecking ball, Earth would never
have been created,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.360
and we wouldn't be alive today.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.410
It's clear, there's still a lot we need to
learn about our alleged cosmic creator because,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.440
after all, these scenarios are still theories.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.640
But they do help answer many of the growing
questions about the oddity of our solar system.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.620
And, if they hold truth, as some scientists
believe, we have a lot to thank Jupiter for.
