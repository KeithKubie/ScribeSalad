00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:07.079
Gender and sexuality are two concepts that are incredibly individualized and so it shouldn't be surprising

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.190
That they are so complex

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.420
It can be hard to navigate the world of sexuality due to the different terms and labels, this video

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.989
Aims to help you navigate this world by arming you with some definitions and examples of 10 different sexualities

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.029
Some of which you might not even know about

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.289
1.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.559
Bisexuality: the definition for bisexuality is actually something that's debated

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.549
Originally, the standard definition was attraction to both genders

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.059
However, as understanding of gender has evolved people have argued for an evolved definition of bisexuality

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.649
Some use the definition of attraction to your own and other genders to incorporate non-binary genders within its definition

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.759
Some famous examples of people who are bisexual are Brandon Urie (he is actually Pansexual witch is discussed later in the video)  from the band Panic at the Disco and actress Angelina Jolie

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.230
2.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.689
Homosexuality: this is one of the terms that most people tend to be familiar with, it means attraction to one's own gender and is sometimes

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.689
referred as gay (Male or female) or lesbian (Female only)

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.110
Famous examples include comedian Alan Carr and presenter Sue Peterson

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.170
3. Heterosexuality:

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.430
Heterosexuality is probably the most well known sexuality and whether right or wrong it is often thought of as the default

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.349
This is known as heteronormativity. It means attraction to genders other than your own

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.129
It's most commonly used to refer to binary genders

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:34.129
4.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.650
Pansexuality:

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.339
Pansexuality is defined as an attraction to all genders

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.689
Some say those who are pansexual don't care about gender when it comes to their attraction though, Not all agree with this assessment

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.618
Some people also use the sexuality and bisexuality

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.209
Interchangeably Miley Cyrus is a notable person who is pansexual

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.409
5.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.909
Polysexuality:

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.889
Polysexuality refers to people who are attracted to two or more genders

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.469
typically bisexuality and pansexuality

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.289
are types of polysexuality, though not all people who are polysexual use these terms

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.870
6.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.220
Asexuality:

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.050
Asexuality is one of the lesser known sexualities. It refers to someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction to any gender

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.230
This doesn't mean however, that they never have relationships or sex which are common myths about asexuality

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.300
Bojack horseman the TV show explores asexuality through one of the major characters Todd Chavez

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.040
7. Grey-asexuality: This is similar to the previous sexuality

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.480
However, instead of never experiencing sexual attraction someone who is grey-sexual may very rarely experience sexual attraction

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.390
They are still valid under the asexuality umbrella despite occasionally experiencing sexual attraction

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.950
8.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.480
Demisexuality:

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.119
Demisexuality again can technically fall under the asexual umbrella, people who are demisexual do experience sexual attraction

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.090
But only after an emotional connection is created

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.950
they wouldn't find a stranger on the street sexually appealing but after they get to know someone well, the possibility of sexual attraction is there

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.300
Demisexuality is considered the halfway point between asexuality and allo-sexuality those who experience sexual attraction

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.290
9. Androsexuality: androsexuality is a sexuality that outside of

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.739
LGBTQ circles is not well known at all. It refers to someone who is attracted to a masculine gender presentation

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.230
This can refer to anyone of any gender man,woman or non-binary

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.399
10. Gynosexuality:  gynosexuality like androsexuality is not well known

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.119
It refers to someone who was attracted to a feminine gender presentation

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.809
This could again refer to any individual of any gender

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.760
