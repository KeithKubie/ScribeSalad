00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.759
Whether you are trying to lose 20 pounds,
get that promotion at work, or quit smoking,

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.830
sticking to your goal isn’t an easy task
- after all, 45% of people drop their New

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.469
Year's resolutions after one month. So why
is it so difficult to keep motivated - and

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.529
how can science help us achieve what we’re
after?

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.420
In one MIT study, students were given two
types of tasks. In the first they had to hit

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.869
2 keys on a keyboard as many times as possible
in 4 minutes, and those that did it the fastest

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.760
would receive money. For some the reward was
$300 while the others only $30. Interestingly,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.320
performance was 95% greater in the high $300
group, highlighting how money can be a motivator.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.180
But in the second task the same students were
asked to solve a more complex math problem,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.680
and this time, those offered the high reward
performed 32% slower than the small reward

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.280
group. This is known as the ‘distraction
effect’ - when we are given a task that

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.050
requires problem solving, economic or emotional
pressure can cause focus to shift to the motivator,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.049
ultimately dividing your attention and reducing
performance.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.340
When we look inside the brains of individuals,
fMRI scans reveal that people who complete

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.820
a challenge for fun, and people who do it
for a reward show similar activity throughout

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.130
the brain. But interestingly, if those offered
a reward the first time are asked to participate

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.180
again for no reward, scans show a decrease
in activity in the anterior striatum and prefrontal

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.390
areas; parts of the brain linked to self-motivation.
It seems that rewards may cancel out our natural

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.770
sense of play.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.759
So how does this apply to you? Well, it turns
out that ‘play’ is the strongest motivator

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.219
for sustained behavioural changes. It makes
sense that we stick with enjoyable activities,

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.460
but considering 67% of gym memberships go
unused it seems most of us are picking the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.979
wrong activities to achieve our goals. You
might burn the most calories on a treadmill,

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.409
but not if you stop doing it after 2 weeks.
Pick something you actually like doing!

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.959
Your goal itself also matters; a study investigating
reasons for exercise found that those focused

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.580
on weight loss spent 32% less time exercising
than whose who said they wanted to feel better

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.060
in day to day life.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.140
And while it’s always good to have a positive
attitude, optimism may not always be the best

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.010
strategy. In a study of 210 females trying
to quit smoking, participants who only imagined

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.311
major success with few obstacles were less
likely reduce cigarette consumption. Positive

00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:33.360
thoughts can often trick your brain into thinking
you’ve already achieved the goal, giving

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.560
you a sense of reward and reducing motivation.
But this doesn’t mean negative thoughts

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.060
are good - imagining a goal coming true, and
then thinking through the obstacles that stand

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.100
in your way is the best mixed approach. This
is known as ‘mental contrasting’.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.840
Finally, try and avoid the ‘what the hell’
effect. This behaviour was first addressed

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.950
when researchers gave dieters varying sizes
of milkshakes - from small to large- and then

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.120
offered them ice cream afterwards. It turns
out, those who had large milkshakes also ended

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.190
up eating more ice cream because ‘what the
hell - I’ve already ruined my diet, I might

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.910
as well go all out’. Anticipating that you
will have some bumps along the road to success,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.010
whether it be a fitness goal, quitting smoking
or work aspirations, will bring your closer

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.070
to making your goals a reality.
