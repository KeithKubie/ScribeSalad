(Narrator) It's great having 
image support in Flutter,

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:13.614
loading images as assets
or over a network.

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.814
But what if you want
to tweak those images in some way,

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:20.081
adding rotation, skew, or even blur?

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:23.703
Flutter gives you
a simple way to do just that,

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:28.977
using a combination of the ImageFilter class
and the BackdropFilter widget.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.704
The BackdropFilter widget takes
an ImageFilter and a child as parameters

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:38.545
and applies the filter
to widgets beneath the child.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.882
First, decide what type
of filter you'd like--

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:45.278
blur or matrix,
which is used for transforms.

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:48.328
Next, give the widget a child,

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:51.453
but note that the child
won't be affected by the filter,

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:53.737
only those widgets beneath it.

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.894
Here's a handy tip.

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:58.324
To apply the filter to the background,

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.624
but not render anything visible
over the filter,

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.563
use an empty container as the child.

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:07.344
If you're not sure how to get started,

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:10.873
try using BackdropFilters with a stack.

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:16.994
Use <i>Positioned.fill</i> to ensure the filter
completely covers the widgets beneath it.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.113
And you can easily apply the filter
to only a section,

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:24.013
selectively blurring out whatever you like.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:27.712

and ImageFilter,

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.073
