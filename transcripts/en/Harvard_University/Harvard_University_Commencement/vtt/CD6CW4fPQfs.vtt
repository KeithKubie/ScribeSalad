00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.420
Our speaker this afternoon

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.930
is a celebrated thought leader

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.820
on international affairs named by
Foreign Policy as one of the top one

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.419
hundred global thinkers

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.150
perhaps most visible as the host of
CNN's flagship international affairs

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.349
program

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.949
a role he's held since 2008

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.550
he's also editor-at-large at Time
Magazine, a Washington Post columnist and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.589
a New York Times best-selling author.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.980
He was introduced as Time Editor at
Large in 2010

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.600
after a decade as editor of Newsweek
International

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.590
overseeing all the magazines' editions abroad.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
Before this, he was hired at the age of
twenty eight as the managing editor of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.410
Foreign Affairs

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.400
He's the author of numerous books,
articles and columns

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.050
and the recipient of equally numerous
honors including a National Magazine

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.070
Award in 2001  for his influential Newsweek cover story,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.000
"Why They Hate Us".

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.460
Born in Mumbai

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.910
our speaker did venture to Yale to
receive his bachelor's degree

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.080
but continued on to harvard

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.050
Thus perhaps dashing poor Eli's hopes

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.770
as we all just sang a moment ago

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.730
starting with Samuel P. Huntington and
Stanley Hoffman to earn a Ph.D in

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.560
political science.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.600
He's a respected scholar,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.770
a talented journalist, and one of our
foremost alumni voices on global affairs.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.770
Please join me in welcoming Fareed Zakaria.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.250
thank you so much

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.200
President Faust, members of the
Corporation, members of the Board of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.799
Overseers, ladies and gentlemen

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.810
Above all, students, graduating students,
thank you so much

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.780
for asking me to do this.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.210
I have to say to the students here

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.489
you are already way ahead of me

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.829
you see I actually have

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.139
never made my commencement either from
college

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.539
or from

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.029
my Ph.D. program

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.300
i did as you heard there was a small
college

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.309
south of here in the little town called
New Haven

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.079
uh... and I perhaps got it wrong and
celebrated a little bit too much the

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.529
night before

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.829
commencement

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.329
uh... so the honest truth is I slept
through my college commencement

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.790
when I finally made it to harvard I got
a job before commencement and had to be

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.379
working in New York and couldn't take the
day off.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.079
I got my degree in the mail.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.819
Some 19 years later I'm finally honored

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.819
to receive in person a Harvard degree.
Thank you.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.599
Harvard was for me a dazzling
revelation

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.919
contrary to the conventional wisdom on
this campus it is possible to get a

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.839
fine education at Yale, which i did

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.290
but the great graduate programs of
Harvard in their scope, in their 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.599
scale, in their  worldliness and
ambition were just

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.579
an electric experience and i soaked
it in

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.989
Now, to get a Ph.D. involves many many
hours of grueling work

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.389
it also involves many hours of goofing
off

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.159
acquiring hobbies and interests and
uh... exploiting the great resources of

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.569
this university

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.059
i mean the libraries and the cafes

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.789
and I did all of that

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.660
and gained from it immeasurably. I learned from

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.319
faculty, from students, from visitors

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.399
but what I remember most

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.639
was that Harvard is the place that I
learned to think

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.699
and owe this university as a result

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.049
a deep debt of gratitude

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.879
something I think all of you share with
me

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.689
and something the development office
will remind you all from time to time

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.469
I've always been wary of making
commencement speeches. I don't think of

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.370
myself

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.049
as old enough to

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.879
really have any wisdom to impart,

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.909
but there's nothing like having children
to remind you of how old you are. My

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.380
nine-year-old daughter is here with me now

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.789
uh... or to remind you about deeply uncool you are

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.939
so I'm gonna

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.930
take on this task with some trepidation.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.009
The best commencement speech I ever

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.810
heard, or heard of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.250
was by Art Buchwald, the humorist. His address was short, was brief.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.199
He simply said

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.999
ladies and gentlemen remember we are
leaving you a perfect world

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.259
don't screw it up.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.480
Now you are not likely to hear that
message much these days.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.680
Instead you're likely to hear that we
are living in green economic times

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.259
the graduates are going to be told that
they are graduating into the slowest,

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.019
economic recovery since World War Two

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.030
and it's not just economic worries

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.449
ever since nine eleven we have been
worried about terrorism,

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.970
fearful of the dangers of new attacks,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.990
that have in many ways altered our daily lives.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.789
Then there are larger concerns you hear
about

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.189
the earth is getting hotter, we're
running out of water, a billion people

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.070
are trapped in terrible poverty.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.940
So I want to sketch out for you

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.199
perhaps with a little bit of historical
perspective

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.770
the world as I see it.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.689
The world we live in his first of all
at peace

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.129
profoundly so

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.990
the richest countries of the world are
not in major geopolitical, geomilitary

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.850
competition with one another

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.220
no arms races, no proxy races, no
wars, no cold wars among the

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.120
richest countries of the world.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.179
You would have to go back

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:49.600
hundreds of years

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.149
to find an equivalent period of
political stability.

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:54.230
I know that you

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.590
see a bomb going off in Afghanistan or
hear of a terror plot in New York

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.229
and worry about

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.879
the safety and security of 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.130
our times.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.009
But here is the data:

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.289
the number of people who have died as a result of war, civil war, and yes,

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.509
terrorism,

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.080
is down fifty percent this decade

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.979
from the 1990s

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.659
it is down seventy five percent from the
preceding five decades. It is down of

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.569
course the ninety nine percent from the
decade before that which was World War

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:27.999
Two.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.580
Steven Pinker argues that we are living
in the most peaceful times

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.970
in human history.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.479
And he should know because he is a
Harvard professor.

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.750
The political stability that we've
experienced has allowed the creation of

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.780
a single global economy

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.069
that has allowed

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.330
countries from all over the world

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.740
to participate and flourish.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.720
In 1980 the number of
countries that were growing up four

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.459
percent a year, with robust growth

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.220
was about sixteen.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.419
By 2007 that number
had doubled

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.849
and even after the financial
crisis that number stands today

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.360
at about eighty.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.560
Countries around the world are thriving
and flourishing in a way

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.039
that was previously unimaginable.

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.800
Even in the current decade with all
its slow growth

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.380
the global economy as a whole would grow
ten to twenty percent faster than it did

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.669
last decade

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.999
sixty-percent faster than it did two
decades ago

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:30.009
and five times as fast as it did three
decades ago.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.680
The result is that the united nations
estimates

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.079
in the last fifty years

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.980
poverty has been reduced more than in
the preceding

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.559
five hundred years.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:43.030
Most of that reduction has taken place
in the last twenty.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.830
The average Chinese person is today ten
times richer

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.059
that he or she was fifty years ago

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.330
with twenty five years more of life
expectancy.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.409
Life expectancy has risen across the
world

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:56.749
dramatically.

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.089
we gain

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:00.939
five hours of life expectancy

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:06.839
everyday. Imagine that, without even
exercising!

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.889
a court of all the babies born in the
developed world

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.210
this year

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.649
will live to be a hundred.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.599
All this is, of course, because of rising
standards of living of hygiene and

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.069
medicine.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:22.889
Atul Gawande, another Harvard
professor

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.930
who was also a practicing surgeon,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.240
who also writes for the New Yorker
magazine tells of a nineteenth century

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.079
operation perhaps not so one common

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:33.409
In this case, the surgeon was trying to amputate

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.890
the patient's leg.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.370
He succeeded.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.730
He also, however, amputated his assistant's
hand.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.500
The two patients, I suppose one would call
them

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.120
died of sepsis.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.510
An onlooker died of shock.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.150
It is the only known medical procedure
to have a three hundred percent fatality.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.060
We've come a long way.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.160
To understand the astonishing age of
progress

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.189
just look at the cell phones you have in
your pockets.

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:04.949
and yes, I know many of you don't have
them in your pockets -- they are already out,

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:08.100
and you are looking at them right now.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.800
That cell phone has more computing power
than the Apollo space capsule that went

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.920
to the moon.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.320
That capsule couldn't even tweet.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.210
So imagine the opportunities that lie
ahead.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.230
Moore's Law, which says that computing
power will double every eighteen months

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.620
while costs have

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.230
may be petering out

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.369
in the realm of information technology.

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:32.640
But there are other arenas in which it
is accelerating.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.220
The human genome is being sequenced
at a pace faster

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.650
than Moore's Law.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.100
A third industrial revolution involving
material science

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.420
and the customization of manufacturing

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.400
is yet in its infancy.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.690
And all of these fields are beginning to
intersect and produce new opportunities in

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.470
ways that we can't even imagine.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.560
The good news goes on. Look at the number
of graduates globally from colleges.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.290
That number has risen four-fold in the
last forty years for men.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.430
It has risen sevenfold for women.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.020
And if you're wondering

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.530
whether or not that age old question how
women smarter than men has been answered,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.759
the evidence is now overwhelming.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:19.560
The answer is yes.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.520
My favorite example of this is that there
was a study done

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.850
That over the last twenty five years

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.940
female representatives, members of the
House of Representatives have had

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.390
managed to get forty nine million
dollars more in federal grant money

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.030
than their male counterparts.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.950
So even at

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.890
pork barrel spending it turns out women
are better than men.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.139
And so i look forward from the villages
in Africa to the board rooms of America

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:49.269
To the increasing participation of women
which is going to enrich and ennoble our

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:50.480
world.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.800
Now you might listen to all this and say

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.870
You might listen to all this and say, well, this
is all a very good for the world but

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.250
what does it mean for America?

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.730
Well, a world at peace brought prosperity,
the rise of the rest

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.400
is going to be particularly good for the
United States

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.460
because let me remind you this is the
country with the largest and most

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.240
dynamic economy in the world

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.470
that hosts

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.800
hundreds of the world's greatest
companies

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.700
that dominates the age of technology

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.030
It has almost all of the world's
great universities

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.880
There is in China and India no Harvard
and there will not be for decades,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.560
perhaps ever.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.290
the United States is also a vital
society

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.780
It is the only country in the industrialized world

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.930
that is demographically vibrant.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.730
We add three million people to this
country every year.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.560
That is itself a powerful life force,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.830
and it is made stronger by the fact

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.750
that so many of these people are
immigrants.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.050
They... I should say, we come to this country with
aspirations, with drive, with

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.100
determination and we develop a fierce
love of this country.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.900
America in 2050 will
have a better demographic profile than

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.310
China.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.560
So this country has its problems,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.829
but i would rather have America's
problems

00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:21.829
than most any other countries in the
world.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.680
When I tell you that we're living in
an astonishing age of progress, I am

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.670
not urging complacency, far from it.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.540
We have been through a century of
extraordinary troubles:

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.200
world wars

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.590
depressions

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.420
cold wars and dozens of other smaller
challenges

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.440
but each of those challenges has been
matched by a response.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.999
Human action and human achievement have
managed to take on

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:52.939
and best

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.560
terrible problems.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.420
We forget our successes

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.090
in 2009

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.270
the H1N1 virus broke out in
Mexico.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.780
Now, if you look back at the trajectory
of these kinds of viruses

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.730
it's quite conceivable that this one
would have spread like the asian flu

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.149
of 1957

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:11.690
or 1968

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.110
which cost four million lives.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.170
But this time, the Mexican health
authorities identified the problem early,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.680
shared the information with the World
Health Organization

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.269
learned best practices

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.539
tracked down where the outbreak took place,
quarantined people,

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.230
vaccinated others.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.520
The country went on a full-scale alert

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.240
in a very Catholic country

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.180
it was not allowed to go to church

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.550
for three Sundays.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.440
Perhaps more importantly you couldn't go
to a soccer game

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.000
for three weeks.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.720
But the result was

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.660
that the virus was contained

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.580
to the point where three months later
people asked what was the fuss and

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.980
wondered whether we had overreacted.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.860
We hadn't overreacted.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.410
We had reacted.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.030
We have responded.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.380
And we had dealt with the problem.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.030
There are other examples.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.760
In the twelve months following the
economic peak in 2008

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.610
industrial production worldwide fell as
much as it did

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.090
in the first year of the great
depression.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.280
Equity prices and global trade actually
fell more.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.060
Yet this time no great depression followed.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.840
Why? Because of the coordinated actions of
governments around the world.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.149
9/11 did not usher in 

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:25.820
an age of terrorism with Al Qaeda

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.800
going from strength to strength.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.420
Why? Because countries cooperated in
fighting them and other terrorists around

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.550
the world with considerable success.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.290
When we come together

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.020
when we put aside our petty differences

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.710
when we cooperate

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.890
the results are astounding.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.970
So when we look at all these problems we
face economic crises, terrorism,

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.520
climate change, resource scarcity-

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.730
keep in mind

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.500
that these are real problems

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.770
but that the human reaction and response
to them will be real.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.940
you can easily map out the big problem

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.710
but it's much more difficult

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.910
to map out the thousands of individual
actions that governments, firms,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.509
organizations, researchers, scientists,

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.650
and ordinary people will take

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.750
that will collectively constitute

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.830
the solution.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.250
In a sense I'm betting on the graduates
of this great university.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.480
I believe that your actions will have
consequences.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.180
your efforts will make a difference.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.679
And according to the graduates I know of
this kind of event,

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.340
I'm supposed to provide some advice.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.140
So, should you go into nanotechnology or
bioengineering

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.120
and the answer is that I haven't a clue.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.640
I honestly don't know what the great
trends of the future or industries of

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.430
the future will be.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.070
But I do know one thing: that human
beings will probably continue to reward

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.380
those talents of heart and mind that
they have always rewarded for

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.170
thousands of years.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.090
Intelligence, hard work, discipline, courage,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.430
perhaps above all

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.290
love and faith

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.740
these are the things

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.480
that at the end of the day make for a
great life; one that is rewarded by the

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.310
outside world.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.440
An equally importantly a good life one
that is rewarded by only those you know

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.000
best.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.570
These are the virtues that people honor.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:19.450
These are the virtues that people have
built statues for five thousand years

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.950
and to which they will be statues for
the next five thousand years... well nobody

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.520
does statues anymore. They build weird, metal, modernist sculptures with

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.070
strange doodads hanging
off them but you get my general point.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.490
Trust yourself. You know what kind of
life you should live. You don't need an

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.660
ethics course to tell you what not to do.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.620
Trust in your instincts and you will
build a great life

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.120
you will build a good life

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.220
and you will change the world.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.420
You know, I said at my age that I don't
have written much specific wisdom to

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.520
impart

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.190
I have one final piece of advice

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.780
for the graduates

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.760
and it is a piece of advice that is
gained from

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.490
experience not books.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.459
Trust me about this.

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:10.140
You will never understand how much your
parents love you until you have children

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.559
of your own.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.630
Once you have children of your own,

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.000
once you have children of your own, all
that strange behavior- the stalking, the

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.900
worrying- it all makes sense.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.510
But do me a favor

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.260
don't wait so long.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.140
My mother lives eight thousand miles
away and I think about this every day.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.100
Don't wait so long.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.830
Get up today of all days and hug your
parents and tell them you love them.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.690
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and to the graduates of Harvard, godspeed.
