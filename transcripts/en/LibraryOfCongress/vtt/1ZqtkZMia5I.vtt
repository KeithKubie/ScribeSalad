SPEAKER: I hope we're 
fashionably late this afternoon.

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:26.262
The Justice is getting micced up
right now.  Good afternoon 

00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:29.591
distinguished guests and 
colleagues.  Thank you for 

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:32.069
joining the law Library of 
Congress and the United States 

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.075
Supreme Court today for the 2019
Supreme Court Fellows Program 

00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:41.943
annual lecture.  My name is Jane
Sanchez and I have the 

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.830
honor of serving as the 25th law

00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:50.893
Librarian of Congress.  

00:13:52.294 --> 00:13:54.294
[applause] 

00:14:00.794 --> 00:14:02.794
The Law Library serves as the 

00:14:04.074 --> 00:14:06.340
nation's custodian of nearly 3 
million items from all countries

00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:08.341
and legal systems of the world.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.515
Our foreign law specialists are 
a diverse group of 

00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:15.516
foreign-trained 

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.020
attorneys and specialists with a
diverse 

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.070
group of librarians as well.

00:14:25.394 --> 00:14:26.827
We do information and analysis 
of 270 countries around the 

00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:28.828
world.

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:33.535
Our skilled Law Library staff, 
both 

00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:37.033
American-trained and Law 
Librarians also provide research

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:40.525
assistance and reference on U.S.
, federal, and state legal 

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:42.964
issues.  
   While our collection and 

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.965
expertise 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.240
reach across all points of the 
globe, for today's event...

00:14:50.109 --> 00:14:52.109
we partnered with our next door 

00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:54.607
neighbor, who happens to be the 
highest court in the country.  

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:00.515
While I don't want to overstate 
our 

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:04.470
love and admiration for our 
colleagues across street, it is 

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:06.903
probably not mere coincidence 
that we hold today's event on 

00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:08.904
Valentine's Day.

00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:12.821
[laughter] 
   Just saying.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.742
This afternoon, we're pleased to
be able to collaborate with the 

00:15:18.743 --> 00:15:20.743
Supreme 

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:24.856
Court as they celebrate their 
46th year of the fellows 

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.857
program.

00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:30.806
It is well-known that our 
featured speaker today has an 

00:15:30.807 --> 00:15:32.807
affinity for baseball.

00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:37.528
If any of you have time to stay 
after the event, I encourage you

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:39.529
to head up to 

00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.455
the specked floor of this 
building to see our baseball 

00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:45.456
Americana exhibition.

00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.766
It features items from the 
library's collections and as 

00:15:49.767 --> 00:15:52.842
well as from the national 
baseball Hall of Fame.  And MLB.

00:15:57.116 --> 00:15:59.116
Please note that today's program
is 

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.223
being live streamed on the 
Library of Congress YouTube 

00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:04.224
channel, so all sounds, 

00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:08.326
images and remarks will be 
captured on video.  Please take 

00:16:08.327 --> 00:16:10.327
a moment to silence your 

00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:12.871
cell phones and refrain from 
taking photos during the event. 

00:16:16.754 --> 00:16:18.754
At this time, I'd like to invite
Jeffrey P.

00:16:22.043 --> 00:16:22.653
Minear, Executive Director of 
the Supreme Court Fellows 

00:16:22.654 --> 00:16:24.699
Program and counselor to the 
Chief Justice of the United 

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.700
States.  Thank you.

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.716
[applause] 

00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:40.911
   SPEAKER: Thank you, Jane, for
your warm introduction and 

00:16:40.912 --> 00:16:42.912
thanks to you and 

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.019
the Law Library of Congress for 
your fellowship in sponsoring 

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.490
this afternoon's event.  It's 
wonderful to have such a great 

00:16:49.918 --> 00:16:51.966
turnout for a very special 
gathering of the friends and 

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.967
alumni of the program. 

00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:57.055
Let me say just a word about the
program in my capacity as its 

00:16:57.056 --> 00:16:59.901
Executive Director.  Each year, 
the Supreme Court fellows 

00:17:01.732 --> 00:17:03.732
commission made up of federal 
judges and 

00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:06.636
other legal leaders appointed by
the Chief Justice selects four 

00:17:06.637 --> 00:17:10.907
talented professionals to spend 
a year within the federal 

00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:13.147
judiciary, participating in 
court administration, while 

00:17:13.148 --> 00:17:15.148
engaging in 

00:17:16.456 --> 00:17:18.456
research and other enrichment 
activities.  

00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:23.012
Today's event is a public 
component of two days of 

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:25.013
activities in which we celebrate
our current Supreme Court 

00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:28.485
fellows and bring together 46 
years of fellows program alumni.

00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:31.835
Over the course of today and 
tomorrow, we will also select 

00:17:31.836 --> 00:17:35.314
next year's fellows from the 
superb finalists who are with us

00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:37.315
this afternoon.  
   I understand we have many law

00:17:39.616 --> 00:17:40.838
students with us in the audience
today, as well as law clerks 

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:45.532
from several courts in the 
federal and state systems.  If 

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.980
you care about the judiciary and
are interested in how our 

00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:49.981
federal courts 

00:17:51.054 --> 00:17:52.270
work, I hope you will take the 
time to learn about the 

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.311
fellowship opportunity we offer 
and consider applying in a 

00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:56.749
future year.

00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:01.721
I invite you to visit our 
website at fellows.supremecourt.

00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:03.722
gov.

00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:06.775
Applications for the 2021 class 
will be due in November. 

00:18:07.832 --> 00:18:09.832
First, we have a great feature 
this afternoon.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.924
We'll be joined by the 111th 
justice of the Supreme Court of 

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:17.200
the United States, the honorable
Sonia Sotomayor.  Who has served

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:19.201
on the Supreme Court since 2009.

00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.540
Six years ago, Justice Sotomayor
published her best-selling 

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:28.843
autobiography My Beloved World. 
Last year she released two more 

00:18:29.052 --> 00:18:31.052
volumes.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.155
The Beloved World of Sonia 
Sotomayor, 

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:39.053
Middle School Readers and Turn 
Pages for elementary school 

00:18:39.054 --> 00:18:41.699
readers.  These books have been 
inspiring people of all ages. 

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.569
   We have two wonderful 
moderators for today's 

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.570
conversation.  Chief judge 
Robert A.

00:18:52.511 --> 00:18:54.511
Katzmann from the United States 
Court of Appeals.

00:18:57.093 --> 00:18:59.153
He's also the chairman of the 
Supreme Court Fellows 

00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.154
Commission.

00:19:04.044 --> 00:19:06.285
Professor Eloise Pasachoff is a 
distinguished scholar at 

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:08.286
Georgetown University Law 
Center.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.192
She's an academic from the 
Fellows Program.

00:19:14.883 --> 00:19:17.127
She served two two highly 
regarded chairs that may sound 

00:19:17.128 --> 00:19:19.128
familiar.

00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:26.765
Justice Sotomayor and Judge 
Katzmann.  Please give them a 

00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:28.766
warm welcome.  

00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.667
[applause] 

00:19:35.672 --> 00:19:37.672
[cheering and applause] 

00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:02.315
   SPEAKER: This room is so 
beautiful.  It's just a 

00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:04.316
beautiful room.

00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:12.515
   SPEAKER: I have the privilege
of asking the first question...

00:20:17.402 --> 00:20:20.048
[laughter]
   SPEAKER: Justice Sotomayor, a

00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:23.930
few years ago... you wrote the 
best-selling, my beloved world.

00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:29.788
Which is widely acclaimed, 
available 

00:20:32.902 --> 00:20:35.186
in paperback, required reading 
in school districts across the 

00:20:35.187 --> 00:20:39.888
country.  In the past year, you 
published two more books, this 

00:20:39.889 --> 00:20:41.889
time for younger readers.

00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:46.941
One called Turning Pages

00:20:50.095 --> 00:20:54.142
and the other called The Beloved
World of Sonia Sotomayor.  You 

00:20:54.143 --> 00:20:56.143
managed to do this while having 
a busy important day job.

00:20:59.263 --> 00:21:01.263
What motivated you to write 
these books? 

00:21:03.198 --> 00:21:06.197
SPEAKER: I should tell the story
of My Beloved World. 

00:21:11.343 --> 00:21:12.363
The publication department 
called me up one day and said, 

00:21:12.364 --> 00:21:14.364
we really should do this event.

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:21.339
I said, Michelle, it's hard for 
me to break away and do that 

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.340
event, I just can't say yes.

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.208
I stopped her and said, I have a
distracting little job.  

00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:38.553
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: She actually quoted 

00:21:38.554 --> 00:21:40.554
those words and put them up on 
her desk.

00:21:58.238 --> 00:21:59.678
Writing these books isn't a 
distraction for me, writing 

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:01.679
these particular books was an 
important mission for me.

00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:08.001
The middle school book, The 
Beloved 

00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:12.091
World of Sonia Sotomayor, was a 
product 

00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:15.759
of my cousin, Miriam, who is a 
bilingual 

00:22:17.448 --> 00:22:20.747
education middle school teacher 
in Stamford, Connecticut.  She's

00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:21.559
been using my adult book for 
lesson plans for her students 

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.560
for a number of years.

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.840
She kept insisting she needed a 
middle grade book.  Because the 

00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:34.075
parents book, now that I have 
two kids books...

00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:40.568
now I call My Beloved World the 
parent book.

00:22:40.815 --> 00:22:42.815
[laughter] 
   My parent book had too many 

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.525
sophisticated concepts.  She 
wanted a middle school book that

00:22:46.747 --> 00:22:46.945
dealt more with the stories that
children could more-easily 

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:48.946
understand.

00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:05.954
   They talked about a younger 
reader book.  I realized that 

00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:07.955
would be a book that was equally
as important.

00:23:28.194 --> 00:23:30.256
For those who are adults, I 
ended up loving the young reader

00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:32.257
book, Turning Pages.

00:23:36.158 --> 00:23:38.158
The illustrations and I didn't 
do them.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.993
Lula dela Cray [phonetic] did 
and they are beautiful.  I had 

00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:47.994
no idea how hard illustrators 
worked until I worked with one.

00:23:51.087 --> 00:23:53.087
She did incredibly, extensive 
research 

00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:56.345
on every single theme.

00:23:58.214 --> 00:23:59.227
She was on the internet 
constantly to make sure that 

00:23:59.228 --> 00:24:02.226
every single detail was 
accurate. 

00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:08.648
She went through -- I have a 
suitcase of old photographs, 

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:10.649
lots of people have 

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:14.518
gone through that suitcase, 
including me...

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:17.859
she not-only went through it, 
but devoured it and found things

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.860
I didn't know.  So...

00:24:22.347 --> 00:24:25.239
one scene in turning pages, she 
gave me a picture with me and 

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.722
these flowered pants and I wrote
back "I would never wear 

00:24:27.723 --> 00:24:29.723
flowered pants."  

00:24:30.748 --> 00:24:32.748
[laughter] 

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.110
And she sent me back a picture 
of a kid wearing flowered pants.

00:24:37.994 --> 00:24:39.994
And I said "I stand corrected.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.704
"  But it was that -- she's just
done an extraordinary job.  

00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:45.705
But...

00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:50.100
it was from the hope that my 
story will serve 

00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:55.781
as an inspiration for kids who 
came from my kind of background.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.121
To know that what I have 
achieved is possible for them 

00:25:01.122 --> 00:25:03.964
too.  And... that's the purpose 
of my books.

00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:11.742
To tell those kids who come from
circumstances similar to my own 

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:15.413
that all dreams are really 
possible.  

00:25:16.024 --> 00:25:18.024
And...

00:25:19.955 --> 00:25:21.955
having a living example, I 
think, is 

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.880
terribly important to people who
live in 

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.380
situations in which their life 
can often 

00:25:31.475 --> 00:25:35.208
appear impossible or so 
desperate that no good can come 

00:25:31.475 --> 00:25:33.475
from it.  And so...

00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:40.811
that's the purpose of all three 
of my books.

00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:46.389
I hope to give hope.
   SPEAKER: So... there's 

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.440
another way in which you've been
touching children's lives 

00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:50.916
recently, that's through your 
work with civics education. 

00:25:51.314 --> 00:25:53.314
SPEAKER: Ah. 
   SPEAKER: So...

00:25:56.043 --> 00:25:58.043
you've been active in this 
program 

00:25:59.087 --> 00:26:01.087
called

00:26:06.548 --> 00:26:10.427
ICIVICS [phonetic] founded by 
Sandra Day O'Connor.  Could you 

00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:13.679
talk to us about why that's an 
important mission?  What's 

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.680
necessary about it -- what are 
you doing with it? 

00:26:17.988 --> 00:26:19.988
SPEAKER: I'll tell you how I 
started 

00:26:21.399 --> 00:26:23.399
getting involved with

00:26:25.325 --> 00:26:27.325
ICIVICS.

00:26:29.806 --> 00:26:31.806
There was an event honoring 
O'Connor 

00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:36.113
and Mont speakers was the head 
of ICIVIS 

00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:41.171
and she described the purpose of

00:26:45.786 --> 00:26:47.786
ICIVICS and the games.

00:26:50.493 --> 00:26:52.493
I wondered if the games could 
teach bilingual students.

00:26:57.844 --> 00:27:01.844
10% of the United States, could 
this be used to teach those 

00:26:57.844 --> 00:27:00.841
civics. 

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.680
She said to me "I love the 
games, but 

00:27:12.943 --> 00:27:16.217
they're too sophisticated for my
students."  For students just 

00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:18.465
beginning to master the English 
language -- they're not 

00:27:19.082 --> 00:27:21.331
accessible yet. 
   My next question was, do you 

00:27:21.332 --> 00:27:23.975
think the games could be tweaked
two make them accessible?  She 

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.976
said "let me think about it.

00:27:26.985 --> 00:27:28.985
" 

00:27:35.261 --> 00:27:37.261
She said, I'm putting you in 
touch with 

00:27:39.332 --> 00:27:43.198
Louise, the one in charge of 
ICIVICS and let's talk about 

00:27:39.332 --> 00:27:42.329
your idea. 

00:27:48.145 --> 00:27:50.400
An Advisory Committee was put 
together of educators across the

00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:55.077
country.  The games are being 
translated into Spanish, but the

00:27:55.078 --> 00:27:57.078
exercise taught us that 

00:27:58.166 --> 00:28:00.609
there were things in the English
versions that were hindering 

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.809
slow-learners.  
   So...

00:28:05.292 --> 00:28:08.355
one of the things we found out 
or realized is... that some slow

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:10.356
learners, whether 

00:28:11.645 --> 00:28:13.645
they're Spanish-speaking or any 
other 

00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:15.986
language-speaking or just slow 
readers have a problem with 

00:28:15.987 --> 00:28:18.986
literal words. 

00:28:23.763 --> 00:28:25.185
Throw the book at someone.  They
don't understand the secondary 

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.186
meaning of something like that.

00:28:29.889 --> 00:28:35.192
   So... now we created a 
glossary, not just for the 

00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:37.193
Spanish speakers, but for the 

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.333
English speakers who have 
trouble with literalism and 

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:42.171
believe it or not, there's quite
a sizeable population of readers

00:28:42.172 --> 00:28:44.172
with that difficulty.

00:28:50.753 --> 00:28:54.856
   So... now, there's an English
glossary and Spanish glossary.  

00:28:54.857 --> 00:28:56.857
So... two of the games have been
translated, 

00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:02.375
they're now working on more of 
the games.  But...

00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:06.051
it was my small contribution to 
being 

00:29:07.722 --> 00:29:09.722
as a result of calling about 
this issue...

00:29:11.991 --> 00:29:12.600
to join the board after Justice 
O'Connor was stepping away from 

00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:14.601
public life.

00:29:17.095 --> 00:29:19.095
They wanted a part of the 
Supreme 

00:29:21.973 --> 00:29:22.816
Court to always be represented 
in ICIVICS because she was its 

00:29:22.817 --> 00:29:25.813
founder and originator. 

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:02.705
It is surprising how many 
people, who are well-educated 

00:30:02.706 --> 00:30:07.376
don't get 100% on the games.  
The kids love them.  It teaches 

00:30:07.377 --> 00:30:08.600
them about civics, but... you're
more fundamental part of your 

00:30:08.601 --> 00:30:10.601
question was why.

00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:22.674
We can't preserve our democracy 
unless 

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.960
our citizens are informed about 
it.

00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:30.074
Ben Franklin was asked as he was
leaving the constitutional 

00:30:30.075 --> 00:30:31.916
convention, what do we have 
doctor?  A monarchy or a 

00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:33.917
republic?

00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:47.200
His response was "a republic, if
you keep it."  We can't keep it 

00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:49.201
if we're being 

00:30:51.287 --> 00:30:54.749
educated about our Civic Life 
and our civic responsibilities. 

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.766
We have rights, because they 
come with obligations and they 

00:30:55.767 --> 00:30:57.767
obligate us to preserve our 
democracy.

00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:10.435
And to make sure it remain 
vibrant.  My charge, personally,

00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:12.436
morally as a 

00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:16.307
justice, is to ensure that I 
don't just 

00:31:18.848 --> 00:31:20.848
write about the constitution, 
but that I 

00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:24.673
teach about it and

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:28.233
try to enview everyone with a 
passion and love as deep as the 

00:31:28.234 --> 00:31:31.232
one I feel. 

00:31:43.503 --> 00:31:45.503
We're working as a community to 
empower 

00:31:48.184 --> 00:31:49.406
and ensure that every member is 
striving as hard as we are 

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:51.407
individually to be active in it.

00:32:05.731 --> 00:32:05.937
I'm doing everything I can to 
further it even more than she 

00:32:05.938 --> 00:32:07.938
already did.

00:32:15.546 --> 00:32:17.546
SPEAKER: I can't wait to have 
you 

00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:23.292
back at your old courthouse -- 
in the Marshall Courthouse, we 

00:32:23.293 --> 00:32:25.293
launched a 

00:32:28.378 --> 00:32:30.378
circuit-wide project, Justice 
for All courts in the community.

00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:34.106
It's the nation's first 
coordinated civic education 

00:32:34.107 --> 00:32:36.107
program, involving every court 
in our circuit.

00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.684
We have this wonderful learning 
center 

00:32:45.781 --> 00:32:49.890
where children can come in and 
meet with the judges.  We have 

00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:51.891
teachers institutes where 

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:57.138
teachers come in and meet with 
judges and scholars about social

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:54.938
studies.

00:33:05.418 --> 00:33:07.418
We have curriculum exchanges 
with the 

00:33:08.704 --> 00:33:10.704
boards of education on how to 
teach.

00:33:12.165 --> 00:33:14.165
We go out to the communities 
every day...

00:33:16.228 --> 00:33:18.228
Law Week, Constitution Week and 
we've 

00:33:19.241 --> 00:33:24.435
got a wonderful poster about 
you, so you definitely have to 

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:26.436
come back.

00:33:29.503 --> 00:33:31.503
We're working on an exhibit and 
her time.

00:33:37.934 --> 00:33:39.760
Sonia Sotomayor was born in 
1954.  You'll be able to check 

00:33:39.761 --> 00:33:41.761
what she was doing in 1970.

00:33:42.762 --> 00:33:44.762
[laughter] 

00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:56.538
   SPEAKER: It's a way of 
bringing our young people closer

00:33:56.539 --> 00:33:58.539
to the communities and the 
courts.

00:34:00.465 --> 00:34:02.465
So... we can't wait to have you 
back with us...

00:34:07.221 --> 00:34:11.904
   SPEAKER: Make sure you visit 
500 Pearl Street.  The learning 

00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:13.905
center, I served before it was 
opened.

00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:18.583
Pieces of it before it was open.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.290
SPEAKER: It said 40 Foley. 
   SPEAKER: Oh... sorry.

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.398
SPEAKER: One of the things 
that's quite moving as an 

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.509
example --
   SPEAKER: They're right next 

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.481
door to each other. 

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.410
   &gt;&gt; SPEAKER: For a young 
person, how extraordinary is it 

00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:54.411
to bring to life one of the 
great icons.

00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:06.149
You were a judge before 
President Obama nominated you to

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.150
the Supreme Court. .  Then as a 
countertops judge in New York.

00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:14.308
What are some of the differences
between your day-to-day work on 

00:35:14.309 --> 00:35:15.324
those courts and your current 
day-to-day work on the Supreme 

00:35:15.325 --> 00:35:17.325
Court?

00:35:19.467 --> 00:35:21.467
I won't ask you which job you 
like better... 

00:35:22.455 --> 00:35:25.152
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: But I'll answer 

00:35:25.153 --> 00:35:27.153
that.  I'll include an answer to
that.

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:29.275
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: I've often described

00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:32.272
the difference between the three

00:35:38.337 --> 00:35:40.337
courts as follows.

00:35:42.817 --> 00:35:44.817
District court life is like 
controlled chaos.

00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:51.395
There's a fast-move ing pace 
every single moment of every 

00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:53.848
single day.  There are countless
different motions running and...

00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:56.255
jumping through your door.

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:00.410
There are hearings and trials 
and procedures of all kinds 

00:36:00.411 --> 00:36:03.403
occurring in the courtroom. 

00:36:07.546 --> 00:36:10.015
What you can expect is that one 
day will never look like the 

00:36:10.016 --> 00:36:16.244
preceding day and no two days 
are ever identical.  The amount 

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:18.245
of information you absorb as 

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.546
a judge is an, in one given day,
is so large that at the end of 

00:36:21.547 --> 00:36:23.547
my first year 

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.451
as a district court judge, I 
told a friend that I finally 

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:29.452
understood why the brain is a 
muscle.

00:36:39.905 --> 00:36:42.580
All the knowledge I was stuffing
into it, it's a good thing it 

00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:44.828
was a muscle and could stretch. 

00:36:50.256 --> 00:36:52.256
It is not only varied in the 
matters 

00:36:53.714 --> 00:36:56.610
the district court judge is 
handling, and the issues that 

00:36:56.611 --> 00:36:59.119
you're dealing with, but it's 
also varied in your human 

00:37:00.546 --> 00:37:02.546
interactions with people.

00:37:04.215 --> 00:37:06.452
You're dealing with lawyers and 
not just in cursory ways, the 

00:37:06.453 --> 00:37:10.517
conference room where a motion 
might be, but in the hearing, 

00:37:10.518 --> 00:37:12.518
they'll appear before you for a 

00:37:15.618 --> 00:37:17.245
number of hours, if not days, 
and certainly for days, if not 

00:37:17.246 --> 00:37:19.246
weeks or months in an extended 
trial. 

00:37:22.195 --> 00:37:24.844
You get to know, not just those 
lawyers and their personalities,

00:37:24.845 --> 00:37:28.315
but their styles and what's 
important to them as litigators,

00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:33.200
as they get to know what's 
important to me, as a judge.  

00:37:33.201 --> 00:37:35.201
It's very personal enterprise 
and...

00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:38.281
you're hearing witnesses, you're

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:41.379
hearing from parties, you're 
dealing 

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.344
with jurors and their own pica
dillos and their own reactions. 

00:37:50.345 --> 00:37:53.027
One of the most-fun things to do
was to present a litigator 

00:37:53.028 --> 00:37:55.884
before her case or a jury and 
watch how the jury was reacting.

00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:02.396
I'd often take notes and at the 
end of the trial, go back to the

00:38:02.397 --> 00:38:06.681
litigants and say "when you did 
this, the jurors didn't like it.

00:38:09.145 --> 00:38:12.033
"  And I'll tell you why I think
why or they really enjoyed that 

00:38:12.034 --> 00:38:14.511
part of your presentation.  
Maybe you should think of 

00:38:14.512 --> 00:38:16.512
including more of that in what 
you're doing.

00:38:24.731 --> 00:38:25.544
What you're focused in on as a 
trial judge, a district court 

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:27.545
judge is the parties before you.

00:38:31.046 --> 00:38:33.046
And you're trying to resolve 
their dispute.

00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:40.481
You're trying to understand why 
this case is important to them, 

00:38:40.482 --> 00:38:42.514
what about the issues is 
motivating this dispute and...

00:38:47.416 --> 00:38:49.458
you're also trying to figure out
what's important to them in 

00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:53.153
terms of settling the case if 
you can.  That's part of your 

00:38:53.154 --> 00:38:59.063
charge to try to avoid the 
litigation, if you can.  You'll 

00:38:59.064 --> 00:39:01.064
have to understand the why of 
doing that.

00:39:12.169 --> 00:39:15.066
Finding justice for those two 
parties, when ours a Court of 

00:39:15.067 --> 00:39:19.353
Appeals and Appellate Court, 
it's a different kind of 

00:39:19.354 --> 00:39:24.031
justice.  You're trying and 
dealing within the parameters 

00:39:24.032 --> 00:39:26.032
set by the Supreme Court and 

00:39:29.983 --> 00:39:31.608
the precedence it's created and 
the precedence of your own 

00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:33.226
circuit and looking for 
uniformity in that part of your 

00:39:33.227 --> 00:39:35.227
world in the circuit.

00:39:39.957 --> 00:39:41.957
You're trying to find justice 
under the 

00:39:43.618 --> 00:39:44.843
law, as it exists at that moment
in that place, your circuit.  

00:39:44.844 --> 00:39:46.844
   So...

00:39:49.746 --> 00:39:51.746
it's justice for the law in that
place.

00:39:54.224 --> 00:39:56.224
When you're on the Supreme 
Court, and 

00:39:57.489 --> 00:39:59.723
their life is more 
contemplative, you are dealing 

00:39:59.724 --> 00:40:01.724
with lots of cases, 

00:40:02.997 --> 00:40:04.997
certainly not as many as on the 
district court.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.792
Only about, I think, it's ten, 
the maximum, 15% of all district

00:40:09.793 --> 00:40:11.793
court cases ever end up on 
appeal, generally.

00:40:13.452 --> 00:40:18.780
And so... you're dealing with a 
volume that is, by definition, 

00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:20.781
much smaller than on the 
district court.  

00:40:22.096 --> 00:40:24.096
Most of the cases, not all...

00:40:25.984 --> 00:40:28.439
they all have one or more twist 
in them, but... they're more 

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.318
clearly controlled by precedent 
than not.  You do get, maybe...

00:40:37.243 --> 00:40:39.480
in that 10%, 10% of the cases 
that might ultimately be 

00:40:39.481 --> 00:40:41.481
reviewed by the Supreme Court.  
   So...

00:40:44.177 --> 00:40:46.177
it's a smaller fraction of your 
overall work.  And...

00:40:48.702 --> 00:40:50.933
I don't want to say the circuit 
court can become more 

00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:53.792
routinized, but it does have a 
pace where there are things that

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.482
are much more controlled, 
clearly by prior law, prior 

00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:00.483
precedence and so...

00:41:01.535 --> 00:41:04.197
what you're trying to do is to 
ensure that you get to your work

00:41:04.198 --> 00:41:06.198
in an efficient way, so...

00:41:08.268 --> 00:41:10.268
the parties are not kept waiting
forever.  

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.720
The same task the district court
is 

00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:16.637
trying to do, but you're trying 
to be clear for those parties 

00:41:16.638 --> 00:41:20.153
within your jurisdiction.  
   Supreme Court, well...

00:41:25.496 --> 00:41:27.496
we take now, on average, 60 to 
70 cases a term.

00:41:30.004 --> 00:41:33.471
It's been closer to 60, Mark, 
the last couple years, okay?  

00:41:33.472 --> 00:41:38.153
The last couple terms.  There's 
less volume, but... every case, 

00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:40.154
the Supreme Court takes is a 
Supreme Court case.

00:41:42.457 --> 00:41:44.457
And what that means is...

00:41:46.749 --> 00:41:48.749
that it's an unsettled area of 
law.

00:41:50.398 --> 00:41:53.303
It's an area in which reasonable
jurors across the country have 

00:41:53.304 --> 00:41:55.304
disagreed.  Because...

00:41:59.986 --> 00:42:02.301
we rarely have ever taken a case
unless there's a split among the

00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:05.420
courts below.  There are 13 
circuit courts across the 

00:42:07.049 --> 00:42:09.049
country and those courts don't 
all agree on issues of law.

00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:13.776
And it is those cases that the 
Supreme Court exists to correct.

00:42:17.863 --> 00:42:19.296
Those cases in which those 
reasonable judges of both 

00:42:19.297 --> 00:42:21.297
genders are agreeing or 
disagreeing.

00:42:26.884 --> 00:42:29.774
They're harder cases.  We tend 
to have much more reading than 

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.400
even the courts below.

00:42:36.098 --> 00:42:38.098
The number of Amica briefs can 
number into the multiples of 10.

00:42:38.351 --> 00:42:40.351
   And...

00:42:42.465 --> 00:42:44.095
the briefing may be the same 
size on the Court of Appeals, 

00:42:44.096 --> 00:42:46.096
but...

00:42:47.591 --> 00:42:49.591
the research, in terms of not 
just what 

00:42:51.463 --> 00:42:54.308
the case readings, themselves, 
but even for me, reading 

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:56.309
articles and journals 

00:42:57.973 --> 00:43:00.016
about areas of law in those 
areas that I know less about, or

00:43:00.017 --> 00:43:02.017
am less comfortable with, is 
much more extensive on the 

00:43:04.358 --> 00:43:05.163
Supreme Court than it was on the
lower courts.  But... what are 

00:43:05.164 --> 00:43:07.164
we doing justice for?

00:43:11.143 --> 00:43:13.143
We're doing justice for the law 
as it should be.

00:43:14.444 --> 00:43:18.520
Because... we're not just 
looking at the case before us.  

00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:22.587
There are some who would argue 
that's what the Supreme Court 

00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:27.084
should be doing.  But... every 
time we announce a principle of 

00:43:29.754 --> 00:43:32.199
law, we are, or of 
interpretation of law, we are 

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.814
deciding not just that case... 
but the cases that come after 

00:43:32.815 --> 00:43:34.815
it.

00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:41.356
So... it's not uncommon in the 
Supreme Court 

00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:46.849
for a Supreme Court Justice to 
ask a 

00:43:48.746 --> 00:43:49.759
litigant if we follow your 
rules, isn't the natural outcome

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.760
this other extreme?

00:43:54.846 --> 00:44:01.010
   So... I'll give you an 
example that occurred on the 

00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:03.011
Court of Appeals, but it happens
regularly on the circuit court.

00:44:06.745 --> 00:44:08.745
I had a case involving the first

00:44:12.207 --> 00:44:14.207
amendment, where a judge had

00:44:15.781 --> 00:44:17.781
, issues a gag order, stopk the 
press 

00:44:19.255 --> 00:44:20.069
from reporting on information 
that had been disclosed in 

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.070
court.

00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:25.975
And the appeal came to us, by 
the litigant, by the newspaper, 

00:44:25.976 --> 00:44:28.428
who claimed that was an 
abridgement of the first 

00:44:28.834 --> 00:44:30.834
amendment.  Because...

00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:34.495
anything said publically in 
court...

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.010
was subject to public 
dissemination.  

00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:42.879
One of the questions that I 
asked was...

00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:47.399
what happens in the following 
scenario?

00:44:49.693 --> 00:44:51.566
There is a bomber on trial, a 
terrorist, and he takes the 

00:44:51.567 --> 00:44:53.567
stand.

00:44:55.662 --> 00:44:57.662
And in the middle of his 
testimony, he says...

00:45:04.065 --> 00:45:06.065
these infadels have to be 
destroyed.

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:09.137
Another bomb will go off in five
minutes.

00:45:10.606 --> 00:45:12.606
This is prove that God is not 
here to save you.

00:45:17.943 --> 00:45:19.989
The prosecutor jumps up and 
says, your Honor, please bar the

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:21.990
press from leaving 

00:45:23.649 --> 00:45:25.649
the room and disseminating this 
story.

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:28.134
We need to call the FBI to get 
them there in time to save 

00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:30.135
people and try to find that 
bomb.

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.534
What does the judge do?

00:45:40.603 --> 00:45:41.817
The lawyer says he denies the 
request that came out in open 

00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:47.312
court.  I looked at him and I 
say... and you're unwilling to 

00:45:47.313 --> 00:45:48.530
save all of those people when 
those five minutes could be 

00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:53.640
saved?  
   And his response was... 

00:45:53.641 --> 00:45:55.641
judge...

00:45:57.377 --> 00:45:59.377
I didn't tell you that in the 
order of 

00:46:02.116 --> 00:46:04.116
his courtroom he couldn't lock 
the door for five minutes.

00:46:11.092 --> 00:46:13.413
Not a perfect answer, but an 
answer.  That's what we do with 

00:46:13.414 --> 00:46:18.299
all of our cases.  We take the 
principles that we announce and 

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.300
try to figure out where they 
will lead us.

00:46:23.426 --> 00:46:25.426
Where they're going to lead the 
society and the lower courts.

00:46:29.385 --> 00:46:32.034
And if it's a place that doesn't
seem to fit within the 

00:46:32.035 --> 00:46:34.685
constitutional theory, as we 
understand it, then we have to 

00:46:38.353 --> 00:46:39.782
look at the premise and figure 
out if we need to change an 

00:46:39.783 --> 00:46:42.021
outcome.  
   And so...

00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:50.620
for us, it is justice for the 
law as it should be.  And those 

00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:54.354
are, very much, the stark 
differences between the three 

00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.621
courts.

00:46:57.773 --> 00:46:59.198
An answer to your unspoken 
question... 

00:46:59.199 --> 00:47:00.029
[laughter]
   SPEAKER: I didn't ask who 

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.030
your favorite colleague was.

00:47:03.034 --> 00:47:03.291
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: That, I won't 

00:47:03.292 --> 00:47:05.292
answer.

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:13.671
I have announced that if I ever,
if, underscore that word, 

00:47:13.672 --> 00:47:15.672
undertake senior status...

00:47:16.925 --> 00:47:18.149
that I would go back to being a 
district court judge.  It's a 

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.150
lot of fun.

00:47:21.165 --> 00:47:24.881
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: I'm going to 

00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:26.882
follow-up on 

00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:30.767
the fun part in that last 
sentence and ask...

00:47:34.108 --> 00:47:36.108
what do you do for fun with a 
busy, important day job.

00:47:38.191 --> 00:47:39.225
How do you relax and unwind 
after all this? 

00:47:39.226 --> 00:47:41.226
SPEAKER: First of all...

00:47:42.474 --> 00:47:47.378
I love exercise -- I do do some 
exercise, when I'm not injured. 

00:47:47.379 --> 00:47:49.379
Some injuries are 
self-reflected.

00:47:51.654 --> 00:47:53.654
Falling isn't a smart thing to 
do -- I love exercise.

00:47:58.588 --> 00:48:00.588
I do like reading fiction as 
opposed 

00:48:01.643 --> 00:48:04.113
to serious books when I can.  
That seems to be getting 

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:07.825
relegated to my summers than to 
the term year.  I've been doing 

00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:09.871
my book tour and got to read a 
lot of children's books lately. 

00:48:09.872 --> 00:48:11.872
   And...

00:48:13.553 --> 00:48:15.983
that's been a lot of fun.  
And... I also like playing 

00:48:15.984 --> 00:48:19.461
poker.  
[laughter] 

00:48:21.777 --> 00:48:23.777
SPEAKER: And I play poker with 
people I really like.

00:48:30.594 --> 00:48:33.431
SPEAKER: Before we open it up 
for Q&amp;A from the audience, do 

00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:36.893
you have in mind a next book? 
   SPEAKER: It's coming out in 

00:48:36.894 --> 00:48:38.894
September.

00:48:40.201 --> 00:48:42.201
It's a second children's book.  

00:48:44.685 --> 00:48:46.685
When the publisher was very 
interest 

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.610
did in doing the story of my 
life, 

00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:54.503
Turning Pages is that, for young
readers, but... I conditioned it

00:48:54.504 --> 00:48:56.504
on doing the children's book 
that I wanted to do forever.

00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:03.451
And it's a book about children 
who face life challenges.

00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:07.921
And it was born from an incident
that 

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:11.835
occurred to me, that happened to
me, not occurred -- happened to 

00:49:11.836 --> 00:49:13.836
me when I was younger.

00:49:16.354 --> 00:49:18.354
I was in a restaurant and I, at 
a time 

00:49:19.802 --> 00:49:21.802
when I was hiding my diabetes 
from the 

00:49:22.868 --> 00:49:25.111
world and went into a bathroom 
and was taking my shot.  Someone

00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:27.112
happened to walk in while hi was
doing it.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.097
I sort of finished what I was 
doing the left the room.  As I 

00:49:32.098 --> 00:49:34.098
was leaving the restaurant and 

00:49:35.365 --> 00:49:37.365
walking by the table of the 
woman who 

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.409
had come in, she was leaning 
over into 

00:49:43.568 --> 00:49:46.406
her companion as I walked by and
said "she's a drug addict" in a 

00:49:46.407 --> 00:49:48.407
stage whisper and I was 
outraged.

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.065
I walk back to her and said "I'm
a diabetic and that shot I took 

00:49:58.066 --> 00:50:00.066
is my 

00:50:01.318 --> 00:50:03.318
insulin and what I use to stay 
alive, 

00:50:04.985 --> 00:50:08.089
you should not be judgmental and
judging people.  If you don't 

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.562
know something, ask, don't 
assume" and I walked away.  

00:50:15.427 --> 00:50:17.427
And as I've been living my life 
and I 

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.482
have many, many friends with 
children 

00:50:22.143 --> 00:50:23.364
with chronic conditions, and 
some with conditions, 

00:50:23.365 --> 00:50:25.365
obviously...

00:50:27.379 --> 00:50:31.586
they can't help, like Tourette's
Syndrome.  In the store, 

00:50:31.587 --> 00:50:33.008
recently, someone looked at my 
friend and said... can't you 

00:50:33.009 --> 00:50:35.009
control your child?

00:50:41.558 --> 00:50:43.558
Because her child had twisted in
an 

00:50:45.632 --> 00:50:47.051
unusual way and banged into her 
by mistake and my friend was 

00:50:47.052 --> 00:50:49.052
just so hurt for her daughter.

00:50:52.352 --> 00:50:54.352
And that incident...

00:50:56.227 --> 00:50:58.227
and mine, made me realize that I
wanted 

00:51:00.325 --> 00:51:02.325
to write a children's book about
kids, 

00:51:04.651 --> 00:51:07.295
and there are so many of us, 
with conditions that challenge 

00:51:07.296 --> 00:51:09.296
their life and 

00:51:10.753 --> 00:51:13.000
I wanted to explain that the 
richness of those conditions, 

00:51:13.001 --> 00:51:15.001
richness in the sense 

00:51:16.048 --> 00:51:17.535
of the positive things that they
bring to our life as a 

00:51:17.536 --> 00:51:21.830
community.  
   And so... my next book is 

00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:23.831
Just Ask.  Hence where the title
came from, right?

00:51:29.177 --> 00:51:31.177
Be different, be brave, be you.

00:51:33.482 --> 00:51:35.094
That's the title of the book.  
It describes children with all 

00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:37.095
kinds of conditions.  Diabetes, 
obviously.  I start out with me.

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:42.231
But... children in wheelchairs, 
children who 

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.553
are blind, children who are 
deaf, children with Tourette's 

00:51:47.554 --> 00:51:53.281
Syndrome, children who have 
attention deficit, children with

00:51:53.282 --> 00:51:55.282
Down Syndrome, children of 

00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:58.329
all kinds with life challenges 
and I 

00:51:59.373 --> 00:52:02.022
describe the frustrations of 
those challenges, the 

00:52:02.023 --> 00:52:04.023
difficulties, but also, the 
things that they help us with.

00:52:09.002 --> 00:52:10.833
How they make us stronger and 
more-important contributing 

00:52:10.834 --> 00:52:12.834
members to our community.  

00:52:15.193 --> 00:52:18.052
It's set in a garden and I show 
how every garden has different 

00:52:18.053 --> 00:52:20.053
things in it, just like the 
world does.

00:52:24.889 --> 00:52:25.495
And we're a richer garden and a 
richer world, because of 

00:52:25.496 --> 00:52:27.781
children who are different.  And
so... that's my book.

00:52:43.312 --> 00:52:44.121
It comes out in September. 
   SPEAKER: We can't wait for 

00:52:44.122 --> 00:52:46.122
that book to come out.

00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:55.384
   SPEAKER: I told the doctor he
has to put it in his office. 

00:52:55.385 --> 00:52:58.030
   SPEAKER: We'll now have Q&amp;A 
from the audience. 

00:52:58.235 --> 00:53:02.368
SPEAKER: All right... I'm coming
down to say hello to everybody. 

00:53:02.369 --> 00:53:04.413
Are you going to be brave enough
to get up and tell me who asked 

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:06.414
the question? 
   SPEAKER: Yes...

00:53:09.495 --> 00:53:11.737
as Jeff Minear, our leader, 
pointed out, this is it a 

00:53:11.738 --> 00:53:13.774
gathering of the Supreme Court 
Fellows Commission.

00:53:17.072 --> 00:53:19.072
We're going to hear questions 
from 

00:53:20.524 --> 00:53:22.524
Supreme Court fellows, alumni.

00:53:24.194 --> 00:53:26.194
The first question is from Sara 
Wilson.

00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:30.160
SPEAKER: Sara, where are you?  
She knows me very well.  She 

00:53:30.161 --> 00:53:32.161
probably knows me better than I 
know myself.

00:53:35.048 --> 00:53:37.104
It's great to see you -- she was
an instrumental part of my being

00:53:37.105 --> 00:53:39.105
on the Supreme Court because she
was the person 

00:53:43.428 --> 00:53:44.878
who led me through my district 
court nomination.  So... I'm 

00:53:44.879 --> 00:53:47.877
internally grateful to her.
[applause] 

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.357
   SPEAKER: Thank you for those 
wonderful remarks.  What advice 

00:53:58.358 --> 00:54:01.219
would you give a new judge, 
either a new trial judge or a 

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.282
new intermediate appellate 
judge, given that you have 

00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:06.965
served on all levels of the 
federal judiciary?  

00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:10.396
SPEAKER: Ah...

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.576
that's a -- I'm going to walk up
-- I need somebody to guide me. 

00:54:15.577 --> 00:54:18.256
You come down --
   SPEAKER: I don't need that --

00:54:18.257 --> 00:54:20.257
   SPEAKER: Thank you, sir.
   SPEAKER: Um...

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.226
it's advice that you're 
obviously going to find 

00:54:27.227 --> 00:54:29.227
difficult to understand.

00:54:30.697 --> 00:54:31.304
To be a judge, you have to be 
decisive.  You have to come to a

00:54:31.305 --> 00:54:33.305
conclusion.

00:54:39.285 --> 00:54:40.931
Both because you can't angst 
forever about one case.  

00:54:40.932 --> 00:54:42.932
Otherwise... everybody who 
appears before you will suffer.

00:54:49.118 --> 00:54:51.118
That kind of delay will cause 

00:54:53.808 --> 00:54:55.808
justice, justice delays, justice
denied 

00:54:56.858 --> 00:54:57.672
[indiscernible], is very 
important to understand and 

00:54:57.673 --> 00:55:00.338
respect.  On the other hand... 
you have to be willing to admit 

00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:02.339
when you make mistakes.

00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:09.128
And many of us forget that when 
you become a judge.  

00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:16.910
There's a temptation to say 
"well, that's the way I ruled, I

00:55:16.911 --> 00:55:21.615
had to be right."  Or I can't 
look indecisive to others, so...

00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:25.039
I can't change my mind.  I think
that's an error.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.760
I think that you have to use 
judgment.

00:55:33.804 --> 00:55:36.047
You have to work efficiently at 
thinking about all the 

00:55:36.048 --> 00:55:38.048
possibilities and coming to a 
decision.  

00:55:38.083 --> 00:55:40.083
But...

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.018
every once in awhile, you should
pause and rethink something, to 

00:55:45.019 --> 00:55:47.019
ensure you got it right.

00:55:52.564 --> 00:55:54.564
One of the justices I 
most-admired, 

00:55:56.015 --> 00:55:58.090
John Paul Stevens, one of the 
speeches, last speeches that I 

00:55:58.091 --> 00:56:00.091
heard him give, 

00:56:02.184 --> 00:56:04.036
just after he left the bench was
at Fordham Law School in which 

00:56:04.037 --> 00:56:06.476
he described the three areas of 
law where his views had changed 

00:56:06.477 --> 00:56:08.477
over time.

00:56:13.399 --> 00:56:15.399
Where he had become educated by 
learning that he had been wrong.

00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:18.503
   And...

00:56:20.423 --> 00:56:22.423
I hope that I can follow his 
example.

00:56:24.331 --> 00:56:26.368
I have, in small ways, and so...
especially in trials, not all 

00:56:26.369 --> 00:56:28.607
the time, because you can't do 
it all the time, but...

00:56:31.874 --> 00:56:33.700
occasionally, I'd be in the 
middle of a trial and someone 

00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:35.765
would raise an objection, I'd 
say denied and I go home 

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.020
that night or go back to my 
office and 

00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:44.957
say to my law clerks "I'm 
uncomfortable with that 

00:56:44.958 --> 00:56:47.021
decision, please help me find 
some research on it" and I read 

00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:49.022
it and 

00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.583
go back the next morning and say
"I made 

00:57:00.727 --> 00:57:03.180
a mistake, let's start again, 
start over."  There've been 

00:57:03.181 --> 00:57:05.181
moments on the Court of 

00:57:06.643 --> 00:57:09.496
Appeals where I wrote an opinion
and after writing it, said "I'm 

00:57:09.497 --> 00:57:13.972
wrong" and wrote a second 
opinion and went the other way. 

00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:15.598
I've sent both to the panel.  
And I said... I wrote myself out

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.599
of this.

00:57:18.609 --> 00:57:19.527
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: In one case, the 

00:57:19.528 --> 00:57:21.528
panel went with me.

00:57:23.232 --> 00:57:25.232
In another case, they went the 
other way.

00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:28.989
And... ultimately, I was proven 
right, but that's beside the 

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:30.990
point.

00:57:31.992 --> 00:57:33.992
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: But...

00:57:37.565 --> 00:57:39.565
if I give any advice to a new 
judge... is...

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.040
keep an open mind.

00:57:45.514 --> 00:57:47.514
I think that ability to say "I 
can 

00:57:50.193 --> 00:57:53.060
make mistakes" let's you listen 
in a way that opens you up to 

00:57:53.061 --> 00:57:57.331
accepting that you're a human 
being and that your initial 

00:57:57.332 --> 00:57:59.332
thoughts on something don't have
to be your final thoughts.

00:58:01.797 --> 00:58:06.734
And so... for me, that's, that 
has been an important lesson.

00:58:06.735 --> 00:58:08.735
   SPEAKER: Our second question 
comes 

00:58:11.998 --> 00:58:13.998
from Derrick Webb.

00:58:15.688 --> 00:58:18.579
A 2014/15 Supreme Court Fellow. 
   SPEAKER: Hello, how are you? 

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:22.039
   SPEAKER: Good to see you.  
I've heard recently that you've 

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.040
been 

00:58:25.534 --> 00:58:28.380
working with your neighbor on 
the bench, Justice Gorsuch on 

00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:30.413
civic education programming. 
   SPEAKER: We have, we've had 

00:58:30.414 --> 00:58:32.414
so much fun.  But...

00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:36.113
I can't talk him into coming off
the stage.

00:58:36.114 --> 00:58:38.967
SPEAKER: All right... 
   SPEAKER: I keep telling him 

00:58:38.968 --> 00:58:42.076
over time he'll get used to it. 
   SPEAKER: You might prevail on

00:58:42.077 --> 00:58:46.547
that.  The question I had -- why
did the two of you decide to get

00:58:46.548 --> 00:58:48.548
into this program 

00:58:49.814 --> 00:58:51.648
on civic education, in a moment 
when citizens and lawyers are 

00:58:51.649 --> 00:58:55.119
having difficult times talking 
with each other across political

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.542
differences and legal 
differences, what connection do 

00:58:56.543 --> 00:59:01.455
you see between your program 
work on civic education and the 

00:59:01.456 --> 00:59:03.456
other virtue of sort of, 
civility? 

00:59:04.729 --> 00:59:06.729
SPEAKER: I think that the 
Supreme 

00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:10.022
Court is a prime example for the
nation.

00:59:13.766 --> 00:59:15.766
Of how you can agree, disagree 
agreeably.  And...

00:59:17.238 --> 00:59:19.238
that's a hard thing to do.

00:59:20.698 --> 00:59:22.118
To listen to people who are 
fundamentally different than you

00:59:22.119 --> 00:59:24.119
are.  And...

00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:28.232
to really go head-to-head with 
them on an issue and...

00:59:29.894 --> 00:59:31.894
if you've seen some of our 
writing, you 

00:59:33.389 --> 00:59:35.223
know that in writing, we go 
head-to-head.  We're not always 

00:59:35.224 --> 00:59:37.457
so civil in writing... we're 
trying to fix that up...

00:59:40.524 --> 00:59:43.170
but we're not always as civil as
I'd like... including me.  

00:59:43.171 --> 00:59:45.615
That's always because you're 
passionate.  It's very hard to 

00:59:45.616 --> 00:59:47.616
disagree with somebody and...

00:59:49.298 --> 00:59:51.748
they write something that you 
think is terribly wrong and you 

00:59:51.749 --> 00:59:55.814
not want to take them and shake 
them and say... why can't you 

00:59:55.815 --> 00:59:59.322
see this?  What's wrong with 
you?  

00:59:59.323 --> 01:00:00.746
[laughter]
   SPEAKER: That's the gut 

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:03.993
instinct.  The hard part is to 
fight that gut and say... 

01:00:03.994 --> 01:00:05.994
okay...

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.317
you disagree with me, I will try
to understand why.  I will 

01:00:09.318 --> 01:00:11.962
explain in my opinion why you're
wrong.  And... if you still 

01:00:11.963 --> 01:00:14.001
don't agree... I'm going to 
leave it to history to figure it

01:00:14.002 --> 01:00:20.572
out.  But... I don't have to 
dislike you because of it.

01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:28.301
I think that we forget that 
people who 

01:00:29.404 --> 01:00:31.037
differ from us, even though what
we sometimes think are 

01:00:31.038 --> 01:00:33.038
fundamental issues, and...

01:00:34.514 --> 01:00:37.800
you know, I had a friend who 
once said to me... "my son can't

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.836
marry a republican" 
[laughter] 

01:00:42.915 --> 01:00:44.943
SPEAKER: And I looked at her and
said... you can't really mean 

01:00:44.944 --> 01:00:48.844
that.  That's ridiculous.  And 
she said "no, no, there's a 

01:00:51.084 --> 01:00:53.084
fundamental difference in values
between the two parties.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.411
"  And I said "there's no 
fundamental difference in values

01:00:58.412 --> 01:01:00.412
between people.

01:01:01.673 --> 01:01:04.333
"  We all have some basic values
that cut across cultures, 

01:01:04.334 --> 01:01:06.334
gender, parties, religions, 
everything.

01:01:07.642 --> 01:01:09.642
We are all committed to family.

01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:17.641
We all believe in the importance
of family and being supportive, 

01:01:17.642 --> 01:01:19.642
in loving those people who are a
part of us.

01:01:25.177 --> 01:01:27.824
We all believe in friendship.  
And being supportive in those 

01:01:28.439 --> 01:01:30.439
friendships.  

01:01:33.134 --> 01:01:35.134
We all believe in our country, 
we all want us to succeed.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.738
Those are the fundamental values
that we have to look to.  

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.739
Now...

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:46.441
the expressions of it, we can 
fight about, we can talk about, 

01:01:46.442 --> 01:01:48.442
but you have 

01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:51.528
to look at the good in people.  
You cannot look at what you're 

01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:56.781
painting as bad, as defining 
them as human beings.  And so...

01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:01.421
if you start from there, it 
becomes 

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.490
easier to disagree agreeably.  
And...

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.079
Justice Gorsuch and I have found
ways to do that.  We have 

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.724
disagreed, all right, on a lot 
of things... but we agreed on a 

01:02:12.725 --> 01:02:14.759
couple things and one of the 
things we're most committed 

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:20.839
to is civic education, both of 
us and it 

01:02:24.551 --> 01:02:25.975
didn't matter to me that he 
wasn't say, voting with me more 

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.976
often.

01:02:29.887 --> 01:02:31.505
Hopefully over time I'll 
convince him.

01:02:31.506 --> 01:02:33.506
[laughter] 

01:02:35.408 --> 01:02:39.687
But in the interim, it's fun to 
work with him.  It is fun... I 

01:02:39.688 --> 01:02:41.327
mean, people are reporting that 
we're constantly laughing on the

01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:43.328
bench together.

01:02:45.242 --> 01:02:47.242
We can poke fun at each other 
and it is poking fun.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:54.191
It's not criticism, it's not 
anger.  It's just enjoyment.  Of

01:02:54.192 --> 01:02:56.192
each other as people.  He's a 
lovely person.

01:02:57.716 --> 01:02:59.716
   And...

01:03:02.172 --> 01:03:04.644
to the extent that both of us 
fundamentally love this country 

01:03:04.645 --> 01:03:08.737
and love children as much, we're
doing something that we both 

01:03:08.738 --> 01:03:13.431
think is important.  I hope most
of the world would figure out 

01:03:13.432 --> 01:03:15.432
how to find that common ground.

01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:18.939
And work in that common ground 
more often.  But...

01:03:22.848 --> 01:03:24.275
we tend to be going to the 
uncommon, rather than the common

01:03:24.276 --> 01:03:24.477
ground.
   SPEAKER: We have time for one

01:03:24.478 --> 01:03:26.478
last question.   SPEAKER: We 
have time for one last question.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.129
Debra? 

01:03:34.263 --> 01:03:36.263
2015/16 Supreme Court Fellow. 

01:03:37.523 --> 01:03:39.523
SPEAKER: Hello, Debra.

01:03:40.978 --> 01:03:42.978
I didn't pick these guys, okay? 
[laughter]

01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:45.461
SPEAKER: But I happen to know 
and like them all. 

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:47.315
SPEAKER: You spoke earlier about
what you hope children will take

01:03:47.316 --> 01:03:49.768
from the books that you've been 
writing over the past few years.

01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:53.441
I'm wondering what you've 
learned about yourself through 

01:03:53.442 --> 01:03:56.107
the process of writing these 
books?  

01:03:58.352 --> 01:04:01.813
SPEAKER: I've learned so much.  
But... about myself... well...

01:04:05.076 --> 01:04:07.076
I've learned a lot about -- you 
know, 

01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:12.174
if you -- I went to an event in 
Chicago 

01:04:14.258 --> 01:04:15.680
and there was a reporter who 
came up to me at the event and 

01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:17.681
said...

01:04:19.392 --> 01:04:20.847
"how many years of psychotherapy
have you been in?"  

01:04:20.848 --> 01:04:22.474
[laughter]
   SPEAKER: And I looked at her 

01:04:22.475 --> 01:04:24.475
and said 

01:04:25.536 --> 01:04:27.799
"what are you talking about?"  
She said "nobody could write 

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:33.295
this kind of book without having
gone through therapy."  And my 

01:04:33.296 --> 01:04:35.296
answer was "this book has been 
my therapy."  

01:04:35.328 --> 01:04:37.328
You know...

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.070
the reason I wrote the book was 
my 

01:04:43.307 --> 01:04:43.554
first year on the Supreme Court,
it was such a shocking, jarring 

01:04:43.555 --> 01:04:45.555
experience.

01:04:50.622 --> 01:04:52.622
I went from a modest stage in 
New York...

01:04:55.574 --> 01:04:57.574
it wasn't so modest a job, but 
it was 

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:00.830
abruptly a job from the Circuit 
Court of 

01:05:02.296 --> 01:05:04.296
Appeals and was on a limited 
stage there.  To a world stage.

01:05:11.725 --> 01:05:13.725
I was catapulted and yanked out 
of a 

01:05:16.859 --> 01:05:18.859
semi private life into this 
world stage.  And...

01:05:21.373 --> 01:05:23.373
everything was happening so 
fast.

01:05:26.454 --> 01:05:28.699
The hearings were 
[indiscernible], all of a 

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.700
sudden, I'm at the Supreme 
Court, 

01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:34.213
nominated at the end of May, I'm
at the Supreme Court in the 

01:05:34.214 --> 01:05:36.214
beginning of April.  (?

01:05:38.383 --> 01:05:40.636
) The first case on my desk is 
Citizens United, all right in 

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.885
one of the biggest cases, 
probably one of the 

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:47.156
most-important cases in modern 
times.  

01:05:47.157 --> 01:05:49.157
And...

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:56.157
I'm being fitted by presidents, 
vice presidents, senators, 

01:05:56.158 --> 01:05:59.635
representatives, people from 
around the globe, famous people,

01:05:59.636 --> 01:06:01.636
not so famous people... but...

01:06:04.562 --> 01:06:05.561
you know, I had dinner with 
Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:09.563
[laughter] 
   SPEAKER: How are you?  And...

01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:23.892
I became afraid... you know... I
gotta get around.  I became 

01:06:23.893 --> 01:06:25.893
afraid... yes...

01:06:27.381 --> 01:06:29.381
that in this process... I would 
lose me.

01:06:37.598 --> 01:06:39.685
You've heard the old adage 
"absolute power corrupts, 

01:06:39.686 --> 01:06:41.762
absolutely" and I realized that 
being in this kind of 

01:06:44.821 --> 01:06:47.487
position can both isolate you 
and... absorb you.  So... you 

01:06:47.488 --> 01:06:50.335
became self absorbed.  And...

01:06:53.564 --> 01:06:55.564
I needed a way to avoid that. 
   So... what did I do?

01:06:58.507 --> 01:07:00.507
I absorbed myself in myself, by 
taking 

01:07:01.562 --> 01:07:03.562
that first summer and escaping 
from being a justice.

01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:08.740
To looking at my life and trying
to figure out and remember how I

01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:10.741
got where I got.

01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:13.998
   And...

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:18.611
that's what My Beloved World is,
is that personal journey for me.

01:07:23.528 --> 01:07:26.173
Of remembering the people, the 
life situations, and the 

01:07:26.174 --> 01:07:30.677
circumstances that created who I
am.  And...

01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:39.071
it's that, that I want to keep a
part of me.  How much I valued 

01:07:39.072 --> 01:07:41.072
and value, all of 

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.200
those people who have made 
little pieces 

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:50.428
of me is so deeply ingrained in 
my psyche and so important to 

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:48.295
me.

01:07:50.574 --> 01:07:52.574
And I wanted to make them real 
for other people...

01:07:55.285 --> 01:07:57.539
but I also wanted you to find, 
within yourselves that which 

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
created you.  

01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:03.637
And to learn how to appreciate 
it even with all its warts.

01:08:08.588 --> 01:08:11.031
I never thought, and it's hard 
to explain, there are incidents 

01:08:11.032 --> 01:08:13.885
in my book that I describe, that
I never thought that I could 

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:15.886
forgive others for.

01:08:19.648 --> 01:08:21.648
And I think I speak with pride 
when I 

01:08:23.108 --> 01:08:24.745
say, the book helped me find 
those moments of forgiveness.  

01:08:24.746 --> 01:08:28.022
   And so... that was 
surprising.

01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:34.929
Because we all hold hurts and 
moments 

01:08:35.982 --> 01:08:36.186
of anger that are so deep within
us that we never think we can 

01:08:36.187 --> 01:08:38.187
let them go.

01:08:39.914 --> 01:08:41.914
And...

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.216
writing the book has helped me 
do that.  

01:08:44.217 --> 01:08:48.895
So... yes... that's what it's 
taught me.  Which is...

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:56.462
there is nothing we can't figure
out.  Especially if we figure 

01:08:56.463 --> 01:08:58.463
out what we've learned from it. 
And so...

01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:03.366
it's been a joy for me to write 
these books.  

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.532
Just Ask book will be slightly 
different venue for me, but even

01:09:08.533 --> 01:09:10.533
there 

01:09:12.008 --> 01:09:14.008
-- I'm sharing and letting go of
some of 

01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:19.026
the anger that I had about being
different.  Because... I think 

01:09:19.027 --> 01:09:21.027
every child who is different in 
some way...

01:09:23.334 --> 01:09:24.348
or perceives themselves to be, 
holds some hurts and anger about

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:26.349
it.  And so...

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:33.330
I've learned for myself, how to 
let some of that go and I hope 

01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:35.331
it will help them do the same.

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.842
[applause] 

01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:50.349
   SPEAKER: Thank you.  So much.

01:10:37.746 --> 01:10:39.746
SPEAKER: Justice Sotomayor, on 
behalf 

01:10:40.983 --> 01:10:42.983
of Eloise

Pasachoff, we know that you'll 
always 

01:10:53.051 --> 01:10:55.051
be brave, be bold, and be you.
