00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:04.520
Brian fearow professor biology

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.980
and curator of insects

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.329
we're going to Thompson island which is uh
just off the coast about four miles offshore

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.610
it's one of thirty four island in the boston harbor

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.939
four or five habitats we are going to cover on the island  today

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.399
lets just follow somebody

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.410
most of the insects we catch other then monarch butterfly and the big darner 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.230
dragonflies everything else is doomed
all the other adult insects will be gone by first frost

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.009
they should be sweeping

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.220
 we will be collecting insects 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.400
 a few weeks ahead of time 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.590
in to 100% ethanol

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.400
not a bad way to go

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.380
and we got our running pool on how many spices we will might get

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.380
a pretty good guess is a couple of hundred species

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.760
the great thing about dragonflies usually
patrol in areas on the same line

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940
so you can anticipate where there gonna be

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.930
and uh

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.970
just wait for them

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380
some beetles will stay in alcohol for six hours and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.700
they basically close up everything 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.869
close up the parts and hold their breath

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.700
i might

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.780
walk back up to the meddle that we started

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.730
just spend the rest of the time getting dragon flies

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.440
but they're pretty predictable they
 will run a track line basically

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.080
they do have really good vision though

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.960
thats a green gardener

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.650
thats a nice incect

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.190
they been getting quite a lot of stuff good day, beautiful
