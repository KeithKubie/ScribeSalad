have more time to set up and so I tend

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320
have more time to set up and so I tend
 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.820
have more time to set up and so I tend
to prefer shooting larger formats and so

the value of reporting what they were

the value of reporting what they were

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760
capturing but it's not easy I mean I was
 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.840
capturing but it's not easy I mean I was
in the Arctic and I was gun ho but

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
Quitman froze my hands were very cold

Quitman froze my hands were very cold
the conditions were particularly

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360
the conditions were particularly
 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.810
the conditions were particularly
challenging and as a result I just came

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820
challenging and as a result I just came
 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.390
challenging and as a result I just came
to realize that that extreme

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400
to realize that that extreme
 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.310
to realize that that extreme
environments just do not lend themselves

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
environments just do not lend themselves
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.900
environments just do not lend themselves
well to to that type of

Matt and so when I traveled to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
Matt and so when I traveled to
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.370
Matt and so when I traveled to
Antarctica I understood that the digital

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
Antarctica I understood that the digital
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.130
Antarctica I understood that the digital
medium was was particularly well-suited

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
medium was was particularly well-suited
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.310
medium was was particularly well-suited
to those challenging environments so in

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320
to those challenging environments so in
 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.770
to those challenging environments so in
Antartica I shot large format and medium

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780
Antartica I shot large format and medium
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.730
Antartica I shot large format and medium
format but primarily my my mode of of

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740
format but primarily my my mode of of
 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.250
format but primarily my my mode of of
capture was 35 millimeter digital which

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260
capture was 35 millimeter digital which
 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.370
capture was 35 millimeter digital which
incidentally with the new cameras is

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380
incidentally with the new cameras is
 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.280
incidentally with the new cameras is
quite extraordinary and yields amazing

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290
quite extraordinary and yields amazing
 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.920
quite extraordinary and yields amazing
results so I did ninety percent of the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930
results so I did ninety percent of the
 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.490
results so I did ninety percent of the
work in Antarctica with with 35

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
