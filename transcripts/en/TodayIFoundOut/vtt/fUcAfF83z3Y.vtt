00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:23.289
The 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.640
term crowdfunding, a process by which a person
raises money by asking others for small donations,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.410
has become popular online during the past
few years.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.910
Websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo offer
individuals a platform from which to make

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450
their cases to an international community.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.450
Mike Hayes of Illinois used crowdfunding to
pay for all four years of his college education

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.000
at the University of Illinois.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
He asked strangers to send him a penny and
received donations from all fifty states in

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.140
the United States and across the world.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.900
But he did it long before the World Wide Web
(See: Who Invented the Web) or crowdfunding

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.040
websites; he did it in 1987.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.600
Eighteen year old Mike Hayes graduated from
high school in 1987 and enrolled in a science

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.670
program at the University of Illinois.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.580
He had earned $2,500 from a job working at
a drugstore, but that money would not go far

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.690
to pay the four years of tuition and fees
that added up to around $28,000 (about $57,000

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.690
today).

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.300
His middle class family already put his four
older siblings through college.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.310
While Hayes’s parents, his father a pharmacist
and his mother a school teacher, would have

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.820
helped him to pay, Hayes decided he did not
want his parents going into debt for him.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.900
Thus, he came up with the idea to convince
2.8 million people to each donate a penny

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.900
to him.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.090
Towards this end, he approached famed Chicago
Tribune columnist Bob Greene for help.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.330
Greene began his career as a journalist before
becoming a nationally syndicated columnist

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.190
with his column appearing in over 200 newspapers
across the nation.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.000
He had worked for the Tribune for almost ten
years when he received Hayes’s request.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.540
Greene liked the idea and shared Hayes’s
request with his readers on September 6, 1987.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.210
He told them who Mike was and why he wanted
Greene’s readers to send him pennies.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.100
“‘Just one penny,’ Hayes said.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.510
‘A penny doesn’t mean anything to anyone.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.720
If everyone who is reading your column looks
around the room right now, there will be a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.459
penny under the couch cushion, or on the corner
of the desk, or on the floor.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.510
That’s all I’m asking.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.659
A penny from each of your readers.’”

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.590
Greene admitted that he and Hayes knew the
biggest obstacle they faced was getting people

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.639
to actually send in the pennies.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.010
So he encouraged his readers to put down the
column they were reading and send a penny

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.680
to Mike right then and there.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.939
He drove the point home by making sure to
include Mike’s PO Box address, twice.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.530
Hayes’ plan worked.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.370
Less than a month after Greene’s column
was published, he had already received approximately

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.900
$23,000.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.980
All of that money came in more than 70,000
pieces of mail and in the form of pennies,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.870
nickels, dimes, and quarters (many of which
had to be hand washed to get the glue or other

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.680
sticky residue used to attach them to the
envelope off before they could be put in the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.129
bank’s automatic coin counter, which actually
broke three times processing all the coins

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.279
he was receiving).

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.989
Mike also received much easier to process
checks and paper bills.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.269
Three people mailed checks for $100.

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.939
The post office received so much mail one
day that rather than count it, they simply

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.559
quantified it in feet, and the postmaster
reported to Bob Greene that at its peak there

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.150
was 26 feet of mail in one day.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.209
The money kept pouring into the PO Box, and
Hayes ended up with more than the equivalent

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.989
of 2.8 million pennies he needed to pay for
college.

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.879
He graduated in 1991 with a degree in food
science and student loan free.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.109
When he spoke to Bob Greene for a follow up
on their original column, he said there was

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.749
a thousand dollars left over after all his
college expenses were paid.

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:35.209
Hayes decided to give the remaining money
to a college student from one of the families

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.209
that sent him money.

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.409
He and his family had kept a large portion
of the letters, totaling about 90,000 in the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.220
end, and he decided he’d award the money
via randomly selecting one letter from the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.730
pile and then contacting the person to see
if they or their children had need of $1,000

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.769
for college.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.579
If they did not, he would draw another letter
until he found a family that he could help.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.799
In the end, Mike had this to say about the
whole thing, “I just want to express my

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.269
thanks to everyone… right now I’m feeling
that the world is a pretty great place.”

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.430
Besides money, Mike also got quite a few college
girls sending him letters with pictures and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.839
their phone numbers, including some from the
University he was attending.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.819
He even got a letter from Miss America 1983,
Debra Maffett, saying how much she admired

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.819
him.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.209
In the end, he claimed he rebuffed all advances
as he already had a girlfriend back home who

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:34.340
was a junior in high school 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:06:01.929
at the time.
