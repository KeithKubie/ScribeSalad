- [Voiceover] "Dina
purchased 200 feet of fencing

00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:05.829
"to make a rectangular
play area for her dogs.

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.974
"The possible area, A, is
given by the equation below

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.853
"where W is the width of the play area."

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:14.757
So they do the work for
us, where they tell us

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:18.050
what area as a function
of W is going to be.

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:21.538
"Which of the following
equivalent expressions

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.729
"displays, as a constant or coefficient,

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:26.749
"the value of the width for which

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.093
"the area is a maximum?"

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.368
So that's an interesting
way that they phrased it,

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:33.877
but they're saying that
these are all equivalent

00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:36.189
expressions to this thing up here,

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.638
and you could verify that
they're equivalent expressions.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.273
We could take, for
example, this first one,

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:42.515
right over here.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.454
This would be the same thing as negative,

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:47.449
let's see, W minus 50
squared is W squared,

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.211
minus two times 50

00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.367
times W so minus 100 W

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.683
plus 2,500.

00:00:56.683 --> 00:00:59.516
And then you have plus 2,500 out here.

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:00.515
Now this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.581
negative W squared,

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.473
plus, I'm just distributing
the negative sign,

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:08.734
plus 100 W minus 2,500,

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.824
plus 2,500,

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:13.308
which these two things
cancel each other out

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:17.407
and you're left with this
expression right over here.

00:01:17.407 --> 00:01:19.247
Negative W squared, negative W squared

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:20.687
plus a hundred W.

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:22.010
And this would be true for all of these.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.263
So these are all just
algebraic manipulations

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:26.282
of this original thing.

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.141
Now, what they're asking us,

00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:29.800
or one way to think about it is,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.367
which of these show the maximum value?

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.920
Which of these forms of the expression

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.602
make it easy for us to find

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:39.495
what the maximum value's going to be?

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.539
Well let's look at this first one.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.616
This first one, let's
think about how this,

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.052
this expression works.

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:50.490
If this part right over
here, W minus 50 squared,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.371
that's always going to be non-negative.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:53.644
'Cause if you take the
square of something,

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:55.363
it's going to be non-negative,

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:57.556
but then if you then
take the negative of it,

00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:59.309
it's going to be non-positive.

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:01.434
It's going to be non-positive.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:02.985
So this part over here is going to be

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.771
less than or equal to zero,

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.896
and then you have plus 2,500.

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:10.194
So if you wanted to
maximize this expression,

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:12.307
which is the same thing as
maximizing this expression,

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:13.944
because they're equivalent,

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:16.672
you want this thing, you want
to not subtract anything.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:19.691
So you want this part to be equal to zero.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.792
So how can this part be equal to zero?

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.455
Well the thing that you're
squaring is equal to zero,

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:26.080
and in order for the thing you're squaring

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.877
to be equal to zero, W minus 50

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.224
needs to be equal to zero.

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:34.520
Or W needs to be equal to 50.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.447
So just looking at this expression,

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.339
we're able to figure out,
'cause all of these expressions

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.029
are equivalent, and they're equivalent

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.398
to this expression right over here.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:44.256
Just looking at this expression,

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.045
we're able to figure out, look,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.653
this expression takes on a maximum value

00:02:47.653 --> 00:02:50.033
when W is equal to 50.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.308
And to their question,
"Which of the following

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:53.597
"equivalent expressions displays,

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:54.990
"as a constant or coefficient,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.649
"the value of the width for which the area

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:57.648
"is a maximum?"

00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:58.666
We know that the value of the width

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.148
for which the area is a maximum is 50,

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.726
and this one, I guess displays it.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:06.351
I've never seen a question
phrased exactly like that,

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:08.034
but it does display the number,

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:09.845
and this is why this form is so valuable.

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:11.405
You want to say, "Look, this is going,

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:13.565
"the area's gonna have
a maximum value when

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:16.176
"this part right over here
is not taking anything away

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:17.186
"from the 2,500."

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:21.330
In fact, 2,500 is going
to be that maximum area.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.469
And when do we reach it?

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.353
When this thing is zero,
this thing is zero,

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.569
when W minus 50 is equal to zero,

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.029
or when W is equal to 50.

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.048
So I would definitely pick this one here.

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:34.836
These other forms of these expressions,

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.914
and you can algebraically expand these.

00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:39.526
It'll come out to be the
same thing as over here.

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:40.594
These don't help you so much.

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:42.927
You can't make that same type of,

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:45.359
that same type of intuition about

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.076
where the maximum value is.

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:48.701
And this form of a quadratic,

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:49.955
this is called Vertex Form.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.829
It makes it very easy to find the vertex,

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:52.885
which is going to be the minimum

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.846
or the maximum value of

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:59.200
an expression, or of a
function, I should say.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.836
Now there's other ways
to come up with the 50.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:04.552
You could say, "Look, this
thing right over here,

00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:06.316
"you have a, it's a quadratic."

00:04:06.316 --> 00:04:10.391
It's got a negative coefficient
on the quadratic term,

00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.819
Or on the second-degree term,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.287
so it's going to be a
downward-opening parabola,

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.750
so it might look something like this,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.069
where if this the A axis,

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.070
the area axis,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.108
and this right over
here is the width axis,

00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:25.697
that's the width axis,

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.210
you would know that this is
gonna be downward-opening,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.981
because it has this
negative right over here.

00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:33.124
It's gonna be a downward-opening parabola,

00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:34.877
so it's gonna look like this.

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.141
And so we just need to find the vertex,

00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:39.079
or we need to find the W,

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.538
the W coordinate of the vertex, there.

00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:44.059
And there's a couple of
ways that you can find

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:45.882
the W coordinate of the vertex.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.775
One, you could say that that coordiate

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:51.327
is going to be halfway
in between the W values

00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:54.601
that make our function equal to zero,

00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:56.040
and so we could say, "Well
what makes this thing

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.399
equal to zero?"

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:01.043
You could say, "100 W minus W squared

00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:01.984
"is equal to zero."

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.459
You could factor out a W.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:07.882
So W times 100 minus W is equal to zero.

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:09.205
Well this is going to be equal to zero

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:11.817
when either W is equal to zero,

00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:14.801
or 100 minus W is equal to zero.

00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.982
So or, W is equal to,

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:19.560
W is equal to a hundred.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440
If W is equal to a hundred,
this part over here

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.799
is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:24.517
The whole area is going
to be equal to zero.

00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:27.002
So this right over here is 100,

00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.173
this one over here is zero.

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.124
The maximum point then, the vertex,

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:33.928
is going to be the W that's
halfway in between these two,

00:05:33.928 --> 00:05:36.690
which is going to be 50.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.351
So that's another way to think about it.

00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:40.685
You could also use the
formula for the X-coordinate

00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:43.390
of a vertex and negative B over two A.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.046
If you had an expression in the form of

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.436
A, W squared plus B,

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:54.395
W plus C, then,

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.323
and then we could say A,

00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:59.354
A is equal to, this is a lower-case here,

00:05:59.354 --> 00:06:02.039
then the vertex is going to be the

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.766
W-coordinate, I should say, of the vertex

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:08.086
is gonna be negative B over two A.

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:10.815
And in this case, in this case,

00:06:10.815 --> 00:06:15.528
B is 100, is the coefficient
on the first degree term,

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:16.979
so it's going to, if B is a hundred,

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.801
negative B is negative a hundred,

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.797
and A is this negative one

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:23.446
that's in front of the W squared.

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.859
It's the coefficient on
the second degree term.

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:27.079
This, they wrote it the other way around,

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.217
where they have the first degree term,

00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:29.320
and then the second degree,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.700
here you have the second degree,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.954
then the first degree.

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:33.220
But A is negative one,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.955
two times A is negative two,

00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:38.457
and then negative divided
by a negative is a positive.

00:06:38.457 --> 00:06:41.200
Hundred divided by two is 50.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.859
So any way you look at it,

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:45.171
W equals 50 is when it
hits the maximum value,

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.200
and if you looked at these expressions,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.161
which of these involve 50

00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:50.264
as a constant or coefficient?

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.563
Well, I see a 50 right there.

00:06:51.563 --> 00:06:53.373
It's a little bit of a
strange way of asking it,

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:54.813
but there is a 50 there.

00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:56.380
It's being subtracted,
but it does show up.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.264
None of these other ones have a 50

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:00.254
anywhere to be seen.
