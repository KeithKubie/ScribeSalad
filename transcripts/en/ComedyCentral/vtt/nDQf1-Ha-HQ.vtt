00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.230
- So the bartender says, I
don't know about you guys

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.072
but I ain't puttin' on one of those hats.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.340
He was wearin' one of those hats.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400
Get it?
- No, no, I don't think we do.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.410
- Aw, come on, you guys are from Texas.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.320
- Well, Tennessee actually.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.730
- Texas, Tennessee, I
got a cousin in Iowa,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.610
it's all the same.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.110
You guys really didn't like that joke?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.670
- No, it was confusing.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.530
We've known quite a few
Jews, none of 'em have wings.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.410
- And even if they did have
wings, that'd be pretty rad

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.010
just flyin' around eatin' matzah balls

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.390
while still also hating
yourself, I get that.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.890
- Yeah, that sounds like a
sweet [beep] Friday to me.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.040
- Look, we get it, alright, the accents,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.970
the Fox News level of anger
that we emit, the cheap beer.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.090
- Hops give me gas.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.440
- But you think it's because we think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.420
that fancy beer makes you gay.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.160
- You gotta drink liquor
if you wanna lick her.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.380
- That's gross.
- Come on.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.260
- The point is, just like how
not everyone with your accent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.350
wants to beat his wife
with a pepperoni stick.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.308
- Oh yeah, shout out to
your cousin Tony and all.

00:00:55.308 --> 00:00:57.509
- Oh, great guy, gets out in a year.

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:00.150
- Not everyone with
our accent is ignorant.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.170
- Yeah, or wants to get rid of the blacks.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.573
- Likes rubbin' buttered
corn on their belly.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.720
- Can we get the bill?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.110
- Aw, come on, guys, I didn't
even get to tell you the one

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.440
about how Puerto Ricans can't tap dance.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.620
- It's not just that it's
offensive, you're not funny.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.520
Like even in the world of,
I got a racist joke for ya,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.050
yours are just bad.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.140
- You're like a little
league racist and you suck.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.640
- My uncle's in the Klan
but at least he gets timing.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.710
- Your premises are weird.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.670
- Nobody's buying your
logic, man, not even you.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.450
- The thing about the Asians felt forced.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.430
- Yeah, maybe skip that one

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.620
at the rally next weekend, Jon Vito.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.940
- Look buddy, you should probably
just stick to the classics

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.740
before you go branching out.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.750
For example, the way they
smell, that's always a big hit.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.290
- Or, women aren't safe around 'em.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.360
- How they're allergic to possums.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.460
- The point is, we really don't appreciate

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.000
you assuming that--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.950
- That just because we have these accents

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.096
means we hate minorities.

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:51.346
(groaning)

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.316
- Oh, [beep].

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.216
It happened again.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.840
- Fancy beer makes you gay.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.150
- Get rid of the blacks.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.320
- The thing about Asians.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.350
- The way they smell.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.880
- Women aren't safe around 'em.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.163
- We don't like minorities.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.010
- They only heard the bad parts.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.630
- Yeah, we know, we're going.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.500
And here's all my money, hope
Confederate bills are okay.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.570
- Let's go, Corey.
- We're not all bad people

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.723
and we know that Jews don't have wings.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.603
- You stay golden, ponytail.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.970
- I can't believe you had to sit beside.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.600
those racist monsters.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.860
- Yeah, it was horrible.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.200
I was trying to tell them about the blacks

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.573
and how their lives matter.

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:37.025
- Honkeys.
