1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,920
Okay.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,460
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday march

4
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:10,060
Seventh 2016 what's going on?

5
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:14,800
How are you? How was your weekend
deal? Listen to the weekend.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,010
I can feel my face and I
with you [voice change].

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,680
Okay.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,170
Oh, what are you doing man?

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,060
You fucking some chick on blow. You
didn't do blow when you were with her now.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,210
Now you're with there.
Now you're doing blow.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,030
Okay.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,730
The boy, I can't believe that
shit came back. You know,

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,400
I thought coke was just done. You know,

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,250
after all the people did what
they did from my generation,

15
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,420
you would think that the next generations
would be like, you know what? Yeah,

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,850
I'm going to stay away from that shit.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,133
Right.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,580
It's not our works. One generation
does it. Like my generation,

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,120
we were like, wow man, let's
stay away from hey man,

20
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:01,810
like let's stay away from LSD and
heroin. Cause that's like a bad trip man.

21
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,550
And then we fucked with like coke and
crack crank, all of that shit, right.

22
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,140
That ruined all of our fucking lives.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,880
And then the next generation was just
like, yeah, man, fuck all that stuff.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,620
Let's fuck with crystal meth. Right?
So now this next wave was like,

25
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,830
fuck crystal meth. You know,
let's kick it old school.

26
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,090
Let's go back to the coke.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,193
Right?

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,830
You have an entire generation of people
that not only can't feel it faces,

29
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,360
but yeah, evidently they like it.

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,160
Oh

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,080
yeah. Where do you go from there?
Sorry, I'm trying to update my, uh,

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,130
my musical tastes.

33
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:44,131
I've decided that after fucking 40 years
of listening to the same fucking 10

34
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,830
bands, you know, not 40, like 30

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,240
mean Jesus Christ. How many
fucking times can you listen to it?

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,650
I always liked those. You have those
people while walking in the circle,

37
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,710
the circle in the jail
at midnight express.

38
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,160
I remember that when they were walking
counterclockwise and then the dude is

39
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,930
going to escape. But you had the drugs,

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,470
you know whose girlfriend put
a tidies up against the glass?

41
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:12,070
He started walking around the
other way. Remember that? Yeah.

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,260
That's what I'm doing right now. I'm
walking around the other way and every,

43
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:18,180
my generation is just going, what are
you listening to this shit for sake,

44
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,090
I don't know how many
times galas a day. Hey,

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,030
I've been listening to that for
fucking 30 years. I got to get,

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,510
I've got to pull my cell phone.

47
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,043
Um,

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,010
I dunno. I, I just, yeah, I would like
to listen to something new. So, uh,

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
the lovely Nia was watching the,

50
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,300
all the performances from
the Grammy's last night.

51
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,970
So I just started downloading
everything that I was seeing,

52
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,850
whether I liked it or not. I'm like,
I'm just going to listen to this shit.

53
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,930
You know? It's Kinda like when I tried
to put a new hour of standup together,

54
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,810
I'm just like, ah, you know, if this
doesn't, this isn't a good idea,

55
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,350
but I'm going to say it anyways cause
I can't say the other shit cause that's

56
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,080
coming out. So I just start
throwing shit against the wall.

57
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,910
So this morning I was listening to, um,

58
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,560
I listened to a little
bit of the weekend. Dude.

59
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,450
Sounds just like Michael Jackson,
right? I think he does. And, uh,

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,010
who else did I download?
That girl looks like m uh,

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,570
MC search, right? The fuck's her name.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,650
I don't know if she was singing about a
relationship and she was over it and she

63
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,800
just looked like she had
this high top fade, you know,

64
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,250
but also knew how to like
make a fucking rocket.

65
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,570
She looked really smart, you know, yet
like you wouldn't want to fuck with the,

66
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:47,290
I dunno, she kind of had it all
going on. It's like, is this a nerd?

67
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,820
Is this a bully?

68
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,460
Is this a rapper or is she a witch? Um,

69
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,460
but the band is fucking great.
So she, I don't, you know,

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,040
after all of that shit, I'm probably
not going to say who the fuck it is,

71
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:04,330
even if I figured it out. Cause I don't
want to shit on people like that. Um,

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,910
anyways, had a killer SG though,
the fucking three pickups, you know,

73
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,110
surfing green, they went
out, they crushed it. Right.

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,060
I actually saw what's his
face? They're the fucking, uh,

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,120
the dude who's getting
the worst tattoos ever.

76
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,060
He's got the Lamborghini and fucking, uh,

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,160
didn't like LNL Keyshawn Johnson
chased him up his front door.

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,030
The fuck is his name? Justin Bieber. I
actually watched that. That guy can sing.

79
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:34,690
He's fucking talented. I just
don't, he should just, just do that.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,400
Just do that. Stop filming yourself
playing basketball and whatever else.

81
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,850
It still would mean McGinn
you fucking a GoPro.

82
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,690
Just sing your song and fucking go
home. Why? Well, why won't you do that?

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,400
It's actually a talented kid.

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,120
Although I didn't like when he threw
the acoustic guitar down in the Gund,

85
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,580
you know what? He fucking Pete
Townsend, you're not okay.

86
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,290
You got the inner ear fucking monitors.
The protecting your hearing. Okay.

87
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,440
You're not, you're not,

88
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,770
nobody's blown up a drum set and part
of the fucking drum said goes right into

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,220
your fucking ear. Okay. Nobody's getting
crushed at your fucking concerts.

90
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:13,630
They've worked all of that
out. You know? Sorry. See,

91
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:17,230
and then I go right back to the grumpy
old man. I've seen all this before.

92
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm just, I'm trying to get the kid
at copy's fucking really talented.

93
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:24,340
He can actually really
sick. Um, so anyways,

94
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,880
and then I was looking to yell at dude
there. What the fuck's his name? I, I,

95
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,031
for the life of me,

96
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,810
I don't understand why I can't just
download shit and then just find it.

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,300
And every fucking time it
goes back to the album thing.

98
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,430
I like when they just list the songs.

99
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,970
I don't need to see the
picture of the album.

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,993
Yeah.

101
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,500
Every time this happens I forget how
to do it. Oh, okay. Artists songs.

102
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,200
There we go. Um, oh, and
speaking of which on,

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,480
um, everybody was, uh,

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,940
sending a bunch of each week when I do
the Thursday, uh, Thursday afternoon,

105
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,700
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. You know,

106
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,070
when we go into the greatest
hits of the Monday morning,

107
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,640
podcast is always a little musical
interlude. I do not pick that music.

108
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,850
That's Andrew thumbless and then he posts
on the Twitter site what the name of

109
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,970
the music is. So last week
it was snarky puppy. Okay.

110
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,920
That's who the fuck it was the posted
every week. Just fucking look it up.

111
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,940
All right. At the MM podcast or
some shit. I forget what the,

112
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:35,180
I don't know what the Twitter account
is. What am I gonna Follow Myself?

113
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,980
Um, anyways, plowing
ahead. So Friday night,

114
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,320
oh, freckles, I took a night
off from stand up. Alright.

115
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,160
Friday night's a big
night to take a night off.

116
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,610
That's like not showing up thanksgiving,
you know, if you'd like to eat,

117
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,710
you know. So I went down to
the Wiltern theater and uh,

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,660
with Andrew and I saw mute
math and they will fucking,

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,430
unbelievable cannot.
I tweeted, I couldn't,

120
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:06,230
I cannot overstate how great
a fucking show that was.

121
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,450
And I wish I remembered the
name of the opening band too.

122
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,350
They were all so great,

123
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:13,940
but what just killed me was I'd
never been to a show like that.

124
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,650
Like whatever that style of music is,

125
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,330
I don't even know what
the style of music is,

126
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,740
but I'm just going from, you know,

127
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,270
the Shit I've been listening
to for 30 years straight.

128
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,233
I,

129
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,320
you're walking in Bajas
Bhavin in cars, right?

130
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,460
I listen to say I listened to the same
90 songs for 30 fucking years in a row.

131
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,600
Um, never to do, be that guy. So just
go into those, seeing those bands,

132
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,190
just how they use guitar,

133
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:51,780
where it's more used for like mood
wear. But when I was growing up,

134
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:55,350
like the guitar was like the Dick
that got thrown on the table, right.

135
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,060
Just slapped you right
in the face with it.

136
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,880
There was always the lead singer
and then you had the guitar, God.

137
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,320
And then the fucking dude playing rhythm
guitar who was not appreciated until at

138
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,440
least 25 years into that
bands career. You know,

139
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,160
like Malcolm young really
didn't get his props until,

140
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,230
till like the mid nineties. I feel Brad
Woodford, same fucking thing. You know,

141
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,130
Ronnie Wood,

142
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,930
all of these guys just play in rhythm
guitar holding the whole fucking thing

143
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:25,470
together. Right? And they don't get
shit for the longest fucking time. Um,

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,930
the Jesus Christ mute math live man,
they fucking unreal. So by the way,

145
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,810
they're playing Portland,
Oregon tonight. That's Monday,

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,390
depending on when you listen to
this Tuesday, they're in Seattle,

147
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,240
then they're off for a week and then
they start back up again in Richmond.

148
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,500
If a you get a chance to see them, um,

149
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,560
you will not be disappointed. And
if you're an old fuck like me,

150
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:49,760
they are a great band to go see, to
try to bring you into the modern era.

151
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,330
You know, if you listen to this, c'mon,

152
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,500
you can't tell me somebody a
little bit younger than me.

153
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,860
You haven't been listening to
that fucking Pearl Jam record 10.

154
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,480
You know whether I'll give each other
the high five, the big Bro Picture.

155
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,480
We're all in this together, man.

156
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,220
Right? Um, if you can't tell me
that you haven't listened to it,

157
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,230
how many times do you
go to Gerald Rotary Spa?

158
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,450
Good. Yay. You be cool.

159
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:19,870
Ooh,

160
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,490
fucking 25 years later. I'm not
saying don't ever listen to it again,

161
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,060
right? Look, you could do
whatever the fuck you want,

162
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:32,000
but I never wanted to be that guy
going out is JJ music. All right?

163
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,510
Then going into my house, Bob
Ida Book Book [inaudible] right?

164
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,160
Going in there and doing
the fucking jitterbug

165
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,270
that makes said that Jeff Beck is playing
the Hollywood ball and I have to see

166
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,620
that guy. He's like 70.

167
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,460
He's buddy guy is opening up and there's
no fucking way I'm going to miss that.

168
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,260
Um, you know, guys, one of
the greatest, he is the guy,

169
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,100
you know, I think from that whole
fucking era other than Jimmy Hendricks,

170
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,850
I thought, yeah, I think you gotta
give it to Jeff Beck, right, Matt,

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,620
in my mind, I'm sure there's some black
guy out there that I'm forgetting.

172
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,430
You know,

173
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,410
who got stolen from bunches as far as
white dudes who listened to black dudes

174
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,300
and then reshaped it. Right. I think
you've got to give it to that guy.

175
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,680
No. Well, you know, it's
just my opinion, you know,

176
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,140
gotta get fucking upset by it. So anyways,

177
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:27,490
what I'm obsessed with right now as
far as like the drummer, Darren k,

178
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:31,300
the guy's fucking insane.
And it was funny because, um,

179
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,940
you know, Andrew got to know those guys,

180
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:38,620
so I got to go backstage and meet
him briefly. And uh, you know,

181
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,000
after the show they were going, hey,

182
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:43,660
did you learn anything watching our
drummer? And I was just like, no.

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,030
And I heard the drum, Darren
goes, ah, like I didn't mean it.

184
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,070
I hope I didn't come off and,
and Celtic way, it's like, dude,

185
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:55,060
I can't get too fucking far beyond
anything that I'm doing watching him.

186
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,640
It was like watching like Keith,

187
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,210
it was like Keith Moon playing drum and
base and then they have this sick ass

188
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:05,830
fucking light show going on. And I was
just sitting there, squinting watching,

189
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,440
just going like, what, what is he doing?

190
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,610
I had no fucking clue. Um,

191
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,120
I did take one video while that
while they were playing, cause I,

192
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,590
I I is coolest, you know,

193
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:23,290
the iPhone is and how great
the video is and everything.

194
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,090
I just fucking hate like
being at something and then
just sitting there filming

195
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,910
it, like I'm working for CBS
nightly news or some shit.

196
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,550
It's like I want to stand here
and I want to take this in.

197
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,870
There's enough other cons
here like filming this shit.

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,010
I can watch this, it will be on the
Internet forever. Right. So anyways,

199
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,230
this sunk clipping that they play. And um,

200
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,910
I had no idea what he was doing. And,

201
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,430
and Andrew's going
watch what he does here.

202
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:56,431
And then he literally has like two
sticks and a two drum sticks in his right

203
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,090
hand and he's playing, this is
going to be some drum geek shit.

204
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,190
So you might want to pass through this.
He's put bay as far as I can tell,

205
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:06,790
he's basically playing 60th, no
triplets, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

206
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,970
Two to two to the three,
four right. But he's only,

207
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,470
he's playing like he's doing
it with two sticks in one hand.

208
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,140
So the one on top sit,
the top of the high hat,

209
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,830
the one underneath is hitting the bottom
of the high head. So up top, what?

210
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,620
He's really just, he's playing like every
other note of the tripled. Like dot,

211
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,810
dot, dot, dot, dot,
dot. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

212
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,110
But he gets that as he's bringing that
stick up. The one underneath hits it.

213
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,760
So that's how he gets the
full 16th note. Right? Sorry.

214
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,340
I know this is really nerdy shit.
And then with his left hand,

215
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,940
he's basically ghosting the off beat
and then play in the backbeat on two and

216
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,290
four and then dragon,

217
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,030
I believe on the final note of a,

218
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,340
the triplet into one.

219
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,423
Okay.

220
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,320
That's what he's doing now. I know
that's drum nerd shit, but I'll,

221
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,370
I'll post the video.
It's fucking insane. Um,

222
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,050
so of course I went to the, you know,

223
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,770
went down to the studio the next
day and I tried to do it, you know,

224
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,790
for like 10 minutes, you know, according
in whatever you learned something,

225
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,300
you know,

226
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,770
the first thing you do is you immediately
try to play it at the same tempo is

227
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,330
the drum God that you saw play in it.
So it was really fucking frustrating.

228
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,290
I think I said, what the fuck, like
10 times. And then I just, you know,

229
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,000
just scrolled through my iPod, iPad,
whatever, my five phone and I'd say,

230
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,480
hey mom. And just started
playing in the same shit.

231
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,870
I've been playing two for 30 fucking
years. I don't know what my deal is.

232
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,430
I can't get out of it.

233
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,503
Okay,

234
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,670
thank God I buy new clothes.
You know, if you should be like,

235
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:47,230
you should be forced to wear the clothes.
If you don't move ahead artistically,

236
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,090
your wardrobe shouldn't either.

237
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,580
You should be forced to
fucking wear the same shit.

238
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,110
I should be wearing an acid wash jeans
with a fucking half shirt driving down

239
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,080
the street, my rusted out 83 Ford
Ranger. And they'd be like, listen,

240
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:03,640
if you're not going to progress with
the art of music, Yo, or whatever,

241
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,830
if you're going to watch the
same 10 fucking films. Um, yeah,

242
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,360
I had no idea how far
behind I was. Um, and so,

243
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,720
and I'm looking at mute math like they
haven't been fucking crushing it for 10

244
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:16,901
years.

245
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,350
I actually went on the Internet and I
looked him up and he like did Letterman

246
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,450
2005. There you go, Bill.

247
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,940
Wait to be on the cutting
edge. So whatever.

248
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,340
I feel like I took a major step forward,

249
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:34,270
but I want to thank everyone
in the band for uh, you know,

250
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:37,720
letting us come back and say hello real
quick. Uh, Darren, Paul, Roy and Todd,

251
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:38,620
you guys were fucking,

252
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,600
you crushed it and thank you to Andrew
for taking me down there and, uh,

253
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,050
pointing out what the fuck was
going on so I could, you know,

254
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,050
so the old man could
figure it out. But, uh,

255
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:54,290
I will definitely see those whenever I'm
in a city that they're in and I'm able

256
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,300
to do it. It was that good of a
fucking show. And like I said,

257
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,660
they're in Portland than Seattle and
they get a week off then they're in a

258
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,340
Richmond, so definitely check it
out. Anyways, plowing ahead here.

259
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,530
Um, so that was my Friday.
All right. So as a comedian,

260
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,570
there's no way you take a Friday,

261
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,570
Saturday off unless the UFC has a fucking
pay per view and it's caught on my

262
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,430
grandma and Holly home of fighting.
Right? So I'm like, all right,

263
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,180
I've got to watch. I thought
they were both title fights.

264
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,610
I didn't realize that corner's
fight was not a title fight.

265
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,240
I think most people didn't realize that
most people like me got drawn into a

266
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:32,750
sport. When there's someone like his,
you know, I go in and out of the UFC,

267
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,390
you know, like most shit.
I go in and out of cooking.

268
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,290
I go in and out of being a good
comedian. I'm just, I mean an app, right?

269
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,030
I'm a fucking a Gemini. I'm into it.
I'm into it. Go Fuck Yourself. Hey,

270
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:47,600
remember that shit? Then I come
back, right. Except with my music.

271
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,650
I just held onto it for just a
little, a little to eat. You know,

272
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,620
you can always get what you will. Um,

273
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,830
what am I talking about? Anyways,
so we have a bunch of people over,

274
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,200
right? We go out, I go to the grocery
store, I get a bunch, I get some booze.

275
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,810
I get, yeah, I get some Gaba
Goo. I get some fucking ige bio.

276
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,400
I get some fucking cheese
and all of that shit.

277
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,300
I go on and get a bunch of ice cream
sandwiches after everybody's all fucking

278
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:21,950
salted up with the Doritos and we
sit down to watch the shit and um,

279
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,560
what a fucking paper view
man. You know, spoiler alert,

280
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,640
you know, if you haven't heard yet,

281
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm going to say who won me
should take beat Holly home,

282
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,450
you know, and Nate Diaz
be Connor McGregor.

283
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,420
It was fucking unreal. My, I'm in.

284
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,640
Anybody else hosts a UFC fight party.

285
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,480
How fucking satisfied
did you feel was unreal.

286
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:51,620
I had like 10 people screaming,
Oh my God. Over and over again.

287
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,270
Like twice in one night,
flipping the fuck out.

288
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,780
More screaming and yelling during that
pay per view than I've heard in any super

289
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,510
bowl. You know, I don't Super Bowl
party that I'd been to in a while.

290
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,110
Um, it was unbelievable.
But Jesus Christ once again,

291
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,930
why always hate when like when a comedian
is getting ready for a special ors or

292
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,850
a late night spot and they say that
they trained like a fighter at the,

293
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,450
it's so disrespectful to what the men
and women do who fight for a fucking

294
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,760
living. It is dead is the most bad ass.

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,470
I'm trying to think of like a more ass
job than that other than, you know,

296
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,200
you're one of the grunts
on the front line in a war.

297
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:38,940
Me,

298
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,690
your fucking job is you just train your
trading to beat the fuck out of somebody

299
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:46,870
who's training that beat the fuck out
of you when you both are professionals,

300
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,700
you do it for a living. A
whole crowd of people shows up.

301
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,750
You have ever fight after school and like
10 people showed up was fucking nerve

302
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,210
wracking. Fight, fight, fight.

303
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,140
These guys walk into a
fucking arena shirtless.

304
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:04,770
Just walk it down there and they got
to stare down some fucking maniac.

305
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,210
I live in there. We're on the
dove on the ground. Right.

306
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,200
And that just taking fucking elbows and
they had the presence of mind to look

307
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,380
over at the clock. Like how much more
of this shit? I had another minute,

308
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:20,760
38 of forearms to my fucking forehead.

309
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,430
I don't know how they take it. So, um,

310
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,080
yeah,

311
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,130
unbelievable fight.

312
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:29,370
I didn't realize that a Connor had gone
up in two way classes. Like I said,

313
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:33,330
I'm a very like novice
fan of this stuff. Um,

314
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,540
okay.

315
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,740
But Jesus Christ

316
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,870
fucking Nate Diaz sitting there and his
whole face is all bloody and he says,

317
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,330
yeah, I, you know, I got this,
I've taken your worst shot.

318
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,080
She can't knock me out. That's
just scar tissue. I've bled before.

319
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,500
I don't know. I don't know how the fuck
you do that. He was bleeding so much.

320
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,650
It looked like both of them
were bleeding to death cause he,

321
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:02,240
once he got up against McGregor, whether
it was all over both of them, um,

322
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,080
I dunno,

323
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,320
I really don't have anything to say other
than I was blown away by both fucking

324
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,600
fights and um,

325
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,333
okay.

326
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,450
You know, as hard as it is to what
I was was to watch Conor lose.

327
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,280
Cause I mean the guy's
a fucking superstar.

328
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,060
I'm talking shit and
then backing it up. Um,

329
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,440
okay.

330
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,470
It was, you know, watching Nate
do is choking a fucking, I was,

331
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:25,720
I was fucking unreal.
I don't, I don't know.

332
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,850
I don't know enough about this sport
to talk about it intelligently,

333
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:28,960
but I will say this,

334
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:33,280
I hate when someone like Connor
loses and then everybody, yeah,

335
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,980
you fucking pussy say all that
shit on the Internet. You know,

336
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:39,250
go on Twitter and start
trashing the guy. You know,

337
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
I want to talk to people right now. If
you are one of those people that do,

338
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,850
how do you, how do you, like,

339
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,150
how do you do something like that and
like look yourself in the mirror when you

340
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,340
go to brush your teeth at
night, you know, no one,

341
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,740
you haven't had a fight
since like the seventh grade.

342
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,260
You know the fuck is wrong with you.

343
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,050
And if you already talked
all that fucking shit,

344
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:59,650
that's what it made it
great selling the fight.

345
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,953
I don't know

346
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,630
how great was that fucking life you
just knocked out. Caught him. Oh,

347
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:11,900
choke dot Connor McGregor. How does
it feel if he grabs it? Mike goes,

348
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm not surprised, motherfucker.

349
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,763
Of course,

350
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,581
I don't know about you guys,

351
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,780
but that's one of the fucking coolest
things I've ever seen to fucking choke out

352
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:22,980
someone who's good is. But Gregor,

353
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,820
they'd stand up all fucking bloody
and just walk around flexing,

354
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,740
not even wiping the blood off, not
concerned about how fucked up your faces.

355
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,560
You don't give a fuck, right. Whatever.

356
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,650
Jesus Christ. The second I got a
little scratch, I would have just, Oh,

357
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,320
I got him. I got me.

358
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,893
Um,

359
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,500
that was great to see me.
Uh, Misha went to, but I,

360
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,700
I as as a fellow fair skin
person, I felt bad for Holly home.

361
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,133
You know,

362
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,550
just to second we start getting beat on
just [inaudible] our face just gets so

363
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,920
fucking red and then our
yellow eyebrows stand out.

364
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,340
I just thought there was a lot
of mean Shit said about her. Uh,

365
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,610
when it came to that, I, I just
really related to it by the way.

366
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,930
What the fuck happened in Nate's,

367
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,740
the side of his face and his neck,

368
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,070
those scratches. How did that happen?

369
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,570
Like somebody took like a
fucking, okay, you got some,

370
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,980
somebody took a knife down the
side of his face and his neck.

371
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,400
He's just sitting there
pawn at it. I, that's,

372
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,430
I've gotten scratched like that
every time somebody's like, exhale.

373
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:35,720
Just the wind of that made me
go into the fetal position. Um,

374
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,880
but anyways, you know, it's great
as that UFC pay per view was,

375
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,450
it's what just makes me so fucking
sad about what has happened to boxing.

376
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,110
If they could somehow, if all the pieces,

377
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,160
shit promoters in boxing could just unify
and become one piece of shit promoter,

378
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,530
you know, promotional entity
like the UFC is right.

379
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,090
Cause you know, you know you not that
the 11 if you, if you're, if you're,

380
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,640
if you're wearing any
level of show business,

381
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,730
you know the promoters are fucking over
the ex, you know, they are in an, in,

382
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,980
in UFC, it's the fighters,
you know, I know in some,

383
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,750
I don't know anything about it,
but I don't sell some of it.

384
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,320
They are getting fucked and because
they're a complete monopoly,

385
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,180
I'm sure they're fucking with their money.

386
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm sure there's a pressure to make
people fight and that type of shit,

387
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,780
which is why they try to break
up monopolies. Having said that,

388
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,370
it's fucking great for the fence because
kids stook the fact that the fighters

389
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:34,730
have no other options. It's
just the best fight, the best.

390
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,133
Um,

391
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,000
and like last night, like I haven't
had that kind of excitement,

392
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,910
like watching like a boxing pay per view,

393
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:47,170
like consistently the way the UFC is
consistently exciting like that since I

394
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:50,470
would say the middleweight division. Um,

395
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,430
yeah,

396
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,230
in the early eighties when you
had Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns,

397
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,710
Marvelous Marvin Hagler
and sugar ray Leonard,

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm all fighting each other.
They all fought each other.

399
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,550
They fought each other numerous
fucking times. It was incredible.

400
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,613
Um,

401
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,800
I guess when Mike Tyson came along,

402
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,560
but that was just more the spectacle
of how quick was he going to just knock

403
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,394
these people.

404
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,010
Um, I dunno.

405
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,620
Just seeing a paper view like that and
then seeing that it took fucking 10 years

406
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,300
for the Mayweather Pacquiao fight and
then one of them shows up and he's fucking

407
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:31,680
hurt and doesn't say anything. He doesn't
say anything and you're still out.

408
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:35,940
60 bucks is just fucking
brutal. So anyways, um,

409
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,910
hats off to that fucking paper view.

410
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:41,280
Jesus Christ actually watched
some McGregor fight again.

411
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,713
Um,

412
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,620
I'm fucking believable.

413
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,100
Okay.

414
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,630
I was just looking at
the blood. I'm going,

415
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:52,500
he's just going to keep fucking punching
him right in that I just keep punching

416
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,490
them right in that fucking eye.

417
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:57,570
Like who did that to that guy with
the fucking yellow hair bleached hair.

418
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,450
Was it fucking, what
the fuck was his name?

419
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,240
Okay.

420
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,130
GSP. I can't even moon that fucking names.

421
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:08,340
He just kept punching the dude in
the eye over and over and over.

422
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:08,880
And then it was always,

423
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,820
I thought that that's what my Greg was
going to do is to keep punching Nate in

424
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:15,750
that fucking, I added
some. How you doing it?

425
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,880
I fuck you. Sit there with I'm
done. Fucking done. You scratch me.

426
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,420
I am done. Keep fighting. All right.

427
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,280
I just keep saying the
same thing over again.

428
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:31,260
I was blown away by it and a respect to
everybody who fought there. Um, anyways,

429
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,660
uh, you know, it's weird to is
McGregor is still the champion.

430
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,550
I didn't know that. I thought it, I
thought I just assumed to feel lost.

431
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,060
That's it, right? You're not a champ
anymore, but you don't have the belt.

432
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,960
You're always a champ. Right.
How do I get out of this?

433
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,970
I don't know anything about this
sport. All right, let me, uh,

434
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,150
let me get to the advertising that
always saves me. Where the fuck is it?

435
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,700
Okay,

436
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,620
I forgot six. There it is. There it. Oh,
here we go. But up, up, up the IDs me,

437
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,720
undies, drying up. You fucking
Twat. [inaudible] B and A's is dry.

438
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:06,720
Don't say that. It's not, um,

439
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,650
beyond days whether you're
wearing a suit or sweats,

440
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,470
you spend almost 24 hours
a day and yet underwear.

441
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,560
But instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

442
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,920
clothes, your, your underwear
is probably boring me.

443
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,910
UNDIES is here to change that. They're
going to give you exciting underwear.

444
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
Introducing male panties. Um,

445
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,620
please include the following.
It's pronounced modal.

446
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,540
I don't know how many times I have to
mispronounce this before it gets some

447
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:44,280
decent copy. All right. It's all
written in lower case. M. O. H.

448
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,540
Dash D. A. L. It doesn't tell me
which one to say to fucking stress.

449
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,400
It's either modal

450
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,380
or muddle.

451
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,520
I was like, no accent is that good.

452
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,290
Every pair of me undies is made
from sustainable sourced modal,

453
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,620
modal of fabric. That's
twice as soft as cotton.

454
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,520
Nothing can describe the fit
and feel of me undies. Oh,

455
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,230
when they get up against your balls,

456
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,040
a smile just comes across your
face like the Grinch on Christmas.

457
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,880
But once you try them on, you're going
to understand while they're called,

458
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:24,420
why they are called the world's
most comfortable underwear.

459
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,840
Who calls them that? Why me undies does.

460
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,100
Then I called the world.
They're called by you.

461
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:34,110
You came up with that in the
fucking advertising room.

462
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,010
That's like when Michael Jackson
just called himself the king of Pop.

463
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,740
I'm the King of Pop. No.
Are you twinkle toes?

464
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,590
What else are you you a little teapot.

pair of me undies, they're free.

edition prints to help you make a

468

469

510
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,910
MVMT watches movement.

511
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,900
Watches was started by
Michael Victor. Michael Tango.

512
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,800
You know what that reminds me? Is that
then that new Tina fame movie, whiskey,

513
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,460
tango, Foxtrot. Is that the,

514
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,960
is that not the worst advertised
movie you've ever fucking seen?

515
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,690
It just says whiskey, tango, Foxtrot.

516
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,320
She stayed in this squinting into
the sun holding a notepad and there's

517
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:58,250
something on fire behind her.
That's it. That's all I get.

518
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,160
You know, you can't hook her up with
a little fucking descrip description.

519
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,293
Yeah,

520
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,040
I don't know. Maybe I'm old.
Maybe that, maybe that's,

521
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,550
that's the way the kids like it. They
don't want it. They don't want what it is.

522
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,790
Says it wasn't it called as
a slug line or some shit.

523
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,893
Right?

524
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,310
I don't know.

525
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,940
Obviously it's right next to another
fucking billboard and there's like a like

526
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:24,390
three Japanese looking dudes
holding shogun warrior swords.

527
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,300
And I know what that's about. I
know roughly where it takes place.

528
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,950
You can't just squint into the sun
holding the notepad. You know, it's like,

529
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,270
is she an Arizona?

530
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,330
Okay.

531
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,820
Is Her RV on fire in the
Grand Canyon? Is she in Iraq?

532
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,930
I don't know. Maybe that's
what they're supposed to do.

533
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,540
Like I'm supposed to peak my interest
in. I'm supposed to go on the internet,

534
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,090
but if someone like me who doesn't
know how to look up Shit, you know,

535
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,440
or starts to look something up and sees
a picture of something else and then

536
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,440
clicks on that and then two hours
later goes, wait a minute. It wasn't,

537
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,750
I gotta look something up and you
can't fucking remember what it was.

538
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:03,190
I'm just saying, I think she's earned
a PR. I think she earned, you know,

539
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,530
a little more respect in that. Right.

540
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,870
Okay.

541
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,630
Dog. She hasn't made fucking
millions and box office.

542
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:12,450
Can you fucking help her out
with maybe half a sentence?

543
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,230

sleeping upstairs last night.

575
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,070
Um, oh fucking Joey
Rose's swung by the house.

576
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,730
We had a couple of cocktails,
right? And then he went home.

577
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,310
Ubered it like the hipster that he
is over to his hipster neighborhood,

578
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,760
you know, there's fucking

579
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,910
is jugs on or whatever the kids were
wearing nowadays. And uh, I don't know. I,

580
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,490
the only time I snore
is when I fucking booze.

581
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,860
So I wasn't gonna do that
to the lovely Nia soya.

582
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,100
I crashed upstairs and, um,

583
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,740
it started thundering
and lightning at night.

584
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,800
And what's fucking hilarious about living
out here slash terrifying is it never

585
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:51,590
rains. So when you hear thunder,

586
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,540
you automatically think it's a fucking
earthquake, but your bed isn't moving.

587
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,820
So you kinda like, well,
wait a minute, am I,

588
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,280
I've never heard an earthquake
that I couldn't feel.

589
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,010
And you've got to like do the
math when you half asleep going,

590
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,770
is that like an earthquake? And you know,

591
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:10,010
in the valley and I can't fucking hear
it. I can hear it, but I can't feel it.

592
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:14,000
That, that doesn't make any sense. And
then you find, oh my God, that's thunder.

593
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,520
Holy Shit. It's fucking raining out.
Right. What does that in French,

594
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,410
you polit you Plu, I can't fucking
remember. I suck at that shit.

595
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,390
If ned it is snowing. Um,

596
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,420
anyways, they'll starts fucking
rating. And uh, it's tremendous.

597
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:40,170
It's rained a bunch. It's an El Nino year.
Thank Christ. And, uh, but what else?

598
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,490
Always the depressing thing in the back
of my head is as green and as lush as

599
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,610
the hills. Look right now. Um,

600
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:49,970
this is like basically the only rain
we're going to get for the next fucking

601
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:54,560
three years. And I know every country
out here is taking long showers now,

602
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,350
going hey to folk and
droughts over, you know,

603
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,610
I just hope, ah, I dunno.
I hope it fucking rained.

604
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,120
Keeps raining as much as it
possibly fucking cans or it can,

605
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,610
or there's a massive goddamn
plague out here. One of the other,

606
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,210
something's got to give. Right.
That's depressing isn't all right,

607
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,200
let's get into 'em. Oh No, wait, I
was gonna tell you another thing.

608
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,920
So yesterday I was just driving around,
hanging out with my wife and uh,

609
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:24,140
they got a bunch of open houses
out here so they can't fuck it.

610
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,010
Let's go look at some houses, you know,
get some ideas for our old ass kitchen.

611
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,870
See what a real kitchen
looks like, right? And, um,

612
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,230
I gotta tell you haven't bought this
house and gone through all this shit that

613
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:39,210
I've gone through. I look at
houses entirely different.

614
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm immediately looking at the windows.

615
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,370
Do they have the old ass
original windows? Um,

616
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,110
and I immediately want to go downstairs
if there's a crawl space, anything.

617
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,500
I want to go down there
and I'm smelling for water.

618
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,520
And you can't really do that a lot out
here because then it doesn't rain enough.

619
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,100
But I immediately look
underneath the fucking house.

620
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:02,430
I look right up it's fucking
skirt, like the home pervert. I am.

621
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,010
And I'm immediately looking
for, all right, let's see.

622
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,990
What does the electrical work look look
like? You know, is it galvanized pipe?

623
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:14,610
What kind of Shit Hole? You know,
look at how stuff is put together.

624
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:18,410
Does this look like it had
a permit or not? And um,

625
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,780
you know, all the sexy shit goes away.

626
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:25,770
Like we have a pool and I'm just
looking at it going like, Eh, it's okay.

627
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,190
And it looks like a piece of shit to
me that looks like you need to Redo the

628
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:34,191
whole floor of that fucking thing and so
got dump out all the fucking water and

629
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:37,740
evidently you can't fill your pool
up with water anymore out here.

630
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:40,830
You have to fly the fucking
water in. So fuck that pool.

631
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,280
I haven't got it in the house. Shit.
You know? Oh, there's a classic.

632
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,860
They're saying it's a two car
garage, but it is if you drive,

633
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:50,640
if you drive two model t Fords, but
if you have any sort of modern car,

634
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,500
you're not going to be able to get
the all you can get to in there,

635
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,910
but nobody can get out of the cars.

636
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,010
So I was just a negative Nelly and I
actually realized that my house isn't as

637
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,030
bad as I thought it was.

638
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,950
Now that I've fucking dumped every
fucking dime that I have into it, I'm

639
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,460
not made me feel good. I was just
walking in the kitchen. I'm like,

640
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,100
there's no prep space
here. All this disco shit.

641
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,560
I don't see any place where I could
fucking slice an English muffin.

642
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:16,470
You know what? Fuck this
kitchen. Fuck the pool.

643
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,330
Fuck the kitchen and fuck this galvanized
pipe. Oh, oh look at this. Oh Wow.

644
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,180
Rugs, rugs in every room. Yeah. Take
your shoes off. Why is that? Yeah,

645
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:28,230
cause the floors haven't been refinished
in fucking 80 years. Fuck these floors.

646
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,520
Let's go upstairs. Oh Great. I see
this used to be an attic. Oh yeah.

647
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,980
You calling that an office? Yeah. Yeah.

648
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,040
I like how you shown it
during the wintertime because
I know it happens in the

649
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,800
summertime. It fucking
heats up up here. Right.

650
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,200
You can grow a fucking goddamn bullshit
Bushel of fucking marijuana up here.

651
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,870
Be fucking three hours.
Fuck this office. Right.

652
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,600
You want to sign up on our mailing list
now I don't put your cell and piece of

653
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,900
shit houses. And then that, that
said I walked and I was done.

654
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,060
And of course I upset my wife
cause all I did was just, sorry,

655
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,580
I accidentally just shut off the
fucking recorder. I actually,

656
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,820
I upset my wife because, you know,
she's like, I like, you know,

657
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,180
I thought we could just have fun and
I understand why you have to go in the

658
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:17,181
house and be rude to the real estate
people saying I don't like those people.

659
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,560
You know, cause they'd,
they don't encourage you to
sell your house, you know,

660
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,210
air quote for a fucking profits and then
you can buy back into the same market

661
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,210
and then everything you just made
on your house, you got to buy it.

662
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:32,850
You got to spend again just
to get the same fucking house.

663
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,030
I actually said that to the guy. I think
that that's made my wife mad and I go,

664
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,310
yeah, the only people making money
out here are you in the banks.

665
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,180
And the guy's like, well no, that's
not necessarily true. Do the math.

666
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,110
Tell me how that works.

667
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
Okay.

668
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,900
Can we get you on the
mailing list? Um, all right,

669
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:53,970
let's leave some fucking questions here.
Questions here for the Goddamn Week.

670
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,610
Kiska Kiska say mall

671
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,230
something, right? What is, what
does, I don't fucking know.

672
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,443
[inaudible]

673
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,500
I'm just never going to get it.
You know what, I don't, I just,

674
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:13,590
there's no reason for me to speak it.
All right, let's, let's plow ahead here.

675
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,730
All right. Um, the March 3rd podcast,

676
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,080
fucking brilliant podcast yesterday,
March, March 3rd, 2016. Thank you.

677
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,990
One of the very breasts and I've
heard hundreds of your podcast.

678
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,500
Nobody drowns in their own vomit
anymore. Great Brain, dude.

679
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,330
Thank you Greg and hamburger. Let me
know if you're coming over here. Well,

680
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:38,270
that's not a fucking
question. That's just a con.

681
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,200
Yeah, but you don't compliment this
questions. That's it. Well, thank you.

682
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,110
I'm going to be doing Germany
hopefully towards the end of the year.

683
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,990
I'm definitely getting over
there. All right. Um, okay.

684
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:50,540
Guy who invented the invented email

685
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,980
died.

686
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,550
He said Uncle Freddy died.
Uncle Freddy. Hey Bill,

687
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:03,210
I'm sending you an email about the
guy who invented email dying today.

688
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,220
This is my way of honoring what he did.

689
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,280
I imagine he'll get very little
press because Nancy just say no.

690
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,540
Reagan died this weekend too.

691
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,810
Here's an article from an is an excerpt
from an article a about him Internet

692
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:20,940
Hall of Famer re Tom Wilson has died.

693
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,290
Tom Wilson was the man who basically
invented email as we know it today,

694
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,530
including making the choice to use
the at sign in an email address.

695
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,340
He was 74 years old. Tomlinson,
I think I said his name wrong,

696
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:37,590
the first time. Tomlinson invented email.

697
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,090
A system where a user on one network
could send a message to someone on the

698
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,260
another network in 1971 oh they
left some of it out of their

699
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,940
Thomaston invented a network. I mean,
I'm going to read it the way I see it.

700
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,150
Tomlinson or Tom Wilson, however,

701
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,080
I feel like reading
Tomlinson invented email,

702
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,830
a system where a user on one network
could send a message to someone on another

703
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,810
network while the government,

704
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,760
advertisers and hackers could all
read your private information.

705
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
This was invented in 1971 had Tomlinson
had any idea what people were going to

706
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,290
do with his invention. What do you have
made it? What do you have invented it?

707
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,960
And the answer is, of
course he would have.

708
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,950
How else was he going to
get some pussy? All right.

709
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,980
This was his slug like, Hey,

710
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,060
can you meet my fucking friend Tomlinson
over here? I don't want to meet,

711
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,820
and he invented email. Oh my God. Hey you

712
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,240
can I touch your peepee? Um,
that's actually really interesting.

713
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,940
There's Internet Hall of famers
now you have to look that up.

714
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:54,440
Who's in the Internet Hall of fame?
Jesus Christ. I want to see images too.

715
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,360
I want to see what the fuck these
people look like. Internet Hall of fame.

716
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,040
Here we go. Come on, man.

717
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,270
Internet Hall of fame homepage. Holy Shit.

718
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,980
2014 hall of fame inductees. I didn't
know this. This is fucking awesome.

719
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,860
Internet Hall of fame. Paul
vixy, internet piracy. Well,

720
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:23,810
let me see the list inductees. All
right, here we go. Here's a list.

721
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:28,370
Here's a list of who.
Who is it? All right.

722
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:32,870
Here's some of the pioneers. Look at
these fucking eggheads. Jesus Christ.

723
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,900
Wow. Wow.

724
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,910
Oh my God. I, if I could do
a fucking screenshot of this,

725
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,610
I got to put the link up here. My God.

726
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,970
What is it about being
super smart and just,

727
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,090
I guess everybody gets one gift. I'll
tell these people. This is a rough one.

728
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:59,170
You know, there's a lot of fucking lonely
prom nights on this page. All right,

729
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,090
Douglas Engelbart and he's as good
looking as that fucking name all he looks

730
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:05,830
like a sweet old man. Let's see what this

731
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:13,090
Guy Douggie Jesus Christ, he's
got the old man face in 1963 Dr.

732
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:18,810
Angle Bard founded the augmentation
research center lab at SRS.

733
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,650
How do you tell a woman that that's
your dream and she's not going to glaze

734
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:28,090
over. Tried doing that while that.
Fuck it. Ah, Cathy and I. Thanks. Wait,

735
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:28,963
I'm with you.

736
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,610
I said I want to start the
augmentation research center lab.

737
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,580
Where are you going? Um,

738
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,120
where he pioneered a system for augmenting
human intellect in which workers

739
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:49,851
sitting at display workstations could
collaborate on solutions to humanity's

740
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:53,880
problems through a vast
online information space.

741
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,210
That didn't matter that no
one ever fucking uses it.

742
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,360
Look at this guy. He fucking
the, see, this is what all these,

743
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,730
these guys are off and
all these men and women,

744
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:07,380
their heart's in the right fucking place.

745
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,760
And then these fucking
lunatics in these corporations,

746
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,530
these sociopath's get their fucking
manicured fingers on these things.

747
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,860
All right, Susan Astrada, you could tell
she was a looker back in the day. God,

748
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,230
I bet all these guys fucking jerked off
to her when she came around the fucking

749
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,260
augmentation lab. Susan here yet. Um,

750
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,020
that's probably why she's, this is
probably the woman, why they're there.

751
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,563
She was this,

752
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,660
this woman here was probably
the inspiration for the
fucking a virtual reality

753
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:42,570
sex suit that they're trying
to work on as strata founded.

754
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,150
C E r f Surf Net,

755
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,810
one of the original regional IP networks
in 1988 surf net serves the academic

756
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:55,470
and commercial communities in California.
I still don't even know what it is.

757
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,150
As an executive director,

758
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:01,200
she took the initial national science
foundation funding two point $8 million

759
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,500
and grew the network from 25
sites to hundreds of sites.

760
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,230
I don't know what it does. All right,
let's, let's look at this. Look.

761
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,390
Dennis Jennings.

762
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,670
This guy looks like a fucking NFL ref
from 1958 as the first program director

763
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:21,070
for networking at the u s
National Science Foundation.

764
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,260
Dr. Jennings was responsible for the
design and the development of NSF net

765
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,333
program.

766
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:29,600
Yeah.

767
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,810
No way he did that. I have no idea
what any these fucking people did.

768
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,920
Come on man. Let's trying to
find somebody. Looks like, okay,

769
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,040
this guy's not a bad looking
guy. Oh yes he is. He isn't.

770
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,540
He's got a full head of hair, but you
can just see he's a spazz. You know,

771
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,100
he's one of those guys seem sort of
cool until he starts laughing and

772
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm all right. Eric Bina
being a co-created with
fellow Internet Hall of Famer,

773
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,221
Mark Andreessen,

774
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:01,221
the first version of the mosaic web
browser in 1993 I think I've kind of know

775
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:05,340
what that is. Alright. You know what
and with that, and I'm fucking bored.

776
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:09,390
Just like the chicks walking away
from these people at the bar. Um,

777
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:10,950
okay.

778
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:15,000
Internet Hall of Famer. Well, you know
what moment of silence for Ray Tomlinson,

779
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,940
his heart was in the right place.

780
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,910
Who knew that pedophiles
would use his invention

781
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,290
to send pictures and shit. All right.
From Scotland, dear Billy, big dicks.

782
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,510
I've had been,

783
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,510
I've been working flat out in work back
in Scotland and now taking a three week

784
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,170
vacation in the u s I'm 27 years old
and I've never been across the pond,

785
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,970
so this is a big deal for me.
Well, welcome a chance to see you

786
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,280
nutcases up close and
personal. I'm Planning Vegas,

787
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:57,230
Death Valley and Grand Canyon to see some
outdoor epicness then onto Chicago to

788
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,800
see the Blackhawks wipe the
floor with the flyers. Wow, man,

789
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,720
that sounds like a great trip.
Then Patty's Day. Oh boy. Um,

790
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,100
then New York City to
pop my wheat cherry. Um,

791
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,060
to a first time timer in the u s what
would be your top three things to do?

792
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,860
I would really appreciate the
advice. Alaska. Fuck yourself.

793
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,190
You're big Nancy boy. Okay.

794
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,810
The three things I would do. Well,
I mean you're kind of doing three,

795
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,240
you're doing some amazing shit, right?
Defi if I was coming to America,

796
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:36,030
what would I do? Oh Dude, I live here.
I don't know what the fuck to do.

797
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:36,840
That's like, you know,

798
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,140
you never know what the touristy
shit is to do in your [inaudible].

799
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,840
You take your own place, you take it for
granted. Like when I lived in New York,

800
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,170
I never went to this. I went to
the Statue of Liberty once I went,

801
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:50,430
when my grandmother visited, you
know, I didn't do any of that shit.

802
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:54,390
I was just trying to get
to work. Um, all right.

803
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:58,920
If I had to pick three cities,
I would do shit. Only three.

804
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,360
All right. You gotta go to
New York. I would say Chicago,

805
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,550
but you get enough New York with Chicago.

806
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,600
I would see San Francisco and then
you'd have to do something down south.

807
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,850
Um, you know, just to get, I don't know,

808
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,210
you'd get both coasts and then you get
down south and all of those are their own

809
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,550
fucking worlds. What would I do?

810
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:25,550
I don't want no black Cox
game is fucking great. Um,

811
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,630
dude, you know what? You stumped
me. I don't know what I would do.

812
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:35,200
I would go to New York like you're going
to do and I would fucking do as much

813
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:39,040
shit as I can. You can't miss
there. That was a nice vague answer.

814
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,570
Um, the fuck would you do

815
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,023
okay?

816
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,610
I Dunno. I live here.

817
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:52,300
I don't know what the fuck would I do if
I went to Scotland. Go ahead, give me,

818
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:55,660
Give me Your Mushy pee ideas.
I guess I would, I would go to,

819
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:58,870
I would go to a rugby game.
I think you know something.

820
00:48:58,871 --> 00:48:59,800
If you're going somewhere,

821
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,050
you have way more ideas than
the person who's living there.

822
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,450
I can't believe I can't think of
anything to do. I, I, you know what?

823
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,990
I go to a fucking steak
house. You know what?

824
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:12,840
I would definitely indulge in the
fucking cuisine over here. There we go.

825
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:16,380
I'm getting my footing here. All
right. You go into a hockey game.

826
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:20,100
I'd go to a sporting event.
Any sort of fucking basketball,

827
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:24,420
anything you can see if you can go
see the fucking golden state warriors.

828
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,900
They one of the best regular
season records of all time.

829
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,910
If you can take it a fucking show.
Go see new mass for fuck sakes. Um,

830
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:34,943
okay.

831
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:40,320
I Dunno what I would do, dude.
I'd go down south, right?

832
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,670
I go to a fucking gun range. Do
something like that you want,

833
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,980
this is what you want to do. You
want to do some metropolitan shit,

834
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,970
you wanna do some sports shit and then
you gotta do some [inaudible] backwards

835
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:53,490
shit. That's what I would do. You know,

836
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,710
go find somebody drinking some moonshine
out of a fucking jar, a mason jar,

837
00:49:58,711 --> 00:49:59,161
and then, you know,

838
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:02,670
have him fucking smoke a God damn pork
shoulder and go out and shoot his guns.

839
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,970
There you go. Ride some
four wheelers. You know,

840
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,030
do something like that.
I don't know. You know,

841
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:12,960
a lot of people sleep on like
Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas.

842
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,120
Those can all be fun to go see.

843
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,720
I don't consider you guys live in
that little ass country, you know?

844
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,993
I Dunno dude.

845
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,580
I've ran a fucking classic American car
and we now went from fucking New York

846
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,520
too. A Chicago. I would drive that
and I wouldn't take the highways.

847
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:35,450
I try to find some old route and I'd
stop off at greasy spoons when you go.

848
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:37,910
There we go. Jesus. Oh, there's a
couple of ideas. I'm sorry dude.

849
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,460
I really fucked you over
on that one. Butter.

850
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,213
I don't know.

851
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,290
That's like when somebody,

852
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,260
you remember back in the day
when you actually shopped,

853
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,690
you know you bought cds and stuff.

854
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,480
I used to have all these cds I'd want
to buy and then when I would walk into

855
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:53,870
virgin I could never remember what
the fuck I wanted. I'm sorry man.

856
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:56,820
I really dropped the ball on that one.
Alright. To a first timer in the year.

857
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,830
That's not it. A podcast got me
in trouble with fiancee's family.

858
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,610
Uh, hey, they are
billary Berm Clinton. Um,

859
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,610
I fucked up man.

860
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:11,990
As you can probably guess
from the subject line Q, The

861
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,520
[inaudible]. Um, as a little background,

862
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:20,900
I'm getting married next month to my
fiance who was wonderful love of my life

863
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:24,710
and all that. We were visiting her family
last night and playing board games,

864
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,300
which we often do. Oh, Jesus. Oh,
what happened? We had drank in.

865
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,680
Did you get competitive? Huh?
She accused her mom of cheating.

866
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,140
Uh, he goes, I'll spare you the details,

867
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,930
but we were playing a card game
with a bunch of characters.

868
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,940
Everyone gets the same people,

869
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:45,410
but when you use them is
really the key to the game.

870
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,510
There was a particularly powerful card I
had held onto until the very last stage

871
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:54,740
of the game. The character's
name was granny Wada,

872
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,223
um,

873
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,300
pronounced Gary water.

874
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,650
I gave you the pronunciation and accent
so you wouldn't fuck it up. Well,

875
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:08,170
it is spelled w, a t, a granny a.

876
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,430
It's the last round of the game and
everyone's going around revealing their

877
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:16,670
card. I was last and my
plan had worked perfectly.

878
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,790
As I went to reveal it,

879
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:24,350
my inner bill Byrd took over and I really
got excited. I flipped it over. Oh,

880
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:28,940
you did it? He goes, oh,
no. Oh No. He goes, I said,

881
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,160
it's granny fucking.

882
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,550
Then when you drop the f pub, Oh my God,

883
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:44,090
I wish I had podcast tee
shirts. I'd send one to you. No,

884
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:48,170
you did. He goes, silence followed
as it echoed through the house.

885
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,590
My fiance's family were stunned.

886
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,970
They're not super uptight.
People, but people just don't,

887
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,150
just don't throw fucks around
during a board game. You know,

888
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,650
from there it only got worse. My
fiance is listen to your podcast,

889
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:05,750
so she knows I was imitating you.

890
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,650
She tried to stammer out
an explanation all no,

891
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:12,020
she had to explain away your behavior.

892
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,910
Ah, dude.

893
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,320
He goes, but it didn't really do anything.
I also tried to apologize sheepishly.

894
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,090
Then on top of that,

895
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:27,480
that move gave me enough points
to win the game over everyone.

896
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,500
So I had to awkwardly mark my
score, which made me the winner.

897
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,583
Wow, dude.

898
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,230
Oh, and you're getting married next month,

899
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:41,190
so the fucking taste of this is still
going to be in their mouth. He goes,

900
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:43,020
we left almost immediately after,

901
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:46,980
and of course I get yelled at all
the way home. I knew I deserved it,

902
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:48,630
so I didn't even put up much of a fight.

903
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:53,070
That's your first good move in
this story. Oh Wow. He goes,

904
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:53,881
my question is,

905
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:58,881
do I try and go out of my way to remedy
the situation or do I just hope everyone

906
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:02,640
forgets about it and moves on?
We're getting married in six weeks.

907
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:05,070
So it's not like I can
avoid them for very long.

908
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,760
I'm pissed because I fucking
crushed the impression to

909
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,660
thanks and go fuck yourself. So for the
Hillary Clinton reference in the opener,

910
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,100
I think she's a cunt to, uh, I
don't think she's a contract.

911
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,650
I just don't think she's an honest person.

912
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,400
And I don't think just because of
the fact that we've never had a woman

913
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
president that that's reason enough to
elect someone is dishonest and as phony

914
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:34,080
as her. Um, anyways, though,
you know what? I would,

915
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,200
I would actually, uh, without your wife.

916
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:40,290
I would just drive over there and
just say, listen, I gotta apologize.

917
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,570
I listened to this podcast.
I'm a big fan of the guy. Um,

918
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,970
I was making a joke and in the moment
I didn't realize that you guys didn't

919
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:49,710
listen to the podcast if you want.

920
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:52,770
And just kept a cue up a
clip where you have it,

921
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,270
which might be a bad thing to do,

922
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:58,650
but like just have me like
saying something else,

923
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,000
Dr Covey's easy shave butter, but any
might be fuck cause I don't say fuck.

924
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,820
MMM. [inaudible]

925
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,200
just say, just tell him you're
really embarrassed or whatever.

926
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,840
I think if you went over there
by yourself, I think, uh,

927
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,270
especially her dad, cause I
think that's the big one there.

928
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,530
I think there's this something
extra when it's, you know,

929
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:22,800
okay.

930
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,650
It's always extra. You know, when,
when you're getting married like a,

931
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,800
you know, if you're a
guy, you know, the, the,

932
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:35,610
the dad's going to be looking at your
twice as hard. And the moms who make, oh,

933
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:37,110
he's, no, it's relax. You know.

934
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:41,100
And then the other way around is if you
know they have a son and he brings a

935
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:41,881
woman around,

936
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,790
like the mother's going to be fucking
looking at her to see if she's a fucking,

937
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,450
you know, an evil little whore. You know,

938
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,040
the dad's going to be looking at you like,

939
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:53,520
is this guy going to be overbearing
and slap my fucking daughter or right.

940
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:58,140
Or whatever. You know what I mean? Is he
a piece of shit? Right. Um, oh my God,

941
00:55:58,141 --> 00:55:59,700
dude. Wow.

942
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,050
You said it's granny fucking water.

943
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,510
Oh God. Dude, if you film that, oh my God.

944
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,480
Okay.

945
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,600
Jesus Christ. Dude, I got
to give you, I got it.

946
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:19,140
My tip of the cap for you there,
man, for doing that. Holy Shit.

947
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,760
I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking
about that. Well, can I, I'll apologize.

948
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,620
Can I apologize to your fiance
for being a bad fucking, uh,

949
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,670
a bad, um, influence? Hey, you know what?
Play this to play this to your year,

950
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:38,530
your future in-laws, dear future
in-laws. Hello, I'm Bill Barr.

951
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:40,050
I'm the one who says, granny.

952
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:46,810
I say this type of stuff. I've been
the bad influence. Don't be mad at him.

953
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:50,290
I'm sure he's a wonderful human
being. I'm sorry I missed up.

954
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,760
He messed up you a little
kid game there. Um, yeah,

955
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,410
he's got to make a great son-in-law. You
know why? Cause he uses doctor cabbies.

956
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:03,880
Easy shade. Don't play that to them.

957
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:06,820
That's not going to get you into anything.
Let's gonna say he listens to morons.

958
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,420
He must be a moron. Are they going
to have half a moron kid? All right.

959
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,770
Not eating birthday cake.

960
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:17,560
Huge fan of the podcast is a 27 year
old who works in a stereotypical white

961
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:20,110
collar suburban office.
I thoroughly enjoy.

962
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:24,340
Listen to you by your biweekly
rants at my desk. Wonderful man. Uh,

963
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:28,960
speaking of which I work in the corporate
offices have a sales and distribution

964
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:31,030
company that has about 50 employees,

965
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,320
but only about 15 people work
in my specific office location,

966
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,970
which means that about once every
motherfucking month we gather in the big

967
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:44,680
conference room and do the cliche
awkward office Happy Birthday Song.

968
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,090
Oh No. With candles and cake
routine and all of that.

969
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,650
What I am by, no me. Okay. Well,
I am by no means a health nut.

970
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,700
I also try very hard to take care of
my body during the workday by eating

971
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:59,710
properly and drinking lots of water.

972
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,030
I've also gotten really into
bike racing over the past years,

973
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:08,650
which has taught me a lot about the
importance of nutrition, et cetera. Uh,

974
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,980
so the thought of eating a giant piece
of chocolate cake at two 30 in the

975
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:15,730
afternoon when my eyes are pre practically
bleeding from staring at a computer

976
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:19,870
screen all day would do nothing but
make me feel like absolute shit.

977
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,660
And I really have no
interest. Very smart. Uh,

978
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,050
this is why for the past couple of years
I've politely turned down every piece

979
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:30,400
of birthday cake that has been offered
to me at these affirmation ceremonies.

980
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:32,920
Unfortunately, I am the
only one of my coworkers,

981
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:37,330
most of whom are women who has
adopted this no cake philosophy.

982
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,740
So every single time I stick,

983
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,790
I stick out like a sore thumb after I
declined the piece that is passed to me.

984
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,290
At which point I have to deal with this
wave of passive aggression from these

985
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:52,291
ladies regarding my decision to
abstain from the sacred ritual.

986
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,600
I also share a birthday
with one of my coworkers,

987
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:58,930
so I am spared some of the awkwardness
that goes along with refusing cake on my

988
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:02,560
own birthday, but still made
out to be some kind of monster.

989
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,320
Okay, Jesus going on and on here.

990
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,400
While I have no intention of succumbing
to the peer pressure brought forth by my

991
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:09,940
colleagues,

992
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,360
this might be the best written fucking
letter I've ever had on the podcast.

993
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,380
Is it possible that I'm being rude
by not sharing in the celebration?

994
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,700
What's more is that even if I found out
people did that I was being douchey by

995
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:26,180
not eating cake, I still wouldn't
give a shit what they think.

996
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,540
Does this make me a
sociopath? No, it doesn't.

997
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,080
It makes you somebody who knows what he
wants and everybody else's, you know,

998
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,900
you just, you just get,
you know what you need.

999
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:40,780
You just get a little space here,
couple of little verbal, you know,

1000
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:47,120
you know, you know the great ones create
space and all, you know, football,

1001
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,190
hockey, basketball. You don't
have to do that baseball.

1002
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:52,760
But you know what I mean? The
great ones create space. Okay?

1003
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:56,000
So what you have to do is you have to
tap into your greatness and you have to

1004
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,810
create space. Okay? And
just say, look, people,

1005
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,660
it's not that I'm not happy
that it's your birthday.

1006
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,590
I just don't want to
become a lard ass. I mean,

1007
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,380
I'm not being a dick here,
but you know a lot of you,

1008
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:14,090
I'm not going to say who over the years
your slacks just keep getting bigger

1009
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,430
because you keep eating all
this fucking cake. All right?

1010
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,870
You blowing out your bodies and
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1011
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,560
And a part of me dies every time
I watch you guys eat this shit.

1012
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,260
But if that's what you want to do,
by all means go ahead and do it.

1013
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:31,820
But I'm not going to become a fucking
cow like most of you guys are.

1014
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,930
Okay.

1015
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,240
Yeah, no, I mean happy. You should
have bells around your fucking necks.

1016
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,910
All right. There you go. You
just right. We're right there.

1017
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,520
They'll never ask you for cake again.
You probably want to get invited,

1018
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,223
you know?

1019
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,320
Yeah.

1020
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,920
That's what fucking, uh, that's what
Sidney Crosby would dope. Right?

1021
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:49,880
Okay.

1022
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,560
Mario Lemieux the great ones,
they create space. No, dude,

1023
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:57,350
you're not a sociopath, right? You're
doing the right thing. You know,

1024
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,220
I dunno. I don't know why women like
sweet so much. You know, I actually,

1025
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:07,850
I like sweets. I'm just
a big fruit basket. Um,

1026
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,900
I actually like sweets, but when
I stay away from it for awhile,

1027
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:15,290
if you really abstain from
fucking desserts and everything,

1028
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,110
if you walk into a place that
has a bunch of crazy desserts,

1029
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,160
it doesn't even look like, like
edible for human consumption.

1030
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,880
You know what I mean? It looks, I
always said it looks like clown food.

1031
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,900
You know what I mean? I got clown sneezed,

1032
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,710
especially if it's really like a lot of
like fruits and fucking whipped cream

1033
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:36,230
and all of that shit just like
this. It looks ridiculous.

1034
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:40,820
It's all these crazy colors,
greens. And purples, right?

1035
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,410
You're doing the right thing.
There's all, I'm saying,

1036
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,920
you're doing the right thing. You
know, you're into bike racing,

1037
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,790
you're working out, you
know, this is the deal.

1038
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:49,940
Do you actually got a chance of bag and
bag in one of those fucking cake Eaton

1039
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,780
brides at you in your
section? Because they,

1040
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,910
they're going to see like a half of
them are probably just testing you.

1041
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,290
The other half are fucking probably
codependent fucking cake eaters and they

1042
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:05,570
feel guilty, you know? And they
know that after they eat that,

1043
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:08,540
then that sugar is going to be in their
veins and then they're going to go back

1044
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,180
to their desk and they're gonna start
eating a handful of fucking cheddar

1045
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:14,180
flavored goldfish to
shoving them down. You know?

1046
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,810
I bet if you walked around your little
section and you have your cubicles and

1047
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:21,360
you looked at their keyboards, I bet
they're keyboards are greasy, Huh?

1048
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,730
I bet there's crumbs in them. I don't
know. You know what I think? Yeah.

1049
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,630
I think you too. Good to work
there. What do think about that?

1050
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,300
That's what I got out of that
fucking letter. All right.

You have to watch her doing the song
cause she so beautifully like all right,

1113
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:07,540
I can deal with this, but I'm,
when it's just their voice,

1114
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,430
like you'd break up with the road
with the phone. What? Rianna yeah,

1115
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:18,020
she called me up and be like, yeah,

Sorry. All right, shut up.

1117
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,950
Don't judge me. I'm an hour in.
I'm out of jokes. That's why.

1118
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:30,370
So this guy works at this fucking office
and he's got into cycling and working

1119
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:31,870
out and nutrition and that type of thing.

1120
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:35,050
So there's like 15 people in his
little area of the office. So he goes,

1121
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,800
that means about at least once a
month he has to go down to the fucking

1122
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:42,970
cafeteria and sing happy birthday to
somebody and then they're passing around

1123
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:45,880
birthday cakes. So he always says
he doesn't want the birthday cake.

1124
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,710
And then they're like, uh oh you
would fuck a girl eating cake.

1125
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:53,920
You gotta eat it too or will
feel guilty. Yeah. And he's like,

1126
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:56,200
am I some sociopath that
I don't give a shit?

1127
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,420
Should I stick to my guns
or should I just have cake?

1128
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,120
Oh stick that you gotta stick to your
guns and you should tell people that

1129
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:05,600
you're on a diet. Cause people were
like, oh that's great. Yeah. You know,

1130
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:08,600
cause I had been really trying to lose
weight too. I mean obviously not today.

1131
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,550
And you know, they don't

1132
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,690
say that as they're about
ready to eat a piece of cake.

1133
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,420
What do you mean you can't
go into a crack house?

1134
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:17,120
And tell everybody that you got sober
and the crack heads are going to be like,

1135
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,593
ah, that's great.

1136
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,760
Well, I mean you can still urray but
you can still say no. None for me.

1137
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,470
I'm trying to, yeah,

1138
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:27,150
watch my weight and when they come back,
no, just have one piece. Then you go,

1139
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,043
hey

1140
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,020
fatty. Yes. I said no does
I know I'm really can.

1141
01:07:32,021 --> 01:07:35,620
I've been doing really well this
last month and I'm really, you know,

1142
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,840
I really feel good and I'm just, you know,

1143
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,060
just now don't put a
fucking peer pressure.

1144
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:44,140
Office offices are the worst for that
type of shit. When I worked in the office,

1145
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:46,840
yeah, it was always someone's
birthday. Someone's always like,

1146
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:49,870
I made brownies over the weekend and
I just like can have them at my house

1147
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:52,960
anymore. You guys eat them and it's, it's,

1148
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,820
it's hard cause everyone's just eating.

1149
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,980
You're sitting in a fucking
cubicle all day. You're

1150
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,620
word is shit. It's probably the
vending machine. I asked your question,

1151
01:08:00,621 --> 01:08:05,420
is it true that that bit bitches be
eaten when they're at the office?

1152
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,460
Why? Why? Why all

1153
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,520
bitches be eating the oil and the
female bitches all be eaten? Why? Why,

1154
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,600
why bitches be eating? Why
bitches be eaten? I don't know.

1155
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:19,130
BB Office

1156
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,190
environments are so hard to be
on a diet with cause it's, yeah,

1157
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:26,930
it's like food constantly cause it's
so fucking boring to sit there all day.

1158
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:31,700
You just eat, eat, eat, eat.
So no say no to the cake.

1159
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:35,720
All right, one last quick one. All right,
so I got to, speaking of that, this,

1160
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,050
this fatty cakes need to take her ass
to the gym. So he looked good to me.

1161
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,720
Thank you. But starting today,

1162
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,680
since I'm going to my
reunion starting today,

1163
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,330
why can't you get in shape
from me? Um, I mean I'm,

1164
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,740
yeah. S W

1165
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:56,460
why are you, first of all, don't try to
be like that. Hijack my health goals.

1166
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:58,020
It's not about you. Okay.

1167
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,350
About me. I had, you had spent in
there for a second. All right. You did.

1168
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,470
How do I help this guy out?
Help this guy out. All right,

1169
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,910
so we started backtracking
here in the podcast. All right.

1170
01:09:06,911 --> 01:09:10,030
I'm just going to paraphrase this.
A, the podcast got me in trouble.

1171
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,450
This dude's getting married in six
weeks. He's over his don't read it.

1172
01:09:13,451 --> 01:09:15,760
Just listen to me. I know I
heard you talking about it,

1173
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,480
but what did he say really loudly.
He, so they playing a card game. Yeah.

1174
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,010
He has the, the Trump card that's
going to fucking beat everybody. Right.

1175
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:27,940
And um, the name of it is,
is granny water w a d eight.

1176
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:30,060
So when he plays at epes Alaska,

1177
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,680
he slammed it down and nobody
listens to the police parents,

1178
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,380
his future in laws do not
listen to the podcast.

1179
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,410
And he just slammed it down and
he goes, I gotta, I gotta read it.

1180
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,460
He goes, it's

1181
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,470
granny fucking war.

1182
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:49,620
And it was just silence followed
as it echoed through the house.

1183
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:54,660
My fiance and family were stunned.
This, not super uptight people,

1184
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:58,150
but people just don't throw fucks around
during a board game, you know? Yeah.

1185
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,770
It only got worse is his
fiance tried to be, oh,

1186
01:10:01,771 --> 01:10:05,590
he listens to the podcast and just, yeah.
And she yelled at him the whole way.

1187
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,420
What you're doing to people, getting them
in trouble with their future in laws.

1188
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,260
I think you owe that young man apology.
I did apologize and I apologize.

1189
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:16,880
I made him a little fucking audio thing
that he could play the to is a in-laws.

1190
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,420
Oh, is it filled with you saying
fuck over and over again? Well,

1191
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:21,990
I had to know if that was going to help,

1192
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,200
but I had to do it in a way
that they like, you know?

1193
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,490
So what a bad influence on, oh, it's
just a silly awkward moment. It's fine.

1194
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:34,290
Everyone will get over it. That's okay.
It's funny story though. All right,

1195
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:38,910
so what are you doing at the gym today?
Back in tries, nods like that today,

1196
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:43,830
which I'm not looking forward to women
always be doing the legs. Okay, I'm done.

1197
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:47,010
Why women be doing their legs? Yes.

1198
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,570
Oh for fuck sakes. Jesus,

1199
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:53,560
you spilled the watts lead
glasses of water on the floor.

1200
01:10:53,561 --> 01:10:55,660
I tell you this all the fucking time.

1201
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:58,960
You're always leaving glasses of water
on the floor and this is what happened.

1202
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:02,200
How many times would we do you not go for
a glass of water because you put it on

1203
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:03,520
the floor? How many times

1204
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,070
are you done? Are you done? Yes, I'm done.

1205
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,410
Can you say sorry for
spilling the water in here?

1206
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,940
I'm sorry for spilling your water,
but also, no, there's no bugs.

1207
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,150
There's no buts in a, sorry.
You read the, sorry. You're not,

1208
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,510

I'll see you on Thursday.
