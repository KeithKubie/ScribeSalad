00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Obviously these two criteria are in conflict to each other.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In reality, what we do is minimize both, and you do that with some sort of a weight, alpha,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which you can play with in the code.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The stronger alpha, the smoother the path.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The smaller alpha, the more we retain the original points.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here's my next question. Suppose we optimize both at the same time with an appropriate alpha?

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What do we get? An original path, a smooth path, or no path?
