what led to the military commissions Act

version of those military commissions so
my first exposure to the military

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
my first exposure to the military
 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.379
my first exposure to the military
commissions was in 2009 when I was 2001

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389
commissions was in 2009 when I was 2001
 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.379
commissions was in 2009 when I was 2001
and I was still a student and obviously

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389
and I was still a student and obviously
 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.989
and I was still a student and obviously
at that point it wasn't really clear in

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999
at that point it wasn't really clear in
 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.660
at that point it wasn't really clear in
November of 2001 who would end up being

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
November of 2001 who would end up being
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.580
November of 2001 who would end up being
a defendant in those military

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590
a defendant in those military
 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.870
a defendant in those military
commissions it was sort of like the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
commissions it was sort of like the
 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.179
commissions it was sort of like the
structure that was created but you know

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189
structure that was created but you know
 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.469
structure that was created but you know
who would be processed through the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
who would be processed through the
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.819
who would be processed through the
structure at that point was still

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829
structure at that point was still
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.199
structure at that point was still
unclear to me

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209
unclear to me
 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.050
unclear to me
I think everyone assumed that people

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
I think everyone assumed that people
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.279
I think everyone assumed that people
were captured in the course of

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289
were captured in the course of
 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.230
were captured in the course of
hostilities in Afghanistan perhaps the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240
hostilities in Afghanistan perhaps the
 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720
hostilities in Afghanistan perhaps the
individuals who were suspected of being

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
individuals who were suspected of being
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.320
individuals who were suspected of being
responsible for the attacks on 9/11

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
responsible for the attacks on 9/11
 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.180
responsible for the attacks on 9/11
would be you know candidates to me for

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
would be you know candidates to me for
 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.250
would be you know candidates to me for
trial by military commission it did

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
trial by military commission it did
 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.559
trial by military commission it did
strike me as odd that sort of an

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569
strike me as odd that sort of an
 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.900
strike me as odd that sort of an
exceptional structure was created thus

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
exceptional structure was created thus
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.780
exceptional structure was created thus
in the same way I guess that that I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
in the same way I guess that that I
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.680
in the same way I guess that that I
was having a hard time accepting the the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690
was having a hard time accepting the the
 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.340
was having a hard time accepting the the
war paradigm I mean I remember well I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350
war paradigm I mean I remember well I
 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.710
war paradigm I mean I remember well I
think yeah you know the the notion that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
think yeah you know the the notion that
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.030
think yeah you know the the notion that
the 9/11 attacks were an act of war I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
the 9/11 attacks were an act of war I
 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.520
the 9/11 attacks were an act of war I
think was a notion that was very quickly

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
think was a notion that was very quickly
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.040
think was a notion that was very quickly
put out there by you know within

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
put out there by you know within
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.860
put out there by you know within
political spheres I think it was the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
political spheres I think it was the
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.900
political spheres I think it was the
immediate reaction of folks within the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
immediate reaction of folks within the
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.690
immediate reaction of folks within the
Department of Defense of course they're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700
Department of Defense of course they're
 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.760
Department of Defense of course they're
conditioned to interpret events in that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770
conditioned to interpret events in that
 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.010
conditioned to interpret events in that
way because of their own training and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
way because of their own training and
 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.949
way because of their own training and
professional background as military

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959
professional background as military
 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.590
professional background as military
people but I think very quickly even

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600
people but I think very quickly even
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.130
people but I think very quickly even
within civilians fears of our political

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
within civilians fears of our political
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.420
within civilians fears of our political
leadership that view was adopted it was

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430
leadership that view was adopted it was
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.670
leadership that view was adopted it was
publicized through the media and it was

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
publicized through the media and it was
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.430
publicized through the media and it was
very quickly accepted by journalists

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440
very quickly accepted by journalists
 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.410
very quickly accepted by journalists
commentators analysts and the public

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
commentators analysts and the public
 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.270
commentators analysts and the public
that that notion was so quickly accepted

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280
that that notion was so quickly accepted
 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.500
that that notion was so quickly accepted
was was troubling to me because I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510
was was troubling to me because I
 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.010
was was troubling to me because I
thought I thought it deserved more

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020
thought I thought it deserved more
 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.229
thought I thought it deserved more
reflection and debate because it's

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
reflection and debate because it's
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.380
reflection and debate because it's
really it is really a significant shift

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390
really it is really a significant shift
 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.860
really it is really a significant shift
and I think had had the attacks on 9/11

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870
and I think had had the attacks on 9/11
 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.440
and I think had had the attacks on 9/11
been treated as you know perhaps a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450
been treated as you know perhaps a
 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020
been treated as you know perhaps a
particularly tragic and horrendously

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030
particularly tragic and horrendously
 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.320
particularly tragic and horrendously
successful criminal action then the

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330
successful criminal action then the
 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.880
successful criminal action then the
course of history would have would have

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890
course of history would have would have
 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.310
course of history would have would have
been very different the fact that very

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320
been very different the fact that very
 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.150
been very different the fact that very
early on they were just you know

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160
early on they were just you know
 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.979
early on they were just you know
relatively unquestioningly accepted as

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989
relatively unquestioningly accepted as
 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.470
relatively unquestioningly accepted as
an act of war and that the war paradigm

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480
an act of war and that the war paradigm
 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.380
an act of war and that the war paradigm
was it was a really question to

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390
was it was a really question to
 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.810
was it was a really question to
interrogate it significantly by you know

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820
interrogate it significantly by you know
 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.850
interrogate it significantly by you know
the elected representation being on the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860
the elected representation being on the
 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.660
the elected representation being on the
hill or by or by the intelligentsia and

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670
hill or by or by the intelligentsia and
 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.210
hill or by or by the intelligentsia and
the academy and commentators and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220
the academy and commentators and
 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.190
the academy and commentators and
analysts and reporters I think that set

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200
analysts and reporters I think that set
 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.000
analysts and reporters I think that set
us on a path that we're still on today

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010
us on a path that we're still on today
 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.130
us on a path that we're still on today
so so very early on for the same reason

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140
so so very early on for the same reason
 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.280
so so very early on for the same reason
that I that I had some doubts about the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290
that I that I had some doubts about the
 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.550
that I that I had some doubts about the
wisdom or propriety of the war framing

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560
wisdom or propriety of the war framing
 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.920
wisdom or propriety of the war framing
for for this particular historical event

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930

international law but I think as a
 

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.680
international law but I think as a

because they can hit the reset button as

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920
because they can hit the reset button as
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.920
because they can hit the reset button as
many times as they want to obviously

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:51.930
many times as they want to obviously
 

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.629

they took advantage of that and so they
 

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:55.610
they took advantage of that and so they
basically pulled the plug on their own

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620
basically pulled the plug on their own
 

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.470
basically pulled the plug on their own

what's it was one thing that was

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040
what's it was one thing that was
 

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.560
what's it was one thing that was
interesting to note and this also

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.570
interesting to note and this also
 

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.519
interesting to note and this also
illustrates sort of how the Military

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:22.529
illustrates sort of how the Military
 

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:25.639
illustrates sort of how the Military
Commission system by design it was set

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:25.649
Commission system by design it was set
 

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:28.699
Commission system by design it was set
up to favor the prosecution even more

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:28.709
up to favor the prosecution even more
 

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.949
up to favor the prosecution even more
shows yeah even more so than any other I

00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959
shows yeah even more so than any other I
 

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.740
shows yeah even more so than any other I
mean I don't I'm very critical of the

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:33.750
mean I don't I'm very critical of the
 

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.620
mean I don't I'm very critical of the
way that the articles we like the

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:36.630
way that the articles we like the
 

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.870
way that the articles we like the
federal courts function and even the way

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880
federal courts function and even the way
 

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.750
federal courts function and even the way
state courts function in criminal cases

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:40.760
state courts function in criminal cases
 

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.980
state courts function in criminal cases
but you know even if you look at just

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:42.990
but you know even if you look at just
 

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.889
but you know even if you look at just
how federal courts function and you know

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899
how federal courts function and you know
 

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:49.040
how federal courts function and you know
so-called terrorism trials it's hugely

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.050
so-called terrorism trials it's hugely
 

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.540
so-called terrorism trials it's hugely
problematic and we can have a completely

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:50.550
problematic and we can have a completely
 

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.220
problematic and we can have a completely
separate conversation about that but the

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.230
separate conversation about that but the
 

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.199
separate conversation about that but the
military commissions stack the odds in

00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:54.209
military commissions stack the odds in
 

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:56.180
military commissions stack the odds in
the prosecution's favor even even higher

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.190
the prosecution's favor even even higher
 

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.150
the prosecution's favor even even higher
I mean the it's a it's a system that is

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160
I mean the it's a it's a system that is
 

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.850
I mean the it's a it's a system that is
that was designed to produce convictions

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860
that was designed to produce convictions
 

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.769
that was designed to produce convictions
over justice it is designed to offer

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779
over justice it is designed to offer
 

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:06.560
over justice it is designed to offer
prosecutors all sorts of shortcuts it is

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:06.570
prosecutors all sorts of shortcuts it is
 

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.920
prosecutors all sorts of shortcuts it is
designed to protect the secrecy that the

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:09.930
designed to protect the secrecy that the
 

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.740
designed to protect the secrecy that the
government wants to protect so secret

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:12.750
government wants to protect so secret
 

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.949
government wants to protect so secret
evidence can be used coerced evidence

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959
evidence can be used coerced evidence
 

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.829
evidence can be used coerced evidence
can be used the accused can be excluded

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839
can be used the accused can be excluded
 

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:20.930
can be used the accused can be excluded
from their own proceedings in many ways

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940
from their own proceedings in many ways
 

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.790
from their own proceedings in many ways
sometimes you know it's argue I think

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800
sometimes you know it's argue I think
 

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.290
sometimes you know it's argue I think
the prosecutors might argue sometimes

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300
the prosecutors might argue sometimes
 

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.840
the prosecutors might argue sometimes
that they can proceed ex parte excluding

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:26.850
that they can proceed ex parte excluding
 

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.050
that they can proceed ex parte excluding
even defense lawyers so it's really it's

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060
even defense lawyers so it's really it's
 

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.030
even defense lawyers so it's really it's
really a system that offers the

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040
really a system that offers the
 

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.019
really a system that offers the
prosecution

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:33.029
prosecution
 

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:36.170
prosecution
all sorts of shortcuts the most

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180
all sorts of shortcuts the most
 

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.329
all sorts of shortcuts the most
important I think function of the

extreme form of sort of coercion you can
 

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.299
extreme form of sort of coercion you can
think sort of the next lowest thing

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:17.309
think sort of the next lowest thing
 

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:19.039

the decision about whether it's you know
if it's probative enough in his view it

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:12.279
if it's probative enough in his view it
 

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.340
if it's probative enough in his view it
can be admitted it can be used and so

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:14.350
can be admitted it can be used and so
 

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.380
can be admitted it can be used and so
that's even even where the military

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:16.390
that's even even where the military
 

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.940
that's even even where the military
commissions pay lip service to the

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:17.950
commissions pay lip service to the
 

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.549

and when you look at the practice of it

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360
and when you look at the practice of it
 

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.720
and when you look at the practice of it
it vests the military judge with a great

it vests the military judge with a great
 

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.610
it vests the military judge with a great
deal of discretion and that's

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:32.620
deal of discretion and that's
 

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.760
deal of discretion and that's
complicated I mean I think what would

troubling that is is when you look at
 

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:41.279
troubling that is is when you look at
the military commission rules there are

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:41.289
the military commission rules there are
 

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:42.960
the military commission rules there are

like electric flow or the air
 

00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:21.190

so going back to but in terms of like
well we were taught we started with the

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:18.429
well we were taught we started with the
 

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:20.940
well we were taught we started with the
Commission's you feel like we've sort of

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:20.950
Commission's you feel like we've sort of
 

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.350
Commission's you feel like we've sort of
covered that enough for we can keep

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360
covered that enough for we can keep
 

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.090
covered that enough for we can keep
going on the Commission's if you want to

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.100
going on the Commission's if you want to
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.090
going on the Commission's if you want to
it's up to you I mean if you have other

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:27.100
it's up to you I mean if you have other
 

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.680
it's up to you I mean if you have other
you know questions about the

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:28.690
you know questions about the
 

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.150
you know questions about the
Commission's or if you'd rather move on

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.160
Commission's or if you'd rather move on
 

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.970
Commission's or if you'd rather move on
completed defer to you well you talked

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:32.980
completed defer to you well you talked
 

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:39.690
completed defer to you well you talked
about how he is he's basically just just

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:39.700
about how he is he's basically just just
 

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.760
about how he is he's basically just just
languishing now he's waiting for the

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:41.770
languishing now he's waiting for the
 

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.960
languishing now he's waiting for the
convening authority to do something with

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:45.970
convening authority to do something with
 

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.789
convening authority to do something with
the charges that are before him you know

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799
the charges that are before him you know
 

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:51.810
the charges that are before him you know
so he's basically in a in a state of

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:51.820
so he's basically in a in a state of
 

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.480
so he's basically in a in a state of
legal limbo and has been for a while

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:54.490
legal limbo and has been for a while
 

00:24:54.490 --> 00:25:00.830
legal limbo and has been for a while
yeah right so so what's next for for him

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840
yeah right so so what's next for for him
 

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.419
yeah right so so what's next for for him
yeah I think I think that there really

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:03.429
yeah I think I think that there really
 

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:05.220
yeah I think I think that there really
isn't much I can say this is exactly the

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.230
isn't much I can say this is exactly the
 

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.010
isn't much I can say this is exactly the
question he'll ask him you know it's

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.020
question he'll ask him you know it's
 

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.780
question he'll ask him you know it's
really it's really sort of out of our

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:09.790
really it's really sort of out of our
 

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.230
really it's really sort of out of our
control

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240
control
 

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.360
control
and in a normal court system we would

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:12.370
and in a normal court system we would
 

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.560
and in a normal court system we would
have been able to say look there's uh

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.570
have been able to say look there's uh
 

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.409
have been able to say look there's uh
there's a speedy trial clock that has

00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:16.419
there's a speedy trial clock that has
 

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:19.470
there's a speedy trial clock that has
won and so now we can go to a court and

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480
won and so now we can go to a court and
 

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.210
won and so now we can go to a court and
ask for you to be released they're not

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:21.220
ask for you to be released they're not
 

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.490
ask for you to be released they're not
gonna charge you but that's simply not

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:23.500
gonna charge you but that's simply not
 

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.690
gonna charge you but that's simply not
the way it works here because the

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:24.700
the way it works here because the
 

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.010
the way it works here because the
government can have it both ways again

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:26.020
government can have it both ways again
 

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.220
government can have it both ways again
going back to sort of that earliest

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:28.230
going back to sort of that earliest
 

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.780
going back to sort of that earliest
moment that earliest sort of bifurcation

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:30.790
moment that earliest sort of bifurcation
 

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.090
moment that earliest sort of bifurcation
in the world when we went down the warp

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:33.100
in the world when we went down the warp
 

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.590
in the world when we went down the warp
sort of paradigm path I think given that

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600
sort of paradigm path I think given that
 

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.799
sort of paradigm path I think given that
that's where we are now the government

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:40.809
that's where we are now the government
 

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:43.919
that's where we are now the government
can always fall back on continued

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:43.929
can always fall back on continued
 

00:25:43.929 --> 00:25:46.770
can always fall back on continued
indefinite imprisonment under their

indefinite imprisonment under their
interpretation of the law of war making

00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:49.419
interpretation of the law of war making

interpretation of the law of war making
the men in Guantanamo in their view in

the men in Guantanamo in their view in
 

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.480
the men in Guantanamo in their view in
the government's view detain a Boleyn

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:54.490
the government's view detain a Boleyn
 

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.990
the government's view detain a Boleyn
told the end of hostilities that have

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000
told the end of hostilities that have
 

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.159
told the end of hostilities that have
you know they're very hard to define

00:25:59.159 --> 00:25:59.169
you know they're very hard to define
 

00:25:59.169 --> 00:26:01.049
you know they're very hard to define
right because they're not geographically

00:26:01.049 --> 00:26:01.059
right because they're not geographically
 

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:04.230
right because they're not geographically
or temporally limited I'm sure there are

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240
or temporally limited I'm sure there are
 

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.730
or temporally limited I'm sure there are
some actors in government who would say

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:05.740
some actors in government who would say
 

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.260
some actors in government who would say
you know even after the end of

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.270
you know even after the end of
 

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.080
you know even after the end of
hostilities in Afghanistan

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.090
hostilities in Afghanistan
 

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.630
hostilities in Afghanistan
the conflict still won't be over and so

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640
the conflict still won't be over and so
 

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.630
the conflict still won't be over and so
so it's really unclear but again within

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640
so it's really unclear but again within
 

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.240
so it's really unclear but again within
that war paradigm the government has a

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.250
that war paradigm the government has a
 

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.890
that war paradigm the government has a
host of options and I think that's

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900
host of options and I think that's
 

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.650
host of options and I think that's
what's really dangerous the ability of

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:20.660
what's really dangerous the ability of
 

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.410
what's really dangerous the ability of
the the ability of the government to

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:24.420
the the ability of the government to
 

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.520
the the ability of the government to
toggle between these different modes of

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.530
toggle between these different modes of
 

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.560
toggle between these different modes of
state violence so the fact that the

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:30.570
state violence so the fact that the
 

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.080
state violence so the fact that the
government has a range of options at its

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.090
government has a range of options at its
 

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.400
government has a range of options at its
disposal you know that that are

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:37.410
disposal you know that that are
 

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.640
disposal you know that that are
reflected in what we now know is the

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:40.650
reflected in what we now know is the
 

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.110
reflected in what we now know is the
government calls the disposition matrix

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120

imprisoned at Bagram in Afghanistan

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:20.990
imprisoned at Bagram in Afghanistan
 

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.720
imprisoned at Bagram in Afghanistan
because it's a theater of war and

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:22.730
because it's a theater of war and
 

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.760
because it's a theater of war and
irrespective of the fact that those men

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:24.770
irrespective of the fact that those men
 

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.349
irrespective of the fact that those men
were brought into that theater of war

00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359
were brought into that theater of war
 

00:53:26.359 --> 00:53:28.599
were brought into that theater of war
man like Amina Buckley were brought into

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:28.609
man like Amina Buckley were brought into
 

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:30.130
man like Amina Buckley were brought into
that theater of war by the United States

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.140
that theater of war by the United States
 

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.020
that theater of war by the United States
so they will continue to make that

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:32.030
so they will continue to make that
 

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:34.059
so they will continue to make that
argument that's the exact it's very

00:53:34.059 --> 00:53:34.069
argument that's the exact it's very
 

00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:35.290
argument that's the exact it's very
similar to the argument that the Bush

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:35.300
similar to the argument that the Bush
 

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.910
similar to the argument that the Bush
administration made as to Guantanamo

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920
administration made as to Guantanamo
 

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.510
administration made as to Guantanamo
saying hey no jurisdiction of Guantanamo

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520
saying hey no jurisdiction of Guantanamo
 

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.520
saying hey no jurisdiction of Guantanamo
so when you think about that I think it

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:42.530
so when you think about that I think it
 

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.290
so when you think about that I think it
really highlights the fact that the

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:44.300
really highlights the fact that the
 

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.569
really highlights the fact that the
Obama administration wants to preserve

00:53:46.569 --> 00:53:46.579
Obama administration wants to preserve
 

00:53:46.579 --> 00:53:48.370
Obama administration wants to preserve
that option wants to preserve the option

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:48.380
that option wants to preserve the option
 

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.690
that option wants to preserve the option
of being able to hold people

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:49.700
of being able to hold people
 

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.290
of being able to hold people
indefinitely without charge even if it

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:53.300
indefinitely without charge even if it
 

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.660
indefinitely without charge even if it
brought those people into a theater of

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:55.670
brought those people into a theater of
 

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.700
brought those people into a theater of
hostilities man and that's a really

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:57.710
hostilities man and that's a really
 

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:02.500
hostilities man and that's a really
radical notion that that that a

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:02.510
radical notion that that that a
 

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.790
radical notion that that that a
government can kidnap someone from

is legal that's all we want to do but
 

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.860
is legal that's all we want to do but
we're still at the threshold we're still

trying to get through the door and the
 

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.490
trying to get through the door and the
Obama administration is taking a

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:54.500
Obama administration is taking a
 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.320
Obama administration is taking a
position that is virtually

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:56.330
position that is virtually
 

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.910
position that is virtually
indistinguishable from the position that

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920
indistinguishable from the position that
 

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.440
indistinguishable from the position that
the Bush administration took over a

of Guantanamo yeah I mean I certainly I

01:08:06.859 --> 01:08:06.869
of Guantanamo yeah I mean I certainly I
 

01:08:06.869 --> 01:08:10.280
of Guantanamo yeah I mean I certainly I
certainly hope not and it isn't you know

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:10.290
certainly hope not and it isn't you know
 

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:13.060
certainly hope not and it isn't you know
I say that not because I I think

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.070
I say that not because I I think
 

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:15.500
I say that not because I I think
Guantanamo is so uniquely horrible right

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:15.510
Guantanamo is so uniquely horrible right
 

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:17.180

I mean I that's not why I'm saying yeah

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.190
I mean I that's not why I'm saying yeah
 

01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:19.789
I mean I that's not why I'm saying yeah
like I said I mean I think even if the

01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799
like I said I mean I think even if the
 

01:08:19.799 --> 01:08:23.180
like I said I mean I think even if the
facility were to shut down tomorrow one

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:23.190
facility were to shut down tomorrow one
 

01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:25.370

so the question whether this particular

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:37.770
so the question whether this particular

so the question whether this particular
facility of Guantanamo Bay Cuba is going

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380
facility of Guantanamo Bay Cuba is going
 

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.890
facility of Guantanamo Bay Cuba is going
to close today in a year in two years

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900
to close today in a year in two years
 

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:43.940
to close today in a year in two years
and five and ten

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:43.950
and five and ten
 

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:49.360
and five and ten
in that perspective becomes somewhat

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:49.370
in that perspective becomes somewhat
 

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:53.660
in that perspective becomes somewhat
somewhat inconsequential and that's

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:53.670
somewhat inconsequential and that's
 

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:55.820
somewhat inconsequential and that's
that's a you know for someone who's

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:55.830
that's a you know for someone who's
 

01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:59.210
that's a you know for someone who's
worked so long on these cases and on

01:10:59.210 --> 01:10:59.220
worked so long on these cases and on
 

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.460
worked so long on these cases and on
these issues it's it's kind of an odd

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:01.470
these issues it's it's kind of an odd
 

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:06.080
these issues it's it's kind of an odd
thing to say okay thanks
