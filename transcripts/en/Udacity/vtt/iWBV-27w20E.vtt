00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.270
It's possible to get through this
program with relatively little

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.010
interaction with your classmates.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.850
Most classes don't require forum
participation, few classes have group

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.280
projects, and you don't have to get
involved with the social communities.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.190
But we really recommend
you do these things.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.490
One of the biggest assets of this
program is the students themselves.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.840
You'll be in classes with scientists,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.350
executives, influential
people from around the world,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.390
and they'll have unique insights and
perspectives into your work.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.000
So while you're in this program,
take advantage of this resource.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.935
Interact on the forums, interact on
the social communities, get to know your

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:31.530
classmates..h And take advantage of
access to this very unique student body.
