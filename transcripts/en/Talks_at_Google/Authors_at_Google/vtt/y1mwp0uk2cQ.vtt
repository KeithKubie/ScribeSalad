DAVID ALLISON:
We're here today at

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.360
Google to talk with Elliot Peper
about his new book, "Cumulus."

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.520
My name is David Allison.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.270
I'm a product lead on a
product here at Google.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.030
And this is--

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.488
RICK KLAU: I'm Rick Klau, former
product manager at Google,

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:15.155
now a partner at
Google Ventures.

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:16.780
DAVID ALLISON: And
this is Eliot Peper.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.870
Maybe we can start with just a
brief description of "Cumulus"

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.122
and what it is, when it came
out, and why you wrote it.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:28.280
ELIOT PEPER: Sure.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.260
"Cumulus" is my fourth novel.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.870
It's a standalone story.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.220
And it's a science
fiction story that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.440
takes place in a
near-future Bay Area

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.170
that's ravaged by
economic inequality

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.440
and persistent surveillance.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.790
So you could think of it
as where we are right now,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.380
but mapped out a few decades.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.260
And it came out just
about six weeks ago.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.670
So came out in the
beginning of May.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.650
And I've actually been really
surprised with the response,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.630
so it's been fun.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.670
The story seems
to be resonating.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.742
And so it's been a delight
to hear from readers.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:03.200
And it's fun to
talk about it here.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.990
In terms of where
the book came from,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.121
or I guess the idea for
the story came from,

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:11.620
I guess it's sort
of like the X-Men.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.300
Every book or every story
has its own origin story.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.800
And this one was really--
I moved back to Oakland 2

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.500
and 1/2 years ago after
spending a long time elsewhere.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.450
So I was living in
Southern California

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.010
and in East Asia, in Taiwan.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.559
And when we moved
back to Oakland,

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.600
we just realized it was
a really interesting time

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.410
to be living in the Bay Area.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.200
So I grew up in Oakland
and was raised there,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.760
and so it was fun to return
and see what had changed

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.290
and what was the same.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.620
And like all of us who live
in the Bay Area are probably

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.230
experiencing, there's
been a huge economic boom

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.910
here that has had many
wonderful, wonderful effects

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.040
on the Bay Area.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.010
And that manifested itself in
our neighborhood and new art

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.220
studios popping up all over the
place, new restaurants, lots

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.520
of excitement.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.330
Renaissance areas
in downtown that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.070
had been honestly
blight for many years

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.470
are now being redeveloped.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.420
At the same time, it
was a little weird

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.600
because we live on a
nice, residential street.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.200
There are kids
trundling up and down it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.824
on tricycles pretty frequently.

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:23.740
We have a lot of families
in our neighborhood.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.440
And we also have a lot of crime.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.050
So we have regular
shootings on our block.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.160
And I was walking with my
wife back home from BART

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.520
a few weeks ago, and there
was a drive-by shooting

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.630
40 feet behind us.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.180
So we were literally dodging
behind the nearest brick

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.900
wall we could find.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.002
And it was also-- I
mean, it was terrifying.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:51.460
But it was also
really interesting,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.000
because the nearest wall we
could find was a doorway.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.020
It was like a nook that
went into a doorway,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.857
and whoever lived there opened
it up to see what had happened.

00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:03.190
They were like, are those shots?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.898
We're like, yeah.

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:05.670
The car was screeching
away right there.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.336
And they're, do you
want to come inside?

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:11.080
So we accepted
immediately out of terror.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.980
And it actually ended
up being wonderful.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.000
We got to know them.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.880
We hung out for 45 minutes.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.190
So it's a really
interesting moment

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.570
to be living, I think, in
the Bay Area right now,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.840
just because it's a little
bit of a microcosm of some

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.490
of the issues that we're all
wrestling with, in our larger

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.090
American society and
even beyond that.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.250
We're really at the center
of the world in terms

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.020
of all these wonderful
new technological marvels

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.410
that we're inventing and
getting out into the world.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.860
And that means a
real economic boom.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.770
But at the same
time, we're really

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.680
continuing to wrestle with
many of the same social issues

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.420
in terms of endemic
poverty, racism,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.100
all of that kind of stuff
that for some reason

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.350
we haven't been able
to solve for, I guess.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.680
And so that, I
think, was what got

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.530
me interested in thinking
about these issues

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.260
and what was the
seed of this story.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.620
RICK KLAU: So talk a
little bit more about that.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.350
How much of the story
at its inception

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.700
starts out with an
intention to communicate

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.190
a particular caution
or worry versus you've

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.230
got some technology that you
want to extrapolate from.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.580
Where could this go?

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.530
How much did you know
about how the story ended?

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.650
And I'm trying to avoid
giving any spoilers out

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.190
for those that haven't read it.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.650
But I think it's
interesting that you touch

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.150
on specifically, issues
of inequality in Oakland

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.750
and factions that
develop, where Oakland

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.600
becomes the literal frontline
of a battle between two

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.150
different forces.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.920
Did you go in with
that in mind, or was

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.665
that how the story found
itself as you fleshed it out?

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.480
ELIOT PEPER: I don't think I
had it that clear in my head.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.670
What was in my head was
more, what if we mapped

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.820
some of these technologies out
a little further into the future

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.800
and then combined that with what
if the US had a similar wealth

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.340
disparity to Mexico City?

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.890
So I've spent quite a bit of
time in the developing world.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.570
And so returning to the
US, I was like, huh, what

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.860
if that got much more extreme?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.560
And so I think that was
the set up for the world.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.310
But the story is actually
a different answer,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.950
because I found that at
least in any of the books

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.340
I've worked on, the
seed that starts

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.650
this book is not necessarily
the same for each one.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.610
So and in this case,
it was this idea

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.240
of these conflicts that
we're all struggling with

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.920
and these big, high level, world
level technology questions.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.880
But then once you actually
decide to write a book, like,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.380
I could written an
essay about those ideas,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.520
just with those ideas.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.020
But an essay is very
different from a novel.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.070
And so for "Cumulus,"
really, my first steps

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.610
on the creative front were,
who is this book about?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.940
And it's really much
more about the characters

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.850
and what they're thinking
about internally,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.580
where they're coming from,
because you only experience

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.630
the world through their eyes.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.020
So there are many
things that could

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.290
be developed in this
world that never were

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.259
in the book,
because they weren't

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.800
relevant to the characters or
the characters never interacted

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.830
with that.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.360
So I really think that if
you're giving a TED talk

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.031
or writing an essay, you can
talk about ideas in a pure way.

00:06:51.031 --> 00:06:54.300
You're just literally talking
about the idea you have.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.680
But when you're telling
a story, human stories

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.950
are really about people.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.520
So I always try to come out
from that angle of what's

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.960
relevant to these
individual people

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.130
and how are they
living in that world.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.200
And then to close that
out, one of the things

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.460
that I find interesting about
these kinds of stories that's

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.480
very different than a
TED talk or an essay

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:21.840
is that with fiction,
you don't have to provide

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.780
prescriptive answers to things.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.710
Like, if I read
an essay, I'm sort

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.360
of expecting that the writer of
the essay has a point to make.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.530
If they don't have
a punchy conclusion,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.580
I'm going to be sort
of disappointed.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.120
But with a novel, I think
one of the interesting things

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.360
about novels as a
medium is that you're

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.580
able to wrestle with
difficult questions

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.480
without feeling-- without
necessarily reaching a really

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.820
pretty, packaged
conclusion at the end,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.630
because honestly, we're all
wrestling with this stuff.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:04.794
So I guess that's sort
of how I think about it.

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:09.660
RICK KLAU: So you continue
to do work in venture capital

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.250
while also being
a novelist, which

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.670
as someone in venture
capital, I can't imagine

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.910
having both of those jobs.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.960
But I do see one of the
interesting intersections

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.550
in that you're frequently
going to come into contact

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.580
with ideas, new
technology, companies

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.530
very early in their trajectory.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.000
How do you make an decision
about the technology

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.789
that you want to
invest in or see

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.720
exist in the world
versus the technology

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.890
you want to write about?

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.900
Is it binary?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.429
And with a great
idea, do you want

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.179
to hold onto it so you
can write about it?

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.090
Do you want to invest in
it and not write about it?

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.765
How do you wrestle with that?

00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.980
ELIOT PEPER: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.030
I don't know that I've ever
been faced with the choice of,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.610
am I going to make an investment
decision about something

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.270
that could create a
novel that I would write.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.670
That would be
pretty interesting.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.440
RICK KLAU: Get
your pitches ready.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.650
ELIOT PEPER: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.140
I think that there is
a lot of similarities

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.980
on how I approach thinking about
both kinds of work, though.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.570
When you're an entrepreneur
or when you're a writer,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.310
typically-- well,
actually, this is

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.700
more common for entrepreneurs.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.520
Often, entrepreneurs
are motivated

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.990
by solving a problem
that they experience,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.870
or at least that they
see in the world.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.950
So something sucks for
you, so you're like,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.540
I can make this
stop sucking for me

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.960
and maybe there are other
people like me who would-- heck,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.830
maybe they'd even be
willing to pay to help

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.960
solve this problem as well.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.730
So you're building a
tool to address that.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.720
And so that's really
important, and I

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.030
think that's where many of our
greatest companies come from.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.290
They come from this very
almost intimate moment

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.950
of figuring out that there
is something in your life

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.280
that is frustrating you and then
figuring out how to address it.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.060
What's interesting about looking
at a lot of entrepreneurs

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.630
working on different
problems is trying

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.330
to see how they fit
into the bigger picture.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.460
And that, I think, has a
lot in common with writing

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.270
science fiction specifically.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.240
Because when you're thinking
about making an investment

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.430
decision in a startup
that is highly-- I mean,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.680
by definition
really speculative--

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.940
you're not going to
have years of company

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.150
financials to look at.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.690
At least if it's an early
stage company, a lot of it

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.370
is about what is the future
you're trying to build

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.610
and how does that fit
into how we already

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.050
understand the world.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.150
And so I think that when you're
making investment decisions

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.900
in technology startups, one
of the most useful things

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.140
that I've found to think
about is actually more

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.450
like the history of science.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:01.600
So if you look back
and think about what

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.154
the world was like before
the car was invented,

00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:06.070
it was a huge problem.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.130
In New York City, the biggest
social problem in the US

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.510
was manure, because horses
were how you got around

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.660
and they pooped everywhere.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.990
And so it made basically
urban living untenable.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.295
And people were projecting,
famous sociologists

00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:25.670
were projecting
that nobody would

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.010
live in cities because this was
a completely insoluble problem.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.380
And then you have this
thing that just came out

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.820
of left field that totally
changes all of the assumptions

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.935
that we sort of bring
to bear in our lives

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:42.060
and don't even think about.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.310
And so that's certainly
relevant for science fiction,

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.470
because if you're
writing science fiction,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.650
you're trying to think
about how the world might

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.160
be different in a way that sheds
a bit of a different reflection

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.850
on the world we
currently live in.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.690
And if you're making investment
decisions in new technologies,

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.050
that's where those
big changes come from.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.900
And so really, being able to--
I feel like being a good science

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.900
fiction writer and perhaps,
you'd know better than me,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.150
but making good startup
investments, a lot of it

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.230
is about actually reducing
the levels of the assumption

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.250
that you bring to the
world, like actually

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:27.330
trying to approach things almost
as if it's for the first time.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.600
And I also think
that that's part

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.570
of what science fiction
brings to readers.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.250
So I love reading
science fiction in part

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.080
because when I come
back to my normal life

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.220
and I look at the
things I'm dealing with,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.030
I do it with a new perspective.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.640
It's put my brain into a
different pair of pants.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.050
And now when I'm back,
I can be, like, oh, OK.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.200
Maybe I shouldn't
make that assumption

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.020
that I've always made.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.890
And I think that that is
really relevant for anybody

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.510
doing venture investing, because
those are the opportunities

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.482
you're trying to seek out.

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:03.190
DAVID ALLISON: So
without giving too much

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.580
away in "Cumulus," some of those
ideas are actually explored,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.100
right?

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.840
You have this notion of fleet,
autonomous vehicle service.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.770
And you have a few
other things in there

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:22.040
that maybe bend lines a
little bit in terms of privacy

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.350
and that kind of thing.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.900
And I'm curious to talk
with you a little bit

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.930
about your perspective on what
are the major changes that you

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.593
see coming, say, in the
next 5 or 10 or 15 years.

00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:38.450
ELIOT PEPER: I, and I think
most people are pretty

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.840
bad at predicting the future.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.630
So I always think
about it more as,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.630
how can you think differently
about the present.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.150
So some of the things
that went into "Cumulus"

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.710
were that often, when
we look at the internet,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.920
we think about the
individual components of it.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.230
So here we might be thinking
about Google and YouTube

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.790
or Spotify or now
Microsoft LinkedIn

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.280
or whatever you
want to talk about.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.600
There are all of these
different essentially brands

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.960
that we associate with
sections of the internet.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.240
But what I think is
really interesting

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.580
is that that kind of
thinking makes a lot of sense

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.510
when you're not networked.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.480
So if you have a desktop PC
that has no network connection

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.530
and you're using
Microsoft, then really it's

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.640
OK to think about Microsoft as
the brains in that computer.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.520
But when you have an
enormous global network where

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.310
all of those different elements
are constantly interacting,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.920
I think of it more
as just an ecosystem

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.650
where all of those
elements are always

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.080
interacting with each other.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.710
And just like in
economics, where

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.210
you might have
microeconomics, which

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.200
is the study of
individual behavior,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.570
individual economic behavior but
then you have macroeconomics,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.800
where you're trying to think
about, if we take a step back

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.650
and look at an entire
economic system, maybe

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.880
there are different rules
that larger system operates

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.930
by that's different than
when you're thinking about it

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.000
at a micro level.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.420
I think the same is
true for the internet.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.100
We now have this massive,
connected piece of technology

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.490
that goes everywhere
from the hardware

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:27.540
that it's running on all the way
up to consumer apps, basically.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.740
And when you're thinking
about the larger rules that

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.930
govern that ecosystem, it
just doesn't make sense to me

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.470
that-- we have Marc
Andreessen's quote,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.720
"software's eating the world."

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.136
It doesn't really make sense
to me why that won't be true.

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:46.540
So if we assume that
software does eat the world,

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.180
that's going to have
a lot of implications,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.010
and that's really what
the story explores.

00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:58.330
RICK KLAU: One of the
interesting implications

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.480
of the themes you explore
particularly in "Cumulus"

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.150
is the degree to which
most of the power

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.580
is held by corporations.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.160
And the state tends not to
have a lot to say or do.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.570
At one point even the
mayor is calling in the CEO

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.880
of a company for help.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.620
And it's been interesting,
in recent science fiction

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.850
there seems to be a divide.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.530
You've got some authors who
see Snowden's revelations

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.160
and the all-powerful state that
is exploring and exploiting

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.680
these technologies
to surveil and build

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.600
massive infrastructure
around that,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.240
and then others who are seeing
declining power in the state

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.620
and increasing power in
private corporations.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.510
I know the direction
you went in "Cumulus."

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.100
is that consistent with
where you see things heading?

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.660
Where is the balance between
state and private power

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.225
with technology
as the accelerant?

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.270
ELIOT PEPER: Sure.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.980
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.990
So I guess on the
surveillance front, anything

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.920
that is software is very easily
surveilled, because you can see

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.680
it's easy to track activity.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.500
And it's much harder to do that
in the physical world, which

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.700
is why before we had the
technologies we do today,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.710
the federal government
wasn't actually,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.800
like, having a shadow of
each of us writing down,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.560
like, every letter we wrote.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.930
It just was not practical.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.500
But the minute that something
becomes more easier to do,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.690
it also becomes harder
not to do if you're

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.150
the one running that system.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:40.780
And then with the private sector
versus public sector divide,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.540
I do think we're at this
really funny moment.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.670
When you read the
newspaper, on the one hand,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.280
you have our federal
government getting hacked,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.070
it seems like almost constantly
and losing reams of data

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.870
that are really sensitive.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.360
And on the other hand, you
also have this narrative

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.180
of the NSA being our Big Brother
and being so sophisticated

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.410
that none of us, like
we can't get out of it.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.780
And I think that both are true.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.750
I think one of the difficulties
of talking about something

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.970
the size of a
government is that it's

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.340
made up of people, just like
Google is made up of people.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.550
And those people have
very different incentives

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.580
and motivations from each other,
let alone from the public.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.910
And so I think I actually think
the inherent contradiction

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.060
in that is more interesting
for storytelling

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.250
than having a really
clear resolution to it.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:50.700
But I do think that the
modern world, how technology

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.570
has impacted how
we live our lives

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.650
is definitely challenging
the nation-state,

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.440
the idea of a nation-state.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.410
So what many people
don't realize,

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.980
because when we grow up we
read the same history books

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.900
and school and stuff like that.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.625
But nation-states are a
relatively recent idea,

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:17.900
a relatively recent idea of how
to organize human societies.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.910
And it was pretty much
during the Renaissance

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.450
that those ideas were developed.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.620
And if you go much
farther back than that,

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.640
if you were an average person,
meaning you're not royalty,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.960
so you're in the
bottom 90% of society,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.560
like living in rural
France as a peasant,

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.590
you didn't really
have an affiliation

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.972
to country or to nation so much
as just your local community,

00:19:42.972 --> 00:19:44.930
because they're really
the only people you ever

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.930
interacted with.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.060
You don't read.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.490
You're a member of your village.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.260
And you have a king that
you have to pay taxes to,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.220
but that's the extent
of your social contract.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.960
It's not a lot deeper than that.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.760
And if the Italian king
took over your area,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.020
you're paying taxes to them.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.730
And they're going to
probably force your children

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.770
into military service
if they want to.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.980
And so the idea
that we are actually

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.330
part of like a nation-state
that has geographic boundaries

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.920
and that has a much more
articulated social contract

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.160
is pretty new.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.120
And right now, the idea
of the nation-state

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.810
was developed when
geographic boundaries

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.630
made a big difference.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.680
So almost all economic
activity was contained

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.960
within those boundaries.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.600
It was very easy to regulate
people crossing the boundaries

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.200
or goods crossing
the boundaries,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.420
because everything was physical.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.630
But today, that's
changed enormously.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.290
The internet doesn't
respect those boundaries.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.200
Many of the challenges we face
don't respect those boundaries

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.680
either, like climate change
or a million other things.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.730
And trade hasn't respected us
boundaries now for decades.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.630
So we live in a world where
the governance systems

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.900
that we have set
up don't actually

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.830
align with how humans
act in the world exactly.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.100
And that that's an area where I
think there's a lot of tension,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.180
and there will continue to be.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.860
So to close the loop, that's
where those ideas came in.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.410
RICK KLAU: We want
to take questions.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.729
I'm happy to pass
the mic or repeat.

00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:23.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:27.240
So "Cumulus" maps a bunch of
technologies from today out,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.750
as you said, a couple decades.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.320
But conspicuously absent
are a bunch of technologies

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.900
that we find promising
today but aren't there--

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.980
virtual reality,
embedded computing,

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.170
augmented humans,
genetic engineering,

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.430
et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.950
Can you comment on that absence
both as a science fiction

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.180
writer as well as an investor?

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.540
How do feel about those
technologies growing from here

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.452
until the time of "Cumulus"?

00:21:53.452 --> 00:21:55.859
ELIOT PEPER: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:57.275
I've never been
asked that before.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.510
I feel like storytelling,
at least for me,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.020
is pretty inherently selfish.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.080
I'm writing and following
my own enthusiasm.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.880
And whatever I tried
to write and follow

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.650
other people's enthusiasm, the
results just don't hold up.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.930
And so one of the
things that that

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.480
makes me play with when
I'm writing a story

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.350
is I don't try to do everything.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.890
Because if I do, it
just becomes scattered

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.020
and it gets sort of unreadable.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.250
And so with "Cumulus"
specifically, you're right.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.370
There are a host of
things, like many

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.190
of the ones you
listed and many more,

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.470
that simply aren't
even discussed.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.260
And that wasn't
because I intentionally

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.754
had a list going of, like, I'm
going to use this and not this,

00:22:50.754 --> 00:22:51.670
and this and not this.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:57.090
It was just that I went with
where the story was taking me.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:02.460
In terms of expectations about
where the world might go,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.520
I think that many of
the things you mentioned

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.657
are very interesting.

00:23:05.657 --> 00:23:07.990
And if you want to read good
science fiction about them,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.640
I highly recommend
Ready Player 1

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.070
by Ernest Klein for
virtual reality.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.800
Human augmentation-- Ramez
Naam has a wonderful trilogy

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.940
called The Nexus Trilogy that
really dives deep on that one.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.770
And pretty much if you took any
of the list you just described,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.800
you could probably find a
good set of science fiction

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.580
that wrestles with
those questions.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.530
And mine don't.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.572
So I dont know how
I can answer that.

00:23:34.572 --> 00:23:36.759
AUDIENCE: So we've heard
a lot about the ideas that

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:37.800
motivate you as a writer.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.841
That's super interesting,
I think, to a lot of us

00:23:39.841 --> 00:23:40.650
at Google.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.370
I'm also curious just to
hear from you personally.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.754
You're obviously involved in
a lot of non-writing things.

00:23:45.754 --> 00:23:47.670
Why do you write, and
how did you get started?

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.400
ELIOT PEPER: I've always
been a very heavy reader.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.180
I love reading.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.000
When I was a kid, I
always had piles of books

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.570
out from the local library.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.340
So I've always been
fascinated by stories,

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.640
and I really enjoy
experiencing them.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.270
But I didn't do-- I mean, I
did creative writing in class,

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.420
in high school English
and stuff like that.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.450
But since leaving high
school, I basically

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:23.160
did no creative writing at
all, and went through college,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.090
went to grad school, started
doing some work in startups,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.800
and then for a VC firm.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.400
And I had done no
creative writing,

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.640
but I was writing a
lot of email [LAUGHS]

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.420
but certainly no fiction.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.590
And then what happened was
because I was getting involved

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.170
in the startup world
and entrepreneurship,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.340
I was reading a lot
about that world.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:50.140
And there's an
enormous body of work

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.390
that is business nonfiction
and entrepreneurial nonfiction.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.700
And a large component
of that body of work

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.610
is memoirs or lessons
learned, where

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.950
maybe a successful
entrepreneur decides

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.200
to share what they've
learned by, I guess,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.620
by building a
successful company.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.880
And then there are also
more analytical works

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.910
that are trying to take--
if we look at the world,

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.860
this is how we can
understand it, approach.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.530
But I couldn't really
find much fiction.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.390
And that was very
frustrating for me,

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.260
because I like reading both
nonfiction and fiction.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.020
And it was also
frustrating for me

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.680
because living in
the startup world

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.550
and working with a bunch
of these companies,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.040
there's a lot of
human drama there.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.970
You have people who really have
very strong convictions who

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.570
are putting a lot
on the line to try

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.470
to realize a dream that
they've come up with.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.560
They're pushing everything to
the max, usually their bank

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.780
accounts, their
personal relationships

00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.760
and everything else.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760
You have fortunes won and lost.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.520
You have all of
this stuff, which

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.960
to me seemed like a great
canvas for adventure.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.820
But really, I could only find
these business books to read.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.830
So my thought was,
well, if I want

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.570
to read the book
that doesn't exist,

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.210
maybe I'll try writing it.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.720
And that's how I-- so
I literally opened up

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.900
a Microsoft Word document
and just started typing.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.000
And that was how I started
writing the first book.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.010
Now it's sort of different.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.070
Because I've really enjoyed
the creative process

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.396
of those first books so much,
I look at storytelling a little

00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:32.895
differently.

00:26:32.895 --> 00:26:34.620
But that's how the
first one got started.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:38.486
DAVID ALLISON: Now you
just use Google Docs.

00:26:38.486 --> 00:26:40.270
ELIOT PEPER: There you go.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.520
DAVID ALLISON: I don't know
if we have other questions

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.103
from the room.

00:26:43.103 --> 00:26:45.510
I had one follow-up
to that, actually.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:51.720
I am curious-- so with TV
shows like "Startup U" that

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.760
focuses on Draper's
program, and also things

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.990
in the news like, for
example, the Theranos

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.390
story-- in some
sense, it seems to be

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.930
that nothing you
could possibly write

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.778
would seem stranger
than those stories.

00:27:07.778 --> 00:27:09.236
ELIOT PEPER: It's
very frustrating.

00:27:09.236 --> 00:27:10.640
DAVID ALLISON: Right, right.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.610
And I'm curious-- you've
written four books now.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.390
How have you learned
to basically adapt

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.460
or tune the story lines?

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.890
Because they come across to
me, having read all of them,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.730
they come across to me as
actually quite believable.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.100
Everything fits together.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.920
It's vaguely plausible
and you go, OK, I see it.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.350
Whereas when I read about
Elizabeth Holmes' story

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.590
and I read about Theranos, I
was like, that's impossible.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.660
I can't possibly believe
that that actually happened.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.090
And I'm curious
to see basically,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.975
how have you developed a sort of
mechanism for tuning the story?

00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:48.850
ELIOT PEPER: So basically,
what you're saying

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.294
is I'm not imaginative enough?

00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:52.730
DAVID ALLISON: I like that take.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.270
That's good.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.335
Yeah, it's a criticism.

00:27:57.321 --> 00:27:58.820
ELIOT PEPER: I'm
always blown away--

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.740
I think fact is stranger
than fiction always.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.420
Another one that
really blew me away

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.800
was when the Pamana
Papers scandal came out.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.680
My first trilogy focuses
on financial crime.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.030
And so I was like, wow.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.860
This is way better.

00:28:20.542 --> 00:28:21.750
I'm trying to think about it.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.690
I don't know that I try to
come up-- the thing that I care

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.130
most about in the
creative process

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:32.510
is actually not really
the plausibility of either

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.850
any technology that might
be involved in a story

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.380
or even the plot
of a story so much.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.220
I really think that the
most important piece for me

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.090
as a reader when
I'm reading a book

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.570
is that characters
are consistent.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:52.830
Because if you have characters
that you believe act in the way

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:57.090
that they would, even if
you were in their shoes,

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.300
you might act differently,
but if you really

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.480
believe they're
acting consistently,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.730
you can almost go
along with anything.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.200
Because we're in their lives.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.245
Fiction allows us to get inside
of someone else's life, inside

00:29:11.245 --> 00:29:11.870
of their heart.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:19.020
And so if you're with them
and you're on their journey,

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.590
so that's the thing that I
actually pay the most attention

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:26.420
to in the creative process,
not the larger world issues.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.270
It's much more personal.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:36.680
And often, that can be very
frustrating when I fail at it.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.550
So if you have a
critical decision that

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.040
doesn't feel consistent,
that can really

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.890
throw off a whole story.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.071
And so those are the things
that I try to pay attention to

00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:49.070
in the creative process.

00:29:52.302 --> 00:29:55.820
RICK KLAU: You have been
very open in engaging

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:01.010
the community of readers who've
grown around these books.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.390
Similar to David's
point, I think

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.780
there are small moments
for me that are really

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.580
the ones that lend the air of
verisimilitude to the story.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.110
I remember in "Uncommon Stock"
reading about their first term

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.960
sheet negotiation.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.220
And it's a very minor detail.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.320
It might have been a couple
of sentences in a paragraph.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.310
But I'd seen that exact
situation play out

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:28.920
with inexperienced entrepreneurs
who really got taken for a ride

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.260
from unscrupulous investors
who were exploiting

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.060
the imbalance of power
that existed at the time.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.940
And hearing you,
almost as a throwaway,

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.180
it made it very easy for
me to live in that world

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.860
and believe that you knew
what you were talking about.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.240
What other pieces
of feedback have you

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.220
heard from your readers that
surprised you or informed

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.550
future writing that you've done,
or do they become your sources

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.365
for future stories?

00:30:59.365 --> 00:31:02.160
ELIOT PEPER: Absolutely, yes.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.560
So I totally agree with you,
and to follow up on your point,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.770
I think that those
little details actually

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.180
do much more for, I guess
you call it worldbuilding

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.780
or for verisimilitude than
the bigger ticket stuff,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.200
than the big
explosions, or things

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.430
that are obviously descriptive.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.810
And so knowing that, I
try to really research

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.320
a lot to support those
kinds of details in a story.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.520
So a good example
is in exit strategy,

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.330
which is the final book
in my first trilogy.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.530
During that book,
the startup that

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:45.520
has been active since the
beginning of the trilogy

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.690
goes through an IPO.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.240
And they're also going
through this climax

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.310
of discovering this
international conspiracy

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.430
at the same time.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.180
And I've never been
through an IPO.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.730
I don't know what that's like.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.810
I've never been through
it in any way or form.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.620
But I knew that the
protagonist, she's the CEO,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.300
it has to feel legit.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.040
I'm certainly not going to
walk through the IPO process,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.350
because that's going
to be really boring.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.850
But she has to have a few
experiences or thoughts

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.800
about it that feel right.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:27.550
And if you go on Google
and research IPO process,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.450
it's totally unhelpful,
because you're

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.220
going to find things that
are like white papers written

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.730
by law firms that explain
how the process works.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.390
That doesn't tell me
anything about what

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.770
would be inside a
founder's head as they are

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.020
going through that experience.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.930
And so I ended up reaching out
and asking for introductions

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:56.160
to CEOs who had been through
that process multiple times

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.590
and interviewed them.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.730
And I actually really
enjoyed the interviews,

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.840
because I would make
a terrible reporter,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.430
because I don't take notes.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.850
I don't record anything.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.679
But for novels, it's
excellent, because I

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.220
would talk to them
for about an hour,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.420
just ask about what
their experience was.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.900
And you discover
these funny things

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.950
that when you're on
your road show, which

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.327
is when you're flying
around and pitching all

00:33:20.327 --> 00:33:21.910
of these large
institutional investors

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.472
that would participate in your
IPO, you're always on the run,

00:33:25.472 --> 00:33:26.930
because you're
giving presentations

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.480
after presentation all day long.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.896
And you always get this
terrible rubber chicken,

00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:34.020
you know, like the kind
when you're at a conference

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.700
and it's totally tasteless.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.900
So a number of people
mentioned that,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.440
how it was so-- you had to
eat your rubber chicken as

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.290
quickly as you could.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.260
So it's those little
things that make

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.250
it work and make it feel right.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:55.100
And so I try to do that, and
not just on the business side.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.230
So like that trilogy deals
with money laundering

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.850
and financial malfeasance.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.380
So I interviewed
federal investigators,

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.270
money laundering experts at
some of the major international

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.890
banks.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:13.609
And the same is true for
"Cumulus," on different aspects

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:16.150
of the story where I wanted to
make sure I was getting things

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:16.310
right.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.760
I mean, it was
very helpful that I

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.179
was writing about where
I lived, because I

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.629
know some of those details.

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:24.170
And for the next
book I'm working on,

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.679
it's the same thing.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.550
I'm trying to just make sure
that I'm immersed enough

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:33.030
that I can cherry pick a
few fun details off the top.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.517
RICK KLAU: Question right here.

00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:36.600
AUDIENCE: One of the most
interesting things to me

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.024
about your first trilogy,
and-- I haven't read it yet,

00:34:39.024 --> 00:34:41.530
but from what I understand this
book as well is that you've

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.370
got female protagonists.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.429
And it's relatively
rare for authors

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.489
to cross the gender barrier.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.770
And it's also relatively
rare in science fiction

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.020
to have female protagonists.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.260
So can you comment
a little bit on what

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.760
your thought process
going into that

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.652
is, how you channel
the female voice?

00:34:58.652 --> 00:35:00.110
DAVID ALLISON: Four
times in a row.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.930
ELIOT PEPER: I think I'll
probably keep doing it

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.030
until I stop getting
asked that question.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:12.760
Because I think it's sort of
interesting that we have--

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.050
not only that there's
a gender divide

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.950
in terms of creators and
their fictional characters.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.140
And there are certainly
a lot more female authors

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.540
who write male characters
or protagonists

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.420
than there are male authors
who write female protagonists.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.760
But honestly, I
think there's sort

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:36.550
of a dearth of female
protagonists in general,

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.865
basically in pretty
much every format.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.150
So I guess to a
certain extent, that's

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.260
certainly how I think about it.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.520
But it's sort of
funny, because I don't

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.970
do much to channel any voice.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.730
And I think that may be
doing a disservice to,

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.380
I don't know, to someone.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.570
But I just try to write all
my characters as people,

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.660
and I don't really
think about their gender

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.580
or racial background
or anything else.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.380
And I think, to a certain
extent, that may actually not

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.750
be super helpful, because
it's hard to-- obviously,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.350
our circumstances influence
how we experience the world

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.860
and how other people react
to us and stuff like that.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.470
But when I'm
writing a story, I'm

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.950
really just sort of thinking
about, OK, I'm basically

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:30.650
imagining myself in your shoes.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.420
So that's how I approach it.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.496
And I'm very happy to have a
bunch of female protagonists.

00:36:36.496 --> 00:36:37.870
But really, it
was like, what are

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.990
the characters I'm excited
to write about, and thinking

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.698
about their history
and their background.

00:36:41.698 --> 00:36:43.940
And it came more out
of that than out--

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.510
I wish I could say I
had a big point to make

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.740
and that I was trying to advance
a social goal by doing so.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.380
But really, it's
because it's fun

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.060
and because I really got into
thinking about those characters

00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:00.090
and imagining who they were as
people and where that would go.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.750
RICK KLAU: So the week
that "Cumulus" came out

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.202
you got a phone call
from William Gibson?

00:37:06.202 --> 00:37:07.660
ELIOT PEPER: Yeah.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.470
RICK KLAU: Tell me about that.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.310
So you hear from the guy who
coined the term "cyberspace"

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.290
and he sort of invented
this whole category

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.830
of science fiction.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.995
What did you talk about?

00:37:17.995 --> 00:37:23.740
ELIOT PEPER: Yeah, it
was super weird, for me.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.850
I was like in a fan boy coma.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.614
So how many of you guys
have read William Gibson,

00:37:31.614 --> 00:37:32.280
just so we know?

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.570
OK, so decent amount.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.980
So for anybody who hasn't, he's
a very, very well known science

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.630
fiction author.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.520
And he invented cyberpunk,
which is the genre

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.550
that this book sits in.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:47.170
So like that was
really-- it blew my mind.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.390
So what ended up
happening was "Cumulus"

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.720
came out on a Thursday.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.870
Website called Ars
Technica reviewed it.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:38:00.590
And someone posted
that review on Reddit.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.310
And I'm not a very
heavy Reddit user.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.850
But it went viral.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:11.500
It had, like, 2000 up
votes on the first day.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.530
I'm now learning more
Reddit vocabulary,

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.680
so it was like on front page.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.280
So that was a big deal.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.060
But for me experiencing
it, it was very odd,

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.770
because I started getting
texts from friends

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.851
that were screenshots of their
front page with my book on it.

00:38:27.851 --> 00:38:28.850
They're like, oh my God.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.114
I'm like, what does that mean?

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.560
So that was weird.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.600
And I was eating breakfast and
I started getting emails just

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.450
to my personal email account.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:45.230
I think the first day there
were between half a dozen

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.600
and a dozen inquiries about
film TV rights for the book

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.550
and all of this other
stuff, which blew me away.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:57.530
I had basically been sort
of obnoxious and loud

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.570
on social media,
because you do that when

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.550
you're trying to release
something for your first day.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:08.150
And I had sent out an email
to my fan reader list.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:13.680
And so that's not the
biggest PR strategy.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.490
I'm an independent author.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.739
I don't have a PR firm.

00:39:16.739 --> 00:39:17.780
I don't have any of that.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.510
So it's all been grassroots.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.880
So this was very weird
and not something I

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.870
was very accustomed to.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.890
But it was a lot of fun.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:30.440
So two days later, I got a
phone call from William Gibson.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.990
And we basically spent an
hour talking about the book.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.890
And really, he was giving
me writing advice, which

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.890
I can now pass along to you.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.400
So he's a super
sweet guy, obviously

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.930
unbelievably brilliant if you've
ever read any of his work.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:54.440
But his big tips for new
writers were, one, never

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.555
do a multi-book deal.

00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.930
So this means when you're
negotiating with the publisher,

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.860
so if you're selling your book
to a publisher, many of them

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.680
want you to want to
sell them a series.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.840
So they'll say, we're going
to give you a seven book deal.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.780
We'll pay you one
advance, seven books,

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.140
and then we'll do some fun
calculus on the back end

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.140
to make sure that we keep
as much of it as we can.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.320
As they should--
they're a business.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.410
But his suggestion was,
you never want to do that,

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.890
because if your book does well,
you want to have the leverage

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.120
to get a better second deal.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.470
I was like, OK, that's good.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.845
And then a second
piece of advice

00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:34.435
was, don't buy the big house.

00:40:34.435 --> 00:40:36.310
Which go really well
together, because if you

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:37.980
did a multi-book
deal and then you

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.320
buy the big house and the
deal doesn't work out,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.940
you've got problems.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.570
So those were really good.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:51.410
And then his third piece of
advice was, keep writing.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:57.440
He said that one of the things
he's seen among his friends

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.370
is that those that
were successful writers

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.890
over the long term
actually kept writing.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:11.950
So there are probably other
worlds where this happens.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.220
But in the writing
world, a lot of people

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.660
have dreamed of writing a book.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.470
I feel like most
people have at least

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.920
thought about it once or twice.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.070
And so maybe you get
started and you try one.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.630
But once you've written
a book, many people

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.930
basically stop there.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.870
So they're happy that
they wrote a book,

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.820
and now they can call
themselves an author, which

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.200
is totally objectively true.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.800
But if you're trying
to both be an author

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.260
and be a commercially
successful author,

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.990
those are very different things.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.030
And if you want the latter,
you need to do a lot of it.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.480
I try to think of it as a
verb rather than as a noun.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.470
And that also means
it's very democratic.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.890
If you want to be a
writer, start writing,

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.872
and you've already
achieved your goal.

00:42:09.872 --> 00:42:12.080
I think that's actually one
of the really cool pieces

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.830
about it.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.500
Most of us have
learned to write.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.100
But on the back end,
you need to keep writing

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.790
if you want to stay a writer.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.190
And you don't want to get
distracted by, I don't know.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.860
Like, say maybe you
came out with a book

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.160
and it's very successful.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.710
Maybe you're distracted by
celebrity or other things

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.310
that the book brings
into your life.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.120
And what ends up
happening is sometimes

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.870
people write one really
good book and then

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.090
they forget to keep writing.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:41.380
And so that was his other
piece of advice, which

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.736
I am trying to take to heart.

00:42:43.736 --> 00:42:45.944
RICK KLAU: With that, I
think we're out of time.

00:42:45.944 --> 00:42:47.810
Eliot, thanks very
much for coming out.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.320
ELIOT PEPER: Thanks
for having me.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.570
[APPLAUSE]
