00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.190
Let's have a quick quiz on window

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.860
based congestion control. Suppose the round trip

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.190
time between the sender and receiver is

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.330
100 milliseconds, each packet is 1 kilobyte,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.300
and the window size is 10 packets. What is the rate at which the sender

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.700
is sending? Please put your answer here in terms of kilobits per second,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.040
keeping in mind that 1 byte is 8 bits.
