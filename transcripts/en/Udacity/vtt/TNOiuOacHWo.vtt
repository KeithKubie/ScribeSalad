00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.930
Here's my solution.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.870
I started with the original problem and
decided first to eliminate

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.200
this pesky free variable, x3, which
wasn't constrained to be nonnegative.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;From this equality constraint,
I know that x3 = x- 1 and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.900
substituting that into the objective
function then gives me

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.630
that I need to minimize 4x1- 2x2.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.560
There's some other constant out here,
but

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.220
that's not going to effect my choice for
the optimum value for x.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.140
So, I can simply drop that.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.660
We end up with 3x1 in
the inequality constraint.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.750
And the -2 from this side,
increases the bound on the side to 7.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.390
The equality constraint
goes away altogether,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.200
with the elimination of the variable.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.523
Now I need to turn this
inequality into an equality, so

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:54.420
I introduce a new slack variable, x3.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.590
And then lastly, I just need to negate
the coefficients in the objective

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.700
function to convert the minimization
problem to a maximization problem.
