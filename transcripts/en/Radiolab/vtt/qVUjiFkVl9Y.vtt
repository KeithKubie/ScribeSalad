1
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.540
Hey, you want to know about that?

2
00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:06.350
One of my proudest moments of being a dad yeah. Happened this morning. Yeah.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.870
So you know how a a meal is a little bit of an introvert, right?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.600
When we sort of worry whether he socializes enough, well,

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.790
we were taking him to daycare and uh, we're getting,

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.620
he's taken his shoes off and there's this little boy who's only there two days a

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:22.100
week and he's not adjusting well. And every time his mother drops him off,

8
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.540
she has to literally pry him off her and he's wailing and you know,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.600
so a meal sits down on this little seat to take his shoes off.

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.250
The mother of this kid puts this little boy next to a meal and he is just

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.370
crying. He's distraught.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.700
So then what happens is a meal turns to this little boy looks at him,

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.580
sticks out his hand and says high five.

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.920
<v 1>I don't know where that is. Amazing. Yeah. Because it's like they're,</v>

15
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.160
they're out in their own society, you know, especially, yeah.

16
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.530
<v 0>Okay. So let's do the introductions. Um, I'm Jan. Hi, I'm Robert.</v>

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.770
This is radio lab. We're calling this show patient zero. Yeah.

18
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.980
And for this next segment, no more patients, no more diseases. We exactly.

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.630
Let's focus instead on invention on the people who bring new ideas into the

20
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.710
world. Yeah. The zeroes behind the ideas. That doesn't quite sound right.

21
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.350
You know what I mean? Yeah. And that guy you just heard,

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.780
<v 1>hi, my name is John McClellan.</v>

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.270
I'm a contributing writer at the New York Times magazine.

24
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.610
<v 0>He's got his own high five story to tell though. It's not about his daughter.</v>

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.490
We have, I think we have kids around the same age as her first high five.

26
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.840
It's actually about the first high five ever. Yeah.

27
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.900
Ever. Yeah. Seat. One morning, a few years ago,

28
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.490
2007 or 2008 John turned on his computer, opened up his email and found

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.980
<v 1>a press release about the true undisputed inventor at the high five coming,</v>

30
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:50.640
you know, out final, who has the press release from national high five day,

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.050
which is a kind of a joke holiday that was invented by a group of high school

32
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:58.650
friends, I think. And they told the story. They told the story of Lamont sleep.

33
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.043
<v 2>So</v>

34
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.650
<v 1>College Basketball Player, Murray State in Kentucky,</v>

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.980
the story in the press release with something like this, sweets,

36
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.690
his father fought in Vietnam as part of, uh, the first battalion 50

37
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.640
<v 3>infantry, which was nicknamed the five.</v>

38
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.890
And they used to greet each other by holding up their hand and saying five as a

39
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:20.860
kind of prideful. And when Lamont was younger,

40
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.730
they would all sort of hang out at the House and Kentucky and he couldn't keep

41
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.110
all their names straight. So when they'd walk in the door and he'd go five,

42
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.370
he would just sort of smack their hand.

43
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.220
<v 1>They go high five, oh, like hi, like hello five hello five high comma, five.</v>

44
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.540
You know, he has small hands,

45
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:37.210
he likes to put them up against the big hands of the five guys.

46
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.780
And it was years later that he started playing college basketball at Murray

47
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:43.150
state and started high fiving all his teammates. He didn't really,

48
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.220
never stopped high-fiving, it was just something he did.

49
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.170
But when he went around playing away games,

50
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.090
other teams picked it up and it sort of spread out.

51
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.920
So he was sort of both the inventor of the high five and the kind of Johnny

52
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.490
Appleseed of the high five

53
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.850
<v 0>at the same time. And within a few weeks of John Getting this press release,</v>

54
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.980
the story was everywhere when kind of

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.080
<v 1>viral. It wound up sort of all over the internet.</v>

56
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.960
There were some local newspapers who, you know, picked it up, you know,

57
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.350
Murray states, and they became very proud of the fact that they were the,

58
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.800
the home with a high five.

59
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.770
It became sort of part of the institutional lore in the athletic department

60
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:16.690
there. And then you read this and you thought, what? Uh, I thought, uh,

61
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.553
how sad

62
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.640
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

63
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.510
<v 5>how sad. How Sad. Because I knew the story of Glenn Burke.</v>

64
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.790
Turns out John had already been poking around into this question of who invented

65
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.910
the high five and he'd stumbled on this photograph. You know what?

66
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.880
Maybe I don't have it, but a black and white picture. Oh yeah.

67
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.000
Here we go to baseball players facing each other. Afros,

68
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.650
huge smiles and their hands are in the air, right about to connect.

69
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.930
Which one of these is Glenn Burke? So Burke's Burke's,

70
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.200
the guy in the warm up jacket, I think he's even got his hat on backwards.

71
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.520
Glenn Burke was a center fielder for the La Dodgers in the 70s. Big Guy.

72
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.180
He says he had 17 inch biceps. So I'll take, I'll take his word for that.

73
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.150
The other guy in the picture is a dusty Baker. He's an outfielder.

74
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.960
But you can tell in the picture just from the way that Glen is sort of throwing

75
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:05.660
his whole body forward that he's the one initiating the gesture.

76
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.560
I mean this is a guy who was, um, you know, the soul of the Dodgers clubhouse.

77
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.950
They just had that type of um, charisma. This is Luther Burke Davis.

78
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.690
Glenn sister with Glenna was like, like he'd always be on a stage,

79
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.870
often said he should have been a comedian. He was always dancing around in the,

80
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.721
in the club as he,

81
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:25.430
he used to do a Richard Pryor stand up routines just from memory.

82
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.520
You just genuinely love people so much though.

83
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:32.810
She says that in the year that picture was taken, the Dodgers made him the,

84
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:36.020
they sort of public face of the team. He was their ambassador of goodwill.

85
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.110
He's the guy. They'd say that to all the press events. Know,

86
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.460
like meet the youngsters on plots and stuff.

87
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.920
Here's the story about this picture. What was the date?

88
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.110
October 5th politically enough, 1977 to playoffs,

89
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.900
Dodgers versus Phillies game four bases are loaded.

90
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:54.930
Dusty Baker steps to the plate and [inaudible]

91
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.900
<v 6>grand slam crowd goes nuts.</v>

92
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.410
Baker does his victory lap and just disease around in 30 come into the plate.

93
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.730
Bear comes racing out of the dug out and he's got his arm really high up in

94
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.700
Baker season. Him instinctively raises his arm and before you know it,

95
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.803
Burke and Baker,

96
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.770
<v 5>smack hands, Bam. There it was the sportscasters that would, you know,</v>

97
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:17.730
announcing the game,

98
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.060
said they had never seen that done in sports before and from there on the

99
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:23.750
Dodgers started high fiving and everyone else started high-fiving and the high

100
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.400
five became a thing [inaudible]

101
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.763
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.020
<v 5>and it all began with that one moment.</v>

103
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.110
<v 1>Platonic high five right there.</v>

104
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.650
Unfortunately that moment,

105
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.000
that was actually both the beginning and also almost the end of Burke's career.

106
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.400
It's not that he wasn't good. He was actually really good.

107
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:47.510
Even in his rookie season,

108
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.810
he was being talked about as the next Billy nays by the Dodgers organization.

109
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.360
But, uh, he was gay

110
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.100
and he tried to keep that a while he was playing a dusty baker actually had kept

111
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.490
trying to set him up with his wife's cousins. And a Burke never won.

112
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.900
You never liked any of them. And Baker's completely confused cause he knew,

113
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.210
you know, these were, these were really good looking women apparently.

114
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.840
So there were rumors circulating and the rumors reached the front office of,

115
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.460
of the La Dodgers. And,

116
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.550
and one day Burke was called in by management and they offered him $75,000 to

117
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:23.920
get married. It's 75,000 to get married. Huh?

118
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.300
What is this like the mob or something? Well exactly. I mean, no,

119
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.720
they didn't regularly offer their players money to get to get married. And,

120
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.490
and Burke's response apparently was, uh, he said, I suppose you mean to a woman?

121
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.760
Shortly after that the Dodgers traded into the Oakland days for a player who

122
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.250
everyone acknowledged was completely inferior.

123
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.670
<v 5>That was confusing for us and I know had to be confusing for him.</v>

124
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.770
<v 1>It was shocking. And everyone, no one understood why he was traded.</v>

125
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320
And you think it was because he was gay. Yeah.

126
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.000
<v 5>You know, baseball, this all American sport. Yeah. But you know,</v>

127
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.370
at least he was still going to be able to play ball, or at least he thought

128
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.740
<v 1>he ends up in Oakland, doesn't get very much playing time.</v>

129
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.210
And when he did get on the field,

130
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.380
<v 5>it wasn't very pleasant. He used to get heckled a lot, you know,</v>

131
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:10.450
from people in the bleachers. And, and even worse,

132
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:11.830
according to a couple of different people,

133
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.130
his coach Billy Martin would often introduce Glenn Burke this way.

134
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.700
This is Glenn Burke, the Faggot Greeley. Yeah.

135
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.960
<v 1>And uh, so Glenn Burke retires. Wow. And he was only like 26 or something,</v>

136
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.250
right? Yes. He was young within a year of his rookie season just walks away.

137
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.730
God, that's like a onboarded career. Exactly. From there,

138
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:34.430
he ends up in the Castro district in San Francisco,

139
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.350
which is the big gay neighborhood and things go, yeah.

140
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.320
<v 5>Okay. For Awhile. But then one day when he's crossing the street,</v>

141
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.330
three teenage girls in their mother's car come barreling down the road and um,

142
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.370
they hit him and broke his leg in three places and that kind of ended

143
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.570
everything. When that happened,

144
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.530
<v 1>he starts taking painkillers. One thing leads to another,</v>

145
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.010
he gets hooked on crack, can't hold a job, he goes broke,

146
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.140
ends up living on the street. And uh, in 1994, Burke,

147
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.250
uh, is diagnosed with, with HIV or aids, I guess aids at that point.

148
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.090
<v 5>And he ended up coming to live with me</v>

149
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.850
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.900
<v 5>lot of times he didn't sleep well at night and we would sit up and talk,</v>

151
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.320
put on music and I dance and he move his arms around cause he was in the bed,

152
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.020
he was bedridden.

153
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.090
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

154
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.360
<v 5>and so you took care of him until he died? Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.060
Glenn Burke died in 1995.

156
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.320
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

157
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.320
<v 1>but what he's left with out at this point is he's left with the original five,</v>

158
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.400
right? That's his claim. Yes. Yes.

159
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.540
That defined him to some people at least at the end. And He, and he believed it.

160
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.570
A reporter had asked him, you know, if it was true about the high five.

161
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.920
And he said, yeah,

162
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.860
think about the feeling you get when you give someone the high five.

163
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.020
I had that feeling before everybody else. Huh?

164
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.200
So what did you do when you got this press release?

165
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.730
So I called national high five day because I wanted to talk to Lamont sleets

166
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.640
even though I was sad. Uh, it seemed like, okay,

167
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.470
here's another person's prideful accomplishment. Um, let's get his story. Hello.

168
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.440
Hello. Eventually. Hey, there we go. He gets this guy on the phone.

169
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.050
<v 0>Uh, my name is Greg Carroll Ledge.</v>

170
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.890
Greg is one of the founders and he and John Get to talking and John Asks Him,

171
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.260
yeah,

172
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.370
<v 1>the sensible first question is the Lamont sleet story. True. He figured it was,</v>

173
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.170
but you know, he thought he should at least ask.

174
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.640
He said a reporter and there was a pause and he said, no.

175
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.130
Frankly, we've been waiting for someone to ask.

176
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.020
We thought no one would ever ask. It's not true.

177
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.580
It's just something that we had made up.

178
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:40.830
We've learned to see if the media would, would run with it.

179
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.820
They made the whole thing.

180
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.550
They made the whole thing up and then they just went to go cast their

181
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.870
protagonists. So we sat down,

182
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.860
we picked a Murray state that's just kind of a great sounding school at pops up

183
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.930
in the NCAA tournament every few years.

184
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.950
And they came across this Guy Lamont sleets. Why him? They,

185
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.210
well it was pretty close to random.

186
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.020
They then told me they had received an email from Lamont's leads his wife.

187
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.800
Absolutely.

188
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.820
His wife emailed us and said some of the details that you have or are flat out

189
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.000
wrong. That implies that some of the things you've said are right though.

190
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.200
But Lamont things he probably did invent the high five. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.210
What about Glenn? I was Kinda like

192
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.370
Kinda a bit blown away, you know? Yeah. You know,

193
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:24.210
here was this guy who is proud of this and these guys.

194
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.910
It just kind of stripped it away from him. Do you feel a little guilty?

195
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.430
<v 0>Did I mean like, okay, it's a high five. It's kind of a silly thing.</v>

196
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:32.710
On the other hand, this guy's life, the way he died,

197
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.850
do you feel like you robbed him? We do feel, uh, we do feel,

198
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.330
we wished that we had done things slightly differently and,

199
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.370
and putting together this sort of, uh, collegiate prank,

200
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.520
but we didn't really know of Glenn Burke at that time.

201
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.790
Greg says they hadn't heard of the Glenn Burke story when they pulled this

202
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.250
prank. And now that they know it, they really feel bad. Both Derek, in fact,

203
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.890
they're now organizing a charity event.

204
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:55.570
They're calling the national high five Athon,

205
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.680
which will raise money for charity,

206
00:10:56.681 --> 00:11:00.940
including one chosen by Glenn Burke's sister Luther. Very proud.

207
00:11:00.941 --> 00:11:04.600
Anytime I see somebody do a high five, it just really makes me happy.

208
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.200
And that seemed like a good end to the story. But, uh, no,

209
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.980
because then John told us that if you really honestly want to get to the bottom

210
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:14.770
of who invented the high five, I mean, we didn't think we wanted to,

211
00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:16.540
but now that we're in it, what the hell? Well,

212
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:19.090
you've got to go beyond Glenn Burke Story.

213
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.540
<v 3>I've wanted you to believe that he was the hero.</v>

214
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.870
So maybe I should tell you a little bit about Derek Smith, right?

215
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.510
Even though Glenn Burke died believing that the high five was his legacy at more

216
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:34.380
or less the same moment that he invented it. A guy named Derek Smith,

217
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.210
a basketball player for the Louisville,

218
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.550
Cargill was that practice and a guy named Wiley Brown went up to Derek Smith and

219
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:45.450
was going to give him just a ordinary low five and Derek Smith looked him in the

220
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:47.580
eye. This is what Wiley Brown told me.

221
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.580
Derek Smith looked him in the eye and said, no, up high

222
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.020
that year, his Louisville team, they were,

223
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.540
they were known as the doctors of dunk. You know they're high flying team.

224
00:11:57.541 --> 00:11:59.370
They played above the rim and John Says,

225
00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:04.320
when Louisville played in the 1980 NCAA finals, I haven't seen it,

226
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:07.950
but apparently the broadcasts are referred actually to the high five handshake,

227
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.440
<v 7>give them a high five high five.</v>

228
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.000
<v 3>He felt compelled to explain it to America and it did at the moment that Derek</v>

229
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.730
Smith did it, did an asteroid fall on his head or something? Well

230
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.480
<v 1>in 1996 I believe in in the 90s he had an undiagnosed heart condition and he</v>

231
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:28.750
just died all of a sudden on a, on a cruise ship. What? Yes.

232
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.040
And um, he said explicitly the Wiley Brown,

233
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.240
this is something I'm going to be remembered for. You know,

234
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.030
our kids and our grandkids are going to talk about this and in fact their kids

235
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.350
in grant's kids do talk about it

236
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.600
<v 5>and they're probably very proud.</v>

237
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.700
But it was Kathy then we ran into this woman, you'll love fireworks.

238
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.870
This is Kathy Gregory.

239
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:50.871
She coached women's volleyball in the 1960s years before Glenn Burke and Derek

240
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.110
Smith. And she says with her girls,

241
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.670
<v 3>everyone did it all the time.</v>

242
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.640
So I do believe that it was volleyball at first started it.

243
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.360
And interestingly she says they would high five more when a player screwed up.

244
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.400
Yes. No, no. It isn't just about celebration.

245
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.000
Cause really when do you need a high five? Of course it's more when your doubt.

246
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.010
Yeah, it makes people so happy.

247
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.970
<v 5>So women's volleyball, there you go. In Obama, Malcolm d no, snip out.</v>

248
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.960
You need because then I produce it. The Levy also discovered that in the movie,

249
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:21.550
breathless in 1955 and exactly one hour,

250
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.810
18 minutes into the filming,

251
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.920
we'll see two Frenchmen do a very distinct boot to sank at eight 30 Amigo right

252
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.284
there.

253
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.773
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.220
<v 5>isn't this all like an indication to you that did it?</v>

255
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.820
It's maybe it's one of those things that probably was there that Donald man

256
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.160
because it like gives pleasure. Yeah.

257
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.090
It's just like from an evolutionary point of view. No, I don't think so.

258
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:49.100
I think, I think it's a,

259
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.540
I think this has the feeling of something that was born. Yeah.

260
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.560
We have to decide like we have to confess like who in this room wants the gay

261
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:04.150
guy to be the, the, the inventor I want to get. Yeah, I'll raise my hand. Sure.

262
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:09.220
Yeah. It's the better story of the two and something in me says like, just go,

263
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.390
go with the narrative winner. You know, so I, you don't,

264
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.700
you don't even have the narrative winter. What are you doing here?

265
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:19.840
We didn't you, I was bored at my desk. This is pat.

266
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.950
<v 1>Walter is our producer.</v>

267
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.670
You guys clearly failed at finding the first high five and you're saying you

268
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.550
have the best. Yeah. There's no such thing as the best there is.

269
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:31.830
I'm about to tell you what it is. We've already done.

270
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.600
We've already beating the dead horse here. All right, good. What is it?

271
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:39.160
What is hello? Hi features, this guy named Tim [inaudible]. This is him. Yup.

272
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.850
And that's his girlfriend, Katie, Haiti.

273
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.240
And this little mini story begins in 2004 when July evening,

274
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.090
beautiful light out. Tim's out riding his motorcycle up.

275
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.070
10 minutes into my ride, the deer jumped out

276
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.480
<v 8>in front of me and uh,</v>

277
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.390
<v 1>he slammed on his brakes and his bike</v>

278
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.720
<v 8>of like skidded and there was a mailbox just snapped my neck.</v>

279
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.120
I woke up, I was laying in the hospital room and uh, opened up my eyes.

280
00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:09.570
I went to lift my arm up cause I'm itchy nose. Yeah. And my arm wouldn't move.

281
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.290
<v 1>He's paralyzed from the neck down. And so for seven years,</v>

282
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.180
Tim hasn't been able to hug his daughter or for that matter, his girlfriend.

283
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.850
<v 8>Yeah, we started the date they, after my accident,</v>

284
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.410
I've never been able to hold her hand or reach out and touch me. I mean,

285
00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:29.440
I feel that I'm almost in a prison,

286
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.220
<v 1>but fast forward a few years,</v>

287
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.550
Tim signs up for an experimental procedure at the University of Pittsburgh.

288
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.910
Doctors open his skull connect wires for the part of his brain that would move

289
00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:45.090
his arm if his arm worked in the connect the wires to a robot arm.

290
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.470
<v 8>Dave even Katie said or whatever,</v>

291
00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:49.200
whenever she saw the wires coming out like that. So that's what's a weird,

292
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.063
crazy.

293
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:55.690
<v 1>And there's a video of one of the first times that Tim actually moves this arm.</v>

294
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.370
What you see is him sitting in a chair,

295
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.290
doctor's kind of watching and his girlfriend Katie is just in front of him off

296
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:04.150
to the left a little bit.

297
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.220
<v 8>They hooked me up to the alarm and um, the machine said, Huh. Huh?</v>

298
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.320
<v 1>Tim kind of grimaces</v>

299
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.540
<v 8>yeah, my brain was sending out that specific type of signal, let me up. Yeah.</v>

300
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.590
And once the computer was able to read that,

301
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.000
the arm started to go up in the air. Alright.

302
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.100
<v 1>Not long after this moment.</v>

303
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.120
Katie stands up from the chair that she was sitting in the side,

304
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:32.180
Tim and walks over in front of the arm

305
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.330
<v 8>and uh, it without even talking, she held out her hand</v>

306
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.683
<v 1>and she says,</v>

307
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.473
<v 7>okay,</v>

308
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.850
<v 1>for a moment there's this like stillness in the room</v>

309
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.250
and then the robot arm jerks forward just like a fraction of an inch.

310
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.140
<v 8>Katie's hand holding up there. That was the target. The touched her hand.</v>

311
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.570
<v 1>Then the arm jerks up a little bit more.</v>

312
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.340
<v 9>You can see him going from looking at the alarm</v>

313
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.350
<v 1>and then a little bit more.</v>

314
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.950
<v 9>So looking at me and then looking at the arm</v>

315
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.143
<v 7>a little bit more</v>

316
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.703
<v 1>until</v>

317
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.003
<v 7>they're touching.</v>

318
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.000
<v 9>When I looked at him like</v>

319
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.270
I just started tearing up and then he started tearing up

320
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.613
<v 7>sales</v>

321
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.400
<v 1>and in a way, this high five, if you can call it that,</v>

322
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.480
it was sorta like the first time they ever touched

323
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.711
<v 8>space and time.</v>

324
00:17:34.711 --> 00:17:39.711
I was able to put the piece of machinery that looked very similar to a hand on

325
00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:43.320
her head. Not only did I just caught her,

326
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.060
pushed into her hand

327
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.133
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

328
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.590
<v 9>it was weird too because the hand was actually warm.</v>

329
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.620
<v 10>The hand was warm.</v>

330
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.380
<v 9>Yeah. Like that's one thing that I just kept saying to people like it was warm.</v>

331
00:17:58.381 --> 00:17:59.640
It wasn't cold.

332
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.783
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

333
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.163
<v 9>I don't know. It's just,</v>

334
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.550
it's still kind of like boggled my lines when I think about it.

335
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.243
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

336
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.030
<v 10>we should say thank you to Pat Walters. Yeah.</v>

337
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.050
Did Dad was kind of not bad that Walter's not bad. Not Bad,

338
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.240
but let's remember where after the first twins, right. Your best.

339
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.090
We're looking for the first and we're going to take one big leap before we

340
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:39.650
finish the show and to try something really odd. Hi, how are you doing? Oh,

341
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.060
we met the guy. Um, I'm Johnny Hughes.

342
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.530
I'm a documentary maker from Britain. I'm also a science journalist.

343
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.281
He's an author.

344
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:51.220
He recently wrote a book called on the origin of tps and it's about peace.

345
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.070
Why as well, if I'm being honest,

346
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:58.071
it was because it was a sort of pun on the origin of species and nothing was

347
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:01.090
wrong as a species. But you see,

348
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.320
Johnny wanted to write a book about the origins of ideas,

349
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.590
the same way that Darwin wrote his book about the origin of species.

350
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.970
So I went chasing off after tps, which brought him to the USA,

351
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.120
and then he ended up driving across the country straight across

352
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.670
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

353
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.660
<v 10>going west into the, onto the great plains as he did the,</v>

354
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.190
the farm's gateway to prairie and then two wide open fields.

355
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.750
That was at that point did he noticed something a little different?

356
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.550
There was a distinct change in headgear. Yeah.

357
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.000
As soon as you get onto the short grass prairie, right after Bismarck,

358
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.870
there's a very obvious transition from baseball caps to carb

359
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.280
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

360
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.210
<v 10>Matt got him to wondering like, how did the cowboy hat get to the west?</v>

361
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.710
Suddenly there it is and he's thinking who designed it or created it or invented

362
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:55.450
it and he's decided to do some research.

363
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.950
And at first the answers seemed pretty obvious and actually quite simple.

364
00:19:59.951 --> 00:20:03.640
So here's his explanation. Number one. So the answer wanted the question,

365
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.880
who invented the cowboy hat? It's straightforward and it goes like this.

366
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.200
1865 the gold rush. Colorado.

367
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.470
Everyone's coming in from all over the world to make their fortune,

368
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.870
pay him for gold. They bring their heads.

369
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.200
So there's a sort of mixture of hats from all different parts of the world,

370
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.650
from an autonomous house for the city's quite a ridiculous collection of hats.

371
00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:26.170
We might say you've got silk top hats.

372
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.560
No seriously in collar in the gold rush. In the gold rush.

373
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.590
That would be your Abe Lincoln hat. Great. In the east coast cities.

374
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.960
Pretty useless on the top of Pike's peak. Why?

375
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.810
Cause it's cause it gets blown off by the wind blown off. It gets wet.

376
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.980
So you've got your a but you also have raccoon skin has the sort of Davy

377
00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.180
Crockett things great in the winter.

378
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:46.750
But in the summer they got full of flannels and they made you really hot as

379
00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:47.980
well. That's not good.

380
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.940
You also had straw hats from the plantations from the south. We care.

381
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.640
I don't know, kind of flimsy. That would would've been some. Some burrows.

382
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.400
Not Bad actually. Yeah. Keep the sun off your eyes, keep your cool.

383
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.700
But they have enormous brims. A problem is when it rains,

384
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.140
water just collects and stays on.

385
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.130
There you are in Colorado with lots and lots of hats,

386
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.240
but none of them were perfect. All of them was slightly unfit.

387
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.730
Inter Mr John B Stetson,

388
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.230
he was the son of a hatmaker in the east coast and he came over looking for his

389
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:20.950
fortune and the story goes when he landed in Colorado,

390
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:23.500
he looked around and he immediately sought no opportunity.

391
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.880
Went back to the east coast,

392
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.410
gathered his thoughts and in a moment of unnatural and inspired inspiration,

393
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.960
if you can be so inspired. He saw the fully formed cowboy hat in his head.

394
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.690
Yeah. So he had the model in his head and what was it?

395
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.110
I said his model was it needed to have a wide brim to keep the sun and the rain

396
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:43.960
off your head, but not as wide as Edinburgh cause that was impractical,

397
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.090
but also much wider. The say a top hat,

398
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:49.090
which was useless and needed to be waterproof because he knew that it was wet

399
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:52.810
over in the west, needed to have a high dome on top to keep you cool up there.

400
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.130
He knew what it ought to be.

401
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.920
So after a little hammering and stretching and cutting,

402
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:01.921
he had the perfect hat and he called it the boss of the plane,

403
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.250
which everyone in the west wanted to be. So Peter the scene boss,

404
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.810
the planes arrives, it's gorgeous. You want one,

405
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.590
you throw away your horrible raccoon thing and you went from one of those.

406
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.860
It very quickly became a status symbol.

407
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.000
That is story number one. Pretty straight forward. Yeah. It was a guy,

408
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.240
it's a guy. It's JB stats and he came up with the idea. He was a genius.

409
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.910
He got it sold. What's the problem with that story?

410
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.870
The problem with that says Johnny and he realized that the moment he landed out

411
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.950
west and he started to look into this [inaudible] close your eyes and imagine

412
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.190
you know your your quintessential cowboy hat. You asked me to do this,

413
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.810
please just do it. Okay, got it. My head, is it a high dome? Get broad brim.

414
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:46.480
Very, it's got a dent in the tub. We'll see.

415
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.410
The picture that we have in our heads is not what Stetson invented. Really? Why?

416
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.730
I mean, what did stetsons look like?

417
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.700
Probably the Dallas cowboy hat you could possibly imagine, you know,

418
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:58.260
rolling up the edge of the brim. No dense on the crown. Uh,

419
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.200
had a little ribbon around it. Um, ribbon. Yeah, it's not very bossy.

420
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:07.120
That's dainty. So Johnny did some more research and he now comes up,

421
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:08.020
this is coming up now.

422
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.800
Theory number two to explain who or what designed the hat.

423
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.410
Again, 1865, it's Colorado gold rush time. People are coming in from all over.

424
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:19.390
J B Stetson shows up. He makes the hat,

425
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:25.390
the hat was very expensive. You couldn't afford more than one. So from then on,

426
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.440
for the next 10 years,

427
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:30.130
you would wear it like all the time you'd be picking up the whole time with the

428
00:23:30.131 --> 00:23:30.581
crown.

429
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:34.390
So you'd be pushing these dents into it every time you sort of jihad and you'd

430
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:37.300
also be sleeping on your hands. He'd be folding over the brim.

431
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.390
So within a few years, the cowboy heroes,

432
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.690
these guys are turning up at the railhead towns with these,

433
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.120
what we might call in Britain, knack head boss of the planes, hats.

434
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.250
That looked like a completely different happened.

435
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:52.550
The one they bought in the store. Yeah, that'd be battered. And you know,

436
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:53.121
think about this.

437
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:57.560
If you're a a young cowboy and you're looking for your first cowboy hat,

438
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.580
do you want one that looks like the guy who runs the hardware shop,

439
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.150
who's got the pretty dainty one or do you want the one with a dent like your

440
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:05.984
dad, the cowboy.

441
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.160
And so hat makers picked up on this and they began producing pre dented,

442
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.370
crumbled, knackered hats, Stetson responded as well.

443
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:16.790
You can look through the kind of order books of stats and you will see the

444
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:18.380
designs change over time.

445
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.670
All of which is to say if you want to tell the story this wet so you can say yes

446
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.530
that soon was there. Stetson played his part.

447
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:26.180
But when it comes to a true cowboy hat,

448
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:29.510
the one we think of when we think of a hat that's in really didn't invent it,

449
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.583
the cowboys did

450
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.170
<v 11>[inaudible].</v>

451
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.910
<v 10>The entire population of cowboys were instrumental in choosing the future</v>

452
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.180
evolution of the cowboy hat. It's almost like the market's deciding,

453
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.050
which in this case is cowboys. And, and can I just plant my flag and say,

454
00:24:44.051 --> 00:24:48.490
that seems like a very sensible theory. It does. But, um,

455
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.480
something about this story number two was still nagging Johnny. Oh,

456
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:55.930
there's more, he's gonna go one more round. They want to come with him.

457
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.270
I will go. Here we go. The third answer to the question,

458
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.410
who invented the cowboy hat is no one did.

459
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.170
Well, someone did.

460
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.980
What I mean is that there were no mindful decisions going on here.

461
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.390
Not even a community of people mindfully chose where the cowboy hat was going to

462
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:16.480
go mindfully. Yeah. So, um,

463
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.280
<v 12>what do you suppose he means by mindfully?</v>

464
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.670
This is where you get a little bit of science. You know that if you were,

465
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.410
say a mouse and you were living in an environment happily,

466
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.330
and then all of a sudden things turn coal. If you have short hair,

467
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.280
you're going to shiver and then maybe die. Right? But if [inaudible]

468
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.710
<v 10>another mouse happens to have longer hair, you know, they're going to do better.</v>

469
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.230
They're going to do better in life. They're going to have more baby mice,

470
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.800
<v 12>so overtime in this community you're going to get more and more and more mice</v>

471
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.000
with longer and longer hair. Make sense? Now these mice,

472
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.670
they don't choose the length of their hair.

473
00:25:53.671 --> 00:25:58.020
They just have the hair they got it is the weather.

474
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.640
It is the local environment.

475
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:04.230
That's what really shapes these mice and you could think of the hat in the same

476
00:26:04.231 --> 00:26:04.630
way.

477
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.120
<v 10>We're looking at the hat shape itself.</v>

478
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.920
The hat shape is changing over time without any forethought.

479
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.340
<v 12>Thanks to that gold rush.</v>

480
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:20.570
In the 1860s you got a whole bunch of very different hats showing up on the

481
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.070
great plane and all those hats show up on heads and those heads and hats are

482
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:29.090
going to have horribly cold winters. Searingly hot summers,

483
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.620
they're going to be in the wind.

484
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.740
They're going to be out of doors because the main occupation is going to be

485
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.860
moving cattle across the plains in this very competitive hat situation,

486
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.400
the habits going to survive is the hat that you comfortable,

487
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.260
<v 5>keeps you cool, keeps you dry. In other words, the cowboy hat.</v>

488
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.000
Therefore, in this third version of our story, it wasn't Mr Stetson,

489
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.840
it wasn't the cowboys. According to Johnny, the environment created the hat,

490
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.260
the wind created the hat, the rain,

491
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.100
the sun, the snow,

492
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.210
the weather created those absolutely right.

493
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.850
This hat was just bound to appear in that place. In that time

494
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.070
<v 10>it would have been invented by someone cause the habitat was there.</v>

495
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.420
The environment was right.

496
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.710
<v 5>There's something kind of poetic about the idea that the happens called the boss</v>

497
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:27.711
of the plains and if your third movie is correct and it's really the plains

498
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.800
where the boss of the hat or something else Chad, that's brilliant.

499
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.430
I love that one. C On the other hand, I'm not sure I like it because

500
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.470
I'm just thinking about all the edits that we do as storytellers.

501
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.300
Like for the pieces in the show,

502
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:48.780
like nothing we're always trying to do is kind of get to moments and we're

503
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:50.460
trying to always atomize everything,

504
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:55.461
get down to the particular person who made the particular decision that resulted

505
00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:00.150
in the particular change. Like that's what we want as storytellers.

506
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.530
So in some sense your scenario three is like the death of story.

507
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.130
In some sense it's the anti story. It feels less glamorous, doesn't it?

508
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.600
It runs to know,

509
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.480
<v 10>do you know what? When Darwin came up with the theory of, well,</v>

510
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.780
when he published his theory of evolution by natural selection,

511
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.090
that felt like a death in a way because it felt like you were taking away the

512
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:23.800
creator, this amazing being a,

513
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.080
you were diminishing life to sort of mindless process.

514
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.020
So a lot of people criticize him, criticized him for the same thing.

515
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:35.460
It's not as romantic, it's not as well. It is is awesome.

516
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.830
It's just not in the same way. Yeah.

517
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.110
<v 5>And come to think of it, we always end up screwing up our stories, but you know,</v>

518
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.350
you start to ask questions and then all of a sudden you're sucked into this

519
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:45.831
thing.

520
00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:49.430
Suddenly it's called complicated and you have to deal with it and have to deal

521
00:28:49.431 --> 00:28:53.460
with the everything that's of everything's, let's just keep it simple.

522
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.180
What is it about time Chad and Robert came into a show and said,

523
00:28:57.181 --> 00:29:00.540
that's the end of it. And you know what? It was?

524
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.430
No. See, it's always more complicated. That is true. Yeah. I mean,

525
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.740
it's never really the end. Let me think about it. If what does an end,

526
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.770
you get the funding. Charlotte gets a credit, all these things [inaudible].
