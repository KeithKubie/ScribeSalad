00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.450
You may remember from physics or
somewhere else, that if I've got some

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.340
point that's at a vector R from
the origin, let's say I'm the origin or

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.100
the origin is the middle of the object,
doesn't matter.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.415
If that point is rotating about
the origin with some angular rotational

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:22.990
omega, and it's also translating with
some translational velocity T, okay?

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.290
The overall velocity of that point,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.980
I hope you remember this from physics,
was V is equal to omega cross R plus T.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.010
It's just true, you can work it out.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.547
And, here's what that
looks like written out.

00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:38.802
You remember we did that crossing
operator could be written as a matrix

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:39.692
multiplication.

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:42.586
We did that for essential and
fundamental matrices,

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:43.880
so that's all this is.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.630
We've just written out
the cross operator as a matrix

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.470
where these are the components of the,
of rotational velocity, and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.590
these are the components of
the translational velocity.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.330
In fact, that's what it says here,
so VX, V sub X, V sub Y, V sub Z,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.320
are the velocity vectors.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.890
In the world, in the world,
in the XYZ direction, VTX, VTY,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.020
VTZ are the translational components
in the world and omega X, omega Y, and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.180
omega Z are the angular velocity
components in the world, all right?
