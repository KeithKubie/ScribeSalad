Speaker 1:          00:00          This is a setup. I don't like that. What was that? His debut. He's never fought before. So having a fight in a smaller organization or not just feed them to these fucking, he shouldn't be initiating pencil. He shouldn't be in jeans. It's not disrespectful to him and it's not disrespectful to the sport, but it's disrespectful to a large scale organization to have a guy who's a guy who's coming in from pro wrestling. He's got a big fan base. Do it the right way, and then eventually make your way into a bigger organization. What are you talking about? He's like homemade event on ESPN. The how'd that go? How'd that work? Awful. We watch it together was a joke. It was a jet. Well, I knew that guy was, uh, was fading quick. We were talking about it in your green room. I was like, he's fading.

Speaker 1:          00:42          I don't like to wait, stepping. He looks exhausted. He tired out quick and then he hit that too. With the illegal knee. Do you think he's still going to be in the UFC after that? 100% they've invested too much in them. Dana said he's going to have another fight. Wow. Interesting interest. It's a bummer. But that's the life we live. And what do you do with them? What I do with them dances and God wouldn't have his learning here, Derek. I did give him Derek Lewis and give him the fuck out of there. Go. He like women. Here's Derrick Lewis who came from a domestic violence home. He's pretty good enjoying this. Oh, you want to be a fighter? Here's Derrick Lewis, Derek, Derek. But there [inaudible]. I know he has some added. How many fights is Greg hardy had was as, that'd be his fourth. He had three on the f whatever, getting white.

Speaker 1:          01:21          So with a guy like that, it was a pro bowler. Really Athletic. Wouldn't his learning curve be very, very steep. But what are quick wouldn't he wouldn't. He is too much. There's too much. There's too much to download. Especially at his age. He's 30 so that you've got to download a lot of information. So maybe he's working a lot on striking, but you can't cover Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, wrestling, bottom. Not all you are, no matter who you are. No, it doesn't matter. You Take Herschel Walker, it doesn't matter if they're that great of an athlete takes a fucking while to learn the skill. Well, Herschel Walker was world class athlete and a lifelong martial artists. Different animals. Yeah, different. Yeah, but I'm saying even if you take an athletic like Lebron James would struggle, did you throw them to the UFC? I firmly believe that Hershel Walker would have given a lot of dudes a hard fucking time at his age or if you started in his forties even as forward as I think he was such a fucking freak stud of an athlete.

Speaker 1:          02:11          He's such an outlier who would have given a lot of that speed. He had a 35 he's running, he was running Olympic speed, which was in the Olympics. He was such a freak. She's such unbelievable and a real martial artists like really had skills. Like when, when I first saw him fight the UFC, I was like, or it strike force rather. I was like, oh my God. Like he can actually fight. Like dudes are scared of him. Like he was, he was moving in the right way. He wasn't doing anything wrong. Who's taken guys down, smashing them. And the physical power that he had was just scared body. So stupid. Ridiculous. So the team, he trained with Ak q's ready. He did it, went to the right place, and they gave him the right fights. It was good. Yeah. But if you start younger, you dove real prominent. Yeah, no problem.
