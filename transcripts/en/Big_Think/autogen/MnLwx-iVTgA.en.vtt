gee I was actually more inclined towards
 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.250
gee I was actually more inclined towards
chemistry

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
chemistry
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.700
chemistry
maybe mathematics than biology in fact

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
maybe mathematics than biology in fact
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.130
maybe mathematics than biology in fact
in high school I never studied biology

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
in high school I never studied biology
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.890
in high school I never studied biology
at all because I found it much too soft

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
at all because I found it much too soft
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.550
at all because I found it much too soft
as a science then it was a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
as a science then it was a
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.680
as a science then it was a
characterization of taxonomy and species

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
characterization of taxonomy and species
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.960
characterization of taxonomy and species
and phyla stuff that I found totally

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
and phyla stuff that I found totally
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.350
and phyla stuff that I found totally
boring

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
boring
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.189
boring
but in college at MIT when I was a

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199
but in college at MIT when I was a
 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.119
but in college at MIT when I was a
freshman I was planning to major in

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129
freshman I was planning to major in
 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.399
freshman I was planning to major in
possibly chemistry but I learned that

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409
possibly chemistry but I learned that
 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.979
possibly chemistry but I learned that
there was this new thing called

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989
there was this new thing called
 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.750
there was this new thing called
molecular biology that was just emerging

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
molecular biology that was just emerging
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.020
molecular biology that was just emerging
and there was it was very exciting so I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
and there was it was very exciting so I
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.229
and there was it was very exciting so I
decided to try it out and I ended up

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
decided to try it out and I ended up
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560
decided to try it out and I ended up
majoring in biology while taking a lot

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
majoring in biology while taking a lot
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.130
majoring in biology while taking a lot
of chemistry courses and I think it was

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
of chemistry courses and I think it was
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810
of chemistry courses and I think it was
probably a very good decision because I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
probably a very good decision because I
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.280
probably a very good decision because I
think the life sciences really have

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
think the life sciences really have
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.520
think the life sciences really have
blossomed tremendously in the past 10 20

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
blossomed tremendously in the past 10 20
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859
blossomed tremendously in the past 10 20
30 years and this is really the golden

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
30 years and this is really the golden
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
30 years and this is really the golden
age now for biology

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080
 
 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 
that came a little bit later so I had

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
that came a little bit later so I had
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.640
that came a little bit later so I had
been on the faculty at MIT for about six

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650
been on the faculty at MIT for about six
 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.289
been on the faculty at MIT for about six
seven years I had tenure and it gave me

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
seven years I had tenure and it gave me
 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.850
seven years I had tenure and it gave me
an opportunity to think about doing

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860
an opportunity to think about doing
 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.210
an opportunity to think about doing
something a little bit risky sort of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220
something a little bit risky sort of
 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.389
something a little bit risky sort of
high-risk high-reward and I spent

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399
high-risk high-reward and I spent
 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.760
high-risk high-reward and I spent
several years thinking what are some

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770
several years thinking what are some
 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.609
several years thinking what are some
problems out there in biology now that

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619
problems out there in biology now that
 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.550
problems out there in biology now that
would fit into that category and I

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
would fit into that category and I
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.830
would fit into that category and I
thought about a lot of things including

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
thought about a lot of things including
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.639
thought about a lot of things including
learning and memory and I thought aging

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649
learning and memory and I thought aging
 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.109
learning and memory and I thought aging
was was interesting because obviously

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119
was was interesting because obviously
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.139
was was interesting because obviously
it's extremely important and it wasn't

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149
it's extremely important and it wasn't
 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.749
it's extremely important and it wasn't
being studied systematically it was

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759
being studied systematically it was
 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.740
being studied systematically it was
being studied from the point of view of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750
being studied from the point of view of
 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.680
being studied from the point of view of
comparing old and young and mainly in

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
comparing old and young and mainly in
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.169
comparing old and young and mainly in
the medical community but in terms of

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
the medical community but in terms of
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.870
the medical community but in terms of
the aging process itself and moreover

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880
the aging process itself and moreover
 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.870
the aging process itself and moreover
what might control the aging process

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880
what might control the aging process
 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.449
what might control the aging process
there wasn't very much known there's a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459
there wasn't very much known there's a
 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.070
there wasn't very much known there's a
little bit known but not much so it

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
little bit known but not much so it
 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.620
little bit known but not much so it
looked like a perfect opportunity but

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630
looked like a perfect opportunity but
 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.039
looked like a perfect opportunity but
one that had considerable risk what made

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049
one that had considerable risk what made
 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.539
one that had considerable risk what made
me decide to actually get into it is it

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549
me decide to actually get into it is it
 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.259
me decide to actually get into it is it
turned out so my lab was at that point

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269
turned out so my lab was at that point
 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.560
turned out so my lab was at that point
studying the organism yeast and I was a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
studying the organism yeast and I was a
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.690
studying the organism yeast and I was a
yeast biologist and we had studied

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
yeast biologist and we had studied
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.270
yeast biologist and we had studied
various aspects of cell and molecular

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280
various aspects of cell and molecular
 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.150
various aspects of cell and molecular
biology in yeast and that's really what

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
biology in yeast and that's really what
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.680
biology in yeast and that's really what
gained me tenure at MIT and it turned

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
gained me tenure at MIT and it turned
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.180
gained me tenure at MIT and it turned
out that yeast cells get old they age so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190
out that yeast cells get old they age so
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.250
out that yeast cells get old they age so
this was a for me a perfect entry point

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
this was a for me a perfect entry point
 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.400
this was a for me a perfect entry point
to the problem we could begin by

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
to the problem we could begin by
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.740
to the problem we could begin by
studying how yeast cells get old and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
studying how yeast cells get old and
 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.360
studying how yeast cells get old and
that's what we did

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
 
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.960
 
we started bashing away at this problem

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
we started bashing away at this problem
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.559
we started bashing away at this problem
in yeast with the idea that we could

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569
in yeast with the idea that we could
 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.280
in yeast with the idea that we could
find genes single genes that could

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290
find genes single genes that could
 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.789
find genes single genes that could
confer extra longevity to yeast cells

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799
confer extra longevity to yeast cells
 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.649
confer extra longevity to yeast cells
that are dividing so when yeast cells

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659
that are dividing so when yeast cells
 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.009
that are dividing so when yeast cells
divide this is baker's yeast that I'm

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019
divide this is baker's yeast that I'm
 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.539
divide this is baker's yeast that I'm
talking about the kind of yeast you

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549
talking about the kind of yeast you
 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.330
talking about the kind of yeast you
would use to make bread or wine or

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
would use to make bread or wine or
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.520
would use to make bread or wine or
spirits and it turns out they're a very

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
spirits and it turns out they're a very
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.080
spirits and it turns out they're a very
very good system to study in the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
very good system to study in the
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.380
very good system to study in the
laboratory to look at cell biology now

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390
laboratory to look at cell biology now
 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.000
laboratory to look at cell biology now
when these cells divide what you get

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
when these cells divide what you get
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.979
when these cells divide what you get
interestingly of course you get two

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989
interestingly of course you get two
 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.380
interestingly of course you get two
cells from one cell but they're

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390
cells from one cell but they're
 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.330
cells from one cell but they're
different one is called the mother cell

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
different one is called the mother cell
 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.190
different one is called the mother cell
and it's big and the other is called the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200
and it's big and the other is called the
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.559
and it's big and the other is called the
daughter cell and it's small and it

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569
daughter cell and it's small and it
 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.110
daughter cell and it's small and it
turns out the daughter cell is all newly

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120
turns out the daughter cell is all newly
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.940
turns out the daughter cell is all newly
synthesized all the material and the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
synthesized all the material and the
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.210
synthesized all the material and the
daughter is new but the mother cell

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
daughter is new but the mother cell
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.369
daughter is new but the mother cell
retains the old stuff so that mother

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379
retains the old stuff so that mother
 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.170
retains the old stuff so that mother
cell will then give another daughter and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180
cell will then give another daughter and
 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.539
cell will then give another daughter and
another daughter in every generation it

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549
another daughter in every generation it
 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.759
another daughter in every generation it
will be getting older and it does that

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769
will be getting older and it does that
 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.740
will be getting older and it does that
about 20 times and then it hits the wall

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750
about 20 times and then it hits the wall
 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.009
about 20 times and then it hits the wall
and senescence okay so that so it really

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019
and senescence okay so that so it really
 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.800
and senescence okay so that so it really
there really was aging albeit in a very

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810
there really was aging albeit in a very
 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.819
there really was aging albeit in a very
baroque system so we thought we would be

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829
baroque system so we thought we would be
 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.819
baroque system so we thought we would be
able to make some headway potentially in

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829
able to make some headway potentially in
 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.020
able to make some headway potentially in
identifying at least what controls this

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030
identifying at least what controls this
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.550
identifying at least what controls this
process in this exotic system and that's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
process in this exotic system and that's
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.180
process in this exotic system and that's
that's really what intrigued me I had at

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190
that's really what intrigued me I had at
 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.589
that's really what intrigued me I had at
that point no plan to study aging more

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599
that point no plan to study aging more
 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.010
that point no plan to study aging more
generally than yeast that came as we got

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020
generally than yeast that came as we got
 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.729
generally than yeast that came as we got
deeper and deeper into the problem
