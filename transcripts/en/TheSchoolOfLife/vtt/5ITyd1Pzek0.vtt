00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:03.198
One of the most pressing choices facing
modern economies

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:04.262
is whether to adopt

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:06.405
a policy of free trade

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.201
or of protectionism,

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.196
that is, whether to encourage

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.039
foreign goods into the country with

00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:13.183
minimum tariffs

00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:15.573
and allow industries to relocate abroad;

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:18.267
or whether to make it hard for foreign firms

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.062
to sell their goods internally

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.414
and discourage domestic producers

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:25.576
tempted by cheaper wages in other lands.

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.184
It feels like a very modern dilemma,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.266
but the debates between proponents of
free trade

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.427
and protectionism

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.508
go back a very long way.

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:38.383
The argument began in earnest
in Europe in the 15th century

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:40.369
with the formulation of a theory

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.212
known as mercantilism

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:44.659
the forerunner of what we today

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:46.899
refer to as protectionism.

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:51.084
Mercantilism was, like nearly
every economic theory

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.977
interested in increasing a nation’s wealth.

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:55.965
But, Mercantilists argued

00:00:56.054 --> 00:00:57.451
that in order to grow richer,

00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:58.865
a country had to try

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.564
to make as many things as possible

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.519
within its own borders

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.665
Nd reduce to an absolute minimum

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.498
any reliance on foreign imports.

00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:08.963
The role of government

00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:10.448
was to help local industries

00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:13.101
by applying huge tariffs on imported goods

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:15.596
and discouraging foreign manufacturers

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:17.924
from competing with local players.

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:20.721
A strong country was one that knew how to

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.024
provide for itself

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.770
and could achieve almost total independence
in trade

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.949
a goal known as

00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:26.789
economic

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:27.608
economic autarky.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.874
The philosophy of mercantilism
reigned supreme

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.130
as the most persuasive theory of economics

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:36.443
until the 9th of March 1776

00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:38.573
the publication date of possibly

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.067
the most important book

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.424
in the history of the modern world.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.295
In 'An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations'

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:49.902
the Scottish philosopher and
economist Adam Smith

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:51.730
attempted to dynamite

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:54.341
the intellectual underpinnings
of mercantilism.

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:56.513
Smith argued that the best way for

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.100
any country to grow wealthy

00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.841
was not to try to make everything by itself,

00:02:01.147 --> 00:02:02.608
for no country could ever hope

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.234
to do well in every sector of an economy.

00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:06.541
Smith observed,

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.089
that countries naturally had

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.422
different strengths in particular areas

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.355
Some were great at making wine,

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.022
others had talent in pottery,

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.492
others still might be experts at making lace

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:18.282
and it was on such strengths

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:20.266
that every country should focus.

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:22.231
This was an application

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:23.747
at the level of nations

00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:25.765
of a theory we can understand well enough

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:28.069
at the level of individual life.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.469
If someone has a natural aptitude

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:31.454
for accountancy,

00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:33.122
it makes no sense for them to spend

00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:34.709
a considerable part of each day

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:36.929
trying also to make cheese,

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:38.200
to sew their own trousers

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.161
or to learn to play violin sonatas.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:41.664
Far better for the accountant,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.436
cheese-maker,

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:43.952
tailor and violinist

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:45.780
to specialize in
the areas in which

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:47.795
they each have the
greatest advantage

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.784
and then trade with others to

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.959
satisfy their remaining needs.

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.257
As Smith noted:

00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.931
“It is the maxim of every

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:56.669
prudent master of a family,

00:02:56.832 --> 00:02:59.015
never to attempt to make at home

00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.628
what it will cost him more

00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:02.596
to make than to buy.”

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:05.358
Smith emphasized that
if Britain could

00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:07.318
produce woolen
goods more cheaply

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:08.019
than Portugal

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.624
and if Portugal could produce

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.323
wine more cheaply than Britain,

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.867
then it would be beneficial to both parties

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.393
to exchange the product they

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:16.790
could make at a lower cost

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.468
for the one they could only make

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:19.666
at a higher cost.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.241
The overall wealth of both countries

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:24.521
would rise as labor and capital

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.626
would always be optimally employed,

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:28.302
directed to those sectors

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:30.361
where native skill and opportunity

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.601
was at its greatest.

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:33.413
The job of the government

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:34.913
was to recognise sectors where

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:36.564
there was a national advantage,

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:38.916
assist in the education of the workforce,

00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:40.712
but otherwise, reduce tariffs

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:41.746
as much as possible,

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:43.224
and step out of the way.

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:44.670
With astonishing speed,

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.044
Smith’s theory convinced
most of the economic

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.268
and political classes of

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:49.561
north Western Europe.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:51.184
In Britain, his ideas were

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.031
first put to a practical test

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:55.247
in relation to the primary foodstuff

00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:56.120
of the nation:

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:57.082
corn.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:59.307
Grain prices had, for many years,

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.443
been protected by government decrees.

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:04.302
Cheaper foreign grain had been kept out,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.997
apparently in order to

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.402
protect jobs and national wealth.

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.169
But Smith’s ideas,

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:11.899
now driven forward
by his foremost

00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:13.613
disciple David Ricardo,

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.736
proposed that all tariffs on imported grain

00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:18.406
protectionist measures known as

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.700
The Corn Laws

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.512
were in fact obstacles to economic growth.

00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:24.808
After bitter debates in Parliament,

00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:27.484
the laws were repealed in 1846.

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:29.577
The result demonstrated both

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.610
the advantages and incidental

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:33.491
costs of Smith’s ideas:

00:04:33.646 --> 00:04:35.463
the price of corn dropped sharply,

00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:36.709
food became cheaper

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.881
and everyone, especially

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:39.036
the working classes,

00:04:39.064 --> 00:04:40.342
had a lot more spare money

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:41.747
to spend on other goods,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.973
This, in turn

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.431
grew the overall size of the

00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:45.163
British economy,

00:04:45.357 --> 00:04:47.421
so that it significantly outperformed

00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:49.716
all of its European counterparts.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.306
But – and it was a very big but

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:54.704
large swathes of British agriculture

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:55.914
went to the wall.

00:04:56.104 --> 00:04:57.526
Cheap imported corn, from

00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:59.033
Canada and the United States,

00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:00.299
destroyed farms

00:05:00.324 --> 00:05:02.974
and ways of life that had persisted
for centuries.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.369
Smith’s theories were both correct

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:07.695
and, depending on where one was standing,

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:09.411
plainly agonizing.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.493
An enduring problem for
the undoubtedly very

00:05:12.518 --> 00:05:15.265
sound arguments in
favour of free trade

00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:17.103
is that its human costs

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.391
have seldom been addressed

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.534
with sufficient passion

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:20.615
and ingenuity.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.513
The cries of the dispossessed

00:05:22.682 --> 00:05:24.920
have not been recognised for what they are:

00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:27.286
threats to the entire stability

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.146
and moral dignity of a nation.

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:31.730
As has only gradually been realised,

00:05:31.962 --> 00:05:33.748
the benefits of an open economy

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.773
can only properly bear fruit

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.530
if a series of steps are taken to mitigate

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.658
the attendant downsides.

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:42.867
Any nation committed to free trade

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:45.306
must tax the sectors of the economy

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:46.769
which have an advantage

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:48.517
and then use the money

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:50.145
to retrain those in the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.248
sectors of the economy

00:05:51.412 --> 00:05:53.436
with the gravest disadvantages

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.326
in relation to foreign competition.

00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:58.360
Without such redirection of money and labor

00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:00.173
a nation will become highly

00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:01.348
unstable politically

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:02.969
thereby endangering

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:05.310
any progress that free trade has made.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:07.610
Secondly, governments must enable

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:08.791
everyone in the economy

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:11.223
to find their own natural
areas of strength;

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.074
which means high levels of
investment in education

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:17.299
and a raft of measures to
maximize social mobility.

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:19.906
Monopolistic behaviour by the rich

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.837
endangers the integrity of a
free trade system

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.151
just as much as punitive import tariffs.

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:28.677
Intellectually, free trade has

00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:30.837
undoubtedly won the argument.

00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:32.931
When a Mexican worker can make a car

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:34.295
for eight dollars an hour,

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:35.885
whereas an American one

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.680
costs 58 dollars an hour,

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:39.896
it is clearly wise to allow Mexico

00:06:39.922 --> 00:06:41.978
to do what it can do best,

00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:44.702
whatever the effect on
American car workers.

00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:47.245
However, defenders of free trade

00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.652
have been grossly negligent

00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:50.255
when it comes to instituting

00:06:50.282 --> 00:06:52.219
the political programs necessary

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.824
to support the efficient

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.126
operations of the system.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.168
It has forgotten the pain

00:06:57.194 --> 00:06:58.297
of the car workers,

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:00.411
the coal miners and the steel makers.

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:01.864
And, in democracies,

00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:03.508
there has been a heavy price

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:04.619
to pay for this neglect,

00:07:05.003 --> 00:07:06.615
in the form of the rise of a new

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.019
class of mercantilists,

00:07:08.246 --> 00:07:09.794
who have successfully argued that

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.176
barriers must again increase,

00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:13.773
that a country should try to make

00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:15.385
everything within
its own borders

00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.895
to regain its greatness

00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.342
and that cheap importers

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:19.755
are invariably the

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.741
destroyers of domestic jobs.

00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:24.150
These arguments make no sense,

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:27.041
but so long as the proponents of free trade

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:29.576
fail properly to articulate a program

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:32.134
to remedy free trade’s operations,

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.287
whole nations will be seduced by the

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:36.321
easy promises of the mercantilists

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.110
and will suffer accordingly

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.522
until the distinctive wisdom

00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:42.757
of Adam Smith can once more

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.186
reassert itself.
