00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:02.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.910
So welcome everybody,
and thank you

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.470
for coming along to today's
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.430
I'm incredibly excited to
welcome Doug Stevenson.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.329
He's going to be talking to us
today about the power of story.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:22.390
Doug has had a 20-year acting
career, of which 13 years was

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.560
spent in Hollywood, acting in
everything in movies ranging

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.040
from "Snoopy" all the way
through to Shakespeare.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.450
In your first movie,
I believe that you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.071
were responsible for karate
chopping Chuck Norris.

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:38.070
DOUG STEVENSON: No,
actually it was the reverse.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.110
I was karate chopped
by Chuck Norris.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh,
by Chuck Norris.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.830
OK, there you go.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.110
And in your most
recent movie, it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.960
was a Perry Mason
movie, isn't that right?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.120
DOUG STEVENSON: Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.874
Perry Mason movie of the week.

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:50.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.300
And so we're excited
to be spending time.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.750
We need to learn a little
bit more about storytelling

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.580
and the power of storytelling
and the content that's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.310
in your book, "The
Story Theater Method."

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.947
So over to you.

00:01:02.947 --> 00:01:04.030
DOUG STEVENSON: Thank you.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.680
Thank you.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.060
It's really exciting to be here.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.920
Go ahead, a little applause
might be nice up front.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.800
Thank you.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.730
The first reframe that I want
to give you around storytelling

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.800
is this.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.400
Stories are products.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.710
Stories are products.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.590
They could be monetized.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890
They can make you money.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.530
And the Google story is
pretty interesting, right?

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.920
1995, Sergey Brin and Larry
Page met each other at Stanford.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.880
Start to collaborate,
developed a friendship.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.410
They're both technology guys.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.980
They decided yeah, we've
got something in common.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.897
And in 1996, they had created
their first search engine.

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:45.730
And this is probably
the first search engine

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.604
that had ever occurred
anywhere in the world.

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:48.980
It was a new concept, new idea.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.900
At Stanford University,
it was called Back Rub.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.875
And so here they are
developing this thing,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.500
and it's really
successful at Stanford,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.416
and the students are
using it, and everybody's

00:01:58.416 --> 00:01:59.830
thinking it's really cool.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.300
But it took too much bandwidth
over the computer system,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.050
and so they had to
rework it a little bit.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.820
And in 1997, I
believe it is, they

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.620
decided we need a new name.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.740
Back Rub is kind of weird.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.823
That's not the right name.

00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:12.080
And they came up with Google.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.454
They went out and bought
the domain name google.com.

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:19.520
And over a period of time, they
started to realize this is hot.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.570
This is amazing.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.790
This is good technology.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.550
We need to do
something with this.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.770
And that's where story came in.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.611
They knew they had to go sit
down with venture capital

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.110
people, somebody who could give
them some money because they

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930
knew they didn't have
the money themselves.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.067
They had to find somebody
who could fund this idea.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:37.650
And so they went
out, and they started

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.020
talking to different people.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.780
And they ended up getting lucky.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.860
There was this guy
named Andy Bechtolsheim

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.917
at Sun Microsystems.

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.750
And they sat down across
the table with him,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.390
and they told the story of a
vision they had for a search

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.340
engine technology that
would allow people

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.750
to find any
information anywhere.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.660
Now, this didn't exist outside
of Stanford at that time,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.850
and it was a new
concept and a new idea.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.120
And they had to
paint this picture

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.040
in Andy's mind of
what this would be.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.470
They told the story.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.920
They walked out of that
meeting with a $100,000 check.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.500
Are stories products?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Did they sell that story?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.960
Did it monetize their business?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.840
Yes.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.090
And so what I want you to
understand about story today

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.270
is with this story
theater method,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.350
we're going to expand
the ability for you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.870
to engage and inform
and entertain and grab

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.660
people's attention with this
story theater method, which

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.990
is a combination of what I
learned in Hollywood doing

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.630
Shakespeare and studying movies
and business presentations.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.420
Because storytelling and
business is very serious

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.420
business.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.040
So here's the exercise
that I want you to do.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:59.290
Recall a childhood memory
or your favorite movie.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.960
Five seconds.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.080
OK, you've got something.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.140
It happened just that fast.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.570
Am I right?

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.778
Did something pop up for you?

00:04:07.778 --> 00:04:08.980
Yes or no.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.560
It happens just that fast.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.320
Your brain goes on a Google
search of your entire life

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.000
for all of the movies and all
of the childhood memories,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.500
and [POP] something pops up.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.070
Now, what just happened?

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.640
When you recalled
that childhood memory,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.120
when you recalled that movie,
your movie screen popped up,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.820
and what did you see?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.170
Did you see a
picture, yes or no?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.830
Yes?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.120
Did you see a picture?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.390
Did you see a scene?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.634
If it was from a movie, did
you see the scene in the movie?

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:38.800
So here's what I need to do.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.360
I need some interactivity here.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.690
I need one person to
share childhood memory

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.155
and what you saw, and one person
to share what was the movie

00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:47.030
and what did you see.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.664
So somebody raise your hand.

00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:50.830
I'll point to you, and give
me an idea what you got.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.630
What do you got?

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.110
AUDIENCE: My
childhood memory was

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.739
with friends riding Big Wheels
down the street on my hill.

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:58.530
DOUG STEVENSON: OK.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.390
How old were you in this memory?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.632
How far back does this go?

00:05:01.632 --> 00:05:02.590
AUDIENCE: Grade school.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.798
DOUG STEVENSON: Grade school.

00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:05.651
So six, seven,
eight years of age?

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.900
AUDIENCE: Something like that.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.400
DOUG STEVENSON: OK.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.580
Can you see that right now?

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.100
Can you describe to
me what you're seeing?

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.880
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.090
DOUG STEVENSON: Describe it.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.120
AUDIENCE: We're outside.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.740
It's a nice, bright sunny day.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.400
There's a lot of people smiling.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.510
We're on our Big Wheels.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.990
There's people falling down.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.970
There's people racing
back up the hill.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.530
There's a lot of activity.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.550
It's kind of loud.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.300
It's a lot of fun.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.170
We're by ourselves.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.680
There's no parental supervision.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.870
It's kind of dangerous.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.454
It's exciting.

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:31.536
DOUG STEVENSON: All right.

00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:33.220
Do you hear the
energy going on here?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.140
And why can he give me
this in such detail?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.000
He is watching the
movie right now.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.740
Would you agree?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.226
DOUG STEVENSON: You're
literally watching this movie

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.490
and going step by step by step.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.590
While he's looking at
me with his eyes on me,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.870
he is watching a
movie internally.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.910
Vision out, vision
in, at the same time.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.230
Amazing, amazing technology.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.250
This gray matter in
here, pretty interesting.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.640
Now, thank you very much.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.780
Somebody with the childhood
memory-- or the movie.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.900
Somebody with the movie,
please raise your hand

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.050
and give me something.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.520
AUDIENCE: Transformers,
the animated movie.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.699
And I just remember when
my friends at this age

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.240
knew it so well that
we were reciting

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.612
the lines from the
movie and going

00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:18.820
through the different scenes.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.736
DOUG STEVENSON: So you
actually can recite it.

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:21.447
It's memorable.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:22.030
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.260
DOUG STEVENSON: And because
you can see the scene

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.022
and visualize the characters
and the environment,

00:06:27.022 --> 00:06:28.980
you can remember what
was going on inside that.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.827
Am I correct?

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:30.410
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.430
DOUG STEVENSON: And so this
is what happens to your brain.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.380
Literally, story is the most
important communication tool

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.490
you can have in your
tool belt if you

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.995
want to be memorable, if
you want to be persuasive.

00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:46.620
Now, if you don't
want to be memorable,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.790
if you want to
just flap your lips

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.620
and say a whole bunch of stuff
in a room and people walk out

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.161
and go delete, and they go on
with their business and nothing

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.250
changes, then you
don't need story.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.880
But if you want to be
memorable, like that movie

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.310
and all of those scenes
and all of that detail,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.520
then you need to be
masterful with story.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.590
Now, here's the thing about
everybody's memory just now.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.190
Why that childhood memory?

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.400
Why that movie?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.630
Because it was an
emotionally charged event.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.030
Would you agree that
that childhood memory

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.130
had some joy or sorrow,
pleasure or pain, at some level?

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.540
For those of you who had a
childhood memory, yes or no?

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.160
Was it an emotionally
charged event?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.850
OK.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.700
The movie, was that
a joyous movie?

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.950
Did you really dig that movie?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.534
It was fun?

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.450
So if you had a movie,
why do you remember it?

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.870
Because it was a cool movie.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.860
Because I dug it.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.776
Because while I was
watching that, it was fun.

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:39.000
It was exciting.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.670
We don't remember things that
aren't emotionally charged.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.890
So if you've ever given a
boring presentation that

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.620
was filled with all
kinds of incredible data

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.170
and it didn't stick,
that's because there

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.662
was no emotional connection.

00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:53.120
You know what the
number one reason

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.650
I'm hired to go out and work
with companies and individuals

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.700
and teams?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.680
They want the
emotional connection.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.350
Because they understand
intellectually that

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.690
if I don't make an
emotional connection,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.870
the stuff doesn't stick.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.000
Would you agree?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.670
It's that emotional connection.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.970
And your data and
your PowerPoint slides

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.230
very seldom do that.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.940
But you know if I
do PowerPoint slides

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.910
with imagery and
pictures, am I right?

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.810
You have a better shot
at being memorable.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.100
So on your handout, page one.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.805
I want to read a
little bit of a quote.

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.180
And this is the book that
we're talking about here today.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.960
This is the author.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.169
Doug Stevenson's
"Story Theater Method."

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.900
So the quote on this page
from the book "Brain Rules"

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.450
by John Medina.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.980
One important area
of research is

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.539
the effect of
emotion on learning.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.820
Emotionally arousing events
tend to be better remembered

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.060
than neutral events.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.260
They persist much
longer in our memories

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.250
and recalled with greater
accuracy than neutral events.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.430
Emotion is the fast
lane to the brain.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.007
If you can infuse your
presentation with emotion--

00:09:04.007 --> 00:09:06.090
and I don't mean you got
to stand up here and cry,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.455
but I mean you get into it.

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:08.330
You have some energy.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.550
You have some emotion.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.380
You're charged by the story.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.290
And if it's a personal story,
it has that emotion in it.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:19.050
So emotion is the fast
lane to the brain.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.250
Now, down at the
bottom of the page,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.660
I'm going to talk to
you about the five areas

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.170
that the story
theater method takes

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.000
your story to the
next level with.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.100
But I want to reframe
something as well.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.540
I want you to think of
the story theater method

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.946
as an app for storytelling.

00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:39.320
Now, I don't know about you,
but when I just recently got

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.749
my iPhone, and I had an Android
before that, the Android,

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.290
the iPhone, the
BlackBerry, would you

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.050
agree that's an amazing
communication tool?

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.840
I mean, just out of the
box, it's already awesome.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.590
It just does all
these cool things.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.859
But when does it become really
awesome for you in particular?

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:57.400
When you start downloading the
apps that are specific to you.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.810
Would you agree?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.600
So who's got Yelp?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.850
Anybody got Yelp?

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.351
I love Yelp.

00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.641
It helps me right here because
I don't know where I am.

00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:05.690
I could find restaurants.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.200
I found a sushi
place last night.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.260
So cool.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.200
Google Maps.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.630
Oh my gosh.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.560
I got lost yesterday.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.920
I went for a six mile run.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.840
I found a running trail.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.937
I could map the run
with Map My Run.

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:19.270
So I could see where am I
going, and how's my heartbeat,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.400
and how far have I gone.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400
And then I got lost on
the way back to my hotel,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.440
so I thought, oh my
god, Google Maps.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.930
Oh, there I am.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.340
It's like, this is
just awesome stuff.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.545
Well, the apps make your iPhone,
your smartphone, unique to you,

00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:37.280
and they take your
iPhone to the next level.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.020
The story theater method takes
storytelling to another level

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.710
because it makes it more
visual, more three-dimensional.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.160
So at the bottom of the page,
the story theater method,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.630
strategic storytelling.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.260
First of all, you're going
to learn how to choose today,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.930
how to choose the right
story for the right moment.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.530
There are all kinds
of different stories.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.510
ConAgra wanted me to help them
with their emerging leaders

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.900
to not be so technical in their
presentations, not so boring.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.440
Microsoft wanted me to
help them find the stories

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.440
for their sales presentations.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.240
Lockheed Martin wanted me to
help their executives not go in

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.030
and give these briefings that
just put everybody to sleep.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.860
Everybody's got a
different use for it,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.690
but there's a different
story for every different use

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.400
and utility.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.940
It's like every story is a
different kind of an app.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.730
How to craft your stories
to make them memorable.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.450
That's the nine steps of story
structure in the story theater

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.540
method that I'm going
to share with you today.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.130
How to craft the story.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.959
It's not enough to have
an interesting story.

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:40.250
It is not enough to just
think, oh I've got this story.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.830
I'll just tell it.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.390
Have you ever had the
experience that in your mind,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.960
you had this really good story?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.359
It was in your head, and it
was brilliant in the shower.

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:52.650
And you thought, this is
going to work in this meeting.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.025
And then you get
up and you start

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.840
telling that story,
and [INAUDIBLE],

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.560
it just starts coming
out of your mouth.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.650
And you forget things, and
you go out of sequence.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.320
Am I the only one who's
ever had this happen?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.710
And you delete a critical
piece of the story.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.290
And you don't know you
deleted it till 7/8 of the way

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.040
through the story.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.500
And you go, oh my god,
it won't make any sense

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.460
without that piece.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.960
I'll insert it now.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.552
Does that work?

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:23.260
Come on, tell me.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.090
No.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.165
Say no.

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:27.540
It doesn't work because if
you go out of sequence, if you

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.373
don't have the right
craft, it doesn't work.

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.730
So the nine steps of story
helps you to do that.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.681
How to identify one
clear and concise point.

00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:36.680
I'm going to share with
you a little information

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.760
about the phrase that
pays today and how

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.112
to perform your stories
for maximum impact.

00:12:43.112 --> 00:12:45.070
I'm going to perform a
couple of stories today,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.910
and you're going to see how
this story theater method allows

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.981
the story to become
three-dimensional.

00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:51.480
So do I have any
actors in the room?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.700
Anybody ever done any acting?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.410
Yes?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.790
See some hands.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.680
The videographer.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.180
Oh yay!

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.400
I got one person over here.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.510
Anybody do any stand up comedy?

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.770
How about go to a
barbecue and have a beer?

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.360
You become a good actor
at a barbecue with a beer?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.480
If I could capture you
on video after work,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.411
you're no longer
on stage, you're

00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:15.660
just goofing off with friends.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.785
You've had a glass of wine.

00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:17.559
You've had a beer.

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:19.350
Oh my god, I got to
tell you what happened.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.010
Oh my gosh, all of a sudden
you're like three-dimensional.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.093
Then you come up and give
a business presentation.

00:13:24.093 --> 00:13:25.144
What happens?

00:13:25.144 --> 00:13:28.970
[WHOOSHING NOISE] I am cool.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.370
I'm professional.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.930
So the story theater
method allows

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.550
it to be more theatrical,
which becomes more engaging.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.200
And then finally, how to
make your stories pay.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.070
How do you monetize your story?

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.727
What is a job promotion worth?

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:48.310
You get a promotion
for a job, and you

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.639
get an increase in salary.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.180
Which leads to
another job promotion,

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.680
another increase in salary.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.210
Over 20 years,
what is that worth?

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.600
Add it up.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.890
One of my students
came to me, and he

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:08.420
was going to be in a
venture capital competition.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.250
They get 10 minutes
to walk into this room

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.026
and do their presentation.

00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:14.400
They wanted to work on the
story for this venture capital

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.190
presentation.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.859
There was a competition.

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:20.150
There was always other people
coming in for 10 minutes.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.820
You get to come in.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.903
There's these people with
checkbook sitting there.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:25.450
It's like, come in, do your
10 minutes, walk out the door.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.200
They came to me and worked
on their story theater

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.970
story of this vision that
they had for this startup

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.950
company right here in
the Silicon Valley.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.420
They walked into that room.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.780
They did their 10 minutes.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.150
And they won $25 million.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.060
What is your story worth?

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.540
What is your story worth?

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.420
Because your personal
story, that story

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.700
you have some idea, some vision,
you can monetize that story.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.170
You can change the world, and
you can change your own life.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.920
Now, anybody here want
to change the world

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.520
while making a lot of money?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.725
Anybody?

00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:01.370
I don't know about
you, but I like

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.970
to be able to pay my
mortgage and change

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.564
your life at the same time.

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:07.730
I have another student who
came to me, and she said,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.110
you know what?

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.010
I'm going to be a
motivational speaker someday,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.093
but right now I'm a nurse.

00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:13.320
But I got this awesome story.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.130
We worked on that story.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.450
She has built a multimillion
dollar speaking and consulting

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.859
business on the basis of
one really awesome story.

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:25.150
I had another guy who came
to me and he said, you know,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.760
I'm making these presentations
because the economy's gone sour

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.260
on me.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.890
And I'm making
these presentations,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.889
but they're not working.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.520
And I think I'm telling stories.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.390
I worked with him for
an hour on his stories.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.750
His closing ratio
went from 2% to 40%

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.290
after one hour of working on
the strategic use of story

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.880
in a presentation.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.120
How do you monetize
your stories?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.660
What are your stories worth?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.340
They're worth a lot of money.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.830
So let's go to page three.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.440
Move it or lose them,
chapter 17 in my book.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.302
What happens to the audience
while you are telling a story?

00:16:03.302 --> 00:16:04.510
Well, let me perform a story.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.290
We'll see what happens.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.255
Back in 1998, I
got a phone call.

00:16:08.255 --> 00:16:09.380
I was sitting in my office.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.300
The phone rang.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.750
It was a speaker's bureau.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.350
And she called me
up to let me know

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.650
that I'd been chosen to do the
after dinner keynote speech

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.470
outside of Kansas City
in Overland Park, Kansas.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.020
The Positive Power of
Change keynote speech.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.270
And she said the meeting
planner wants to talk to you.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.228
She wants to make sure
you're on the same page.

00:16:26.228 --> 00:16:26.920
Give her a call.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.315
So I called her up,
and she said, oh, I

00:16:29.315 --> 00:16:30.440
am in charge of everything.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.480
I don't do this kind of thing.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.330
But this is the annual meeting.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.288
It's a really big deal.

00:16:33.288 --> 00:16:36.332
So you have to be at the
front desk at 5:30 PM.

00:16:36.332 --> 00:16:37.790
I'm going to pick
you up, and we're

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.860
going to drive down
to the restaurant.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.690
We're going to get set up, and
I've got to do registration.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.981
I've got to work with the
caterers and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.860
Could you be-- you have
to be there at 5:30 PM.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.240
OK, OK.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.287
5:30 PM.

00:16:49.287 --> 00:16:50.370
I'll be at the front desk.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.550
Fine.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.610
I was thinking to myself
when I hung up the phone,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.360
OK so she's not picking
me up until 5:30 PM.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.311
Man, if I fly in
the day before, I'm

00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:03.560
going to waste the entire day.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.643
I never get anything done.

00:17:04.643 --> 00:17:05.630
I'm so bad on the road.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.069
Why am I so bad?

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.810
How many times can
I go to the gym?

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.520
How many times can
I read "USA Today"?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.990
How many times can
I get a pedicure?

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.077
But I had a rule.

00:17:18.077 --> 00:17:19.910
And I think you guys
all have the same rule.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.230
If you're a business
traveler, do you ever

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.653
fly in for a meeting on the
same day as the meeting?

00:17:23.653 --> 00:17:24.319
It's a bad idea.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.109
Am I right?

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.339
It's a bad idea.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.040
But I was thinking
maybe it's possible

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.850
because this isn't LA to Boston.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.925
This is Colorado
Springs to Kansas City.

00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:35.050
Middle of the country to
the middle of the country.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.341
I thought, maybe it's possible.

00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:37.660
I'll call my travel agent.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.800
You could tell how old
I am because I was even

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.520
using a travel agent.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.230
Travel agent.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.730
Yeah.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.450
Hi, Carol?

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.070
I'm good.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.960
How are you?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.750
Yes.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.560
Uh huh, another booking, yeah.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.910
Kansas City.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.470
August 28.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.790
Actually, Carol, could
you look on the 28?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.557
I know, I know.

00:17:57.557 --> 00:17:58.140
I have a rule.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.160
2:30?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.900
Really, 2:30?

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.400
Well, no.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.475
She's not picking
me up until 5:30.

00:18:06.475 --> 00:18:08.020
It would give me three hours.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.560
Ah, is there a backup?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.820
There is.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.666
OK.

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:14.410
OK.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.830
Mm, OK.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.440
What's the routing?

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.620
Through O'Hare.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.630
OK.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.680
All right.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.880
Just give me just a sec.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.260
Don't do this.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.820
Don't do this.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.490
OK, let's do this.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.050
OK fine.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:33.797
Thanks.

00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:35.880
I don't know why, but I
just felt good about this.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.210
I thought, this time
it's going to work.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.320
Positive Power Change.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.480
I mean, that's what I do.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.646
So on the day of the booking,
I went to the airport.

00:18:41.646 --> 00:18:44.690
Took off on time, flying
through the friendly skies, land

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.150
at O'Hare airport, walk out
into concourse B. OK, concourse

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.650
B. Departure board,
departure board.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.500
OK, there we go.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.640
Des Moines, Jacksonville,
Kansas City.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.005
B18 delayed.

00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:56.100
Oh, man.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.780
It's delayed an hour.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.280
OK, well it's only
delayed an hour.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.560
Instead of 2:30, I
get there at 3:30.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.500
Still two hours.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.750
Not bad.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.920
Went to the Red Carpet Club.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.753
Had an hour to kill.

00:19:07.753 --> 00:19:10.650
Came back, looked at the
departure board again.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.010
Red Carpet Club,
departure board, B18.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.740
Delayed again.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.350
Finally, finally, I get
a flight out of Chicago

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.280
into Kansas City.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.900
The plane had pulled
up to the gate.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.733
It is on the ground,
pulling up to the gate.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.790
4:45.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.730
4:45.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.300
Oh my god.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300
What did she say?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.910
At rush hour,
there's very seldom

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.060
enough taxis at the
airport, but there's always

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.640
the little blue
super shuttle bus.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.410
They run every half hour.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:37.910
4:45.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.980
You do the math.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.360
I'm sitting in my seat.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.063
Row 28.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.736
Window seat.

00:19:57.736 --> 00:19:59.610
I am literally in the
last seat on the plane.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.402
I've got 15 minutes,
if there are no taxis,

00:20:01.402 --> 00:20:03.151
to get all the way out
to get to the curb.

00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:04.267
What are my chances?

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:05.550
Ha ha ha.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.667
The positive power change.

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:07.750
The positive power change.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.251
OK, come on.

00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:10.833
Let's go down the aisle, people,
let's move it down the aisle.

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:11.486
OK, come on.

00:20:11.486 --> 00:20:13.110
Positive power-- oh
my god, 12 minutes.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.290
Come on, positive power change.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.500
Are you kidding me, lady?

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.260
Is that your entire life?

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.330
Have you ever flown--
you rookie, jeez.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.390
OK, all right.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.170
Good, good, good.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:23.670
Here we go.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:23.910
Here we go.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.410
OK.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.140
All right.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.640
OK.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.860
Positive power of change.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.100
Hit the-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.240
Come on.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.470
Finally, I get off the plane.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.928
Luggage carousel,
luggage carousel.

00:20:34.928 --> 00:20:35.840
OK, OK.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.460
Five minutes.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:36.960
OK.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.668
Come on, come on.

00:20:37.668 --> 00:20:38.900
I finally get to the curb.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.781
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:40.280
5:00.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.280
Whoa, shuttle bus.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:42.910
No taxis.

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.120
Positive power of change.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.161
Positive power of change.

00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:52.530
What do we teach?

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.090
Reframe the situation.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.054
Change represents an
opportunity for something

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.470
better to take
place in your life.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.850
No taxis.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.960
That's my shuttle bus.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.610
5:05.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.110
This is an opportunity
for something

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.290
better to take place in my life.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.374
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.540
And then I see it sitting
right in front of my face.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.370
Literally, I've been
looking over the roof

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.957
of a long white stretch limo.

00:21:17.957 --> 00:21:18.790
Sitting right there.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.800
I'm thinking, opportunity.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.304
I look over, and
the trunk is open.

00:21:22.304 --> 00:21:23.720
And there's this
short little guy.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.620
He looks like Danny
DeVito in polyester.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.800
He's just closing the
trunk and getting back.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.702
Hi, excuse me.

00:21:28.702 --> 00:21:30.910
Are you by any chance going
to Overland Park, Kansas?

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.940
I've got to get a ride.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.830
I'm a motivational speaker, and
I've got to get a ride tonight.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.579
It's an emergency.

00:21:34.579 --> 00:21:35.682
There's no taxis.

00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:36.640
Can you give me a ride?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.110
This might be your lucky day.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.610
Really?

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.600
Why is it my lucky-- guy he
was supposed to give a ride to,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.340
his flight got
canceled, and I was just

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.880
going to [INAUDIBLE] head back.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.220
Can we work something out?

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.660
You've got $20.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.720
I do have $20.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.719
Give me the $20.

00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:02.510
I give the man $20.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.414
He takes my luggage.

00:22:03.414 --> 00:22:04.830
I'm sitting in the
back of a limo.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.460
I'm thinking to myself--

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.360
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.610
I'm thinking, this is so cool.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.780
I mean, the positive
power of change.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.850
Reframe the situation.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.430
Change represents
an opportunity.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.020
It actually is true.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.792
Oh my gosh.

00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:19.250
So now we're having
a conversation.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.850
You drive with limo
drivers, taxi drivers.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.710
Uh, you know, buddy, it's a good
thing you missed that shuttle.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.120
I used to drive
for that company.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.578
There's eight hotels
on that route.

00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:29.850
I believe, if I
recall, yours would've

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.885
been about number seven.

00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:31.510
It's rush hour.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.820
You never would have
got there on time

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.944
if you caught that shuttle.

00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:36.320
But because you
got a ride with me,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.650
I've got an alternate route.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.817
I can get you there on time.

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.733
So the next time you
come to the airport, man,

00:22:40.733 --> 00:22:41.950
don't look for the shuttle.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.995
Look for the limo.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.690
Look for the limo.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.160
Oh, that's good.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.890
Look for the limo.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.750
Well, I went and
gave the speech.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.490
I mean, 5:29, he literally
drops me off at the hotel lobby.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.240
I give the speech.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.156
Everything goes great.

00:23:03.156 --> 00:23:08.000
But the next day, as I'm flying
home, I'm sitting on the plane.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.177
Kind of in that half awake, half
dazed, half sleepy thing kind

00:23:11.177 --> 00:23:12.950
of going over what
happened yesterday

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:21.470
and going over and over in my
head like a mantra from a guru.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.830
Don't look for the shuttle, man.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.790
Look for the limo.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.890
Look for the limo.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.860
Look for the limo.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.300
Oh my gosh, look for the limo.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.560
Well, it just was
such a cool message

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.770
because this is the
metaphor for my life.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.930
When things go
wrong, if you focus

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.080
on solutions rather than
problems, if you look

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.860
for the opportunity,
they're there.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.079
You got to look for the limo, or
else it's not going to appear.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:48.870
Now, how about you?

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.520
Have you ever had a project that
doesn't go according to plan?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.370
Yes or no.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.250
You ever had something in your
life not go according to plan?

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.780
Your first divorce?

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.620
Second divorce?

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.370
Your teenagers?

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.460
My challenge for
you is the next time

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.240
things aren't go
according to plan, focus

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.410
on solutions rather
than problems.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.840
In other words,
look for the limo.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.150
Say that with me, nice and loud.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.890
Look for the limo.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.640
Oh my gosh, that's
story theater.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.900
Now, is that engaging?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.790
Did you watch the movie in
your mind just now, yes or no?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.640
Yes or no, did you see it?

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.220
Did you participate in it?

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.530
Here is the really
cool thing about this.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.490
Where did you forget
that you were sitting

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.180
out there watching
me tell a story?

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.460
And without knowing it, you
slipped inside the story,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.020
and you were in it somewhere.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.940
You're literally in one
of the environments.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.440
You were feeling
an emotional state.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.460
So I need three people, very
quickly, raise your hand.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.230
I'll point to you.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.310
Where were you inside the story?

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.176
Right there, what do you got?

00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:52.825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:54.200
DOUG STEVENSON:
How about row 28?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.251
Was anybody back there with me?

00:24:56.251 --> 00:24:56.750
Oh, my gosh.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.820
Did you get some anxiety?

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.410
You probably got some anxiety.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.350
And how many of you were
also ticked off at that lady?

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.730
I have had a lot of people
go, I hate that lady.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.010
I think, you're listening
to me tell the story,

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.900
but you had hate in
your heart while you're

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.820
listening to me tell the story
because that lady is driving

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.444
you nuts?

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:13.860
Where else we're
you in the story?

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.570
Thank you very much.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.070
Where else?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.760
Two more people.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:18.364 --> 00:25:20.030
DOUG STEVENSON: Talking
to Danny DeVito.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.196
So I'm at the curb, and I
got the dialogue going on.

00:25:22.196 --> 00:25:23.540
So you're kind of seeing that.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.280
You're seeing the curb.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.780
Where else?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.981
Anybody else?

00:25:26.981 --> 00:25:29.471
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:29.471 --> 00:25:30.720
DOUG STEVENSON: Super shuttle.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.340
And oh, my gosh.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.876
That sense-- now, was
there emotion connected

00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:36.250
to these scenes
that you were in?

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.390
Yes or no.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.610
Did you feel it?

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.870
Did you have joy and
sorrow and frustration?

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.560
Did you laugh?

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.730
Did you feel it?

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:43.850
Yes or no.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:44.900
Because you did.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.970
You cannot-- this is the thing
about story theater that is

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:48.910
so compelling.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.290
You cannot not go with
me into these scenes.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.070
You cannot not do it.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.430
And it doesn't matter
where you're from.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.700
And this is the beauty
of story theater.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.960
It is a universal language.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.140
I have done this
all over the world.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.980
I even did this in Japan
with a Japanese interpreter,

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.732
and people still got it.

00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:10.190
I have done it in Malaysia.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.114
I've done it in Spain.

00:26:11.114 --> 00:26:12.780
I've done it all over
the United States.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.415
It is the universal language
because it is theater.

00:26:15.415 --> 00:26:16.350
It is behavior.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.130
It is not just telling a story.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.580
It is showing and
telling a story.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.870
Now this is the app that
takes story to the next level.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.180
So here's the question.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.690
What's your story?

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.470
And is it worth
working on this story

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.230
and making it a little
bit more colorful

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.770
so that you can
monetize that story

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.620
and turn that into a
million dollar story?

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.330
Because your story can
take you to the next place,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.110
but at the same time it can
influence and persuade people

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.280
to go to the next place.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.910
But they won't do it if they
just hear it and understand it.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.890
Understanding a concept does
not change hearts, minds,

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.830
and behavior.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.590
It does not get people
to write a check.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.370
It does not get people to
say, OK, you've convinced me.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.190
All right, I'm going to
go along with your idea.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.580
Now, there's got be
something more compelling.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.550
So the idea here-- and
at the top of page three,

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.120
you can see what I'm asking for.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.070
The visuals, when
you're creating a story,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.890
you need to make it visual.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.430
So I want you right now to all
identify in your mind a story

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.290
that you would like to be
more amazing, more colorful.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.390
So if you're watching
this on video, on YouTube

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.130
or on the feed,
what is that story

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.240
that you'd like to make more
amazing, more colorful, more

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.947
compelling, more
emotionally dynamic?

00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:40.530
So just think about
that for a second.

00:27:48.765 --> 00:27:49.515
You got something?

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.410
Now, I want you
to visualize when

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.220
you were experiencing
that event in your life.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.450
You are in environments,
am I right?

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.370
You're in specific physical
places with other people.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.440
Those are the environments that
you create with story theater.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.810
Did you notice when
I did my story,

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.980
it became a
three-dimensional space?

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.000
What were some of the
three-dimensional spaces

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.190
that you saw me create for you
that you literally saw yourself

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.410
in those spaces with me?

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.410
Who can give me an idea?

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.880
You saw a physical environment.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.470
What was it?

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.570
The airplane.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.720
So you saw the airplane.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.285
Did you see the aisle?

00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:31.660
Did you see people in front
of you, stacked on the aisle?

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.580
Yes or no.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.080
Yeah?

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:33.750
You were there, right?

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.760
So you saw an airplane.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.410
What other physical
environment did I create?

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.790
On the phone.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.840
Was anybody with me when
I was on the phone going,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.650
don't do this.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.400
Did anybody get a
little plugged in there?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.930
Oh my gosh.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.690
Most people say,
that was just nuts.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.920
I've done that.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.150
So if I can create those moments
and create those environments

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.470
and create those scenes and
do them, not talk about them,

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.970
you go into it with me, and
you get the emotional hook,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.230
the emotional trigger.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.160
What is one other
environment that you saw?

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.550
The curb.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.440
So I got the curb.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.910
I've got the office where
I'm making the phone call.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.470
Got the back of the plane.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.580
Got the luggage carousel.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.180
I've got the departure
board in concourse B.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.110
I've got all of
these environments.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.670
So look at your story
in your mind right now.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.690
What are the environments that
your story takes place in?

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.190
Make it visual.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.850
Make your story visual.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.950
Move.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.190
Use some space.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.550
Make it three-dimensional.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.180
That's when it
becomes story theater.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.174
And when you take that
step, they go with you.

00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:39.840
Would you agree?

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.090
Did you go with me
when I did that?

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.990
Now, some of you out
here are probably

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.371
very, very techy brains.

00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:49.120
And I don't mean that
disparagingly at all

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.610
because oh my gosh, do we need
this type-- but you know what?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.500
When I say to you
make it visual,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.259
some of you who are a
little bit more introverted,

00:29:57.259 --> 00:29:58.800
a little bit more
in your head, might

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.210
say but I'm not very physical.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.950
Here's my challenge.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.815
Do you want them to be physical?

00:30:04.815 --> 00:30:06.880
Do you want them to feel it?

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.950
Then you've got to go
to that next level.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.250
You've got to make it visual.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.110
Now, the next piece on
here is make it emotional.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.060
Make it emotional.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.960
What emotions did you
feel during this story?

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.280
Did you feel anxiety?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.604
Did you feel joy at the
end when I made it on time

00:30:22.604 --> 00:30:23.520
and I gave the speech?

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.530
Yes!

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.370
Did you feel happy when I
was riding along in the limo?

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.170
I was like, whoo, woohoo.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.700
Did you go with me on my
emotional roller coaster?

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.360
Because you probably did.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.140
You go where I take you.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.350
You don't have a choice.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:42.290
90% of every audience will
go right there with you.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.090
I've often described this as
kind of like bungee jumping.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.125
You don't kind of.

00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:50.750
You jump.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.580
When you commit to telling a
story at this level, you go.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.700
And they come with you.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.057
And it doesn't matter what
it feels like out there.

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.390
You are committed to doing this.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.930
It's a mini piece of theater.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.570
Now, the next one here is make
one clear and concise point

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.850
with every story.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.780
And here's where story
strategy comes in.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.300
When you choose your
story, you immediately

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.190
have to say what is the one
clear and concise simple

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.810
point that I want to
make with this story.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.500
So when you get to
the end of the story,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.540
you do not go on for
three or four or five

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.820
sentences about
what I learned was,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.740
and then you go through
this litany of things.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.240
No, you get to the
end and say, what

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.910
I learned was look for the limo.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.640
When things don't go
right, look for the limo.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.330
Now, that is a phrase that pays.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.670
That is part of the storytelling
technology of story theater.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.520
It is very strategic.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.174
It is very targeted.

00:31:51.174 --> 00:31:52.590
I don't get to
tell any story that

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.930
makes a whole bunch of points.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.620
It is very, very specific.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.880
It is one app that
does one thing well.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.820
And that's how you influence
and persuade people to change.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.514
You focus their attention.

00:32:03.514 --> 00:32:05.430
So I want you to see in
the middle of the page

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.270
where it says visualize scenes.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.780
As you are creating
your stories,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.837
I don't want you to just keep
thinking about the sequence.

00:32:13.837 --> 00:32:15.420
This happened, and
then this happened.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.830
Then I said this, and
then this happened.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.140
Then I said that, and
then this happened.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.890
And she said this.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.960
Then I went over here.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.710
That's just telling.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.750
And that stays in the head.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.350
You need to visualize
the scenes that you

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.320
were in where the
drama was taking place,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.862
and you need to play
within those scenes.

00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:34.320
So now we're going to talk
about the advanced story theater

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.090
performance techniques.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.030
Story strategy.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.990
Use a specific story to make
one clear and concise point.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:48.820
Years ago I realized I
get hired all the time

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.095
by very, very
frustrated clients who

00:32:53.095 --> 00:32:56.310
are giving very, very dull, dry
technical presentations, full

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.030
of very good information.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.997
But they put their listeners
into a content coma.

00:33:01.997 --> 00:33:03.830
Have you ever done this
with a presentation?

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.210
Have you ever put your
audience into a content coma?

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.260
Say yes.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.210
I know some of you have.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.810
Because it's like
such good content.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.400
But oh my gosh, it's
so much content.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.900
Anybody besides me ever give a
presentation where you've got

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.316
three hours' worth of content
in a 20 minute presentation?

00:33:19.316 --> 00:33:20.200
Yes?

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.110
Oh my gosh, this is a
crime against humanity.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.204
This is a problem.

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:27.620
So I get hired by people all
the time for this one reason.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:36.200
I thought, I need a
story that illustrates

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.750
what I do with these clients
to put up on my website

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.520
so that more people will listen
to the story of what I do,

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.150
understand what I
do, and hire me.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.172
I want to monetize my
business with the right story.

00:33:52.172 --> 00:33:53.630
Well, I didn't have
the story, so I

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.690
went on a story safari,
what I call a Google

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.240
search for the right story.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.800
I need a story that teaches
what I do with technology where

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.488
I help people to make their
content more interesting.

00:34:04.488 --> 00:34:07.490
Oh, here's the story.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.810
How many people
have dogs or cats?

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.040
Got any people with pets?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.330
Some of you don't have pets.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.448
You've got kids?

00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:15.739
You'll probably relate to this.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.770
Even if you don't have dogs
or cats, go with me on this.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.750
I grew up with
dogs, Irish setters.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.130
My dad was into Irish setters.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.210
And we had Irish
setter-- we had Dawn.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.290
We had Penny.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.198
And as a kid, I always had dogs.

00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:28.489
And I thought, this is so cool.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.840
Because when you're a kid, you
just get to play with the dogs.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.010
But your parents
take care of them.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.980
They're the ones
who spend the money.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.949
Am I right?

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.841
So as a kid, it's
like, this is great.

00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:37.340
Well, as an adult,
all of a sudden I

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.350
realized I want my own dog.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.380
So I went out, and I got
this little black lab puppy.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.204
Six weeks old, just
this little ball

00:34:46.204 --> 00:34:48.199
of fat and fur
and just adorable.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.290
And I named her Jaya,
and I raised her.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.480
And she was just adorable.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.610
She was my best friend.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.902
When I was down in
Hollywood, I needed a buddy.

00:34:55.902 --> 00:34:58.360
Well, about two years into this
relationship with this dog,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.392
she got sick.

00:34:59.392 --> 00:35:01.850
I'd never had to deal with this
before, but all of a sudden

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:02.900
she was very lethargic.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.024
She wasn't eating her food.

00:35:04.024 --> 00:35:07.350
And I thought, something's
going on with this dog.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.362
Jaya is not good.

00:35:08.362 --> 00:35:09.570
I got to take her to the vet.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.310
So for the first time
I'd ever had to do this,

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.330
I took her to the vet.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.440
He diagnosed her.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.820
He said, yep, she's got a cold.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.820
She's a little bit sick.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.920
Here's some pills.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.017
Give her a pill at breakfast
and a pill at dinner.

00:35:19.017 --> 00:35:20.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.604
Thought, so easy.

00:35:21.604 --> 00:35:23.020
Just give her a
pill at breakfast.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.880
So that night at
dinner, I was going

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.600
to give her a pill I
said, come on, Jaya.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.130
Jaya, Jaya.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:27.650
I know.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.150
I know.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.500
Come on.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.610
Come here.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:31.140
Good girl.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.639
Good girl.

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:32.321
Sit.

00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:32.820
Sit.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.430
I know.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.810
You don't feel very well.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.310
Hi.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.809
I know.

00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:38.110
I've got to give you a pill.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.260
What did he tell me to do?

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.362
OK, so Jaya, I've got
to pull your mouth open.

00:35:41.362 --> 00:35:43.736
I've got to shove this down
into the back of your throat,

00:35:43.736 --> 00:35:47.345
and I'm going to hold it, and
you're going to swallow it.

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:47.845
Yeah.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.341
Come on.

00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:53.840
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.297
Come on, swallow the pill.

00:35:57.297 --> 00:35:58.130
OK, what did he say?

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.040
OK.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.890
If she just looks at
you, massage her throat.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.610
Massage the throat.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.120
Good girl.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.774
So did you swallow it?

00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:08.640
Uck.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.240
So she spits up the
pill on my hands.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.490
It's like, this is ridiculous.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.767
I tried this three more times.

00:36:12.767 --> 00:36:13.850
I went through four pills.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:14.891
They cost a lot of money.

00:36:14.891 --> 00:36:15.400
Am I right?

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.700
Oh my gosh.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.690
They cost a lot of money.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.481
Anybody here have kids
who are a little bit

00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:19.570
fussy with their pills?

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.190
Dogs, cats, gerbils, pythons?

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.230
So anyway, I was really
frustrated with this.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.390
I figured, who knows
how to do this?

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.620
I called my friend John.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.260
I said John, you've had
dogs your entire life.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.090
What do you do?

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.370
You got any peanut butter?

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.939
John, do you need
some peanut butter?

00:36:36.939 --> 00:36:39.230
Are you asking for me to
bring some peanut butter over?

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.729
No, no, no.

00:36:39.729 --> 00:36:41.160
Do you have some peanut butter?

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.490
Yeah, I've got peanut butter.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.640
Hide the pill in
the peanut butter.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.610
I see some heads nodding.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.860
I thought, this is so strange.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.960
Hide the pill in
the peanut butter.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.560
But I did it.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.580
I went and I got
some peanut butter

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.150
and I scooped it
into my palm and I

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.010
put the pill inside
the peanut butter.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.030
I went over to Jaya.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.050
Come here, Jaya.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.550
Come on.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.540
You want something?

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:04.560
Yes!

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.700
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.740
Oh, good girl.

00:37:11.412 --> 00:37:13.120
Well, I hid to pill
in the peanut butter,

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.780
and the medicine went down.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.780
Hide the pill in
the peanut butter.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.590
What is the pill?

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.580
The pill is all that
information that you've

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.760
got in a presentation
that is so hard to swallow

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.730
for the listener's brain
because it's just too much.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.850
And sometimes it's
too dry and technical.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.250
Would you agree?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.810
The pill is good medicine.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.590
It's good information.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.770
And yet it's hard for
their brain to swallow it.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.510
Would you agree, yes or no?

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.540
Because sometimes it's
just like, oh my god.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.460
I get this.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.390
Why don't they get this?

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.930
Because you're brilliant,
and they're not you.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:47.950
That's why.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.030
And so when you are coming
up with a whole bunch of data

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.130
that you need to put
into a presentation,

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:58.680
my counsel for you is to hide
the pill, the good medicine,

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.210
in the story butter.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.770
Because the peanut
butter sticks.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.450
The story sticks.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:09.180
That story is the
strategic use of a story

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.680
to make a specific point.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.880
Did you see the dog?

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.500
Did you see me
giving her the pill?

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.080
Did you feel it?

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.810
Did you feel the saliva?

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.940
Anybody?

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.820
So that's story
theater once again.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.600
The strategic use of a story
to do a specific thing.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.140
I can tell you for a fact.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.760
I've put that up on my
home page on my website.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.350
I now get calls from clients
from all over the world that

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.510
used to come to my
website and keep going.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.780
Now they come to my website.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.750
They watch that video,
they pick up the phone,

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.400
and they talk to me.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.250
That's monetizing your story.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.100
That's a million dollar story.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.320
How much is your story worth?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.960
Now, the next one
here is in moments,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.220
acting or reenacting
moments in your story.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.170
The in moments, the acting
out of these moments

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.682
like playing with the dog,
going to the back of the plane,

00:39:01.682 --> 00:39:03.890
getting off the plane, being
at the luggage carousel,

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.730
being at the curb.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.270
I call them in moments.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:09.890
And literally, here's where
the theater in story theater

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.946
comes in.

00:39:10.946 --> 00:39:15.060
In story theater, I take
moments in my story,

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.150
and I go back to when I was
an actor on a stage in a play,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.820
and I'm in a present tense
recreation of a moment in time.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.720
Then I step back out, and
I'm talking to the audience,

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.960
and I'm narrating my story.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.840
And then I step back into a
moment, playing with the dog.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.720
Then I step back out.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.844
I'm talking to you.

00:39:30.844 --> 00:39:32.010
So that's the story theater.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.500
Very simple.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.430
Emotions.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.890
Showing emotions rather
than describing them.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.080
The emotional connection
that you're looking for

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.320
is that you don't
describe emotions.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.440
You get into them.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.340
You feel them.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.799
You show them with your body.

00:39:45.799 --> 00:39:48.340
And you do this after you've
had a beer at a barbecue anyway,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.680
so you know how to do it.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.890
Three dimensions, using
staging and movement

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.660
to create imaginary
environments,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.050
going back and
forth and creating

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.740
a three-dimensional stage.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.900
Dialogue, adding
two-person dialogue,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.430
like the dialogue that I
had with my little Danny

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.194
DeVito, the limo driver, or
the telephone conversation.

00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:07.110
This is the stuff that
makes story come alive.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.193
So I want you to think
about that story right now,

00:40:09.193 --> 00:40:12.310
and what is the dialogue
that is in that story?

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.410
Who are you having
a conversation with?

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.070
Don't just tell me
about the conversation.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.780
Do the conversation.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.540
Dialogue makes stories awesome.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.697
It really makes them come alive.

00:40:24.697 --> 00:40:26.280
And finally, [INAUDIBLE]
their message

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.260
branding, using a
phrase that pays.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.860
At the bottom of
the page it says,

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.234
and this is a
quote from my book,

00:40:32.234 --> 00:40:34.990
a speaker's job is to
deliver information

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:42.687
in a way that motivates people
to listen, remember, and act.

00:40:42.687 --> 00:40:44.270
Here's the greatest
challenge that you

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.340
face in your presentations,
internally or externally.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.604
If you go in and you
make a presentation,

00:40:49.604 --> 00:40:51.020
the person that
you're speaking to

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.140
is going to take action later on
based on whether they remember

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.380
anything from your
presentation or not.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.060
They're not necessarily going to
change their mind in the room,

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.050
that their behavior
changes later on.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.430
You have to be memorable.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.980
And if you give a presentation
and you're not memorable,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.187
you're dead in the water.

00:41:11.187 --> 00:41:13.520
So I want you to think about
a presentation you've made,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.561
you've listened to, you've
been participating in,

00:41:15.561 --> 00:41:18.890
in the last 24 hours where
you've been in the audience

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.211
for a presentation.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:21.085
What do you remember?

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.320
Come on.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.070
Give me something.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.430
What do you remember
from a presentation?

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.774
Any presentation you've been
in in the last 24 hours.

00:41:29.774 --> 00:41:31.940
Somebody give me a specific
thing that you remember.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.780
I need three people.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.736
What do you got?

00:41:33.736 --> 00:41:35.360
AUDIENCE: Feeling
bored out of my mind.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.650
DOUG STEVENSON: Feeling
bored out of my mind.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.400
Now, was that what
the presenter wanted?

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.500
I don't think so.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.790
So your sense is, oh
my god, this sucks.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.482
I am so bored.

00:41:44.482 --> 00:41:45.190
This is terrible.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.360
This is pathetic.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.896
This person doesn't get it.

00:41:47.896 --> 00:41:49.270
He doesn't know
how to engage me.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.470
That's frustration.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.800
That's not learning anything.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.300
That's being a
little bit ticked off

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.550
that this person doesn't get it.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.850
Who can remember content?

00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.804
Yeah, what do you got?

00:41:59.804 --> 00:42:00.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.450
DOUG STEVENSON:
A student who had

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.930
been admitted into a university.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.030
In other words,
are you telling me

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.230
that you're remembering
somebody telling

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.502
a story about a student?

00:42:06.502 --> 00:42:07.679
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:09.470
DOUG STEVENSON: You're
remembering a story.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.145
Can you see that right now?

00:42:12.145 --> 00:42:13.020
Here's the challenge.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.390
I ask you, what do you
remember from a presentation

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.680
within the last 24 hours.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.130
Nobody raises their
hand and says,

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.360
there was this
incredible concept.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.520
It's like, eh, the content
just goes flopping away.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.900
This is scary.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.180
This is scary.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.970
OK, next page.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:30.820
Page five.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.810
How to choose your stories.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.310
Here we go.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.870
How to choose your stories.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.660
You start with
the point in mind.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.070
You start by thinking, what
do I need a story to do?

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.160
Story is a utility.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.390
Story is a vehicle that
accomplishes something.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.110
What do I need a story to teach?

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.960
You start with a point in mind.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.040
That's where you start.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.390
And then you go
on a story safari.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.024
Look for a moment of crisis,
challenge, or obstacle.

00:42:54.024 --> 00:42:55.940
So I want you to understand
that you're always

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.926
looking for the iceberg moment.

00:42:57.926 --> 00:42:59.550
When I say look for
the iceberg moment,

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.730
what do you think
I'm talking about?

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.650
What is the iceberg
moment related to?

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.700
Titanic.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.300
You know what the story of
Titanic is without the iceberg?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.169
It's a cruise ship.

00:43:13.169 --> 00:43:14.710
It's just a big
cruise ship, and it's

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.001
going from England to New York.

00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:17.450
And it's just a cruise ship.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.840
Without the iceberg,
do we have a story?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.170
Not really.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:23.750
But with the iceberg,
OK we got something.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.100
What is the iceberg
moment in your story?

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.330
There's got to be a crisis,
an obstacle, or a challenge.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.990
So you're always
looking for stories

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:37.180
that have this pain, this
challenge, this frustration.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.841
The moment doesn't have to
be profound or dramatic.

00:43:39.841 --> 00:43:42.340
I want you to think about the
stories that I told you today.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.160
One was a story about
giving my dog a pill.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.630
Oh my gosh.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.170
Is this profound?

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.410
No, it's ordinary,
everyday stuff.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.660
But with craft, it
becomes something.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.650
My airport story.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.780
Has anybody else ever
had a delayed flight?

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.140
So is this profound?

00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.640
No.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.660
But with craft, it
becomes something.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.070
The story teaches
us a better way

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.530
to think about something or
a better way to do something.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.570
The story portrays an event that
has special meaning, perhaps

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.590
a turning point in your life.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.360
Now, here is how you start
with the point in mind

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.160
and go on a Google
search for that story.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.200
If you start to search, you say
I want a story about empathy.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.340
I need a story about integrity.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.189
I need a story about innovation.

00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:32.730
So you start with
that point in mind.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.177
You go, OK, I'm going to
search my life for innovation,

00:44:37.177 --> 00:44:37.676
innovation.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.250
Ah, I got nothing.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.120
Ah, I got-- well you
know what you're doing?

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.320
You're doing a Google
search of your entire life,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.610
but you forgot to put some
words in the search box.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.060
Here is the word you
put in the search box.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:01.462
Innovation, where was I living
when I was 30 years of age?

00:45:01.462 --> 00:45:03.170
So what you're doing
is you're going back

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.934
to a specific
moment in your life.

00:45:04.934 --> 00:45:06.600
So you go back to
where were you living.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.050
You go back to an address.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.960
And then you scan, while I was
at that address, what happened?

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.610
Is there anything that happened
while I was in that apartment

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.680
or in that house when I
was 30 years of age that

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.480
had anything to do
with innovation?

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.080
No.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.550
How about my job when I was 30?

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.385
What job did I have?

00:45:26.385 --> 00:45:27.260
What boss did I have?

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.190
What team was I on?

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.060
Anything to do with innovation?

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.950
OK, what about my relationships?

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.771
I was in a relationship with--
who was I in a relationship

00:45:36.771 --> 00:45:37.270
with?

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.180
And you're basically going to
a specific moment in your life

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.650
and scanning that moment
in your life for something

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.840
around innovation.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.110
If you don't find
anything at 30, 32.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.050
Where was I living?

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.800
35, where was I living?

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.969
40, where was I living?

00:45:50.969 --> 00:45:52.510
And you keep doing
this, but you have

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.900
to put search terms in the
Google box of your brain.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.464
And that will help you
to identify a story.

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.630
So I'm going to answer a
couple of questions for you

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.560
before we end here that
are common questions that I

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.060
hear from everybody.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.990
Which comes first, the
story or the point?

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.360
In storytelling and business,
strategic storytelling

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.890
and business,
basically I'm always

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.890
looking from the point of I
need a story to do something.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.540
So I start with
the point in mind.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.510
But occasionally, occasionally
something happens to me

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.750
like this airport story
with the Kansas City airport

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.850
and missing the shuttle
bus and the limo.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.850
And after something
like that happens,

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.680
because I'm a story
guy, because I'm always

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.720
coming from theater and
metaphor, something like that

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:42.030
happens and I'm sitting
back going, huh.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.580
That's interesting.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.927
I thought that the best outcome
would be to either get a taxi,

00:46:46.927 --> 00:46:48.760
but there weren't any,
so to get the shuttle

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.020
would be a positive outcome,
and I'd get there on time.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.730
Didn't get taxi.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.580
Didn't get shuttle.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.290
Got a limo.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.930
Limo's better.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:03.459
Why would I be disappointed
about missing a shuttle bus

00:47:03.459 --> 00:47:04.250
and getting a limo?

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.250
I should be happy that I
missed the shuttle bus.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.710
And I start playing with the
concept, the metaphor of this,

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.510
and I go, ah, now I have to
find out what's the point.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.210
So if you've got a story
from your life and think,

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.740
this is cool stuff.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.700
What's the utility?

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.440
What's the point?

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.900
You have to then go
to, what's the point?

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.480
You don't get to tell it if
it doesn't have a right point.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.840
Which is better, personal
stories or stories

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.770
about other people?

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.130
Well, let's take a vote.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.580
When you're listening to
a story from a speaker,

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.860
from a presenter, somebody
in your organization,

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.100
which one plugs you in more?

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.117
Them telling a story about
something in their life,

00:47:41.117 --> 00:47:42.950
or them telling a story
about somebody else?

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.560
So personal story,
they're telling you

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.380
a personal story, who
thinks that's better?

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.110
Well that's basically
95% of the room.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.770
So you just answered
the question.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.270
You need to be willing to
share stories from your life.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.940
You need to be willing
to share stories

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.490
where you messed up
and learned a lesson.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.580
Here's the challenge.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.500
You are bringing
wisdom to that lesson.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.460
You're bringing wisdom to
that pain or that challenge.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.560
So you're not saying basically,
boy I screw up a lot.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.780
No, you're saying I
was doing this thing.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.450
It didn't turn out the way I
thought it was supposed to.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.324
I learned this
wonderful lesson, and I

00:48:18.324 --> 00:48:19.740
want to share that
wisdom with you

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.030
so I can spare you some pain.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:24.527
So personal stories are best.

00:48:24.527 --> 00:48:26.860
That doesn't mean you can't
have other types of stories.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.470
I'm going to share with you
other types in just a second.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.246
Does the story have to be
true or can you embellish?

00:48:34.246 --> 00:48:34.745
Yes.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.520
Yes, the story has to be true.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.581
Here's the test of any
story that you tell.

00:48:44.581 --> 00:48:46.705
If somebody walks up to
you after your presentation

00:48:46.705 --> 00:48:49.250
and says, did that
really happen to you?

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.120
What does your answer have
to be to be integrity?

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.850
Yes, that really happened to me.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.360
Can you embellish the
story and it still be true?

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.240
Yes.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.490
Oh my gosh, yes.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.090
Do you want to get a laugh?

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.190
Embellish.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.702
Have some fun.

00:49:06.702 --> 00:49:08.910
I don't remember when I was
at the back of the plane.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:14.090
If there was a lady whose entire
life was in the overhead bin

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.880
and in her luggage, I don't
remember that specifically

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.105
about that flight.

00:49:18.105 --> 00:49:20.410
But I fly a lot.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.365
Is that true on just
about every flight,

00:49:22.365 --> 00:49:25.270
that there is somebody who
has never flown in their life,

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.085
and they've got no idea what it
means to fly on a regional jet?

00:49:28.085 --> 00:49:29.790
Am I the only one?

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.250
And so I insert that in.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.760
That's an embellishment.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.720
But the story is true.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.774
That happened to me.

00:49:34.774 --> 00:49:36.940
So it has to be true, and
yes, you can embellish it.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.780
How long should a story be?

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.000
As long as it takes
to be powerful.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.020
I told you two stories today.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.202
The airport story was
about nine minutes long.

00:49:50.202 --> 00:49:51.660
The pill in the
peanut butter story

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.775
was about four minutes long.

00:49:53.775 --> 00:49:56.400
Pill in the peanut butter story
doesn't need to be much longer.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.960
That's the right amount
of time to do that.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.540
The airport story is a much
bigger theatrical story.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.120
That's what it takes to do that.

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.300
Here's a guideline.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.770
Three to six minutes.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.460
Three to six minutes.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.490
But if you think a 30
second vignette is a story,

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.350
you are wrong.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:16.300
It's a vignette.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.180
It's really not that engaging.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.080
It's interesting.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.360
But it's not engaging.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.359
It's not compelling.

00:50:22.359 --> 00:50:23.900
You need to look at
your presentation

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.560
in terms of what
presentation have

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.840
I got that I just have to win.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.310
I have to have a
story that just rocks.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.390
It has to nail it.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.635
I mean, it's just got to
compel people to action.

00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:38.480
I have to get them
to change their mind.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.520
I have to get them to
change their perspective.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.620
I have to move them.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.060
Well, if you want to
move them, then you

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:49.130
need to be moving them with
energy and passion and power

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:52.830
and personality and an
incredibly crafted story,

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.520
a story theater story.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.360
Now, the last one is
how do you determine

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.150
the point of your story?

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:05.710
You don't stick a point
on this just generic,

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.450
I want to tell a
story about this,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.610
and I'm going to stick
this point on this story.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:12.880
You have to look at what did
you do to overcome the obstacle.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.810
When you were in that situation
and that obstacle, that crisis,

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:20.082
that challenge occurred,
what was your process?

00:51:20.082 --> 00:51:21.790
So I want you to take
a look at the story

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.414
that you've got in
your mind right now,

00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:26.360
and I want you to go
back and visualize,

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.820
when that thing
happened, what was

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.309
the first thing that happened?

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:31.600
The second thing that happened?

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.900
Was there a thought?

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.920
Was there emotion?

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.380
Was there an action?

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.367
And then what did I do?

00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:38.450
And then what did I think?

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:39.160
And then what did I feel?

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.130
And then what did I do?

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.910
And literally create a
sequence in your mind

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.590
of every thought, every
action, and every reaction.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:48.320
And sequence that
all out, and then

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.630
look in terms of what
did I do for the lesson.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.790
Now, when I was at the curb
and the shuttle bus went away,

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.900
my first thought was,
I'm going to be late.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.970
And my second thought
was, oh no you're not.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.100
You have a keynote to give.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.560
Come on, find something.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.180
Look around.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.244
Find something.

00:52:08.244 --> 00:52:10.660
So I started to look around,
and I started to look around,

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.060
and I looked, and
there was a limo.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.670
And because my mind
said shuttle bus,

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.045
I hadn't even seen
that there was

00:52:17.045 --> 00:52:18.540
a limo sitting in front of me.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.920
Look for the limo.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.570
So it took me awhile to work
through that process of what

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.260
did I do at the curb.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:30.070
But when I got to the place
where I finally look around

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:34.440
for-- look for the limo.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.110
Good language.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.020
Look for the limo.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.620
That's really cool.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.640
And then you know
the embellishment?

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.810
I gave the words look for
the limo to the limo driver.

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:47.250
I created a Yoda.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:48.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.480
DOUG STEVENSON: That's good.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.530
Because when you
create a Yoda, and you

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.207
give the profound language to
somebody like him, and he says,

00:52:55.207 --> 00:52:56.540
don't look for the shuttle, man.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.540
Look for the limo.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.830
Then you can react to it.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:03.000
You could do what I call
a self-reflective echo.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.211
Look for the limo.

00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:06.415
Look for the limo.

00:53:06.415 --> 00:53:07.790
You guys aren't
even knowing, I'm

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:09.277
doing like 27
techniques in here.

00:53:09.277 --> 00:53:11.610
And they all work really well
because they're subliminal

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.170
and they're cool and they're
a little bit of story theater.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:15.440
Is this fun or what?

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.420
Oh my gosh, I'm keeping
you awake during lunch.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.550
The last one is there are
different kinds of stories

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:24.990
for different situations.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.500
I'm going to just give you nine
different types of stories.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.100
There's a crucible
story, a severe test.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.020
There's an imbroglio
story, a comedy of errors.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.800
There's a profile story,
a story about Larry Page

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.100
and Sergey Brin.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.190
It's a profile story.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:46.870
There is a vignette, which is a
short little interesting thing.

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.680
Not well developed.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.130
There's a credibility story.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.030
That's a story that
you use to sell

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:57.642
yourself, your credibility, in a
job interview or with a client.

00:53:57.642 --> 00:53:59.600
The client wondering,
well who the heck are you

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.539
and what have you ever done
and why should I trust you?

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.080
There's a credibility
story for that.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.020
It's a sales story.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.520
There's a pattern
story where you've

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.419
learned a lesson over
a period of years.

00:54:09.419 --> 00:54:10.960
There's an instructional
story that's

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.219
much more technical,
much more instructional.

00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:14.760
It's got the imagery
and the emotion,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.950
but it's much more
of a technical story.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:19.610
And then finally,
there's a Minerva story.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:21.030
Ancient wisdom.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.930
A Sufi story.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:23.880
A Native American story.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.587
Any kind of a folk story.

00:54:25.587 --> 00:54:27.420
So these are the different
kinds of stories.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.214
Now on the last
page, page six, I'm

00:54:29.214 --> 00:54:30.880
just going to give
you some information.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.000
You could just look
at it at your leisure.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.440
The nine steps of story
structure and the phrase

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.370
that pays, how you
arrive at those.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.280
But here's what I want
you to be aware of.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.090
If you are listening
to this on the feed,

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.530
or if you're watching this on
the Google channel on YouTube,

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:52.300
or if any of you would
like a copy of this handout

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.520
for someone else, or you
would like the article called

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.730
"The Nine Steps of Story
Structure" article,

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:58.950
here's what you do.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:01.090
Send an email to me,
doug@dougstevenson.com.

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:11.235
So D-O-U-G at
D-O-U-G-S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N dot

00:55:11.235 --> 00:55:12.160
com.

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.340
And in the subject line,
just write Google handout.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.160
And I will email a PDF
of this handout to you,

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.630
along with an article on the
nine steps of story structure

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:25.450
that fleshes it out
a little bit more.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.560
So today has been an
absolute joy and a pleasure

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.750
to be on the Google
campus with you

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.600
here in Mountain
View, California.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.500
It's a lovely day.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.750
Go on out and story on.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:37.130
Thank you very much.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.480
[APPLAUSE]
