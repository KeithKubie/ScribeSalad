00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.830
 [Cheers and applause] 

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.230
 (Dan Sandler): Shetima, I'm a little worried 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.301
 About this introduction. 

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.634
 I do not think we ... really did not try this at all. 

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:13.710
 (Chit Haas): [laughing] It will be 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 Very spontaneous, though we have done it 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.820
 Repeatedly. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.980
 I think it's very spontaneous. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.521
 (Dan Sandler): But I am concerned about the introduction itself. 

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.920
 (Chit Haas): Welcome to "What's New in Android". 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.820
 [clap] 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.120
 We are delighted to be in the room. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.745
 I'm sorry for being the smallest room in Shoreline. 

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:33.900
 (Dan): That's true. 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.900
 So there is a place to stand. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.483
 If there is a seat next to you, please raise your hand 

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:41.170
 So that others know that there is a place. 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 That will help a lot. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.749
 I'm Chit Hass from the Android UI Toolkit team. 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.740
 (Dan): I'm Dan Sandler from the Android System UI team 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.420
 I'm Roman Guy from Android. 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.670
 Again, he prepared it again. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.546
 again. 

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:54.239
 [clap] 

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:56.852
 But not in his team, not again. 

00:00:56.852 --> 00:00:57.810
 (Chit): No, no, no. 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.750
 [Laughter] 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.310
 No, it was a successful rebellion. 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.240
 We will not repeat that problem. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.060
 So today we will talk about everything new in Android. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.800
 In detail, after taking all the previous things into account 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.740
 Let's talk about what's new in N. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 Oh, hello. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.297
 Here it is. 

00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:18.130
 We can also call it what's new in Android. 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.713
 In fact, you should call it 

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.904
 What's new in Android. 

00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:24.820
 Because we have talked about these things. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.290
 We hope that everyone here has a general idea in advance. 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.870
 And that you have tried to work with them and complained about the mistakes, 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.119
 You played with new possibilities and features. 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.410
 So we'll talk about it. 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.743
 And also we will talk about some things 

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:42.090
 Which is newer in Developer Freeview 3 and other small things. 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 Lets start. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.800
 The big question is, what does N mean? 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.210
 I think its meaning - we have moved to Russian this time. 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.120
 And of course Nyet means not yet, I will not tell you. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.130
 But its meaning today is N Preview. 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.870
 N Preview 3. 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.324
 So let's talk about - there are several ways 

00:02:11.324 --> 00:02:12.240
 To divide properties, 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.781
 But we think it would be useful 

00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:15.699
 If we talk about what the user actually sees 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:16.990
 And the developers side of it. 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.500
 Then we will talk about the properties that developers see. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.903
 And things related more to the implementation and code that succeeds. 

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:27.156
 Why not start with Dimo. 

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:27.875
 [clap] 

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:29.590
 Yay. 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.140
 Let's talk about Constraint Layouts. 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.180
 He has been mentioned in the keyword in the morning. 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.730
 Steve will talk about it. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.252
 And Roman will tell you what is happening. 

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:45.000
 (Roman): So Constraint Layout is a new interface for Android. 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.610
 It will be in the Unbundled Library 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.540
 You'll be able to include them in your app 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.831
 Without updating the framework. 

00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:53.890
 They are all compatible with Gingerbread. 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.560
 So you can use it in any application you want. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.260
 It is the first interface we designed in conjunction with the same tool. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.550
 When we were designing an interface manager for Android, 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.132
 We also designed this user interface in Android Studio .. 

00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:10.970
 You saw a glimpse of the keyword, but it was hard to see. 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.295
 We have a system that automatically deduces restrictions. 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.930
 There are multiple ways in this new system 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.560
 Which you can create interfaces with. 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.587
 Here for example, I have a button. 

00:03:19.587 --> 00:03:21.920
 As you see when I move it, my lines of help appear. 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.731
 It follows the physical design guidelines, 

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.360
 Which will show the appropriate distance for use between different widgets. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.050
 It shows the right margin between the widget and the screen. 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.840
 Now, if I add another button, I can create a constraint between the two buttons. 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.444
 Now they are straight. 

00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:41.610
 But strong in this new interface editor 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.780
 Is that we operate the computational solutions behind the android interface 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.390
 In the Android Studio at 60 frames per second. 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.890
 When the first button was moved, 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.620
 You see what happens immediately, 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.550
 And how the interface resolves all restrictions. 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.140
 This will give you a much quicker reaction to what is happening. 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.360
 We can also see this before creating constraint. 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.990
 When this limitation is made to the screen limit 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.910
 We'll see you before we leave the mouse button. 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.710
 We'll give you an overview of what happens if you create that restriction. 

00:04:11.714 --> 00:04:13.630
 I'm sure some of you have RelativeLayout Views 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.149
 You may have been surprised by what is happening 

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.519
 When we send an extra widget. 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.440
 Everything goes to another end of the screen. 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 This will not be repeated. 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.350
 So additional restrictions can be created quickly 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.980
 And add the two buttons below. 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.990
 You can also use AutoConnect. 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.860
 If you turn it on when I put a new button on the screen, 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.130
 When you see help lines, for example, in the center of the screen, 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.370
 If you put my buttons here, 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.192
 The system will create restrictions automatically. 

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:46.826
 So I do not have to do it myself. 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.750
 But you can print, change the entries afterwards. 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.380
 You can resize easily, 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.810
 So you can take all the space or leave it all. 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.857
 We also have a percentile move. 

00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.440
 Here, the button was in the middle. 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.400
 But you can say I want him, for example 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.910
 25% from the top of the screen. 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.622
 You will adjust to the size of your screen. 

00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:10.800
 There are other features that we will try on Friday at 9 am. 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.504
 For example, we have a balanced dimension, 

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:13.920
 You can always make widgets 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.280
 1: 1 with a balanced dimension to 16: 9 or any dimensions you want. 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.790
 In the end, the thing you've seen a glimpse of in the keyword. 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.950
 If you put several widgets on the screen, 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:30.150
 To move it as a text field from the top, I will click TextView from the label. 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.100
 Carefully describe them to the user interface. 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.760
 I will destroy all restrictions. 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.990
 Now if you click on this Field Label icon, 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.820
 You'll know what I want to do. 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.665
 My interface will simply work. 

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:43.790
 You will not be locked. 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.140
 You can add the restrictions again. 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.870
 You can change behavior again. 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.180
 I can add another widget. 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.430
 And the work of automatic inference again, 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.013
 You have the right to work 

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:53.220
 On the appropriate user interface, and create them more quickly. 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.010
 [clap] 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.155
 Thanks Roman. 

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:00.655
 And also... 

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:02.370
 Sorry, something extra. 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.660
 This is a small overview. 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.480
 Call it Alpha 1. 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.050
 It's still a rough draft. 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.320
 So upload Android 2.2 Preview. 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.040
 Play it. 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.100
 They gave us complaints about mistakes. 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.520
 I will check the complaints collector myself. 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.420
 I will ask engineers 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.960
 To correct most of those mistakes. 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.477
 We have more on the way. 

00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:21.810
 We are still working on that. 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.661
 This does not represent the final version in any way 

00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.625
 UI and UI editor. 

00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.210
 One last question, 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.040
 how much is it? 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.587
 [Laughter] 

00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:31.670
 100 KB. 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.444
 Is this good? 

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:33.360
 [Laughter] 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.651
 (Dan): But you also, Chit? 

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:36.120
 4 million dollars. 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.620
 [Laughter] 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.530
 Well if they play it. 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.760
 And give us feedback. 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.252
 To get back to the Slids. 

00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:43.210
 But that was a great demo. 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.030
 But I want to see the salads again. 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.750
 (Dan): Good luck coloring that. 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.080
 Excellent. 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.516
 Multiple windows, are the most visible developments in N. 

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:52.720
 It is the possibility of multiple activities on the screen at one time. 

00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:55.470
 There are two kinds of that you may see. 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.230
 Someone is splitting the screen which is side by side. 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.970
 Or if you work horizontally head to tail. 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.250
 If we go to Recents, we can see the screen record here, 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.840
 We have the ability to traction of Recents 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.320
 To half the screen. 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.792
 And the work that you are doing 

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.250
 Be in the other half of the screen. 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.815
 You can click on someone to be your second activity. 

00:07:13.815 --> 00:07:16.190
 When you drag things, you'll notice that Window Manager 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.200
 Simply color the background until you leave the button. 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.110
 And then you have a complete change of order. 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.430
 One of the things that makes it work on its own in your application 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.964
 Is the magic of Android Layouts. 

00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:28.630
 We know how to change the hierarchy. 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.590
 We know how to adjust the interface to suit new sizes 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.290
 And the properties of screen formats. 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.180
 Window Manager will run from above 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.160
 So when you go to the new size and strength 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.220
 With side-by-side interface, your app will work simply. 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.220
 So prefer and test it. 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.678
 Make sure it works the way you want 

00:07:43.678 --> 00:07:47.110
 Either side-by-side or split screen mode. 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.030
 Use the API if you need it. 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.880
 You have the option to do so. 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.470
 It's automatically selected for you by default. 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.970
 But you can say that you do not want 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.030
 Be a scalable activity. 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:02.180
 There are some properties that you can set for default and minimum scaling. 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.520
 You can listen to APIs 

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.870
 To know when the system will become in the multi-window mode 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.040
 Or you are in that way now. 

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.480
 Finally, if you are in multiple window mode 

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.850
 You want to start a new activity to the first, 

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.650
 You can request to be parallel to the first. 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.049
 Go and check it out. 

00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:25.090
 Also check the image in the image mode. 

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.850
 This is the other half of the multi-window mode 

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.860
 Where you can on Android TV 

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.470
 To operate an activity consisting of an image within an image. 

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.220
 For example, playing a full video 

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.179
 With another activity 

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.350
 Users can choose to watch at the same time, 

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.990
 With the first video working in the foreground. 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.220
 For all these properties and more, 

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.327
 Please go to the multiple windows lesson today at 4pm. 

00:08:52.327 --> 00:08:54.660
 There are little photo activities inside the picture, 

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.319
 Basically like the one we saw in the multi-window mode 

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.110
 To see when that will happen 

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.000
 And what can you do after him? 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.230
 There is a new drag and drop property. 

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.500
 We've had drag and drop in the podium 

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.800
 Since Gingerbread at least. 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.440
 We have added to that property now. 

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.250
 Because you are now in a multiplicity mode. 

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.270
 Would not it be nice to pull from one activity to another? 

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.620
 Which was not allowed by the previous drag and drop method 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.670
 Because we did not need to. 

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.190
 But now we want to withdraw material 

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.630
 To and from activities. 

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.770
 So we added a little API 

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.660
 And capabilities that allow you to do so. 

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.930
 See some of the APIs here. 

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.560
 Many of which are about permissions. 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.540
 Probably because that activity 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.630
 He did not want you to copy from the password domain 

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.800
 To your activity. 

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.470
 Or maybe no cat video 

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.890
 To fall on your activity. 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.120
 So there is little giving and taking 

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.430
 To allow for correct permissions. 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.230
 There are also ways to start commands, 

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.340
 Or to cancel orders on their way, 

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.910
 To update Drag Shadow, which has an inappropriate contact name. 

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.834
 This is just the formation of thumbnails 

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:02.000
 For the piece of material being pulled. 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.034
 You can update it for anything you want. 

00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:05.700
 You can also update it repeatedly 

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.874
 If you want to revive shadow formation. 

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:08.790
 (Dan): Yes. 

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.050
 (Chit): If that's your intention. 

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.550
 So we can see a quick record of the screen. 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.580
 You can see it working here. 

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.230
 Well, to see. 

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.620
 These are some of our internal democracies. 

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.960
 They will be published as an article and a demo 

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.300
 You can run it externally. 

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.490
 It shows the initial interaction 

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.271
 To drag an article that does not have permissions 

00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:28.020
 In spite of giving them permissions 

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.560
 And thus have the ability to draw between applications. 

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.230
 Let us move forward. 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.840
 So we have notifications. 

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.760
 (Dan): Well, then you all saw us 

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.280
 We do this lecture in advance, I hope so. 

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.738
 And you know that this is the part 

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.860
 Where he stole the talk for a quarter of an hour, 

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.151
 To talk about all the new things in brilliant alerts. 

00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:45.490
 But this is not true this time because they gave me my own talk. 

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.001
 So go back to the 9 am. 

00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:49.250
 We will be deeply involved in everything that is new and exciting 

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.180
 In Android and Android 2.0 notifications 

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.280
 Which you have seen in the keynote address. 

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.980
 I will ... 

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.470
 (Chit): Give me the cursor right away. 

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.670
 No, I have not finished yet. 

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.336
 wait. 

00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:59.160
 [Laughter] 

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.130
 I just want to mention some of the things I want you to pay attention to, 

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.960
 Or maybe to attract you to learn more 

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.550
 Or read about them in designer documents. 

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.850
 First we have new interfaces for the first time, 

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.967
 The fact since Honeycomb. 

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:11.550
 With we had told the material a bit 

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.010
 Since a few updates ago. 

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.700
 Some of the new interfaces to move things a bit, 

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.205
 And create new versions of the application 

00:11:17.205 --> 00:11:18.330
 Which sent the alerts. 

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.380
 So you will always know 

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.050
 He who puts things in your faces. 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.687
 We also have bundled notifications, 

00:11:23.687 --> 00:11:26.020
 Which we designed mainly for Android ware. 

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.960
 And finally became possible on mobile and Tab, 

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.240
 The possibility of collecting such notifications. 

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.170
 We also have a direct response, 

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.000
 A property touch the answer button, and then write directly into the shadow. 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.540
 This is also one of the things that have been in Android ware for some time now. 

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.216
 You can talk to your watch 

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:43.420
 And make them send a message. 

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.790
 Now you can do the same even from the locked screen, 

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.962
 If the user has allowed it. 

00:11:47.962 --> 00:11:50.170
 Since I'm here and talking about UI-related things, 

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.419
 I would like to talk to you about quick settings. 

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:53.889
 We finally did what the user asked us to do 

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:55.680
 A long time ago, 

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.620
 Is to make them changeable. 

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.440
 We now allow you to choose Add or Cancel 

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.710
 Any of the quick settings you want. 

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.220
 We have actually what is better and is called the most rapid settings. 

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.690
 I think I invented that name now. 

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.273
 The fastest setting is the five-point list, 

00:12:06.273 --> 00:12:08.270
 Any of the five most frequently used settings 

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.271
 Which appear at the top of the list of alerts 

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.520
 At any time you look at it. 

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.900
 If you move them to get the five favorite 

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.680
 You'll be able to reach them in one touch, 

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.022
 Any time you look at your notices. 

00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:20.840
 [clap] 

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.100
 But see. 

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.710
 there is more. 

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.407
 So the designers who follow us at home, 

00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:28.990
 Learn from the end profile that you can create 

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.570
 Your Quick Settings Now 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.219
 Which any Android N user can carry. 

00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:37.010
 So, take a look at the API documentation 

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.360
 About TileService. 

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.952
 This will create a complete life cycle around the Quick Configuration Panels 

00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:42.910
 Which allows you to know when the user added the tile to the list, 

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.430
 When the tiles are seen. 

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.590
 If you want to live updates, you can do that. 

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.131
 And then most important of course 

00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:52.860
 What to do when the user clicks on the tile. 

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.849
 When you call getQsTile you will get a handle 

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:57.140
 For the purpose of the tile, which bear all cases 

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.370
 It allows you to do things like changing the icon, 

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.950
 Change the address, enter and exit the event status, 

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.420
 Which allows you to reduce or decrease the light 

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.170
 Whether that resource was available. 

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.919
 After all these changes have been made, 

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.650
 Please do not forget to send the updateTile. 

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.922
 So this is perfect for your settings. 

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:12.463
 That's a quick property to apply 

00:13:12.463 --> 00:13:15.080
 You know that the user wants to access it from their closed screen. 

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.260
 If you are busy building your smart home, 

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.770
 The first thing you want to do is create a quick button 

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.830
 From your phone so you can turn it on 

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.530
 And make it play your own music when you enter your home. 

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.146
 This is exactly what quick settings do. 

00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:27.520
 The last thing you have to do is etc etc etc ... 

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.820
 Things on the menu 

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.110
 To make sure you have all the correct permissions 

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.485
 To identify the user interface as a tile in quick settings 

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:35.362
 Know what to do with them. 

00:13:35.362 --> 00:13:37.320
 Let's talk about blocking the screen a bit. 

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.153
 This is really a property to allow access 

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:43.840
 Which we offer within N to increase and replace font size. 

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.480
 Font size has always been subject to change 

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.604
 In Android for a long time. 

00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:49.540
 You know, developers, if you specify the characters in ASPI 

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.572
 Which doubles the font size selected by the user 

00:13:51.572 --> 00:13:54.030
 So the user can say that he needs a little more help, 

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.848
 Or he wants to see a little more words on the screen. 

00:13:56.848 --> 00:13:58.800
 But as you also know, stylists 

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.570
 That ASPI is very limited, right? 

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.590
 We do not change models by font size. 

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.440
 You can encapsulate content to resolve these shapes. 

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.020
 But there are certain parts of the system 

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.570
 Such as notifications, 

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.987
 Which did not adapt 

00:14:08.987 --> 00:14:10.028
 Well done. 

00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:11.600
 Because the geometry size 

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.180
 Did not change to acclimate to the added words. 

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.390
 Now we have a screen size property in Android N. 

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.720
 Go to the screen settings, and click on them. 

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.120
 The point per inch will change on the device at run time. 

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.910
 It becomes a new way to change all the user interface on the device 

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.990
 New density is not just words. 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.740
 So you can zoom in or out 

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.190
 So you can get the most benefits from that small screen. 

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.400
 You can use 0.85 to 1 or 1/2. 

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.400
 I do not have to explain this now. 

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.970
 But please avoid pixels in your designs. 

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.660
 Because this will change the density on your computer, 

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.750
 This will double if you use non-device pixels 

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.281
 In your designs and other calculations. 

00:14:53.289 --> 00:14:54.830
 The other thing you have to do, 

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.190
 I will show you some little video to illustrate it, 

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.689
 Is to make sure your app works 

00:14:58.689 --> 00:14:59.735
 Very well in sw320dp. 

00:14:59.735 --> 00:15:00.390
 I know, 

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.060
 I know we all carry those big paintings 

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:04.900
 Which we call phones. 

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.940
 There are very small screens too. 

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.440
 But if the user does not have a sudden density 

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.260
 So that the screen is actually sw320dp, 

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.770
 Your app will need to handle it smoothly. 

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.780
 We have a video here to show you what is happening right away. 

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.240
 This is a direct volume change. 

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.760
 Enter the screen size, 

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.980
 Move the button larger or smaller. 

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.960
 And believes that everything will change in size, 

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.180
 Not only words, but the navigation bar and status bar, 

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.420
 And all those important things. 

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.600
 In fact, I have an explanation here. 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.510
 This is the default size appearance. 

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.230
 If you change the font size only, some things will grow bigger, 

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.120
 But other things will not be affected. 

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.100
 Of course, the screen size will change everything. 

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.209
 You can finally make every part of the user interface 

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:48.250
 Large sized decent view 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.910
 Or small enough to store all this information on the screen. 

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.077
 Let's talk about localities. 

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.160
 (Chit): Yeah, let's do it. 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.400
 Well thank Dan. 

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.178
 Multiple sweeteners. 

00:15:57.178 --> 00:15:58.670
 [clap] 

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.170
 no no no. 

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.170
 I will not do it yet. 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.070
 [Laughter] 

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.970
 You know what wonderful, 

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.110
 Is to see the geometry and shape of the shed 

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.640
 According to empty seats in the hall. 

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.249
 It's very hot there, is not it? 

00:16:09.249 --> 00:16:11.290
 (Dan): That's one of the reasons why you watch a 360 broadcast. 

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.140
 (Chit): Yes. 

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.690
 But it is not hot at home for live broadcast. 

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.690
 Well for those who come home, 

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.940
 Let us talk about the multiple mullahs. 

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.210
 But demand was heavy in several editions. 

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.000
 We discovered that outside our country 

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.780
 People speak different languages. 

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.980
 [Laughter] 

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.560
 That's true. 

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.400
 I was told that. 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.190
 People like you. 

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.840
 For these people, it is very difficult to deal with the user interface. 

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.934
 Because sometimes you may want some content or some applications 

00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:40.100
 To speak to you using one of these languages, 

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.570
 Or that there is a different regression from the system assumptions 

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.510
 When it does not have the appropriate resources, 

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.010
 Whatever. 

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.760
 There are many accidents 

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.940
 Where you already want to adjust several languages ​​and localities to work with. 

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.010
 Now we can do it. 

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.720
 Not only can you adjust all these languages, 

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.900
 But their order according to 

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.310
 What you want to do on your device. 

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.880
 You can also add some new languages ​​and styles 

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.870
 Which we have added. 

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.069
 We have a record of the screen here 

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.839
 Let's see how to choose it. 

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.160
 Go to languages, 

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.819
 I had only one selected, 

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:11.869
 I do not know why. 

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.249
 Let's go and choose the duet. 

00:17:14.249 --> 00:17:17.050
 Which are German, not Dutch, 

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.520
 For your information only. 

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.890
 I will choose the style of Liechtenstein, 

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.510
 Because I think it's funny. 

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.359
 And then register it and put it first. 

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.210
 Suddenly I can not read my user interface. 

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.910
 Because it has become the basic language 

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.310
 Of the whole system. 

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.386
 These are multiple localities, I hope you use them. 

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.510
 Let's talk about the status of the goat. 

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.510
 We have had a parachute in Marshmallow. 

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.780
 So I'll reconsider it a bit. 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.150
 A chart of health workers has been stolen from the system, 

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.467
 So I think it's easy to understand. 

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:48.050
 I will put the chart there. 

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.110
 You will understand directly what the status of the funeral. 

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.550
 It is quite clear as I think. 

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.710
 But I will clarify some things 

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.160
 And alert you to the important in it. 

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.270
 First, it begins to work when the screen is locked, 

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.170
 The device is stationary, works on its battery, 

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.429
 It will work for a short time. 

00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:04.970
 It then begins to sleep 

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.540
 Here is the bottom where you see that green part 

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.040
 Here at the bottom. 

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.914
 And then there are these windows for maintenance 

00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:13.110
 Which appears now and suddenly 

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.550
 Activities can operate on the system, 

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.320
 And to carry out its normal tasks during those windows. 

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.760
 And then we have these periods growing exponentially 

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.450
 Between those windows. 

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.000
 They talk over time. 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.210
 At the same time we have these conditions of the goat, 

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.070
 Where activities do not do much. 

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.580
 No network connection. 

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.650
 There are deferred jobs and jobs. 

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.977
 There is no WakeLocks. 

00:18:35.977 --> 00:18:36.560
 All good. 

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.680
 This allows for longer battery life. 

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.716
 All this is easy to understand. 

00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:42.340
 But let's go inside and talk about N. 

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.620
 So in N we have all these things. 

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.450
 But also we have this situation, put the lighter lighter extra 

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.039
 Which does not require you to be consistent. 

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:55.580
 So also the phone can 

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.280
 Be in someone's pocket for a very long time 

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.270
 Without being used. 

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.790
 Would not be nice in that case that the activities do not eat 

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.310
 Of battery power then? 

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.722
 He will pay attention to this unstable situation. 

00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:07.930
 And wait for some time, 

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.550
 Then the status of the goat begins. 

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.425
 Then comes maintenance windows. 

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:13.310
 You have less activity, 

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.930
 Not like Marshmallow but the same idea here. 

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.690
 All this is easy to understand again. 

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.749
 We will note on the graph that you have similar colors 

00:19:24.749 --> 00:19:26.040
 For some materials there. 

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.831
 Which means that they are put together together. 

00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:30.330
 In the end, we have a similar bar code. 

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.490
 All of this is understandable. 

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.990
 [Laughter] 

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.909
 Let us note that the capabilities of N, 

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:36.450
 Putting light snakes that you talked about, 

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.880
 It is actually totals of function mainly. 

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.480
 We have all the things from N when the device is stationary, 

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.890
 In addition to this light situation all the time. 

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.640
 If we really want to understand it, 

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.020
 We will put the data charges together, 

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.580
 It will become this way. 

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.150
 [Laughter] 

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.110
 I will say as I said earlier, this is clear. 

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.650
 [clap] 

00:19:59.352 --> 00:20:01.310
 Some people thought it would use more words. 

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.560
 We explain that quickly. 

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.760
 In Marshmallow you have the device. 

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.530
 Screen is locked. 

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.790
 It works on battery. 

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.062
 The place is fixed. 

00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:09.520
 At that time you can not easily use the network. 

00:20:10.478 --> 00:20:13.400
 Your activities and stimuli have been delayed and there is no WakeLocks. 

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.050
 The service will be restricted in light mode N, 

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.610
 In all of the above. 

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.610
 But it should not be fixed. 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.490
 It can be moving in your pocket or wherever it is. 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.940
 Then you have fewer restrictions. 

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.230
 Because there is a spasm of activities in the background 

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.390
 Which are still available at the time. 

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.130
 Please go to modern battery and memory optimizations 

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.390
 Today at 5 pm to learn more about this topic 

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.522
 As well as things related to system health. 

00:20:37.522 --> 00:20:39.480
 When I talk about the health aspects of the system, 

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.932
 Let's talk about the Svelte project. 

00:20:40.932 --> 00:20:43.390
 This project has been underway for a number of issues 

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.770
 To see everything going on in the system 

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.110
 Of things that make the battery lose its capacity faster, 

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.750
 And then see what we can say to the conciliators to correct in the application 

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.610
 And to work on that requirement, as well as what we can do on the platform. 

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.645
 So we did. 

00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:02.437
 In N you can bid farewell to the following orders. 

00:21:02.437 --> 00:21:04.020
 I'm sure we'll miss them so much. 

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.000
 But they had to be uprooted. 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.550
 There are those cases that we have noticed, 

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.220
 While the research team is working 

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.930
 That something might happen 

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.370
 Such as communication order, 

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.155
 A message appears, 

00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:16.780
 All activities are covered. 

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.989
 Because they wanted to know when the Wi-Fi network had changed. 

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.020
 For example, if you walk in your office building, 

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.960
 Moving from router to router, 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.490
 All such activities, 

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.140
 What will they do? 

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:28.640
 nothing. 

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.810
 Then they will go back to sleep. 

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.600
 At the same time the system has been shocked. 

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.850
 Because they all woke up, 

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.120
 They will not be able to remember all of them at the same time. 

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.690
 We will get rid of the ancients to allow the newcomers, 

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.300
 Then we get into this shocking situation. 

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.910
 Similarly in new videos and photos. 

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.390
 The user taped a picture, 

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:50.780
 An expense report decides that it wants to know the new image. 

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.030
 Because it was probably a sign of a bill. 

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.640
 The application will be added to 50 of his friends, 

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.461
 It will be noticed that the picture is not important to him 

00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:00.710
 For it is for one of the cats that she has met. 

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.043
 The application will then return to sleep. 

00:22:02.043 --> 00:22:03.370
 This is also shocking to the system. 

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.260
 Why not underestimate those things and increase battery life 

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.790
 And the age of the device to be more useful to the user 

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.420
 Simply delete all those messages? 

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.187
 In fact, the new method is to use JobScheduler, 

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:15.770
 Which we have been talking about for several years now. 

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.353
 There is a special programming interface new applications you should pay attention to, 

00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:22.030
 Which allows you to ask when the content changes. 

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.990
 Not directly, because the problem was so 

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.110
 In the old method. 

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.590
 But with time, when the scheduled work is done, 

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.680
 You will be able to find out if there is any new content that interests you. 

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.710
 Again, go to the Talk Improvement Battery and Memory 

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.350
 To learn more about these things. 

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.266
 (Dan): And then that application will call you back 

00:22:37.266 --> 00:22:38.572
 To take pictures of the cat as you like. 

00:22:38.572 --> 00:22:40.030
 Yes Yes, 

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.194
 It turned out that the bell on the cat was important to determine the expenses. 

00:22:43.194 --> 00:22:44.610
 Yes, good point, thank you. 

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.635
 Well, Data Saver has now become possible for the user 

00:22:52.815 --> 00:22:55.430
 That says to the device or system 

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.530
 It wants to restrict the size of the data 

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.840
 Which is used by applications. 

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.660
 Here, for example, where I live, 

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.730
 I do not care much about Wi-Fi, 

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.010
 Because I have an unlimited data subscription. 

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.150
 It's not a big problem. 

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.480
 But this is not true for the world. 

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.380
 People may pay very high overpriced 

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.660
 For network subscriptions, 

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.640
 Or may be too slow. 

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.530
 So everyone may not want to use the limited data they own. 

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.080
 Or perhaps have restrictions. 

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.970
 Here we give them the ability to really reduce it, 

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.340
 Not just say that we use less data, 

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.130
 But to tell applications whether the data is available to them, restricted, or completely prohibited. 

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:34.390
 There's a place to go in your system settings now 

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.790
 You can choose this for each application. 

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.710
 In terms of designers, you should pay attention to this. 

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.600
 Because you may be banned at any time. 

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.490
 There are ways in your system 

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.500
 To see if this happens, 

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.500
 In order to search for a communication service, 

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.100
 And see if you are a - on a restricted network 

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.790
 Or (b) whether access in the background is available or restricted at that time. 

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.300
 (Roman): Direct Boot is one of my favorite features in Android N. 

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.210
 If you have a PIN code on your device, 

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.529
 And you have encrypted the device, 

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:11.820
 If the device is restarted for some reason, to upload an update, 

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.500
 Or automatic updates are effective, 

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.380
 Or to restart amnesty, 

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.697
 You will notice that your phone is stuck on the PIN code screen, 

00:24:19.697 --> 00:24:21.280
 It is waiting for you to enter your password. 

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.320
 You may lose messages, e-mail or even calls at the time. 

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.850
 Now, what the system does 

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.641
 Is that it will work until the lock screen 

00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:31.200
 Before asking for a PIN code. 

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.370
 And until the password is entered 

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.259
 Some apps will work. 

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:36.800
 You can register your app 

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.850
 In order to be able to operate in this mode from Direct Boot, 

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.600
 Which means that even from that closed screen 

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.766
 You can do some tasks, 

00:24:42.766 --> 00:24:44.909
 Such as receiving calls or messages. 

00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:46.450
 If you want to know more about this, 

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.741
 And find out what you can do in your app 

00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:51.100
 To work in that situation, I beg you to come to talk 

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.280
 Thursday at 9 am. 

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.380
 Will be within the modern Android protection. 

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.900
 Another feature has been asked a lot, 

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.560
 Are access to specific directories 

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.090
 On external memory. 

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.100
 If your app wants to look at images, 

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.000
 Music, video, or anything else 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.400
 In the external memory of the user, 

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.260
 Until now you should have requested access to the entire memory. 

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.920
 That was a somewhat scary permit 

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.260
 For users who wanted to download the app 

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.440
 From the Play Store. 

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.795
 Now, however, as we see on the picture, 

00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:22.520
 Your app can select the request 

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.260
 For one place or directory in memory, such as photos or music only. 

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.020
 And combined with the new permissions system in N, 

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.430
 It becomes very clear to the user 

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.090
 What is the work of the application, 

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.181
 And what the app can access. 

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.934
 (Chit): Androde to work. 

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:41.600
 I advise you to go to their talk. 

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.890
 There are a lot of events there. 

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.380
 I just want to mention some properties 

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.070
 Especially in Android to work in this version. 

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.830
 So go to the talk on Thursday at 2:00 am Your Apps at Work. 

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.970
 Please listen to him, 

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.710
 But at the same time if you have profiles installed to work on your phone, 

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.251
 There is a new feature called Work Mode. 

00:25:56.251 --> 00:26:00.010
 Which is in fact to abolish the working status of work. 

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.142
 So they are with a question mark 

00:26:02.142 --> 00:26:02.850
 In front of the ferry 

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.000
 Non-working mode! 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.630
 You can go to Quick Settings 

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.392
 And stop its work easily. 

00:26:08.392 --> 00:26:10.350
 You will see, I do not know if you see it on the screen, 

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.040
 The Work Profile application has been shut down. 

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.120
 If you click on one of these, 

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.730
 You'll get a small message telling you no no no, 

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.780
 This does not work now. 

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.400
 So it's easy to turn on and off this job. 

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.941
 You can spend the weekend 

00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:25.190
 Without seeing the e-mail if you like. 

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.770
 There is also something called the Work Challenge. 

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.390
 Which we hope will be removed from some ugly endorsements 

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.090
 Carried out by some companies. 

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.589
 They will need the more restricted password 

00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:35.630
 And what follows on the screen. 

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.840
 They will no longer need to do that. 

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.510
 They can provide a password 

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.870
 Use only when a Work Profile application is running. 

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.620
 We'll see a small screen record about it. 

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.860
 If you want to apply a Work Profile, 

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.140
 Your password will be confirmed here, 

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.012
 The application starts. 

00:26:51.012 --> 00:26:53.220
 Now if you enter and run another application, 

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.730
 Will enter it directly, 

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.570
 Because you have already entered your password 

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.012
 To the entire system. 

00:26:59.012 --> 00:27:00.470
 (Roman): But now the real reason 

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.979
 For our presence here, the characteristics of designers. 

00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:05.270
 The largest one has been mentioned in the keyword. 

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.470
 They are run-time changes. 

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.470
 Now we have a much faster translator, 

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.420
 Which means that when your app is loaded, 

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.870
 Will not be pre-assembled like what was in Lollipop and Marshmallow. 

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.910
 But will work first in the development of translation. 

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.290
 And when JIT sees the code snippet in your app 

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.150
 That are running frequently, or that may benefit from higher performance, 

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.540
 You will start working and assembling things in just the right time. 

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.670
 When your device is idle, 

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.640
 We will collect some information collected by JIT 

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.170
 To assemble part of the application in advance in the capacity of time. 

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.500
 We are actually doing three operations, 

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.607
 Compiler, and JIT assembling in advance in the capacity of time. 

00:27:39.607 --> 00:27:40.690
 Ask us for a few years. 

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.981
 We have tried these three in the past. 

00:27:41.981 --> 00:27:45.420
 Now we are all doing them at the same time. 

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.780
 I sincerely advise you to come and talk on Friday 

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.360
 1 pm from ART, The Evolution of ART. 

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.500
 They will give you much more information on how this works. 

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.420
 We have new libraries from Runtime Libraries. 

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.920
 One of their chiefs is ICU4J, which is now part of the framework. 

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.520
 The ICU library is useful for globalization, 

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.370
 And the web civilization of your application. 

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.095
 It's a fairly large library. 

00:28:06.095 --> 00:28:07.580
 It is now part of the framework 

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.176
 In the name of a different package so as not to conflict with other package names. 

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.273
 And is now reliable in the framework of action. 

00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:15.460
 You can reduce the size of your APK. 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.680
 We also added some java.util bouquets 

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.590
 So there is java.util.function 

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.930
 Which contain classes and APIs 

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.290
 Useful for programming practical method such as Predicates. 

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.280
 We also have a new Streaming API 

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.420
 Very useful when we combine them with the characteristics of the new language. 

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.300
 If you want to use one of the new language properties in Java 8, 

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.860
 You have to change some of the gradlebuildfile files 

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.620
 To switch to the new Jack compiler. 

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.630
 You also have to say that you want binary compatibility and my resources 

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:47.210
 With version 1.8 of the programming language. 

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.370
 After doing so you have access to Lambdas properties. 

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.470
 The Lambdas were implemented using unknowns in your ranks, 

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.020
 In rapid speech, 

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.640
 Which means they are compatible with the systems to Gingerbread. 

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.557
 You have some examples of what Lambdas is. 

00:29:01.557 --> 00:29:04.015
 If you do not know what they are, or have never used, 

00:29:04.015 --> 00:29:06.186
 There are many documents and articles on the net. 

00:29:06.186 --> 00:29:07.540
 Go and take a look. 

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.290
 Will make your life much better, 

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.940
 Especially if you are using RxJava 

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.730
 Or just an Android framework for the user interface. 

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.975
 Lambdas makes anything that needs a lot more work easier. 

00:29:18.975 --> 00:29:20.850
 But be careful because these things 

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.131
 Create many anonymous rows. 

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.640
 It is actually a little more expensive compared to what is apparent. 

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.710
 But that will not affect most applications. 

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.444
 Default and Static Interface 

00:29:33.444 --> 00:29:34.985
 They are very useful properties, unfortunately 

00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:36.389
 Not compatible with legacy systems. 

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:37.930
 If you have an existing interface, 

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.230
 You can now add new methods and pull out our default settings, 

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.840
 Much like you can do in abstract rows. 

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.810
 This is very important for moving your APS forward without breaking 

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.585
 Everything or break your customers. 

00:29:50.585 --> 00:29:53.934
 You can also use it to create a famous converter style 

00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:56.350
 Which you may have seen with a lot of listeners. 

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.640
 If your listener has several ways to reconnect, 

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.264
 There is usually a transformer row 

00:30:00.264 --> 00:30:02.254
 Comes to his side and has an empty execution 

00:30:02.254 --> 00:30:04.670
 For all these methods, 

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.767
 If you want to implement only one of these methods, 

00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:08.350
 You do not have to advertise them completely. 

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.910
 This is now very easy with default methods. 

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:15.200
 You can use static methods on the interfaces. 

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.514
 Repeat the blogging, I'm sure many of you 

00:30:17.514 --> 00:30:19.430
 All these frames are used for business 

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.180
 With lots of blogging, but you like this property. 

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.710
 Which unfortunately do not correspond to the old systems. 

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.545
 But that means that now, with one pedigree, 

00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:29.060
 As in the @Exportable example at the bottom, 

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.520
 It can be written several times on the same type. 

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.214
 For example, we have a row here 

00:30:34.214 --> 00:30:36.630
 We want to appreciate its publication in episodes on different formats. 

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.220
 We can reuse the code instead of using the arrays 

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.250
 Of the values ​​in the code. 

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.770
 The audio team, or the media team, is working very hard 

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.650
 In older versions of Android to reduce audio latency. 

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.510
 Much of this work has already been done at local levels of the system. 

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:58.235
 In the end they worked to reduce the ambient noise in the upper layers. 

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.870
 You can predict, depending on your device, of course, 

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.749
 Latency is worth 40 to 70 milliseconds when playing sound. 

00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:05.790
 Very easy to activate. 

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.590
 You can see an example here on the screen. 

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.460
 When you create sound features for your media player 

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.909
 You can set it to low latency. 

00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:15.200
 We will give you access to this property. 

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.991
 There are also some APIs 

00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:18.220
 You can use it to optimize playback. 

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.130
 You can create numbers for underruns 

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.560
 Which occur when running the media. 

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.160
 You can also resize dynamically 

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.910
 For your ideas to carry out the work in case there are many underruns. 

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.150
 If you want to learn more about it, 

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.566
 Especially if you want to know 

00:31:30.566 --> 00:31:33.290
 How to use APIs to increase latency more, 

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:38.360
 You can go to talk on Thursday at 3pm. 

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.260
 Renderscript is a set of improvements. 

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.800
 Is now in the consolidated resource file. 

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.960
 You can have many nuclei that can not communicate with each other. 

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.470
 This makes it easier to create complex software. 

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.800
 We also have decreasing nuclei. 

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.119
 You can make a Map Reduce type from the API. 

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:55.160
 For example, if you want to computerize a graph, 

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.890
 You can do this with a decreasing nucleus. 

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.010
 You have access to several photos. 

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.716
 We added Allocation.getByteBuffer, 

00:32:00.716 --> 00:32:02.090
 And it will help you to minimize 

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.850
 Of the number of allocations that occur when the Renderscript kernel is running. 

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.630
 In the end, if you're working with a lot of data, 

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.910
 We have support for floating-point numbers from 16-bit, 

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.382
 Which helps you reduce your data size by half. 

00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:15.840
 If accuracy works for you, 

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.310
 You should definitely consider it. 

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.237
 And to the graphics people, OpenGL ES 3.2 

00:32:21.237 --> 00:32:22.820
 It is the newest version of OpenGL ES 

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.930
 Which we send with Android N, 

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.760
 It is practically OpenGL ES 3.1 plus something 

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.530
 Named Android accessories package. 

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.530
 The Android Extensions package was a set of OpenGL extensions 

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.090
 So that if the package is on the machine itself 

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.860
 You are guaranteed access to all of those accessories. 

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.720
 It has greatly facilitated the lives of OpenGL designers. 

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.410
 So it was wrapped with the needs of OpenGL ES 3.2 itself except one NEN plug-in 

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.184
 Which you see on the slide. 

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:52.880
 Some glimpses contain advanced mixing equations. 

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.379
 So the device will handle all things mixing modes 

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:59.240
 That you find in Photoshop or their image editing program. 

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.261
 You do not have to write the glosses anymore, 

00:33:01.261 --> 00:33:02.170
 Because it is part of OpenGL. 

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.299
 You can use mosaics coverings and engineering solutions. 

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:06.590
 These are very useful for creating runtime geometry. 

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.537
 So usually you can do is create a fairly simple network, 

00:33:09.537 --> 00:33:11.370
 The closer you get to the thing, 

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.490
 You can dynamically increase triangles 

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.160
 To show it smoother on the screen 

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.440
 Without the use of large memory or greater performance 

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.470
 When you do not need those triangles. 

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.136
 There is a new compressed format for installation 

00:33:21.136 --> 00:33:23.880
 Called ASTC in addition to some other properties 

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.567
 Which you will love very much if you use OpenGL ES. 

00:33:27.567 --> 00:33:29.400
 Vulkan has also mentioned in the keyword, 

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.129
 Here are some additional details. 

00:33:31.129 --> 00:33:33.170
 There will be a talk of his own 

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.440
 Today at 6 pm. 

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.470
 The Vulkan is a GUI-level API for graphics. 

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.100
 Its level is lower than OpenGL. 

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.350
 Somehow, you actually become the driver. 

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.989
 You can generate commands for the GPU 

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:46.530
 From a variety of topics, 

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.670
 Which will help improve the efficiency of your application. 

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.150
 There is not as much overhead in the same driver. 

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.490
 You can make more call charges. 

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.560
 You can fill the screen with more material. 

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.754
 You can also group shadings in advance without connecting to the intranet, 

00:33:58.754 --> 00:34:00.295
 This is very useful in investigations 

00:34:00.295 --> 00:34:02.750
 Or to make heavy improvements, 

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.700
 Because program drivers on the device are trying to find a balance between optimizing shadings 

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.310
 Not spending too much time to assemble them. 

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.840
 It is also a multi-device API. 

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.040
 The Vulkan also appears in Android N, 

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.920
 Is Vulkan itself which you will find in Windows and Linux. 

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.480
 Program operators are sold from today. 

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.370
 So you can write your code on my desktop, 

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.370
 And then run it on your phone. 

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.385
 It's also a bit harder than OpenGL ES. 

00:34:25.385 --> 00:34:29.803
 You must manage memory and sync by selecting. 

00:34:29.803 --> 00:34:33.151
 So we are expected to see great natamia in Vulkan equipment. 

00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:36.150
 Engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.090
 Works to support Vulkan or have support for it. 

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.639
 Your position will be good if you are using one of these engines. 

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.681
 Your apps will be better than no price. 

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.139
 (Chit): There have been improvements 

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:49.810
 For adb in terms of efficiency and performance. 

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.540
 We made it more perfect in character, more like the structure. 

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.290
 For example, you can get something larger than something like LS. 

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.620
 You can take results from what happens in adb 

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.960
 And pass them to other operations on the host. 

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.437
 You can do things more perfect in its properties. 

00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:06.770
 There are also significant improvements to performance 

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.435
 Especially for payment and withdrawal 

00:35:08.435 --> 00:35:10.530
 By a very complex algorithm 

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.314
 The increase in size of the beaver is called. 

00:35:13.314 --> 00:35:15.050
 [Laughter] 

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.570
 This is how we work here in Google. 

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.830
 [Laughter] 

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.330
 So... 

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:19.743
 (Dan): Come on ... 

00:35:19.743 --> 00:35:21.470
 (Chit): If you know adb, you will not have a choice. 

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.449
 But you will enjoy it. 

00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:24.240
 (Roman): Get the status of the checkout process 

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.350
 And the possibility of passing standard data 

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.230
 The remote machine can be very useful to have automatic tests, for example. 

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.541
 You can turn on many automatic things on your device 

00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:35.870
 And get the correct results. 

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.870
 Everything we changed in NDK, 

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.880
 Is that we have brought Clang to 3.8 and GCC to 4.9. 

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.510
 But with the GCC, 

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.070
 This will be the latest version of the GCC 

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.840
 Which works with NDK. 

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.160
 If you are not using GCC, 

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.170
 This is the time to test your application NDK with Clang. 

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.780
 It is time to move forward. 

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.190
 We made arm7 architecture the default. 

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.980
 You can forget the old architecture. 

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.230
 It will be your logo now 

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.040
 To benefit from improvements 

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.399
 Which take into account today's hardware requirements. 

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.940
 (Chit): VR, we've heard a little about him 

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.580
 In the keyword. 

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.330
 And you have a chance to hear more about him 

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.560
 During the rest of this week. 

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.810
 I wanted to talk about the huge server space of the API 

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.250
 Which you should pay attention to. 

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.457
 First you need to know the characteristics of the device. 

00:36:23.457 --> 00:36:25.568
 The devices are a bit limited in capacity 

00:36:25.568 --> 00:36:27.450
 Owned as we heard in the keyword. 

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.180
 Then, pay attention to this API. 

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.670
 I will say that you want other information, 

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.780
 Please go to your talk. 

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.690
 As we have seen there are many conversations. 

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.780
 Another Mary was asked there were about 18 conversations on VR. 

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.530
 Choose whatever you want. 

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.580
 I think that the biggest of them, 

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.663
 Where they will talk about technical details, 

00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:46.530
 It is tomorrow morning at about nine o'clock. 

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.470
 But make sure the table. 

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.254
 You will know if you are using the VR statement. 

00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:52.920
 It is a ... 

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.960
 (Dan) Sorry, did you say VR? 

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.705
 (CHIT): VR. 

00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:56.440
 He noted that there were four quotations. 

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.300
 Not just two. 

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:57.670
 It's four. 

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.220
 (Dan): Did you say four? 

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:58.990
 Okay. 

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.586
 (Chit): In each hand. 

00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:00.260
 Okay. 

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.170
 (Roman): I will just add that if you do not write 

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.990
 Experience a VR, a game, or a virtual museum, 

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.230
 Etc., this API will not benefit you. 

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.280
 Do not run it in your app just because you think it might speed up its work. 

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:12.970
 It's not for you. 

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.820
 It is for VR virtual reality experts only. 

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.600
 (Chit): Well! 

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.100
 not for you. 

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.100
 (Roman): Not you. 

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.205
 [Laughter] 

00:37:19.205 --> 00:37:22.890
 (Chit): Well, the Suppot Library support library is new in N. 

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.800
 But I wanted to speak quickly and concisely 

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.720
 For some things that were in some previous versions. 

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.080
 In Release 23.2 we had some things 

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.870
 Which people were waiting for. 

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.203
 There are possibilities of night mode. 

00:37:33.203 --> 00:37:38.270
 Is the ability of your application to move quickly between the light and dark appearance. 

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:43.200
 Bottom Sheets for material design 

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.450
 Also Vector / Drawable and AnimatedVectorDrawable, 

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.060
 People have asked all these since we issued the basic features on Lollipop 

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.699
 As if we did not know. 

00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:52.990
 It proved very difficult to implement 

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.690
 For some reason the way resources are handled, 

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.450
 In addition to the drawings, 

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.110
 And make it compatible with previous systems. 

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.896
 It took time. 

00:38:00.896 --> 00:38:01.895
 But finally became possible. 

00:38:01.895 --> 00:38:03.920
 It is compatible with several previous versions. 

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.320
 They are tempted to discover them and use them. 

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.080
 And start selling smaller APKs. 

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.860
 Because tankers are usually much smaller than the pictures 

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.780
 Such as PNGs and JPEGs. 

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.200
 RecyclerView and AutoMeasure, and also Wrap Content Wrap Contents, 

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.240
 They have asked a lot for a while. 

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.406
 This is in that version. 

00:38:21.406 --> 00:38:25.580
 Then at 23.1 we modified the RecyclerView API 

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.640
 To allow for more performance, and rich-textured animations. 

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.420
 Check out these too. 

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.390
 (Roman): As the talk about VectorDrawable, 

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.770
 There will be a talk by Colt I do not remember when. 

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.901
 It is about reducing the size of images and what can be done 

00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:39.840
 To reduce your APKs size. 

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.220
 It will talk about VectorDrawables, 

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.810
 But also what you can do with PNGS, 

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.150
 And JPEGs and WebPs to make your applications smaller 

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.400
 But with the same beautiful appearance. 

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.036
 (Chit): Yeah, right. 

00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:51.850
 Support Library, 

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.040
 I also wanted to talk about what I want to call the future. 

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.910
 There are some interesting events that designers will be eagerly interested in. 

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.260
 But we also have a talk called What's New in the Support Library. 

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.993
 In order not to spoil the surprise, 

00:39:02.993 --> 00:39:05.776
 I will tell you to attend the talk today at four o'clock 

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:07.400
 To learn more about what will happen in future releases 

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.860
 In the Support Library. 

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.900
 I want to talk quickly about these things, 

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.392
 Because I love them. 

00:39:13.392 --> 00:39:15.100
 This is a detail of implementation. 

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.683
 No one will know from outside. 

00:39:16.683 --> 00:39:19.660
 But VectorDrawable performance may improve a lot 

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.490
 In the N Preview version, 

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.420
 Because we worked on performance improvements 

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.260
 In both sides of the load and the firstDraw side. 

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.260
 We will create the bitmap, 

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.390
 And we paint it there. 

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.670
 It took us a long time to chart that path. 

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.380
 We have speeded it up. 

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.880
 We also quickly did his comment. 

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.480
 If you have a very complicated path, 

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.020
 It turns out that the expression of that string at the Java level, 

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.850
 It was very intense time. 

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.560
 We have important legislation there. 

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.920
 This is a bigger reason to start using VectorDrawables. 

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.090
 And also FloatProperty and IntProperty. 

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.410
 It is my favorite feature because I have run on my own. 

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.118
 This really is ... 

00:39:51.118 --> 00:39:53.570
 (Roman): Was that the only code you wrote in N? 

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:53.996
 (Chit): That's possible. 

00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:54.422
 (Roman): I'm sure of that. 

00:39:54.422 --> 00:39:55.010
 (Chit): No, no. 

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.593
 In fact, I wrote much more code, 

00:39:56.593 --> 00:39:57.550
 I also reviewed them. 

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.550
 There were problems, 

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.591
 My review was canceled. 

00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:01.580
 [Laughter] 

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.420
 Not only did I not write the code much 

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.840
 In FloatProperty / IntProperty, 

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.180
 But have written for more than two years. 

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.614
 But it was a hidden API. 

00:40:09.614 --> 00:40:11.030
 But we discovered that people can not reach 

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.760
 To the capabilities that allow the use of primitives 

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.720
 With proprietary material until the API is detected as generic. 

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.470
 These are all. 

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.300
 I beg you to use it. 

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.280
 Especially for the movers that allow you 

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.170
 In a more direct way to change settings 

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.290
 Without the usual mechanism, 

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.900
 Such as what we use drives and dive into JNI and support. 

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.320
 This will add a little improvement in performance. 

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.030
 What do we have after that? 

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.330
 Android Instant Apps Android Instant Apps 

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.300
 Which we have seen in the keyword this morning. 

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.109
 And you see us go to the Sandbox area and discover the demons. 

00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:43.650
 They also brought the conversation tomorrow morning 

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.194
 What's New in Android Play for Developers 

00:40:46.362 --> 00:40:48.070
 They will have more details about it. 

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.250
 Most importantly, go and get the release. 

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.850
 If you do not own it yet, 

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.340
 Developer Preview 3 will now be available there. 

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.060
 I do not know the times of ahaadeeth 

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.970
 When they are on interwebs networks. 

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.210
 But there must be, 

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.440
 So they wanted to go there. 

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.720
 These are some useful sites in case you do not know d.android.com 

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.650
 here they are. 

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.990
 Get the Preview, 

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.700
 Download the SDK. 

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.269
 More importantly, please send complaints, 

00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:17.310
 And very quickly. 

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.740
 We are trying to end this release. 

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.824
 is there anything else? 

00:41:21.824 --> 00:41:23.240
 (Roman): Can we take ... 

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.240
 I just want to talk a bit about the Constraint model, 

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.531
 Because I care about him a lot. 

00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:28.790
 There is also Code Lab you can go to 

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.790
 If you want to play it now. 

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.030
 Other than that, we can take some questions. 

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.470
 It would be strange in this lounge, but ... 

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.300
 (Dan): Do not I think I have a microphone? 

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.220
 (Chit): I do not manage how we can take questions here. 

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.490
 (Roman) spoke very loudly. 

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.573
 (Cheet): Do you know? 

00:41:40.573 --> 00:41:44.320
 I will tell the two thousand people who have questions 

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.130
 They will not be able to ask, 

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.290
 We will have office times at the end of each day. 

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.081
 There are office times called Android N desk times. 

00:41:52.081 --> 00:41:54.580
 There will be plenty of people on platforms. 

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.330
 People who worked on N, 

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.100
 They turned out to be the same people who worked on all other versions. 

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.670
 And let your questions be brought there. 

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.929
 There are office times for different teams for multiple windows and so on. 

00:42:03.929 --> 00:42:06.002
 Make sure they are in the table. 

00:42:06.183 --> 00:42:07.500
 So ask your questions. 

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.250
 I think we will skip the questions. 

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:09.720
 Roman: Well. 

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.210
 (Chit): It's rather strange there. 

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.335
 So we do not end the conversation, 

00:42:12.335 --> 00:42:14.019
 We will say thank you. 

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:14.810
 (Roman): Thank you. 

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.610
 [clap] 

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.160
 [Music]
