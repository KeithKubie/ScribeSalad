00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:01.840
- [Voiceover] Okay, it's
time to introduce you

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.376
to a new friend, ELI the ICE man.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:09.651
ELI the ICE man is a friend
of every electrical engineer

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:12.190
and what we've been taking
about is A/C analysis,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.225
and in A/C analysis we
limit ourselves to one type

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.892
of signal and that's a sinusoid,

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:24.019
and the sinusoid we like is called cosine.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.852
We say cosine of omega t plus phi.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.500
Omega represents the radiant
frequency of the cosine,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.911
here it's shown in blue.

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.387
That radiant frequency is omega,

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:41.749
and phi is the phased
layer, the phased shift.

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.825
And if we look here we see this
isn't really a cosine wave,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.385
because the peak is a little
before zero, time equals zero,

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:52.552
so this distance right here
is the lead, the phase leed,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.890
and that's phi.

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.683
So when phi is a positive
number, this whole cosine wave

00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:06.930
is shifted a little bit to the left.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.832
That's what we mean by phase shift.

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:11.503
So in these kind of signals,

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:14.256
our input into our favorite
components, we're gonna get

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:17.432
a relationship between the
voltage and the current

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:21.612
in those components, and it's
related by the impedance.

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:24.452
We define the idea of
impedance as the ratio

00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:28.535
of voltage to current, we
gave that the symbol z.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:32.408
Now in this video, instead of using

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:35.309
v as my variable for
voltage, I'm gonna use

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:37.356
a different letter, I'm gonna use e.

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:41.101
E is short for EMF or electromotive force,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.281
and it's really commonly
used, almost as often as v,

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:49.106
for representing voltage,
and I'll show you why

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:51.606
I wanna use e in a little bit.

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.493
And another way I can
write this just as easily,

00:01:57.493 --> 00:01:59.076
e equals z times i.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.297
And this looks a lot like
Ohm's law, and what we're gonna

00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:07.017
find out here is we can
apply this in addition to

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.784
applying it to resisters, we can apply it

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:11.117
to capacitors and inductors.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:17.363
So first off we're gonna look
at our friend, the inductor.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.355
And we're gonna look at the equation

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.772
e equals z i for an inductor.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:36.310
I'm going to assign i to be
a sinusoid, so i is gonna be

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.142
equal to some magnitude,
we'll call it i naught,

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:43.142
cosine omega t plus phi.

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:50.673
So I'm gonna say my
current is a cosine wave

00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:53.292
of this magnitude with this
phase delay, and that's shown

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.959
in blue here, so this here is i.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.860
And now let's write e
in terms of this i here,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.027
so I can write e equals z,
now what is z for an inductor?

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:13.139
The impedance of an inductor
is j omega l, and what is i?

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:19.312
i is sitting right here,
and I'm gonna represent i

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.331
like this, I'm gonna
represent i as a phasor,

00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.293
or a phasor representation.

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:28.628
And we said that that
could be represented as i,

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:32.795
the magnitude of the current
indicated at the angle of phi,

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:37.243
so these are equivalent
representations of i,

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:39.194
this is the time domain representation,

00:03:39.194 --> 00:03:41.884
and this is the phasor representation.

00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:44.754
Now what we have out here in
front of i is a scaling factor,

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:47.546
there's this complex j that
we'll take care of in a second,

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:49.088
and there's omega l.

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:53.383
So omega is the frequency and
l is the size of the inductor.

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:55.902
Now for the purposes of
this video, when I plot out

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:00.267
the voltage over here in
orange, we're gonna assume that

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.865
this scaling factor omega l
is one, just so that we can

00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:06.148
focus on the timing relationships

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:09.424
between the current and the voltage.

00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:13.678
When we talked about complex
numbers, multiplying by j,

00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.874
multiplying something by j represents

00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:18.374
a rotation of plus 90 degrees.

00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:22.641
And so I can write this as e equals,

00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:27.692
let's put the scaling factor
out there, and we'll have

00:04:27.692 --> 00:04:31.120
i naught, which is the original
magnitude of the current,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.919
and phi, it's changed here,
phi changes, phi becomes

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.086
phi and this multiplication
by j here corresponds to

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:42.131
adding 90 degrees to phi.

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:50.944
So multiplying by j corresponds
to a 90 degree phase shift,

00:04:50.944 --> 00:04:55.111
and if I draw here, this is
now e, and the phase shift,

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:01.311
we decided this distance right here,

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:06.234
this distance right here
is phi, and this distance

00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:09.651
right here is a phase leed of 90 degrees.

00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:21.261
And you'll notice I key off
the peaks of these wave forms,

00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:24.339
because that's the easiest
place to see the leed.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:29.236
So when I move to the left,
that corresponds to a lead

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.819
of plus 90 degrees.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:36.366
So in an inductor, in an inductor,

00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.901
we say that e leeds i by 90 degrees.

00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:07.555
Alright, now let's do
it for our capacitor.

00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:15.249
And we'll do the same kind
of thing here for capacitor

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:29.694
we'll assign the same
current, we'll say i equals

00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:33.861
some current, i naught, times
cosine of omega t plus phi,

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:42.493
and now let's work out the
voltage across the capacitor.

00:06:42.493 --> 00:06:46.245
So the voltage across the
capacitor, e, is the same thing

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:50.003
we have here, e equals zi or I can write e

00:06:50.003 --> 00:06:52.026
in the capacitor equals z.

00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:55.118
Now what is impedance of a capacitor?

00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:57.118
It's one over j omega c.

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:05.954
That's z, and i we represent
the same way as we did before,

00:07:07.382 --> 00:07:09.715
i naught at an angle of phi.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:16.362
So now let's carefully
do this multiplication.

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:20.529
e equals one over j times one
over omega c times i naught

00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:28.038
at an angle of phi.

00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:32.802
So here's this one over j term,

00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:36.135
now I can rewrite one over j as minus j.

00:07:42.847 --> 00:07:44.970
Now we're multiplying
something by minus j,

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.618
and multiplying by minus j
corresponds to a rotation

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:53.179
of minus 90 degrees, so I
can write e one more time

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:56.262
like this, e equals one over omega c,

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:01.350
here's the scale factor,
here's the original

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.183
current magnitude, and
I get the angle of phi,

00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:08.971
this time minus 90 degrees.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.289
So this minus sign here
corresponds to a lag, a phase lag,

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:21.663
so here's our original current
here, let me label that,

00:08:21.663 --> 00:08:25.830
here's i, and now we have our
voltage, e looks like this,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.611
here's e, and what we
see, let me go out here

00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.552
and measure it here,
here we have a phase lag,

00:08:37.552 --> 00:08:41.469
where it's pointing to
the right of 90 degrees.

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.242
And that we call a lag.

00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:54.004
We can summarize that, we
can say in a capacitor,

00:09:00.092 --> 00:09:01.425
we say e lags i.

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:10.952
And an equivalent way to say this

00:09:10.952 --> 00:09:13.535
is we could say that i leeds e.

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.158
I leeds voltage.

00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:31.322
So I can actually put boxes
around these two results,

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:34.900
here and here.

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.845
Now there's a lot of sign
flipping going on here,

00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:47.012
and there's actually an
easy way to remember this,

00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:50.343
and I wanna introduce you
to someone who can help you

00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:54.260
remember this, and his
name is ELI the ICE man.

00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:04.470
So what can Eli tell us?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.667
ELI tells us that in an
inductor, an l, voltage,

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:13.125
leeds current, and over
here in a capacitor,

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:15.208
c, current leeds voltage.

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:20.154
That's the message from ELI the ICE man,

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:23.975
he helps us remember the
order that voltage and current

00:10:23.975 --> 00:10:26.967
change in inductors and capacitors.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.862
He's gonna be your friend for a long time.
