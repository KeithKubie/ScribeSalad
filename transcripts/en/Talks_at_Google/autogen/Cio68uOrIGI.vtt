00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.850
ANDREA THUMSHIRN: Very
good afternoon everybody.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.630
I want to talk a little
bit about the last six

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.740
years of my life and how it
happened that I came to India.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.750
So first of all I
want to show you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.230
a small video that shows the
environment in which I spent

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.088
the last six years of my life.

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:28.582
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.526
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:15.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:17.146
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.240
So now the question arises, why?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.290
Why did I leave
my job, my family,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.910
a good life in the
capital of Germany,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.750
Berlin, to live in a tiny little
remote village in Rajasthan

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.170
to coach and teach the
children of the village?

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.390
I was always very adventurous.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.830
I love to travel.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.080
And I come from a very
sports-related family.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.560
My grandfather, my grandmother,
my uncle, my auntie, my mother,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.550
my father, my whole family was
engaged in the local sports

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.300
club.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.380
We all grew up volunteering in
the sports club and coaching

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.380
and playing different
kind of sports.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.870
And so it was in my
blood and I am what

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.440
I am today because of sports.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.620
I started my own
travel agency so that I

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.420
could travel all the time.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.750
And one of my favorite
destinations was India.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.660
I was always traveling
around looking for new places

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.540
where I could bring my
clients off the beaten tracks

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.600
to show them the real country.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.760
My business partner
came from Jaipur,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.040
and his mother came
from a little village

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.419
which was halfway
between Agra and Jaipur.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.960
So we thought it
would be a good idea

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.720
to bring our clients
for a lunch break

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.990
to a little Indian village,
show them the real village

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.780
life, traditional
life, colorful life,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.830
and host them for a lunch break.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.380
Maybe the kids of the village
could show their village

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.430
and the local family could
have some extra income.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.060
So the family lived
in this ruined fort.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.050
They were the former rulers, the
[NON-ENGLISH] of the village.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.530
And I started dreaming of, maybe
I could teach them some hockey,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.310
the village kids.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.780
They have nothing to do.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.279
And maybe we could have some
space in front of the fort

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.709
where we could start coaching.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.147
So I shared my dream
with a local family.

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:22.730
And they would say,
yeah, you can have

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.110
the space in front of our fort.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.470
We don't use that.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.360
And you can try.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.160
So in 2010 I was hosting
a veterans hockey

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.230
team from Vienna, from Austria.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.770
And we brought
some hockey sticks

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.530
and we had a training
session with the kids.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.750
And so the kids were so excited.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.170
And then I started
dreaming that, this

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.420
would be a great
story if I could make

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.070
a difference in that village.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.170
So obviously my business
was still in Germany

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.950
and I could only coach them once
in a while when I was in India.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.370
Otherwise nothing much
happened in the village.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.650
So I tried to hire
volunteers from Germany

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.380
who could bridge the
gap when I was not here,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.320
but that somehow
didn't work out.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.390
Then I thought,
OK, maybe I could

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.987
run my travel
business online and I

00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:10.070
could sit in that village.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.380
Maybe I would have less
clients than before but I

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.260
would need not so much
money to survive here

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.380
and I could coach
and teach the kids.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.510
So, I gave everything
up in Germany.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.590
I sold everything.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.370
I closed my office and I
reconstructed two rooms

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.290
in that old fort.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.860
And I called a
roller and a tractor

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.060
and we leveled the ground
here in front of the fort.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.460
And we called the
kids for practice.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.740
I went to the
local schools and I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.760
wanted to especially encourage
the girls to play hockey

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.570
with me.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.570
And I brought sticks
and I coached them

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.550
for a training
session and I invited

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.860
them to come in the
afternoon after school

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.180
to our hockey ground.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.730
And I also tried to offer
them English classes

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.100
because I didn't
speak any Hindi.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.410
They didn't speak any English.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.970
So the mode of communication
was very basic.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.510
There was an old
temple and the family

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.530
provided me one room which we
used as an open-air classroom.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.907
And I started giving English
classes where some of the kids

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:14.240
would show up in the afternoons.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.620
But I realized that traditional
Indian schooling system

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.900
where kids happily
repeat what you tell them

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.770
but their brains are not working
anyhow, that doesn't work much

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.190
and they don't learn anything.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.930
So we started speaking
on the hockey grounds.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.990
So actually all the kids learned
speaking English while playing.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.410
This was our village
hockey ground.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.490
We made a boundary wall
around and it was very dusty.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.710
Especially during
the hot summers,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.600
it was almost unbearable.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.450
But the kids would show up
every day and they didn't mind.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.420
And so we had a kind of
time-sharing agreement

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.630
with the local cows which
would rest on that place

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.340
while we were not playing.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.610
And so the kids always
tried to sneak in late

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.100
because the first one
who came had to remove

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.290
the remainings of the cows.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.570
We had so many kids that I
could not get hold of them

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.400
and they were very wild.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.340
So I started learning
the colors in Hindi

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.710
and I bought T-shirts
in different colors

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.320
so that I could say the
[HINDI] group is there,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.530
the [HINDI] is there, and
[HINDI] is over there.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.210
And I got some older students
of the village who helped me

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.150
in coaching in the beginning.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.780
So I tried to make
them understand,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.530
and also for me, don't dream
your life, live your dream.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.000
So then after one
year practicing,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.410
I showed them the
movie "Chak De!

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.370
India".

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.870
They got very fascinated.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.600
That was a funny
story because I bought

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.520
an old screen and a beamer
and invited the kids

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.900
to watch with me the movie.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.500
And we brought the
cables out of the fort.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.050
And there were some power
[INAUDIBLE] obviously also.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.460
And we had to show the movie
when the sun was almost

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.830
going down so that
we can see the movie.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.290
And we put some
chairs up and kids

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.670
were sitting on the ground.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.310
And I was fascinated
watching the movie.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.500
And I was so excited
about my idea.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.420
And after half an
hour, I looked around

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.390
and only the farmers
were sitting around me

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.380
because the kids
already went home.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.220
Because when it's getting
dark, they all have to go home.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.650
So they only saw
half of the movie.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.539
Nevertheless, they
got very much inspired

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.850
and they said, Andrea,
we also want to play.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.650
So my friend, he
was the hockey coach

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.950
in the DPS school in
Jaipur, and they invited us

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.420
for our first match.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.270
So we went by train to
Jaipur, which was already

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.090
the first big excitement.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.550
And I feel so
privileged that I could

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.640
share all these first
moments with the kids.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.080
They saw the big city.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.140
They asked me, Andrea,
how to go [INAUDIBLE],,

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.980
like how they can go
up these huge buildings

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.440
and how all this traffic works.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.990
And the first time
in their life they

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.350
were wearing sport
shoes, shin pads, socks.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.642
So Chando, my local
partner and I,

00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:19.100
we were sitting
next to each other.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.840
One was putting up the socks.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.030
One was putting
inside the shin pads.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.080
And then we sent
them on the ground.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.610
And the whole stadium was
filled with privileged children

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.710
in white school uniforms.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.320
The green grass
was, wow, they've

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.450
never seen such a
grass in their life.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.250
And we realized that we were
quite malnutrition compared

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.450
to the city children, which
were, according to the coach,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.690
the same age group,
which I don't agree.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.490
But yes, this was the next
lesson that we had to learn.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.830
Life is not fair.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.430
Especially when it comes
to sports and competition,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.370
I had to learn my lesson
the hard way in India.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.070
If it's under 14,
it's maybe under 17.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.160
So then I thought, my
project needs more awareness.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.550
I need to raise funds.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.140
So how am I going to do this?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.590
So I have to room
around the country.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.960
So I bought a rickshaw.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:28.090
And I drove from Jaipur to
[INAUDIBLE],, 2,400 kilometers--

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.130
--in 13 days.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.600
And I can tell you it was the
best way to know the country.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.240
Every 100 kilometers, a
different [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.160
different food.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.580
The people were so
friendly and welcoming.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.115
I had to I had to drink chai
with each and everybody.

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:49.160
Everybody wanted to know, what
the hell is that white woman

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.510
doing in that rickshaw?

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.440
And we had a two meter
hockey stick on the roof.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.960
So we promote.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.540
I mean, we didn't raise
any funds, to be honest.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.370
But it was a great experience.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.650
And we were in some
newspaper highlighted

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.130
and there was some awareness
of the project at least.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.050
It was a great experience to
drive all along the country.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.800
So I tried to encourage
the kids that you

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.450
have to sit in the driver's
seat of your car, of your life.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.250
In villages, they are only
driven by the village society,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.250
by their parents.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.410
They do what the parents want.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.737
And later on, they
do a job which

00:11:31.737 --> 00:11:34.320
they don't want but the parents
want, that the neighbors want,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.680
that whoever wants,
but not them.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.410
So sports teaches you
to be self-confident,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.910
to understand what
you want in your life.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.540
So then obviously the
girls also wanted to play.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.140
And my focus was
anyway on the girls.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.690
The problem was just that
their school uniforms,

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.230
their skirts were quite long,
so it was very difficult to run.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.790
And a regular hockey skirt would
be very brave for a village

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.870
girl to wear.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.260
That was too short.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.200
So then my fashion design
diploma came into accounts.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.330
So I got a tailoring machine
and I tailored hockey

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.920
skirts which were a little
longer than the regular hockey

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.700
skirts.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.760
And the girls loved them.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.280
And I always had
my silver suitcase

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.900
where I put all the socks,
shin pads, shirts, and skirts,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.660
and we would travel
with the train.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.090
This time we went to
Haryana and the girls

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.110
had their first match.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:39.240
But that was again, very
enthusiastic from my end

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.360
because I think
it was April, May.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.160
It was like 40, 45 degrees.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.840
It was burning hot.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.060
And we had to wait for
them [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.020
Which is more important the
longer you have to wait.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.490
So the first children already
fainted because of the heat.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.340
And we finally had
then our match.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.180
And this is my daughter Kavita.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.660
So I took care of her.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.450
She didn't have a mother.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.780
And I brought her the best
Puma shoes from Germany.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.180
And she said,
"Andrea, too tight."

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.470
She wanted to play barefoot.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.750
She was the wild jungle kid.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.920
She wanted to play barefoot
as per her convenience

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.880
and not with my good sport
shoes that I brought for her.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.290
Then we played our first
All India KD Singh Babu

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.780
under-14 tournament, which
is by the way the only

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.480
under-14 tournament where
really under-14 teams are

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.640
playing, in Lucknow.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.300
And they had a really,
really good sports canteen.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.220
So in Rajasthan, most of the
families are vegetarians.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.320
And it's even
you're a bad person

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.520
if you are a nonvegetarian.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.960
So I'm from Germany.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.880
I am a nonvegetarian.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.690
So that was always some
blame to put on me,

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.930
or a bad influence that I have
on the children because I'm

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.550
eating nonveg.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.080
So this is Lokesh.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.220
He was our goalkeeper.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.380
He was the smallest of all.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.500
And he saw all the
other teams eating eggs

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.970
for breakfast and
butter and everything

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.592
and he was asking me, "Andrea,
if I eat eggs, I get strong?"

00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:21.610
I said, "You can try."

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.600
So he went to the
buffet, he got one egg.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.230
The whole team was watching him.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.170
He survived the egg.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.460
And all the others, one
by one, also took one egg.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.320
By the end of the
tournament, everybody

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.080
had four eggs for breakfast.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.680
And since that time, it
was always our secret.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.290
If we went out for
tournaments together,

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.000
the first question was,
Andrea, we eat omelet?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.810
So they knew that
this is something good

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.840
but they are not allowed
to eat this at home.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.690
And somebody was even
asking me if his mother

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.410
can smell that he eat eggs.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.710
They were literally scared.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.050
So we always extended--

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.900
most of the time we were
out in the first round

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.920
on tournaments because
we were the youngest.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.390
But to get more
experience, I always

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.260
asked the organizer if
we can stay some two,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.050
three days longer.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:21.000
First of all, you travel
all the way for one match.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.670
And then the food is so good.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.440
And they don't get that
kind of food at home.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.830
Plus if they watch matches,
they also can learn a lot.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.500
So we always extended
our stay and we

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.600
had lovely food every day.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.540
This was the Nehru
Cup in Delhi where

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.790
they, together with
all the state teams,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.150
were doing the march past.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.080
And you can see here
our hand-painted flag.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.790
And the kids were thrilled--

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.110
floodlight, [NON-ENGLISH]--

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.250
--AstroTurf in Delhi, wonderful.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.190
So if you have a dream,
the sky's the limit.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:08.450
Then the next crazy
thing I did was I

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.870
imported a secondhand
AstroTurf from Germany.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.260
And it was quite an
action because it

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.470
was the first second-hand
AstroTurf that came to India

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.680
and nobody at the customs
knew how to handle that,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.380
how to evaluate a second-hand
AstroTurf from Germany

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.020
and how much tax I have to pay.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.460
So after I overcame this, the
huge truck with the AstroTurf

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.090
came from Gujarat
port to Rajasthan,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.330
and we had a huge party.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.760
And I thought like, wow,
my dream is coming true.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.890
We have an AstroTurf.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.820
I made it happen in Rajasthan.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.230
There are only two AstroTurfs
and I have number three,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.170
and I can make this
happen for these children.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.170
And we had a huge party
and it was nice and great.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.580
And the next morning, 8 o'clock,
Saturday, one of my girls

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.800
called me and she said, "Andrea,
please do come to the ground.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.260
Police is there.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.460
There is a problem."

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.010
So we went to the ground.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.900
The groundwork was
already going on.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.119
It was a government project.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.510
And the sports ministry
sanctioned money.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.099
Everything was nice.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.950
Huge stones blocked
the entrance.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.920
The [NON-ENGLISH] was sitting
there on a plastic chair.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.250
And around 300 villagers
were singing freedom fighters

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.500
songs, [INAUDIBLE] go home.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.660
Today she is ruling
the hockey ground.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.510
Tomorrow she is ruling India.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.550
We don't want history
to repeat itself.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.330
I felt like, are they
talking about me?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:43.470
What does that mean,
ruling the hockey ground?

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.700
I signed that this AstroTurf
will be government property

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.460
and I donate this
to the community.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.540
All I want is that these kids
can play on an AstroTurf.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.030
So I had to load my
AstroTurf again, rescue it

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.820
to another place, and
store it somewhere.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.840
So the dream of the
AstroTurf was on hold.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.860
Then I thought, OK, if my
kids cannot play in Rajasthan

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.580
on an AstroTurf, I
bring them to Germany.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.840
So I took five boys for two
months in the summer holidays

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.250
to Germany where they stayed in
German families for two months,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.500
had lovely German food, and
played in a German club.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.220
And surprisingly they
could compete with the kids

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.660
of their age group.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.900
And they got so much
exposure and so much

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.210
learning for their future
life that nobody can ever do

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.980
for them in their life again.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.750
So they came back and everybody
was thinking that maybe they

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.460
don't want to go back.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.250
But they were so bonded
with their families

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.920
and they were so proud
to tell of their stories

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.690
and bring all the
chocolates home

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.750
and benefit from
their experience

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:06.430
and tell everybody and
motivate all the other kids so

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.050
that there was a big
battle for the next year

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.980
that who would be the
privileged ones who

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.870
could come with me to Germany.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.630
So since that
time, every year we

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.210
select some children,
the best ones who

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.890
are present in practice, good
in studies, good in hockey,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.160
and good attitude,
good discipline,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.840
and we take them to Germany.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.060
And we find a lot of
sponsors in Germany

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.090
who support those hockey
clubs who host them

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.960
and who find it's a very
great idea to integrate them

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.640
in their teams.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.980
So Deepak, my so-called
son, he was the lucky one.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.400
He even went with
me to Switzerland.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.070
And he was so amazed that
these cows give 40 liters milk

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.100
while his buffalo at
home gives maximum

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.800
one liter, which is
enough for a cup of chai

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.850
for his grandfather.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.100
Then I thought,
OK, sports is good,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.820
but I should involve
myself more in education

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.860
because that is what
counts at the end.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:15.380
And out of that old
temple, we made a school.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.110
So I had German
volunteers with me.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.230
And with our own
hands, we knocked down

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.640
walls and ceilings.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.730
And the whole village was
standing outside watching us,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.030
how these white people
can do this labor

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.480
work, which is actually
the lowest level of work

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.260
that you can do.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.500
And we were working hand in
hand with the local laborers who

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.270
earned like 250 rupees a day.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.190
And we had a lot of fun.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.060
We had a lot of fun to build
a school with our own hands.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.900
And we started the first
English medium school

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.080
with our little ones.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.870
So I want to show you a small
video from our school, how

00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:03.279
we tried to teach the village
kids in a state of the art way.

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:03.945

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.080
So our school was a primary
school, English medium,

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.790
[INAUDIBLE] and class
one, two, three, and four.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:18.930
Unfortunately, we also had to
shut down that school April

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.500
this year because our
local partner misused

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.370
foundation money.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.874
And we bought land to lay out
that AstroTurf where you saw

00:23:27.874 --> 00:23:29.040
where the kids were playing.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.070
We already made a concrete
base to finally lay out

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.150
that AstroTurf.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.520
So the dream was
a little closer,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.320
but the local partner
registered the land in his name.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.890
And we had to file a
big case against him.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.190
And the result was that he was
threatening all the children

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.940
and was beating them
up in school, whoever

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.900
came for practice.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.620
So out of 80 children
who were daily there

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.210
for practice, who played
for the district, who

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.890
played for the state, nobody
was allowed to come anymore.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.720
We didn't get any
support from the parents.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.930
And we were raising the
question that we can only work

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.700
and continue if you
stand by our side

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.770
and if you understand what
this project is all about.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.640
And only one family
was standing up,

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.610
and they were even from
the neighboring village.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.850
So we decided to
leave this place.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.400
We got threatened for
our lives and there

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.260
was no way to continue.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:37.290
So we got an offer from Coorg,
where there is obviously

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.810
more awareness about sports.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.530
And we thought that maybe we
have a better start there.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:49.470
It was a big decision to get
all the energy again together

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.580
and all the motivation and
overcome the bad experience

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.910
and struggle and loss that
we were facing in Rajasthan

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.500
and start again.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.720
But we said OK, we do
it for the children.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.810
And we packed a truck
with all our belongings,

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.290
mainly hockey equipment
and school equipment.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.990
And we have two Labradors.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:18.150
And so my husband and
I and the two Labradors

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.290
were in the truck.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:26.010
And for 70 hours and
2,400 kilometers,

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:30.060
we were driving
Jatwara in Rajasthan

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.960
to Coorg to set up a
new hockey village.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.630
And since three
months, we are working

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.010
with a local primary
school, grade one to seven.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.510
We coach them in hockey and
we teach English and math

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.250
for grade one, two, and three.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:53.400
They are all students from the
coffee plantation laborers.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.380
And we hope that we can make
a difference there again.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.700
I still believe that we made
a difference in Rajasthan.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.560
We left our footsteps behind and
we took three of the children

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.330
with us, age 15, 16, and 17.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.290
Shivani got selected as
the first and only girl

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.110
from Rajasthan for
the National Academy.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.830
And she is playing at the
moment senior nationals

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.380
at the age of 15 for Rajasthan.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.360
And I hope she has
a bright future.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.670
And Rohit is from Goa.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.150
He lived with me the last
three years in Rajasthan.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.460
And I took him now to Coorg.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.670
He has a learning disability.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.560
He's suffering from
[INAUDIBLE],, so he

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.930
can't properly read and write.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.010
But he's a brilliant
sportsperson,

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.670
a brilliant, excellent cook.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.760
And he's preparing
each and everything.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.320
He's making bamboo rafts.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.620
And he's the king of
the jungle in Coorg.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.740
And Deepak, he's 17.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.840
He's also a very
good hockey player.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.450
And he became our
plumber and electrician

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.370
because we live so
far away in the jungle

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.770
that, even if you call an
electrician or a plumber,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.500
it takes 10 days
until somebody comes.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.570
So he's keeping our activities
alive by making [NON-ENGLISH]

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.410
here and there.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.040
So we brought these three
kids from Rajasthan.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.700
So this is what we
could take with us.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.120
And still kids are
calling us and asking us,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.670
when do you come back or
did you open a new school?

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.440
We want to come to your school.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.730
So at least for the children
I think we made a difference.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.800
And we want to continue
the same thing in Coorg.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.690
So that is Shivani.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.380
She came as the first girl
to Germany two years back.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.440
And she played an
excellent season

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.140
for one of the best
clubs in Germany.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.110
And so now we are thinking if
we again bring her to Germany,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.170
but we don't want to miss
out any trial for her

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.770
because you never know
when any selector is

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.530
spotting her and inviting her.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.920
Because last year the trial
for the national academy,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.130
she didn't manage
to get a space.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.380
Because of all the struggles
that we had in Rajasthan,

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.330
she didn't practice
for some time.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.320
But now in Coorg we trained
her well and she's fit.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.150
And we hope that she
has a bright future

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.360
and will one day play for India.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.610
So she was very easy going.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.340
Coming from a village
the first day in Germany,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.460
she was wearing the hot
pants of her German sister.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.080
She was completely adapting
to the German lifestyle,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.010
which is very surprising.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.640
But I think that gives
her a really bright future

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.710
because she's very open minded.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.730
Her English is pretty good.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.050
She's doing now NOS,
means open schooling.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.370
We teach her at home.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.340
And she's doing that in
English, all subjects.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.730
She's doing bio and
chemistry in English.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:03.870
And this is Brijesh.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.010
He was three times in Germany.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:11.310
And he got a job with the
ThyssenKrupp Elevators

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.560
in Jaipur.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.610
He only has a Hindi
medium 12th grade pass,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.800
but he was so motivated.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.270
And ThyssenKrupp said, OK,
he's so brilliant, we take him.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.270
Unfortunately his
parents thought

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.880
more of a government
job and didn't

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.420
allow him to take the job.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.500
Well, let's see, maybe he
will fight his way through.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.010
But he is a very, very
bright and brilliant child

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.500
and he will make
his way I'm sure.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.440
So there will be a day in
your life when you look back

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.250
and what you did in your
life and did it make sense?

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.610
Did it make any impact?

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.360
Did you make a difference?

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.430
And that was actually my
motivation to start this

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.790
project and to go ahead and
ahead and ahead because I think

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.640
I cannot forgive myself if
I stop because I think I can

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.810
still motivate and encourage
so many more children.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.270
Thank you.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.920
[APPLAUSE]
