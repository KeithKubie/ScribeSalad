00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.046
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:05.924
is think about the
different ways to make five.

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.328
What do I mean about that?

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.504
Right over here we have
three plus something,

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:16.218
so there's some unknown
number right over here.

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:19.507
Three plus something is
going to be equal to five.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:23.061
In this diagram we have three circles here

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:24.499
that represents the three

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.359
and then we have five boxes.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.217
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.403
How many more circles do
we need in order to fill up

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:36.265
all the five boxes?

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.335
We've clearly already filled three.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:41.319
Well, let's think about it.

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:47.078
We just have to add one and two circles.

00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:49.392
Now we have a total of five.

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:53.835
Three blue ones and two
of this purple color

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.310
or I guess this pink color.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.535
We see that three plus
two is equal to five.

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:06.495
That mystery number
here, that blank is two.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:09.582
Three plus two is equal to five.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:11.993
Now over here we have two

00:01:11.993 --> 00:01:16.133
plus a mystery number
is equal to five again.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:20.237
Once again, we have five spaces

00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:22.998
and two of them are filled in with this

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:25.428
kind of purple, pink stars.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.344
How many more do we have to fill in

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:30.189
in order to fill in all five boxes,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.409
two plus what is equal to five.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.777
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:35.697
and think about it.

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:39.232
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.175
Let's think about how
many more of this boxes

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:45.431
we need to fill in, in order
to fill in all five of them.

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:53.243
We need to fill in one,
two, and three of the boxes

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:55.342
in order to fill out all five.

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:57.049
Now we have five stars.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.958
We have two of the pink ones

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.893
and we have three of the blue ones.

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:03.856
We can say that two plus three,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.406
the mystery number here is three.

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:10.917
Two plus three is equal to five.

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.402
Let's do a few more of this.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:17.648
Here I have four plus some mystery number

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:18.978
is equal to five.

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:22.730
I filled out four of the five boxes,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.584
how many more do I need to fill in

00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:26.689
in order to have five things,

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.235
in order to have all
five boxes filled out.

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:32.106
Well we see very clearly here

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:35.147
that there is exactly one box

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:37.038
that we need to fill in

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:40.708
or one box that we need
to add to the other four.

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:49.086
We see that four plus
one is equal to five.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.967
Now let's go the other way.

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:55.727
We have the five boxes, only
one of them is filled in.

00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:58.184
How many more of these smiley faces

00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:01.144
do we need to add, in order
to fill in all the boxes?

00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:02.520
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.463
we have one,

00:03:03.463 --> 00:03:06.399
how many more do we need to add to one

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.037
to get to five?

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:11.160
Like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.705
and think about it on your own.

00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:16.256
Well, let's see, we can add one,

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:21.294
we can add two, we can add three,

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:26.209
and four yellow smiley faces.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.257
We could say one, one we
have one white smiley face

00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:34.658
plus one, two, three,
four yellow smiley faces

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:37.400
is equal to five.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.301
You see a pattern here.

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:41.298
Let's start at the beginning.

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:44.314
Three plus two is equal to five,

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:47.265
and two plus three is equal to five.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.030
When you had three filled in,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.744
you needed two more to get to five.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.433
When you had two filled in,

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.945
you needed three more to get to five.

00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:57.427
Notice three plus two, two plus three.

00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:58.992
Same thing over here,

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:01.476
four plus one is equal to five,

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:05.041
one plus four is equal to five.
