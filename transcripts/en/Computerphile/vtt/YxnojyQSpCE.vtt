00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're back with Spencer, and we've come to see his amazing collection. What have we got here, Spenc?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.040
It's a whole bunch of Sinclair machines, all from the 1980s, or they're Sinclair-related at the very least.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.300
We'll go from the ZX81 all the way up through to the Spectrum +3 and the Z88.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.160
Clive Sinclair was a British enterpreneur, he had quite a history in the electronics business,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
some of it more successful than others.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.960
But he was quite big in the Hi-Fi side of things and the scientific instruments range of stuff as well,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.460
but he then went on to make computers.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.220
ZX80 was groundbreaking in its day, when it came out,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
and then the ZX81 went on to be the biggest selling machine of 1981.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
Which is where I pick up the story, I don't have a ZX80, unfortunately,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.660
but if anyone's got one and they want to give it away, I'll happily give you a good home,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.440
because they are about 400 pound on eBay, and it's a lovely machine,

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600
but it's not worth that to me.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.130
The variations - I mean, the majority of these are Spectrum-based, but...

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.830
but it does cover a few other odd things along the way as well.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.440
The Spectrum is one that resonates with a lot of people I grew up with.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.940
Yeah, the Spectrum really was one of the main computers which kicked the computer craze in the 80s.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.800
So most people at school, they all had a Spectrum or a Commodore 64.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.940
Unless their parents were teachers, so they had a BBC Model B, if that was the case.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
But yeah, early 80s, they were just everywhere.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.210
Why do you think they permeated society in such a way?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.940
One of the biggest things about them was the price. They were cheap.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.860
Yeah, Clive Sinclair really made things down to a price.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.980
So, yeah, being that much cheaper, it's that much more affordable,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.600
but underneath that, they are actually really good machines as well.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
Really. really quite capable devices for their time.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.460
That's a Spectrum in the background there, isn't it? What's going on at the moment?

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.100
That's Manic Miner that's playing on there.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
Obviously that's the best game of all time, yeah, there's no question about that.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.740
It is games like this that I grew up on in the 80s,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.640
and that's kind of why I'm here today.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.460
Until things like these, ZX81 and ZX80 came out,

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.080
a computer - you either only had little flashing lights and switches on the front to operate it,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.100
or you had a mainframe-type thing, ridiculously expensive kit.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.020
This - the computer plugged into your telly, which - most people had a telly back then,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.400
and the cassette deck - yeah, most people had a tape recorder,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.180
so really, a cheap, cheap medium for loading and saving the games.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.240
I've just spotted these microdrive things, what were they?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.700
Those were Clive Sinclair's alternative to a floppy disk.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.700
Because back in the day floppy disks were quite expensive, these are little tiny tape cassette cartridges,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.380
so you've got one continuous spool of tape, which normally takes 100K of data,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.360
and it loads a lot quicker than what it would do from casette tape.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.700
So you got more storage, quicker, easier random access to it as well.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.940
That's the little microdrive cartridge itself, so you see the spool of tape in there.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.960
There's two tracks on there, which are about 50K each,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.300
or supposed to be there - in practice it never turned out to be quite as good as that,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.320
so you might get about 80 or 90K of data on there, if you're lucky.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.960
Do you use them at all, or is that...?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.220
I used to use them back in the 80s, I've got them now just for...  yeah, for completeness, effectively.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.600
But yeah, they aren't a practical, safe way of storing data these days.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.820
And presumably, there are not many of the cartridges around.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.440
No, they stopped being made years ago.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.700
We've talked a little bit about RAM pack wobble before.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.540
And, you know, there were certain reliability issues sometimes, weren't there?

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.089
Do you think that was widespread, or did he just get tainted by a few bad examples?

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:37.169
There is definitely a history of him... to cut corners wherever possible, yeah.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:42.480
So you save a couple of pence here and there, so there were some problems.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.740
One of the other big issues is the fact that he would preannounce products,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.840
and take preorders, and it'll be delivered next month.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.360
That actually turns out to be two months, three months, four months down the line.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.660
Some of the very early models to go out just weren't finished,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.300
they had lots of bodged wires in them and stuff like that.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.100
So, yeah, that didn't help his reputation much.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.020
I've heard they used to use the delivery times as basically the finance for the devices.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.100
Do you know about that?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.960
The money wasn't exactly in the bank accounts to start with,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.200
so if you can pre-sell the stuff that gets you the money in,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.720
then you can start to make it and hopefully it's gonna work before you ship it out.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.900
When the QL was announced, I mean, that took quite a few months before that was available,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.980
but the first ones of those, they actually had the ROMs hanging out the back,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.900
on the little plug-in extra circuit board, because they weren't finished, so they had to ship something.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.600
And it's "well, that kind of normally sometimes works, so ship'em out, 'cause we got customers that need them."

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.080
The original Spectrum was a huge big hit,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.420
obviously there was pressure on him to come up with something bigger and better.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.600
And he wanted to get into the business world a bit more.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.140
So, the QL was launched in 1984, and that came out with a proper keyboard.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.960
And the actual keys. Yeah, it's just like a keyboard.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.400
That was obviously an improvement on the "dead flesh" keyboard of the Spectrum

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.680
What did you call it, dead...?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.280
I don't know if you've felt dead flesh lately, but it's just like that.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.540
The Spectrum was revamped at the end of '84 with the Spectrum+,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.440
which is effectively exactly the same computer as the original Spectrum, it's the same motherboard.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.860
Only difference being, you got a real keyboard and a reset button.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.190
Other than that, Spectrum+ and the Spectrum 48k are the same beast.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.420
So now you could turn it off and on again with a button?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.240
That's right, yes, because the power socket was always a little bit fragile,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.440
and if you've done it too quickly, you could damage it.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.900
So, yeah, having a reset button probably saved a lot of machines there.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.100
That was kind of a normal operation, of loading a program, wasn't it? You did have to turn it off.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.820
Once you've finished playing the game, you wanted to play something else, that's kind of what you did.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.280
Yes, yes, and there's no shutdown procedure or anything like that.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.260
There's no startup procedure either.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.780
It's just a case of "here, there's power - it works, there's no power - doesn't work."

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.360
That's as simple as it got.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.820
And no multitasking, of course.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.560
Oh, no.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.540
It was a lot more flexible, there's also a decent sound chip in there as well,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.240
as opposed to the beep-beep-beep that we got out of the old Spectrum.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.980
A whole number of sectors, or technically we use clusters,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.800
which is multiple sectors joined together, to store...
