00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Can you say a little bit about how social networks fit into the history

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the use of technology in political protests?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Right. This is a really an interesting topic in that with the dictators,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
what they want is a lot of people to believe that everybody is happy

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with what's going on.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They don't want a lot of people to know that people are unhappy.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What happened was during the 1979 Iranian revolution,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
people were passing information through cassettes,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for those of us who are old enough to know what cassettes are.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
During the Tiananmen Square uprising, people were passing information through fax

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and with the use of fax machines.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, with smart phones and Twitter and Facebook,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
people can pass information very rapidly,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so I would know if there was a protest how many of my friends are going to go

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or how many people will go.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If I feel like a good mass of people are going to go

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and that we can really damage the government, then I would go.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have models that show whether the particular movement will spread

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or whether it will stop and so on and so forth.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's very exciting work.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Network science and social network analysis has come into service here,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because if you think about cybersecurity, what is cybersecurity?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What is cyber? Cyber is just a collection of machines that are networked together.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I send an email from my machine and so on and so forth,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and that's then an information network.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Underlying it is a physical network of machines that are linked to each other.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can think of it, well, if I'm a bad guy, and I want to spread a virus through this network,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
how will I do it?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's similar to this idea of epidemiology like between people networks

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and how does it spread and whether you are more susceptible to get a virus than not.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If your PC is more prevalent, maybe you're more susceptible

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to some of the viruses that are out there, because the majority of viruses

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
are for PCs right now and less for Macs.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Or, for example, if I'm a good guy, how would I stop a virus from spreading?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Which links should I take away or which nodes should I take away?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Nodes here being computers, right?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Actually, this also is analogous to people networks.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If I don't want a piece of information to spread, which person should I take out?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
For some definition of take out.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I've been watching a lot of murder mysteries.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You have worked for the government.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, this is how it comes in cybersecurity,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and in fact if you think about it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
social networks are built on top of information networks

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and that's built on top of physical networks,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and so the interdependency between these networks is very interesting to study

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and see, well, if I take out part of a physical network

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how will that affect the information network and the social network.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact, we have seen recently, for example again, with the demonstrations

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
when the governments take down their Internet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because they don't want people to talk to each other,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
but we're seeing that even though they take down the Internet,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because there's a phone network and the Twitter apps and all these other apps,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
are also through phones and voice that people can communicate information now,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which is awesome.
