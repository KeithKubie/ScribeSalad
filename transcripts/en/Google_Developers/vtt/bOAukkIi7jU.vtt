00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
One of the hottest topics
today is augmented reality,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.640
but just what does it mean
to augment or mix realities,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.850
and how does it work?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.110
Hi, my name is
Nicolai, and I'm going

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.940
to talk about Project
Tango, augmented reality,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.090
and the exciting new world
that's now at your fingertips.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.720
Augmented reality has been
around in some form for years.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.040
Pilots, for example,
utilize a head up

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.710
display to navigate in
low light or bad weather.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.020
Representation of obstacles are
projected onto the wind screen

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.820
along with other vital data,
such as airspeed and altitude

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.960
to allow a pilot to
see when it's not

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.070
really possible to see.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.880
So what does it take to make
AR work on a mobile device?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.240
In many ways, AR works
just the way you work.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.700
When you walk, your
eyes process images

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.530
while a pair of tiny
canals in your inner ear

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590
called the vestibular
system provides

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.600
information about spatial
orientation and movement.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450
Your brain automatically
links the data,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.740
and you maneuver
without even thinking.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.300
In order to analyze
your movement,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630
a Project Tango device
processes images

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.910
of your immediate environment--
dozens of images every second.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.610
As you move and
point the device,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.360
the images change, and
the Project Tango software

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.110
interprets and presents your
movement in the AR world.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.740
Add Project Tango's
high resolution clock

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.630
to sync all of these
elements, and you

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.250
have a tool capable of
capturing and presenting

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.190
a high fidelity virtual image
on top of a live camera image.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.330
To understand how this
works in more detail,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.710
watch the introduction
to motion tracking video.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.170
Creating an AR experience
that's believable

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.430
is a delicate
exercise, and I want

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.070
to walk you through a
few of the key elements.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.530
So let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.670
As we walk along this hallway,
the Project Tango device

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.180
is taking pictures, and
you are essentially seeing

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.260
a live picture of your world.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.840
Each of the little
dots that you see

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560
represents a physical
feature that Project Tango

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.370
locks onto so it can
track your movement.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.210
As these features shift
in relation to the device,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.720
Project Tango's motion
tracking tracks your progress.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.060
Now, let's augment reality.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.110
In this case, we will
add a box to our room.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.050
As we move around
it, Project Tango

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.020
tracks our movement in
relation to our physical world

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.460
and redraws the box to
keep it fixed in place.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.470
To make this work,
you must make sure

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.750
that the camera image
and the device [? post ?]

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.080
are time synced.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.145
If they are not, you will
see the virtual overlay

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.480
is out of sync with
the camera motion.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.120
We say they
experience it slushy.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.380
If, on the other hand,
the two are time synced,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.980
the virtual object will
follow the physical world,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.320
and we say we have
good registration.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.950
Now, there are some
things to watch out for.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.360
Imagine riding a roller coaster.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.770
Your eyes and you vestibular
system flood your brain

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.030
with sensory data over time.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.700
Your brain gets
overloaded, and you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700
lose track of time and space.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.440
Same thing in the AR world.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.280
If the Project Tango system
cannot process data efficiently

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.610
enough, then the system can no
longer draw the virtual world

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.230
in the right position, and
it will look like it's moving

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.360
randomly on top of
the physical world.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.750
Not synchronizing
[? post ?] and camera image

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.640
is one of the most
common mistakes,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.400
so we have created sample
code for various platforms.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.640
Pretty neat, right?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.120
You must also manage the
properties of the camera

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.020
and the motion tracking system.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.340
The parameters of the virtual
camera and the physical camera

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.510
must match.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.580
This includes the field of
view, any lens distortion,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.480
and physical displacement
of the physical camera

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.380
in the inertial
measurement unit.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.060
If you don't address this,
errors will accumulate,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.410
and as you move the device
further and further away

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.640
from its starting
point, the virtual world

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.720
will appear to shift.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.820
Yep, this is pretty tricky,
and you need a bit of math

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.170
to nail this.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.870
We've got you covered with
ready to use samples here.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.320
When you are thinking about how
to program in Project Tango,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.720
think about working in two
worlds, the physical world

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.740
and the virtual world, where
the shared element is time.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.039
That, in a sense, is
augmented reality.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.580
Now, there are some
limitations which

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.600
you need to consider when
you are imagining an AR app.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.000
Several factors affect the
accuracy of motion tracking.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.329
Light, surfaces, and
how fast we are moving

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.820
can all create errors,
and here is why.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.000
Again, remember, the
Project Tango device

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.950
works pretty much
the same way we work.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.630
Low light can make it difficult
for the camera to accurately

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.640
detect the surroundings.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.580
Without accurate images,
Project Tango cannot recognize

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.740
your physical environment.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.200
Just as we cannot
see in the dark,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.210
neither can a
project tango device.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.340
Also, the environment
needs textures in order

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.790
to accurately gauge movement.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.140
Imagine standing in the
middle of a snowstorm.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.040
Everything around you is white.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.050
Now try to gauge how fast you're
moving and in what direction.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.660
Same thing with Project Tango.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.210
Project Tango is a leap
forward for mobile devices

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.950
that enables them to run
room scale and markerless AR

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.350
experiences.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.400
Just imagine the possibilities.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.160
Augmented reality can take
your world and enhance it,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.370
and with Project Tango,
you can do that right now.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.940

will build with Project Tango.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.940
