and the reason we did this and I don't

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
and the reason we did this and I don't
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.060
and the reason we did this and I don't
recommend it for all apps but the reason

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
recommend it for all apps but the reason
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.070
recommend it for all apps but the reason
we did this is because if you want a

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080
we did this is because if you want a
 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.700
we did this is because if you want a
weather app on your phone and you've got

are mobile web app so crummy compared to
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.280
are mobile web app so crummy compared to
native apps and and they are you know if

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290
native apps and and they are you know if
 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.500

consensus if there is such a thing on

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
consensus if there is such a thing on
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.020
consensus if there is such a thing on
the web is that web apps are slow

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
the web is that web apps are slow
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.110

a guy named drew crawford and called why
mobile web apps are slow and he did

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
mobile web apps are slow and he did
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.000
mobile web apps are slow and he did
comparison he showed me Oh benchmarks of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
comparison he showed me Oh benchmarks of
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.870
comparison he showed me Oh benchmarks of
JavaScript versus native code and he

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880
JavaScript versus native code and he
 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.430
JavaScript versus native code and he
found of course that especially on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440
found of course that especially on
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.620
found of course that especially on
mobile javascript is way slower than

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630
mobile javascript is way slower than
 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.479
mobile javascript is way slower than
native code and his conclusion is that

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489
native code and his conclusion is that
 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.569
native code and his conclusion is that
web apps can't compete with native apps

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579
web apps can't compete with native apps
 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.000
web apps can't compete with native apps
because they're in javascript and java

and that's why mobile web sup apps are

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569
and that's why mobile web sup apps are
 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.039
and that's why mobile web sup apps are
slow um this is not true web apps are

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049
slow um this is not true web apps are
 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.470
slow um this is not true web apps are
not slow in crummy because javascript is

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480
not slow in crummy because javascript is
 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.400
not slow in crummy because javascript is
slow and the reason is really simple

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410
slow and the reason is really simple
 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.289

that we can pull from this if we really

that we can pull from this if we really
 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.370
that we can pull from this if we really
really try um

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380

the first thing to notice is that on the

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690
the first thing to notice is that on the
 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.870
the first thing to notice is that on the
surface these two rules seem like the

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880
surface these two rules seem like the
 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.790
surface these two rules seem like the
same rule just worded in two different

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800
same rule just worded in two different
 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.470
same rule just worded in two different
ways so I can fill up two points on a

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480
ways so I can fill up two points on a
 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.850
ways so I can fill up two points on a
slide but really um I think they're

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860
slide but really um I think they're
 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.360
slide but really um I think they're
different and one of these rules is much

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370
different and one of these rules is much
 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.270
different and one of these rules is much
harder to accomplish than the other rule

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280
harder to accomplish than the other rule
 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.560
harder to accomplish than the other rule
and if you're going to ask someone who

whole bunch of them and you know the
 

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.650
whole bunch of them and you know the
first thing you learn is that if you're

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660
first thing you learn is that if you're
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.780
first thing you learn is that if you're
going to make mobile animations that are

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:50.790
going to make mobile animations that are
 

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.190
going to make mobile animations that are
performance you should use CSS

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200
performance you should use CSS
 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.350
performance you should use CSS
transitions and transforms because their

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360
transitions and transforms because their
 

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.150
transitions and transforms because their
hardware accelerated in there fast so I

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160
hardware accelerated in there fast so I
 

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.460
hardware accelerated in there fast so I
went back to Google and I said tell me

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.470
went back to Google and I said tell me
 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.230
went back to Google and I said tell me
about CSS transforms in transition

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240
about CSS transforms in transition
 

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240
about CSS transforms in transition
and it worked even though i spelled

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.250
and it worked even though i spelled
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.610
and it worked even though i spelled
transitions wrong and and suddenly um in

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620
transitions wrong and and suddenly um in
 

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.860
transitions wrong and and suddenly um in
a weekend I was able to make my

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:09.870
a weekend I was able to make my
 

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.360
a weekend I was able to make my
animations fast and performant on my

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.370
animations fast and performant on my
 

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.980
animations fast and performant on my
iPhone so then I went on to the next

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:12.990
iPhone so then I went on to the next
 

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.780
iPhone so then I went on to the next
thing I asked Google about touch events

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
thing I asked Google about touch events
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.639
thing I asked Google about touch events
and it told me about touch events how to

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:16.649
and it told me about touch events how to
 

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:17.990
and it told me about touch events how to
capture the event when your finger

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000
capture the event when your finger
 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.660
capture the event when your finger
touches the phone and suddenly my my

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:20.670
touches the phone and suddenly my my
 

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.480
touches the phone and suddenly my my
smooth animations were interactive you

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.490
smooth animations were interactive you
 

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.460
smooth animations were interactive you
can interact with him and then I got

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:25.470
can interact with him and then I got
 

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.199
can interact with him and then I got
excited and I went on and I asked Google

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:27.209
excited and I went on and I asked Google
 

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:29.030
excited and I went on and I asked Google
about app cache it is this thing I'd

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040
about app cache it is this thing I'd
 

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.930
about app cache it is this thing I'd
heard about I always heard that it was

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940
heard about I always heard that it was
 

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.600
heard about I always heard that it was
tough and confusing but you ask Google

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.610
tough and confusing but you ask Google
 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.190
tough and confusing but you ask Google
about it and it gives you the links the

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200
about it and it gives you the links the
 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.900
about it and it gives you the links the
blog posts that you need to know and the

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:35.910
blog posts that you need to know and the
 

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.930
blog posts that you need to know and the
app cache is something that um well it

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940
app cache is something that um well it
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.579
app cache is something that um well it
tells the browser to cache the app so

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:40.589
tells the browser to cache the app so
 

00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:41.930
tells the browser to cache the app so
that next time you go to it you don't

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940
that next time you go to it you don't
 

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.710
that next time you go to it you don't
have to pull in all of the HTML and

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720
have to pull in all of the HTML and
 

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.000
have to pull in all of the HTML and
JavaScript and suddenly your interactive

suddenly the New York Times is asking
you to give presentations and I think

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120
you to give presentations and I think
 

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.639
you to give presentations and I think
that was the body from someone else

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:40.649
that was the body from someone else
 

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:44.870
that was the body from someone else
that's not my body um so learning the

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880
that's not my body um so learning the
 

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.730
that's not my body um so learning the
techniques that perform well is actually

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740
techniques that perform well is actually
 

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.110
techniques that perform well is actually
pretty straightforward it doesn't take

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120
pretty straightforward it doesn't take
 

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.030
pretty straightforward it doesn't take
that long especially if you're already a

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040
that long especially if you're already a

that long especially if you're already a
web developer and we like to think that

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500
web developer and we like to think that
 

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.449
web developer and we like to think that
web development is difficult um you know

00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459
web development is difficult um you know
 

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:58.190
web development is difficult um you know
because it's our it's our jobs it's our

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200
because it's our it's our jobs it's our
 

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.410
because it's our it's our jobs it's our
livelihoods but in reality the hard part

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420
livelihoods but in reality the hard part
 

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.260
livelihoods but in reality the hard part
is all the stuff that happens behind the

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.270
is all the stuff that happens behind the
 

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.730
is all the stuff that happens behind the
scenes all the you know the people that

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740
scenes all the you know the people that
 

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.560
scenes all the you know the people that
work on the WebKit team people at Google

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.570
work on the WebKit team people at Google
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.980
work on the WebKit team people at Google
and Apple and Mozilla who are making the

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:09.990
and Apple and Mozilla who are making the
 

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.720

tools doing the hard work to give us the

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.730
tools doing the hard work to give us the
 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.020
tools doing the hard work to give us the
handful of tools to

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.030
handful of tools to
 

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.410
handful of tools to
make mobile apps I perform well so this

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.420
make mobile apps I perform well so this
 

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.070
make mobile apps I perform well so this
is easy and I really think that avoiding

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.080
is easy and I really think that avoiding
 

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.780
is easy and I really think that avoiding
techniques that perform poorly is the

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:22.790
techniques that perform poorly is the
 

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.230
techniques that perform poorly is the
hard part this is a little bit

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
hard part this is a little bit
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.930
hard part this is a little bit
counterintuitive because introducing

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940
counterintuitive because introducing
 

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.120
counterintuitive because introducing
crummy performance on the web is really

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.130
crummy performance on the web is really
 

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.550
crummy performance on the web is really
an active endeavour the default is good

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560
an active endeavour the default is good
 

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.410
an active endeavour the default is good
performance so one of my favorite mobile

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:37.420
performance so one of my favorite mobile
 

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.900
performance so one of my favorite mobile
websites is Wikipedia and this is one of

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:40.910
websites is Wikipedia and this is one of
 

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.180
websites is Wikipedia and this is one of
the only content heavy sites where i

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:43.190
the only content heavy sites where i
 

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.840
the only content heavy sites where i
actually prefer their mobile site over

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.850
actually prefer their mobile site over
 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.850
actually prefer their mobile site over
their desktop site on my on my phone and

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:48.860
their desktop site on my on my phone and
 

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.530
their desktop site on my on my phone and
it performs beautifully I think the most

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:50.540
it performs beautifully I think the most
 

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.780
it performs beautifully I think the most
complicated thing on this site is an

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:52.790
complicated thing on this site is an
 

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.390
complicated thing on this site is an
autocomplete in the search but they

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.400
autocomplete in the search but they
 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.800
autocomplete in the search but they
don't try to do anything fancy and

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:56.810
don't try to do anything fancy and
 

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.420
don't try to do anything fancy and
because of that to get great great

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.430
because of that to get great great
 

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.540
because of that to get great great
performance it scrolls beautifully um

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:00.550
performance it scrolls beautifully um
 

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.010
performance it scrolls beautifully um
when you click on a subheading that's

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.020
when you click on a subheading that's
 

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.640
when you click on a subheading that's
collapsed it just appears and um you

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:06.650
collapsed it just appears and um you
 

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.490
collapsed it just appears and um you
know no jittery animations and because

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:09.500
know no jittery animations and because
 

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.320
know no jittery animations and because
there aren't any animation so really

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.330
there aren't any animation so really
 

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.860
there aren't any animation so really
good performance is the default and when

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:14.870
good performance is the default and when
 

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.280
good performance is the default and when

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:09.470
there's all sorts of juicy things you
 

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.170
there's all sorts of juicy things you
can do with this and you can't find

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.180
can do with this and you can't find
 

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.850
can do with this and you can't find
anything in there that performs poorly

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860
anything in there that performs poorly
 

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.410
anything in there that performs poorly
here if you try to break it and try to

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:14.420
here if you try to break it and try to
 

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.879
here if you try to break it and try to
do these things it's really hard to do

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:15.889
do these things it's really hard to do
 

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:17.769
do these things it's really hard to do
that because Apple has it locked down

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:17.779
that because Apple has it locked down
 

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.720
that because Apple has it locked down
and they only give you tools that

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:19.730
and they only give you tools that
 

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.499
and they only give you tools that
perform well and one big example of this

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:23.509
perform well and one big example of this
 

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:27.519
perform well and one big example of this
is it is possible to make of course iOS

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:27.529
is it is possible to make of course iOS
 

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.900
is it is possible to make of course iOS
apps that don't perform well and the

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:28.910
apps that don't perform well and the
 

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.240
apps that don't perform well and the
biggest way to do this is to do custom

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.250
biggest way to do this is to do custom
 

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:36.129
biggest way to do this is to do custom
drawing operations and so in in the iOS

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:36.139
drawing operations and so in in the iOS
 

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:37.749
drawing operations and so in in the iOS
world there are things called UI views

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759
world there are things called UI views
 

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:40.179
world there are things called UI views
and UI views you can think of them as as

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:40.189
and UI views you can think of them as as
 

00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:42.670
and UI views you can think of them as as
divs in the HTML world they're just

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680
divs in the HTML world they're just
 

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.439
divs in the HTML world they're just
generic rectangle containers that you

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:44.449
generic rectangle containers that you
 

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:46.689
generic rectangle containers that you
can put stuff in and you can implement

00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:46.699
can put stuff in and you can implement
 

00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:49.030
can put stuff in and you can implement
an optional method on them called draw

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040
an optional method on them called draw
 

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.269
an optional method on them called draw
rect it's optional you usually don't

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279
rect it's optional you usually don't
 

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.889
rect it's optional you usually don't
want to use it but when you implement it

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:53.899
want to use it but when you implement it
 

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.980
want to use it but when you implement it
it turns a uiview into essentially a

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:56.990
it turns a uiview into essentially a
 

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.139
it turns a uiview into essentially a
canvas element where you can do canvas

00:16:59.139 --> 00:16:59.149
canvas element where you can do canvas
 

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:01.179
canvas element where you can do canvas
drawing to it and actually the syntax is

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:01.189
drawing to it and actually the syntax is
 

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:04.299
drawing to it and actually the syntax is
very similar to the syntax for canvas

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:04.309
very similar to the syntax for canvas
 

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:07.539
very similar to the syntax for canvas
drawing presumably because canvas was

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:07.549
drawing presumably because canvas was
 

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:11.799
drawing presumably because canvas was
originally developed by Apple so apple

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:11.809

care so much about you not using this

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:13.819
care so much about you not using this
 

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.789
care so much about you not using this
that they'll actually put this optional

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799
that they'll actually put this optional
 

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:17.500
that they'll actually put this optional
method when you go into Xcode and you

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:17.510
method when you go into Xcode and you
 

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.179
method when you go into Xcode and you
create a file they'll put this method

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:19.189
create a file they'll put this method
 

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:21.100
create a file they'll put this method
here they'll comment it out and in the

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.110
here they'll comment it out and in the
 

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.750
here they'll comment it out and in the
comment they tell you not to use it and

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760
comment they tell you not to use it and
 

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.640
comment they tell you not to use it and
I think they're only reason they

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:24.650
I think they're only reason they
 

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.230
I think they're only reason they
actually put this here is so that they

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240
actually put this here is so that they
 

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.970
actually put this here is so that they
can tell you that it adversely affects

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:27.980
can tell you that it adversely affects
 

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.840
can tell you that it adversely affects
performance and so I think this is um

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:30.850
performance and so I think this is um
 

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.520
performance and so I think this is um
the biggest difference between the

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.530
the biggest difference between the

that it's just it's really hard to break
this rule so where do we go from here

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:43.730
this rule so where do we go from here
 

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.960
this rule so where do we go from here
how do we avoid making crummy web apps I

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:46.970
how do we avoid making crummy web apps I
 

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.500
how do we avoid making crummy web apps I
think the biggest thing more so than our

think the biggest thing more so than our
 

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.430
think the biggest thing more so than our
native apps is discipline um we need to

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440
native apps is discipline um we need to
 

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.019
native apps is discipline um we need to
take great care that we

00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:56.029
take great care that we

00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:53.479
because websites were static and you
 

00:19:53.479 --> 00:19:54.849
because websites were static and you
know developers could implement it and

00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:54.859
know developers could implement it and
 

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.079
know developers could implement it and
you know sometimes they had to do

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:56.089
you know sometimes they had to do
 

00:19:56.089 --> 00:19:58.539
you know sometimes they had to do
disgusting things like chop it up into a

00:19:58.539 --> 00:19:58.549
disgusting things like chop it up into a
 

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:00.399
disgusting things like chop it up into a
grid of images and use tables but it

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:00.409
grid of images and use tables but it
 

00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:03.219
grid of images and use tables but it
worked um but now especially on the

00:20:03.219 --> 00:20:03.229
worked um but now especially on the
 

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:06.129
worked um but now especially on the
mobile web um websites are dynamic

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:06.139
mobile web um websites are dynamic
 

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:07.989
mobile web um websites are dynamic
they're animated it's really hard to

00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:07.999
they're animated it's really hard to
 

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.919
they're animated it's really hard to
design for that especially in Photoshop

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:09.929
design for that especially in Photoshop
 

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:12.200
design for that especially in Photoshop
so designers may have these great ideas

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.210
so designers may have these great ideas
 

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.369
so designers may have these great ideas
for how to do things how to interact

00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:13.379
for how to do things how to interact
 

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.109
for how to do things how to interact
with things and when it comes time to

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:15.119
with things and when it comes time to
 

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.789
with things and when it comes time to
actually develop them it doesn't work

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799
actually develop them it doesn't work
 

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.749
actually develop them it doesn't work
and i think that very often developers

00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:20.759
and i think that very often developers
 

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:23.779
and i think that very often developers
don't speak up about it and they it

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:23.789
don't speak up about it and they it
 

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.060
don't speak up about it and they it
stays in there so i think the way to

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.070
stays in there so i think the way to
 

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.820
stays in there so i think the way to
avoid this is to really developers take

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:28.830
avoid this is to really developers take
 

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.299
avoid this is to really developers take
ownership in any design work and nef

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:32.309
ownership in any design work and nef
 

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:33.769
ownership in any design work and nef
they are working on I don't know any

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:33.779
they are working on I don't know any
 

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:35.509
they are working on I don't know any
organization where a developer couldn't

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:35.519
organization where a developer couldn't
 

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.669
organization where a developer couldn't
go back to the designers and even back

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679
go back to the designers and even back
 

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:39.409
go back to the designers and even back
to management and say this was a great

00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419
to management and say this was a great
 

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.419
to management and say this was a great
idea but it turns out when we actually

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:41.429
idea but it turns out when we actually
 

00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:43.399
idea but it turns out when we actually
implemented it doesn't work so there

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:43.409
implemented it doesn't work so there
 

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:46.690
implemented it doesn't work so there
needs to be this cyclical process of

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:46.700
needs to be this cyclical process of
 

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.169
needs to be this cyclical process of
development another thing to avoid is

00:20:50.169 --> 00:20:50.179
development another thing to avoid is
 

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:53.330
development another thing to avoid is
one platform press preference I am an

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340
one platform press preference I am an
 

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.539
one platform press preference I am an
iPhone guy I love my iphone I will never

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:56.549
iPhone guy I love my iphone I will never
 

00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:59.419
iPhone guy I love my iphone I will never
switch to android I have a bunch of

00:20:59.419 --> 00:20:59.429
switch to android I have a bunch of
 

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:02.509
switch to android I have a bunch of
Android phones and I never use them um I

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:02.519
Android phones and I never use them um I
 

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:04.879
Android phones and I never use them um I
have a Firefox OS device and I really

00:21:04.879 --> 00:21:04.889
have a Firefox OS device and I really
 

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.399
have a Firefox OS device and I really
want the Firefox OS device to be great

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:07.409
want the Firefox OS device to be great
 

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:09.739
want the Firefox OS device to be great
but it's not that great and so I'm

00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:09.749
but it's not that great and so I'm
 

00:21:09.749 --> 00:21:12.409
but it's not that great and so I'm
really about iOS and this is to the

00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419
really about iOS and this is to the
 

00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:14.720
really about iOS and this is to the
severe detriment of for cash because it

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:14.730
severe detriment of for cash because it
 

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.779
severe detriment of for cash because it
works way better on iOS than it does on

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:17.789
works way better on iOS than it does on
 

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:19.909
works way better on iOS than it does on
Android so this is something to avoid

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919
Android so this is something to avoid
 

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.139
Android so this is something to avoid
and this is the less than I need to

00:21:21.139 --> 00:21:21.149
and this is the less than I need to
 

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:25.789
and this is the less than I need to
learn um but I haven't I can put it in

00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799
learn um but I haven't I can put it in
 

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:29.560
learn um but I haven't I can put it in
the slide um the next thing to avoid is

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:29.570
the slide um the next thing to avoid is
 

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.619
the slide um the next thing to avoid is
I call Tess Tess blindness and when you

00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:33.629
I call Tess Tess blindness and when you
 

00:21:33.629 --> 00:21:38.180
I call Tess Tess blindness and when you
develop an app you're as you progress in

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:38.190
develop an app you're as you progress in
 

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.769
develop an app you're as you progress in
development you're constantly using it

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:39.779
development you're constantly using it
 

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:41.210
development you're constantly using it
or constantly interacting with it you're

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220
or constantly interacting with it you're
 

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.279
or constantly interacting with it you're
loading on your phone and pretty soon

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:43.289
loading on your phone and pretty soon
 

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:46.489
loading on your phone and pretty soon
you learn how to avoid interacting with

00:21:46.489 --> 00:21:46.499
you learn how to avoid interacting with
 

00:21:46.499 --> 00:21:48.590
you learn how to avoid interacting with
it in a way that breaks it you know all

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600
it in a way that breaks it you know all
 

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.940
it in a way that breaks it you know all
the little hidden gotchas and

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:49.950
the little hidden gotchas and
 

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.940
the little hidden gotchas and
subconsciously you avoid it and I do

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:52.950
subconsciously you avoid it and I do
 

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.710
subconsciously you avoid it and I do
this all the time I'll do something and

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720
this all the time I'll do something and
 

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.759
this all the time I'll do something and
I think it has no bugs and then I'll

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:55.769
I think it has no bugs and then I'll
 

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:57.859
I think it has no bugs and then I'll
hand it to my wife and the very first

00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:57.869
hand it to my wife and the very first
 

00:21:57.869 --> 00:21:59.600
hand it to my wife and the very first
thing she does is break it she'll double

00:21:59.600 --> 00:21:59.610
thing she does is break it she'll double
 

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.710
thing she does is break it she'll double
tap on things you're not supposed to

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720
tap on things you're not supposed to
 

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.139
tap on things you're not supposed to
double tap on she'll slide when you're

00:22:03.139 --> 00:22:03.149
double tap on she'll slide when you're
 

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:04.369
double tap on she'll slide when you're
not supposed to slide in and completely

00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:04.379
not supposed to slide in and completely
 

00:22:04.379 --> 00:22:07.100
not supposed to slide in and completely
falls apart um and so the way I know

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.110
falls apart um and so the way I know
 

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.820
falls apart um and so the way I know
that I'm falling for test blindness is

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:09.830
that I'm falling for test blindness is
 

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.799
that I'm falling for test blindness is
when I show a new app to someone new on

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:12.809
when I show a new app to someone new on
 

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.279
when I show a new app to someone new on
my phone and instead of handing it to

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:16.289
my phone and instead of handing it to
 

00:22:16.289 --> 00:22:19.310
my phone and instead of handing it to
them I load it up and I show it to them

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320
them I load it up and I show it to them
 

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.200
them I load it up and I show it to them
and I show them how I'm interacting with

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.210
and I show them how I'm interacting with
 

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.940
and I show them how I'm interacting with
it isn't this a great thing and I don't

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:22.950
it isn't this a great thing and I don't
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.690
it isn't this a great thing and I don't
hand over my

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700
hand over my
 

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.980
hand over my
phone and I've seen all the developers

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:24.990
phone and I've seen all the developers
 

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.450
phone and I've seen all the developers
do this too when they're working on

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460
do this too when they're working on
 

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.529
do this too when they're working on
something especially when it's in beta

00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539
something especially when it's in beta
 

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:29.389
something especially when it's in beta
if you're afraid to hand over your phone

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:29.399
if you're afraid to hand over your phone

if you're afraid to hand over your phone
if you try to show people it by you

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500
if you try to show people it by you
 

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.110
if you try to show people it by you
interacting with it then you're probably

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120
interacting with it then you're probably
 

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.230
interacting with it then you're probably
succumbing to test blindness so these

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240
succumbing to test blindness so these
 

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.580
succumbing to test blindness so these
are the things to avoid and there's lots

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:40.590
are the things to avoid and there's lots
 

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.730
are the things to avoid and there's lots
of other things to avoid but it really

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740
of other things to avoid but it really
 

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.570
of other things to avoid but it really
boils down to this the only way that

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580
