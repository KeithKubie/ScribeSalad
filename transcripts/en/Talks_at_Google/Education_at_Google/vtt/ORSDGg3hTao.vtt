WALTER KORMAN: Hi,
I'm Walter Korman,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.940
introducing Dr.
Anne Yoder, Director

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.597
of Duke Lemur Center presenting
to Google San Francisco today.

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.493
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:16.960
ANNE YODER: So thanks, Walter.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.240
And thanks for having me.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
I'm really psyched to be here
in San Francisco at Google.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.070
I've been a fan of Google's
for a long time, of course.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.019
We all are.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.060
So it's great to be here.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.450
So I am going to give
you a talk today.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.080
"Madagascar's Mouse
Lemurs as a Model System

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.640
for Investigating
Speciation, Climate Change,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.890
and (Possibly
Alzheimer's Disease)."

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.050
So as Walter has
heard via e-mail,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.870
it's about four or five talks
kind of squished into one.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.890
So I hope I pull it off.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.460
So for the outline
of the talk, what

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.410
you can expect to hear--
first, to understand lemurs,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.630
you have to
understand Madagascar.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.580
So they're intertwined
inextricably.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.340
So we'll look at
Madagascar for a bit first.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.790
And then we'll
focus in on lemurs

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.130
and why they're so special.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.430
And I'm a Grateful
Dead fan, so what

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.760
a long, strange trip
it's been is a theme.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.400
Species diversity in mouse
lemurs is not about us.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.790
And you'll, hopefully,
get that message

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.190
when we get to that
part of the talk.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.750
And as a side note, we'll
have a little diversion.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.850
So mostly, I do
evolutionary genetics.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.410
And I'm interested in
island biogeography

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.360
and evolutionary change.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.010
But as Director of
the Lemur Center,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.380
I've also been drawn
into Alzheimer's disease,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.080
surprisingly.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.140
And I'll explain how that
happened when we get there.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.760
OK, we'll also talk about
climate change and lemurs

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.330
on the move.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.210
So we all know that climate
change is a real thing.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.410
And it's having profound
impacts everywhere

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.530
on people and organisms.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.230
And it's looking
like it will have

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.580
serious impacts for lemurs.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.972
And so we'll look at that.

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:04.090
That will lead us
into conservation

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.510
in action, or corridor science.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.320
And then, what can
mouse lemurs tell us

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.990
about Madagascar's past?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.290
And finally, just as a
little side end note,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.580
what does any of this
have to do with Google?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.350
And you will see.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.360
So first of all, you
know where you are.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.600
We're here in California.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.390
So we're going to go quite
a distance around the planet

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.250
to Madagascar.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.280
So it's right off the
coast of East Africa,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.600
as you probably know.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.900
And it's a fascinating
place to do research,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.720
because it's not a
continent, really.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.920
But it's not really
an island, either.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.750
So it obeys some of the
rules of continents,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.240
but it breaks most of them.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.070
It obeys some of the
rules of islands,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.810
but it breaks a lot of them.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.430
So it's a complicated
place to work.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.480
And that's why it's so much fun.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.400
For one thing,
I've done some back

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.910
of the envelope calculations.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.900
And Madagascar comprises 0.01%
of Earth's land surface area.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.350
So that's just a speck,
really, on the planet.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.930
But when you then look
at species diversity,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.540
and lemurs particularly,
you find that almost 20%

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.200
of primate species diversity
is found on this island, which

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.950
is roughly the size
of California--

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.220
so again, the California theme.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.880
So that's a lot-- 20%
of primate species found

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.470
on this one speck of earth.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.150
Why is that?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.070
Well, hopefully I'll
explain a little of that.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.870
And another aspect
of lemurs that I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.940
think you probably are
aware of is that they

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.680
are highly endangered.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.270
And in fact, they've
been designated

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.660
as the most endangered
vertebrates on Earth--

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.230
not just mammals,
not just primates,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.300
but vertebrates on earth.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.490
So to be a lemur is to
be critically endangered.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.910
So I'm going to give
you a little bit more

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.270
of a visual about what
that will look like.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.060
This is a circos diagram.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.380
I don't know if anybody's
aware of circos diagrams.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.999
For you computer
persons out there,

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.290
you might want to look into it.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.260
It's an amazing tool for
visualizing very complex data.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.560
So if you can't really
plot it on a graph,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.760
circos diagrams are
a great way to look

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.490
at these multi-dimensional
data sets.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.050
But what you see
here is on the top,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.170
you see the IUCN
status-- so data

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.370
deficient, critical, endangered,
vulnerable, et cetera.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.640
And on the bottom, you see
all the species of lemur

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.460
and grouped by their lineages.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.180
So if we look at
least concern, we

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.090
see there are only
three species out

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.010
of all of these species of
lemur that are doing well.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.970
Nearly threatened-- just a few,
vulnerable-- quite a bit more,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.800
endangered-- it gets pretty
hairy, critically endangered--

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.580
a lot of them, and then we
have some other species that we

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.070
don't know much about at all.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.190
So there is still
a lot that we can

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.550
learn about a lot of
species out there.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.240
And when you look
at it all together,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.470
you see that the hot colors
kind of rule the map here.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.490
So that's a more detailed look
at this critically endangered

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.390
designation for lemurs.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.310
OK, so this is where we're going
to get a sense of Madagascar's

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.760
place on the planet
in sort of time,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.420
and how the earth has changed.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.330
So what you're seeing at
the very top of the screen

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.430
is a time ticker.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.270
It started at 200
million years ago.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.400
We're approaching the present.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.870
And what you're seeing is
the break-up of Gondwana.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.100
Now that green
spot that you see--

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.410
that is the break-up of
Laurasia and Gondwana.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.820
And if you look down, you'll see
Madagascar sort of tucked in.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.060
I don't know if I can
use my mouse to show you.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.120
Yes, so here's Madagascar.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.770
It's adjacent to India.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.540
And it's drifting
away from Africa here.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.030
So this is Africa.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.030
This is South America.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.570
And up here is Laurasia.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.450
So at about 130
million years ago,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.020
it separated
completely from Africa.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.620
It stays connected to India for
some 30 million years or so.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.670
We're going to just
watch it moving around.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.850
And at about 88 million
years, pay close attention,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.820
because that's when
India actually separates

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.870
from Madagascar and
hightails it across what

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.800
is known-- all
right, here we go--

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.010
hightails it across what we
know as the Indian Ocean.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.134
And now you know why it's
called the Indian Ocean--

00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:42.780
because India traversed
this body of water

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.460
about 70 million years ago.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.670
And in a moment, you'll
see a burst of black.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.740
And that's it going
over the Deccan Traps.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.330
This is a hot spot.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.270
This accelerates
India's movement,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.600
and then you see it here
colliding with Asia.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.500
And so this is what
built the Himalayas.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.670
And it's a very
active tectonic area,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.360
as you know, from
recent history.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.970
So anyway, the point,
though, being that here's

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.580
Madagascar all by its lonesome
for a very long time--

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.990
80 million years,
88 million years.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.479
So that begs the question, how
did lemurs get to Madagascar

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:20.270
in the first place?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.670
And that was actually
the initial work

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.460
that I did in lemurs,
was to try to determine

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.690
how many times they got there,
when, and by what mechanisms.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.220
And so I'm just going to
very quickly summarize

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.400
that information.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.520
And I can tell you they
got there just once.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.180
So they are a single clade.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.810
They had an ancestral
form that arrived there

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.500
at some point in time.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.260
We've actually done
those calculations,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.470
and it was about 60
million years ago.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.420
And so they arrived in
Madagascar 60 million years

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.920
ago, one time, and
all kinds-- you know,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.740
evolution has happened in
those 60 million years.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.170
So here we have,
what does earth look

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.200
like at about the
time that lemurs would

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.290
have arrived in Madagascar?

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.180
And you can see that
India is here, separated.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.100
Madagascar has been separated
from Africa for a long time.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.950
So the only option, it
seems, is open water.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.420
So if you study
biogeography, there

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.610
are various categories of
how animals and plants have

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.120
gotten around the planet.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.860
There's something
called vicariance.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.540
And what that would mean would
be that lemurs were already

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.049
there in Madagascar when it
separated from these other land

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.830
masses.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.520
But we now know that that
was-- it's way too old

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.059
for that to have happened.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.156
Another option is a land
bridge or island hopping,

00:08:41.156 --> 00:08:42.780
so that there would
have been some kind

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.040
of terrestrial
mechanism where they

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.992
would have traversed from Africa
or India over to Madagascar.

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:52.450
I won't go through
all the details.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.620
I have a couple of
papers out on this,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.220
but we have ruled that out.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.660
So we are left with what
George Gaylord Simpson called

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.900
"sweepstakes" dispersal,
which is just like Hail Mary

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.390
and build me a raft.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.370
So how did that happen?

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.350
That's one of the
other questions

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.630
that I've asked myself.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.360
So this is a database
from the World Bank

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.190
that tracks cyclone paths.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.600
And you can see
here, poor Madagascar

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.660
just gets slammed by cyclones.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.500
And so these are all
cyclones from recent history.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.360
And what happens is
the cyclones tend

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.190
to come across from the east
across the Indian Ocean.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.210
They're picking up
steam as they go.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.550
They hit Madagascar,
sweep over it,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.290
then they bounce off of the
thermal inertia of Africa,

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.460
and sweep back across.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.360
So often, Madagascar
will get slammed twice.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.790
I know, it's awful.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.920
So Madagascar really gets
hammered by these cyclones.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.470
And it has a huge impact today.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.630
But I know as an
evolutionary biologist,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.370
it's very dangerous to take
things that are occurring today

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.260
and apply them to the past.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.540
You really want to verify that.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.670
So of course, you can make up a
story given what we know today.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.450
And actually, when these
cyclones do happen,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.450
people have observed giant
rafts of vegetation out

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.740
in the middle of the Mozambique
Channel with standing trees,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.910
because it's so violent.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.550
And they're ripping
river banks apart.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.570
So conceivably,
that could explain

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.260
how lemurs and other
organisms could have gotten

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.446
from Africa to Madagascar.

00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:36.820
But again, it's
a dangerous thing

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.890
to take these
present-day phenomena

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.160
and apply them to the past.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.910
And also, notably, the currents
today flow from the east

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.410
to the west.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.480
So they would be in
the opposite direction

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.380
of what would facilitate rafting
from Africa to Madagascar.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.080
But in 2010, this
very cool paper

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.774
was published by Ali
and Huber in "Nature."

00:10:59.774 --> 00:11:01.190
And I actually
reviewed the paper.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.100
And I could sort of almost see
the smile on the editor's face

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.000
when he asked me to
review this paper.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.620
But they did a
computer simulation

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.190
where they placed
all the continents

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.560
in the places they would
have been back in the Eocene.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.040
And they recreated the climate,
and the ocean currents,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.540
and so on.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.873
And it was this long simulation.

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.770
It took a very long time to run.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.860
And this was six years ago,
so computers were much slower.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.700
But the punch line was
that ocean currents would

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.980
have flown from west to east.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.840
And there would have been
these episodic storms, where

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.811
rafts could have been moved very
rapidly across the Mozambique

00:11:40.811 --> 00:11:41.310
Channel.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.150
So it kind of
provided the mechanism

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.280
that I'd been searching
for for much of my career.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.530
And layer on top of that-- some
anecdotal observations in other

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.720
primates that, in times of
great duress, where they have

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.880
to endure extreme climate
or food deprivation, torpor

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.310
or hibernation can be
induced episodically.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.456
So can anybody see the
mammal in this picture?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.390
There it is.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.810
This is a paper that
was published in 2013,

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.480
led by the postdoc
the Duke Lemur Center,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.780
Marina Blanco, who has
discovered-- well, we

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.340
knew already that some lemurs
hibernate for about half

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:33.860
of the year.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.984
These are the dwarf lemurs.

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:37.400
They're very closely
related to mouse lemurs.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.900
And she was the one to
discover that they actually

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.770
hibernate underground.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.060
So I'm going to--

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.790
-show you a great little film.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.555
[SPEAKING MALAGASY]

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.305
ANNE YODER: You get
to hear some Malagasy.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.831
[SPEAKING MALAGASY]

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.830
ANNE YODER: He's pissed.

00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:15.650
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.890
ANNE YODER: So anyway, this
is pretty amazing stuff.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.780
So there are dwarf
lemurs closely

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.490
related to the mouse lemurs that
hibernate for half of the year.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.890
They go underground.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.480
And Marina has been radio
collaring these animals,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.760
and then following them--
finding them when they're

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760
hibernating underground.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.620
And we've been doing genetic
analyses of their gene

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.960
expression profiles when
they're hibernating,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.090
and what's driving that.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.360
And that's a whole
another story of its own.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.760
But anyway, so here
we have, I think,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.940
the mechanism that might explain
how lemurs got to Madagascar.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.660
So it does appear that it
was an over-water dispersal,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.620
and perhaps facilitated by
hibernation or the ability

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.170
to torpor, and
certainly, probably,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.170
facilitated by this ocean
current and these storms.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.200
So lemurs got to
Madagascar just once.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.760
They got there a long time ago.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.930
And everything that's
happened since then

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.160
has been localized
to Madagascar.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.680
And so this is kind
of what it looks like.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.770
So this is a phylogeny.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.540
You can see that the ancestral
node in the phylogeny

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.180
here is about 60 million years.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.080
And then there's a
sort of long pause

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.340
where we get this secondary
radiation at about 40

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.090
million years ago.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.550
And again, this is
its own seminar.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.450
But I believe this is
related to climate change.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.560
When India got out of the
way of Madagascar and thus

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.340
set up these trade
winds, and would

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.180
have set up the eastern
rainforest and the dry west,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.670
which we'll hear more
about in just a little bit.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:51.120
OK, so moving on-- so Madagascar
has had this strange history.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.252
And lemurs got there.

00:14:52.252 --> 00:14:53.710
And they've been
doing their thing,

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.870
and other critters and plants
have been doing their thing

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.950
all this time.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.470
And many of us who
study Madagascar

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.480
think of it as sort of
a speciation laboratory.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.700
And there are multiple,
multiple studies

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.450
of different vertebrates
and plants, and even birds,

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.680
that show that groups
that get to Madagascar

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.150
tend to get there just
once and then radiate.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.870
So you have this really
interesting pattern

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.870
of diversity, but
endemism to Madagascar.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.300
So they're unique to Madagascar.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.740
So what is that about?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.360
My career has, more and more,
become focused on mouse lemurs.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.860
And I hope you will
see why as I go on.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.600
But they're just
endlessly fascinating.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.150
So a lot has changed just in
the last couple of decades.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.350
So in 1993, we thought
we knew a bunch of things

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.830
about mouse lemurs.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.820
We knew that there were just
two species of mouse lemurs, one

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.380
from the west
coast of Madagascar

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.320
and one from the east,
that they were very similar

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.630
morphologically and
ecologically, and probably

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.790
only recently diverged,
that they both have

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.060
broad geographic distributions.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.650
They both readily adapt
to secondary habitat.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.110
And in fact, this is
a very cool thing.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.980
If you go to Madagascar, you
can go to almost any village.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.780
And if the weather is
right, you can go out

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.990
at night with your headlamp.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.350
And if there's some scrubby
little forest outside,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.400
even if it's very degraded, you
can go out with your headlamp,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.934
and you see the mouse lemurs
jumping around in the trees.

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:25.100
And you see their eye shine.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.900
It's just awesome.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.490
So they adapt to
secondary habitat.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.030
And all of this put
together-- back then,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.430
it was assumed that
mouse lemurs were not

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.300
under any threat of extinction.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.170
Because they were
all over the place.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.350
They got along pretty well
in this secondary habitat,

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.030
and they were doing well.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.030
Well, a lot has
changed in 20 years.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.400
So just by a year
ago, over the course

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.730
of these couple of
decades, work that

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.470
has been ongoing--
including a lot of my work--

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.780
has shown that species diversity
is actually very high, and is,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.160
in fact, the highest
of all lemurs

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.849
in the mouse lemur radiation.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:11.190
And you can see from this
picture that kind of one mouse

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.310
lemur looks like another.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.970
And I think you can, literally,
have one species in one hand

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.430
and another species
in the other hand,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.020
and not be able to
tell them apart.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.690
So how do we do that?

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.569
Well so I got into
this in the year 2000,

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.690
or actually about
a year before that,

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.600
when a colleague of
mine, Steve Goodman,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.700
was working with a
Malagasy graduate

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.510
student, [? Rodan ?]
[INAUDIBLE], who

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.170
had been collecting mouse
lemurs in Western Madagascar,

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.900
and was convinced that he
was seeing species diversity.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.934
Because he was looking very
carefully at their morphology,

00:17:44.934 --> 00:17:46.850
and what they were doing
in nature, and so on.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.760
And so Steve said,
we want to send you

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.500
a bunch of tissue
samples so that you

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.530
can prove this genetically.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.980
And again, this is another
seminar altogether.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.380
But species concepts
are very complicated

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.570
and very controversial.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.842
So it freaked me out to
think about trying to prove

00:18:07.842 --> 00:18:08.800
that they were species.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.133
But I thought, well, I can't
turn down all these samples

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:11.840
from Madagascar.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.060
So I plunged in.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.220
And long story
short, it turned out

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.100
that the genetic diversity
that we uncovered

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.350
was incredible, and
was shocking to me.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.150
And from that moment
on-- so this was,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.430
what, 16 years ago-- I
haven't really looked back.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.210
One of the interesting
things that we found

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.120
was that the
distribution of the mouse

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.730
lemurs and their
evolutionary history

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.300
did not obey what
I was expecting

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.230
to see based on the sort
of ecotypes and geology

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.480
of Madagascar.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.460
So that's a long story short.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.120
And this slide is just sort
of a little cautionary tale.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.480
Be careful what you say
in the published form,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.980
because it has legs sometimes.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.690
So I said, so we found
these various results.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.220
And I said, "This
result cast doubt

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.740
on the traditional ecogeographic
models, whereas also suggesting

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.460
that species diversity may be
underestimated for eastern as

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.160
well as for western
mouse lemurs."

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.190
And so just with
that one sentence,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.020
I now get cited as Yoder's
ecogeographic model,

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.380
which is not a model at all.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.560
There are no
parameters whatsoever.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.680
It just was a word
that made sense to me.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.580
And there was a virtual
stampede of activity

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.310
in eastern Madagascar--
people going out

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.570
to look for these same kinds of
patterns of genetic diversity.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.960
And it was really
quite a heyday.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.260
And for a while there, every
new mouse lemur species that

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.270
came out, the press went wild.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.330
And it was just a little nutty.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.310
And understandably,
a lot of more

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.492
traditional primatologists, who
perhaps are not geneticists,

00:19:58.492 --> 00:20:00.430
have been in great alarm.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.430
And this is called
"splitting" when you do this.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.480
When you take what
is one species

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.480
and you split it into multiple
species, that's splitting.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.940
There are splitters and
lumpers, just so you know.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.040
So there was a lot of concern
that we were over-splitting

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.870
the mouse lemurs.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.720
But I'm here to tell you that we
have not over-split-- that they

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.800
really are different species.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.190
And this is where the "it's
not about us" comes in.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.600
Because who cares?

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.950
Would a mouse lemur care
that we can tell them apart,

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.990
or do they care that they
can tell themselves apart?

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.230
So that's sort of the point
of the next part of the talk.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.200
So there was a very nice
paper published recently

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.880
in the journal "Evolution"
about species diversity

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.290
and how you recognize it
just in a general sense.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.690
But I love this figure.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.920
On the y-axis, we have
genetic divergence.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.800
And on the x-axis, we have
morphological divergence.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.450
And so we're up here in
this top left corner,

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.980
where it's non-adaptive
radiations or cryptic species

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.080
complexes, which are problematic
but conceptually interesting,

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.480
according to this author.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.100
And the reason
being is, something

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.070
is driving
diversification and sort

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:25.320
of evolutionary unique
pathways so that they diverge,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.710
and they keep diverging,
and they stay diverged.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.530
But we don't know
what's driving it.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.997
And we don't have the
sort of visual signals

00:21:32.997 --> 00:21:34.080
to help us recognize that.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.070
So this is cryptic species.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.280
And mouse lemurs are
classic, I think,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.710
cases of cryptic species.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.900
And so here's just
a random assemblage

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.820
of six mouse lemur species.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.920
And can you tell them apart?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.430
Probably not.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.020
They're all about this big.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.730
They're brown.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.750
They're nocturnal.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.600
And one looks like another.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.550
I think this is part
of the reason why

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.540
we can't see the difference.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.870
They're nocturnal animals.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.770
So they don't have
the same requirements

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.540
for visual communication
that we have.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.840
So many anthropoid
primates-- which is us--

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.650
monkeys, apes, humans-- we
are very visual creatures.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.950
So visual communication
is for breeding,

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.920
for hanging out--
anything you can think of.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.570
Visual communication
is very important.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.380
For a nocturnal animal,
probably not as much.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.620
So I think we can rule out
sight as an important signaling

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.660
device for mouse lemurs,
leaving us with sound and smell.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.770
So there's a German group
led by Elke Zimmerman who

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.090
has been looking very
carefully at mouse lemur calls,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.350
and has discovered that
the male mouse lemurs have

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.950
very distinctive calls.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.970
So the other calls,
like the maternal calls,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.790
contact calls--
they're pretty similar.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.200
But the male calls
are quite different.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.760
And so we have here
Microcebus rufus and murinus.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.650
And this was long enough ago
so that all we can say really

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.310
is that one was from the east
and one was from the west.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.270
And if we look at the
male advertisement call,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.770
sort of sounds like chirp,
chirp if you're the eastern guy.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.600
And if you're the western
guy, it's more sort of a buzz.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.850
And now, we're going
to have, actually,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.080
an acoustic
experience of our own.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.740
So this, what I've
shown you down here--

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.810
this is the mitochondrial
phylogeny of these animals--

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.700
the mitochondrial gene tree.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.200
And so this is the species
here, Microcebus murinus.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.732
And we're going to hear
what his call sounds like.

00:23:38.732 --> 00:23:42.004
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

[ANIMAL CALLS]

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.940
ANNE YODER: And now we're going
to go to a different address

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.070
in the phylogeny.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.230
And this is a lehilahytsara
which you're going

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.060
to hear quite a bit more about.

[ANIMAL CALLS]

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.390
ANNE YODER: So they're almost
like songbirds, really,

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.376
where the males have these
very different calls.

00:24:11.376 --> 00:24:14.937

[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.895
ANNE YODER: This
one always makes

00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:20.930
me think of the Larson cartoon
about the mating calls,

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.790
shows the guy in the bar at
the end-- hey baby, hey baby.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.170
That is a great cartoon.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.720
Gary Larson always gets it.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.320
So anyway, I just want to thank
Elke Zimmerman for sending me

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.030
these audio tapes
to play for you.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.080
OK, so that's Elke's work.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.330
And so I think we can
say with some security

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.550
that mouse lemurs-- these
different species are using

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.630
different calls to advertise, to
find the right date, basically,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.860
so that the girls
know which guys

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.460
they want to hang out with.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.290
What we've been
doing in my lab is

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:59.050
we're very interested in the
more olfactory and pheromonal

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.130
communication that
they might be using.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.130
So we have sort of dug
into this gene family,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.590
which is called the vomeronasal
receptor 1 group, which

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:14.020
are these proteins that
receive olfactory or pheromonal

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.340
signals.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.920
So they're G
protein-coupled receptors.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.470
And you can see that the
pheromones come here.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.760
They bind to these tissues.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.190
And then signals are
sent to the brain

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.550
to tell the animal
what the pheromone is.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.650
And there's a growing knowledge
about specific gene function,

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.370
like you can actually
say, OK, this gene

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.250
responds to this pheromone
in mice-- but only in mice.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.770
So what we did is we just
kind of did a shotgun approach

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.470
to see what kind of
vomeronasal receptor genes

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.380
were present in lemurs, and
particularly mouse lemurs.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.590
And we got a very
surprising result

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.280
in that-- just to
cut to the chase--

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.590
that there's a specific
group of this gene family

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.260
that is specific
to strepsirhines,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.790
which are the lemurs and their
close relatives the lorises.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.980
So we call this the
V1R strep gene family.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.290
And I've never been able
to name a new species,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.750
but I did name a gene family.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.620
So that's kind of fun.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.570
But so just backing
up, in mice--

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.670
this is a phylogenetic tree
of these different genes.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.470
And this group has actually
been able to determine

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.830
what the specific functions
are of a particular cluster

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.760
of these genes.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.350
So in this example,
this is V1R subfamily

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.780
is receptive only to the stimuli
from female mouse bedding.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.410
So that is the only thing.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.160
So female mouse bedding
and those receptors fire,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.920
but nothing else will
excite those receptors.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.940
But if you look at
this one, this one

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.430
responds to female
mouse bedding,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.790
snake bedding, ferret bedding.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.000
And there are some
that are so specific,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.690
it's only specific to
snakes, or it's only--

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.100
so it's really quite elegant.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.190
However a lot of mice--
who are very cute,

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.360
but people tend not
to mind killing mice.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.720
So a lot of mice lost
their lives in this study.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.110
And with the mouse
lemurs, we can't do that,

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.630
because they're endangered.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.190
And we're just not going
to hurt our mouse lemurs.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.280
So I am actually
collaborating with a guy who

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.950
is a specialist in these
olfactory and pheromonal

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.330
receptor gene families,
Hiro Matsunami at Duke.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.830
And we are using transgenics.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.290
So we are taking the
sequences from mouse lemurs,

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.090
and we're going
to-- I mean, this

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.410
is work that's going
on as we speak--

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.840
put these sequences
in transgenic mice

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.460
so that we can then determine
what it is that gets

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.870
these particular genes going.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.710
And so I was asking Hiro what
we could expect from this study.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.750
And he said, this is
probably too much to ask,

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.700
but it would be super-exciting
if, for example,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.990
the transgenic mouse
started attacking or mating

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.245
with a castrated mouse painted
with lemur soil beddings.

00:28:09.245 --> 00:28:12.920
So we're going to have-- it's
going to be kind of a fun ride

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.340
to see what we can find out.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.540
And in fact, in
Greensboro, North Carolina,

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.670
which is very close
to where my lab is,

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.710
they actually have
fossa, which are

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.170
the natural predators
of mouse lemurs,

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.140
or one of the natural predators
of mouse lemurs in Madagascar.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.701
So we're going to
experiment to see

00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:31.450
if they respond
differently to fossa scent

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.980
than, say, wolf or something.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.430
So it's going to be a good time.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.185
OK, how about
Alzheimer's disease?

00:28:38.185 --> 00:28:44.320
So we're drilling a bit deeper
into the biomedical sciences.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.860
So it has been
known for some time

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.100
that mouse lemurs
get a disease that's

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.950
very much like Alzheimer's
disease in humans.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.880
And there are a lot of sort
of indicators that it's

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.255
the same kind of disease.

00:28:58.255 --> 00:29:03.150
And namely, they get plaques
and tangles like humans do.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.010
They also get cognitive decline.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.980
It's age related.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.790
So there are all
these similarities

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.070
to Alzheimer's
disease in humans.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.140
And they are the only
non-human primates

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.950
that we know of that get
this kind of disease.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.580
And people have been looking
for Alzheimer's models.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.990
In mice, you can induce
an Alzheimer's-like, using

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.022
transgenic tools, you can
induce something that is similar

00:29:27.022 --> 00:29:27.980
to Alzheimer's disease.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.310
But they are so phylogenetically
diverged from humans

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.690
and primates that it's really
not an effective model.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.900
So we're thinking that mouse
lemurs might potentially

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.290
be ultimately an effective
drug-testing model, if nothing

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.040
else, for looking into this.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.110
So we are collaborating
with this guy, Alan Roses,

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.060
who has devoted his
entire career into trying

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.970
to understand the underlying
genetics of Alzheimer's

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:54.470
disease.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:58.800
And he's got a very rich
career, and a long paper

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.590
trail of very insightful work.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:08.050
One of the genes that has been
implicated in Alzheimer's is

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.470
something called tom40.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.310
Again, I could give
a whole talk on this.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.000
But I'm just going to
scoot right to the point.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.830
So tom40 is implicated
in something

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.270
that's called late onset
Alzheimer's disease,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.640
or LOAD is the acronym for this.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.650
And this is one of the
reasons that people

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:31.280
have been so
puzzled and thwarted

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.330
in understanding
Alzheimer's disease.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.130
It doesn't appear to be
linked to any genetic defects,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.080
or there are no
familiar patterns,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.560
so it just comes up
sort of spontaneously.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.690
It's by far the most common
form of Alzheimer's, and it

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.690
occurs in 90% of
Alzheimer's sufferers.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.090
So there's early-onset
Alzheimer's disease

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.190
that does have a strong
genetic component.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.570
But late onset does not.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.540
So that's always been a puzzle.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.460
But the configuration of
the tom40 allele in humans

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.410
has been shown to have a
statistical association

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.090
with developing this late
onset Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.420
So what we've been doing is
looking into the similarities

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.010
between humans and mouse
lemurs at the tom40 locus,

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.030
to see if we can see
any kind of smoking gun.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.340
And unfortunately, we have.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.460
It's very exciting.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.310
And in fact, we have some
intellectual property rights

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.580
filings on the results
that we have uncovered.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.190
And actually, when I say
"we," Peter Larson, who's

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.090
the head postdoc in my lab--
he's really led this work

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.250
and had some deep insights.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.480
But I can't tell you,
because I'd have to kill you.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.500
So it's proprietary right
now, but it's very exciting.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.170
But just to sort of give
you a hint of this-- so

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.092
what you see here is
this is a phylogeny.

00:31:48.092 --> 00:31:50.300
Here's an aye-aye and a
black and white ruffed lemur,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.436
ring-tailed lemur.

00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:53.060
Here's a dwarf lemur
and a mouse lemur.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:58.870
And this is a gel that shows
you the size of the tom40 allele

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.050
that we're looking at.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.770
And you see that the ancestral
form, if you go up here

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.880
to this node in the
phylogeny, would

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.290
have been this very short form.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.440
But if you look at mouse and
dwarf lemurs, it's quite a bit

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.080
longer.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.150
And if you compare that to
human, it's quite similar.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.510
And we've dug down into it
to look at the similarities.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:23.080
And that's what has
led us to this insight

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.120
that I think certainly speaks
to mechanism, and potentially

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.890
to a treatment.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.430
So hopefully, you'll hear a
lot more about that going down

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.880
the road.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.420
And this is one of
the great things

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.980
about having the
Duke Lemur Center, is

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.010
we have a colony of mouse
lemurs where we can study them,

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.850
and watch what happens
to them as they age.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.430
And for a primate,
they age quite rapidly.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.670
They reproduce within
the first year.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.320
They have babies
every single year.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.270
And they go from sort
of early middle age

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.460
at four years old to old age
at seven or eight years old,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.870
and by 10, they're ancient.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.940
So you can see this
progress very rapidly.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.740
Also, we keep up with their
pedigrees very carefully.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.010
So if we see symptoms
appearing in various lineages,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:15.450
that would tell us about
potential genetic effects.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:21.330
So it's a great resource for
understanding this disease.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.914
OK, and finally, one
of the big projects

00:33:24.914 --> 00:33:26.330
that we have going
on right now is

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.730
we're working on a genome
assembly for mouse lemur.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.750
So we all know that
the human genome has

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.020
been sequenced and assembled.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.394
And you would
think it's perfect.

00:33:35.394 --> 00:33:36.490
It's not.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.230
Genomes are very
complicated business,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.860
and there's a lot of
bioinformatics involved.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.400
So you'd probably
be pretty interested

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.570
if you dug down into it.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.490
But so Drosophila,
zebrafish, human--

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.510
there are really very
few genomes out there

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.130
that are of
chromosome-level quality.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.520
And we are almost there
with the mouse lemur.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.850
And we've been working
with the Baylor group--

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.770
the Human Genome Sequencing
Center at Baylor.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.500
And it's a collaboration
between the Duke Lemur Center

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.179
and Baylor.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.889
And we're nearly there.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.969
This figure will be sort of
hard for you to understand.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:18.100
But this was the genome that
was available in green up

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.310
to about six years
ago-- 2x coverage

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:25.040
meaning that every base pair
on average is sequenced twice.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.889
And then the Baylor group had
done some deep sequencing,

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.940
and so they have 100x coverage,
meaning that every base pair is

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.080
sequenced on average 100 times.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.380
And we have taken that--
we meaning my lab.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.260
And we've used optical mapping
and some other really dazzling

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.070
techniques.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.600
Again, everything
is changing so fast.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.739
And we have, as you
can see, we have vastly

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.989
improved on the length
of the scaffold.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.590
So that tells you how
close you're getting

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.139
to an actual chromosome.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.720
And when you see this
sort of flat top,

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.460
that means you've
gotten to the end.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:07.050
So we're almost there,
to the chromosome level.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.580
OK, now taking sort of
a big step back-- so

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.810
that was like drilling
down into sort

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.330
of biomedical potential
of mouse lemurs,

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.540
and just a whole
frontier that awaits,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.270
and we're going down that path.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.000
But we're also--
and particularly I

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.990
am-- very interested in what
has happened in Madagascar.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.910
What has evolution done there?

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.680
And what does the future hold?

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.357
Because as you've heard,
it's a special place.

00:35:36.357 --> 00:35:38.190
Lemurs have been there
for 60 million years.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.860
They've been evolving
and diversifying.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.670
When they're gone, that's it.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.770
There's no going back.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:49.850
So it's a critical concern of
mine-- keeping them around,

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.150
keeping them on the planet.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.520
So what this is, is a
classic paper from 1990.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.890
And it shows you here sort of
before man, original forest

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.180
cover in the east.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.160
And then by the 1950s,
how degraded it is.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.160
And this is 1984--
yet further degraded.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.960
And today, even worse.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:17.750
So with a postdoc, Jason Brown,
we wanted to look at-- OK,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.750
so it's bad.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.300
How bad is it going to get in
the face of climate change?

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.380
Because slash and burn
agriculture and subsistence

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.500
farming is basically what
has driven deforestation up

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.260
to this point.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.860
But now we're going to layer
on top of that climate change.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.530
Just what impacts is
that going to have?

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.370
And we all know-- this
is no news to anybody

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.910
here-- the world's
climate is changing fast.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.920
You can see just in
the past 30 years,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.990
the average global
temperatures annually

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.820
escalating very rapidly.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.400
And I think--
certainly in my view--

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.920
it is without controversy that
this is human-mediated change.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.100
So what our goal was, was
to compare past, present,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.260
and future distributions
of as many lemur species

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.740
as we could using something
called species distribution

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.190
modeling, or SDM.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.380
And this is a
geospatial technique.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.490
And I'm going to race
through how this works,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.290
but it's a very
powerful technique

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.790
for understanding the
appropriate environment

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.940
for a given species to occur.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.790
So how does it work?

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.270
How do you do SDM?

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.540
Well, you start with
your lemurs here.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.250
And you have their
locality data.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.680
And then you estimate the
climatic variables by locality.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.330
And there are various databases
that allow you to do this.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.510
And so you have things
like annual precipitation,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.040
mean temperature, isothermality,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.160
They're very complex
measures of climate.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.280
So it's not just
rainfall and temperature.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.990
There's a lot into it.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.470
So you measure that
by the locality.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.960
Then you do some very fancy
calculations, plugging it

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.800
into the black box.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.440
And then this generates
a probability model

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.930
of species distributions.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.087
And so hot colors
mean that the organism

00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:10.170
that you're interested in
is very likely to occur.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.340
There cool colors
mean not very likely.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.370
So let's take a look.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.050
And then you repeat this.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.270
So this is using
today's climate.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.190
And then you repeat this, but
you project into the future

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.300
under the assumptions
of climate change.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.950
And for our data,
we had 3,377 points,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.200
which actually isn't a lot.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.720
But these are lemurs,
so it's always hard.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.020
A lot of data from
museums and this-- I

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.080
just want to shout
out-- "Lemur News"

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.430
is a very small publication
that's organized by some very

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.950
wonderful and devoted people.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.040
It's a great place
for Malagasy students

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.130
to publish data that
would not be published

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.660
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.510
But it's an amazing
resource for, I saw a lemur

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.350
x in this forest.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.120
And only "Lemur News"
will publish this.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.680
But so Jason Brown, the
postdoc in question,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.630
spent a full year going through
every issue of "Lemur News,"

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.170
and culling from every
issue of "Lemur News"

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.860
all the locality data
for all these species.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.530
So it was really
quite remarkable.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.030
I don't think anybody
else will ever

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.030
do this, or anything like it.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.730
And then there's a
database WorldClim, which

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.070
has temperature, and rainfall,
and all these other climate

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.130
measures for around the globe.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.170
So we used that as our source.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.470
And to get to the
chase, what we found--

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:38.200
and we were using a
model for the year 2080,

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.070
and there are all sorts of
different climate models.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.050
So we used one that was
sort of intermediate.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.549
It's not the Doomsday,
and it's not the oh,

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:46.840
everything is going to be fine.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.940
It's sort of somewhere
there in the middle.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.010
And we found that there are
some areas of Madagascar that

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.310
will remain stable, some
areas, actually, where

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.460
lemur species will
expand their ranges,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.700
but a lot of areas where
they will contract-- mostly

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.910
along these eastern rainforests.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.470
And so what we did was
compile all this information,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:12.260
and condense it, and identify
those parts of Madagascar

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.910
that are going to be
particularly profoundly

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.060
affected by climate change.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.530
And it turns out that
the real hot spot

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.280
is sort of this
northeastern corridor

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.370
here that you can see
in the bright red.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:27.620
So that, in our view,
should be a place

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.530
that we should really be
paying a lot of attention to,

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.010
particularly making sure that
there are forest corridors.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:39.420
Because what this means is--
this is only in 60 years.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.160
Evolution cannot operate
on that kind of time scale,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.930
so this is fast.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.790
And lemurs are going
to want to move.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:50.850
And if they don't have the means
to get there through forest

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.950
corridors, it's a dead end.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.260
So we are now very
cognizant of making sure

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.810
that there are
forest connections

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.830
between these major
chunks of forest,

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.560
that there are these
corridors, so that the lemurs

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.460
and associated flora
and fauna can move.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.720
And I just want to call
out to Jason Brown, who

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.470
did all this work.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.640
He's super.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.840
OK, so that's sort of
the fast and dirty story

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.760
about climate change.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.801
Lemurs are going to move.

00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:25.530
The northeast corridor or the
northeast region of Madagascar

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.440
is going to be
particularly affected.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.190
So this is all climate change.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.960
But we can't forget
that day in, day out,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.380
there is burning going on.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.510
There is subsistence farming.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.660
There are no bad guys.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.580
These are people just
trying to make a living

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.920
and feed their families.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.280
So it's a very
complicated problem.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.120
And one has to work very
much at the grassroots level

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.530
to make a difference,
because it's people's lives

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.230
we're talking about.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.670
So we have a project.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:00.900
And it is just coincidental
that our project site

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.220
is very close to
this area that we

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.170
identified as being so critical
in the face of climate change.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.961
It's called the Duke Lemur
Center SAVA Conservation

00:42:09.961 --> 00:42:10.460
Initiative.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.190
And it's up in the northeast
part of Madagascar.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.970
There are two protected forests.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.510
And when I say protected,
that's on paper.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:25.000
It's much harder to enforce than
it is in other places with more

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.930
resources.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.310
But you'll notice that there's
a big forest here called

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.890
Marojejy.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.570
It's a mountain.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:30.410
It's spectacular.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.740
It's a UNESCO World
Heritage site.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.650
And then there's a place
I can't pronounce here

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.470
further to the south.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:41.760
And you'll see there's no
protected area connecting them.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.650
I mean, that's one thing
that jumps out at you.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.380
So let's take a look
using Google Earth,

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.170
and see what this looks like.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.360
And wow.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.904
What do you see, but there's
a corridor right there

00:42:54.904 --> 00:42:56.070
that's connecting these two.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:02.140
And this was filmed just
recently, so it's still there.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.170
So here are the two
protected areas.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.400
And now our target
is very clear--

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.750
that we want to protect this
corridor, which currently

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.370
does not have protected status.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.090
And there are villages
encroaching on either side.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.780
And you can see, actually,
here how degraded the habitat

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.340
on either side to the
north and the south side

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.620
of this corridor.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.230
So we're going to be working
with the Madagascar National

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:32.230
Parks to just delineate
this corridor, and also

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.070
these other protected areas.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.000
So this is something that's
very important for going forward

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.050
to protect these
forest corridors.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.000
So now, shifting
gears yet again--

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.760
so I wanted to know
if mouse lemurs might

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.350
be sort of like a
canary in the coal mine

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:56.580
in determining when forests are
just on the verge of collapse.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.590
Because the thinking was,
OK, you've got a forest.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.050
It can't support the
big lemurs anymore.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.410
But maybe it can still
support mouse lemurs.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.340
And if you go there, and you
can't even find mouse lemurs,

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.820
then you know that
it is sort of gone,

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.520
and it needs, then, intensive
reforestation, or forest

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.501
restoration, or
whatever mechanism

00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:17.500
you want to think about.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.180
But it's a way to determine
the health of the forest.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.220
So Marina Blanco that
I mentioned earlier,

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.780
who is the one who
studies this hibernation

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.270
pattern in the dwarf lemurs--
I sent her on a mission.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:35.450
And I said, just go
everywhere, and see how many

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.220
mouse lemurs you can collect.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.983
And see if they're
the only lemurs there,

00:44:38.983 --> 00:44:40.220
or if there are other lemurs.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.940
Let's just have a
first look at this.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.430
And so she did.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.640
And she went to five field
sites, collected 29 mouse

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.200
lemurs, seven dwarf lemurs, four
flights, and 4,200 kilometers

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.270
by road.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:57.830
And so this is a problem
I face in the sort

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:02.830
of evolutionary literature--
in that people who are studying

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.470
crickets can go out
and collect thousands

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.480
of crickets in their backyard.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.350
And so we're interested
in mouse lemurs.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.130
Not only do we have to go all
the way around the planet,

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:18.080
and go to these
extreme measures.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.990
It's really hard to get around,
even once you get there.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:26.785
So these are my own pictures
from previous field work.

00:45:26.785 --> 00:45:27.660
There are no bridges.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.700
So you have to find another
way to get across a stream.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.260
This is what air travel
looks like in Madagascar.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.730
And this is a
Madagascar traffic jam,

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.760
which these occur with
alarming frequency.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.550
So the fact that she
went to five sites

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.340
and did all this
work in three months

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.620
is really quite remarkable.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.980
And this is one of
these things that I

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.090
love about science--
you just never know

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.460
what's going to happen.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.050
So at the end of her
expedition, and she'd

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.730
been to all these
very remote places,

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.150
she said, "Then, depending on
the return date to the USA,

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.320
I'll try to fit another short
expedition to Ankafobe to try

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.790
to get mouse and dwarf lemurs."

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.770
She is basically
saying, is that OK?

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.490
And she said, this
is this little place.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.020
It's an hour north of Tana,
which is the main city.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.110
And if you fly from
anywhere else in on earth,

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.214
you fly into Tana.

00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:23.630
So I thought, yeah,
sure, why not?

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.650
Drive up there, take an hour.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.760
So I said, sure, go for it.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.610
Well, it's quite remarkable.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.230
So here we go--
Google Earth again.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.660
So this is Ankafobe.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:40.530
And it's a tiny, little place.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.390
So you can see it's one
kilometer in length,

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.980
and it's just nothing, really.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.530
And the other green that you
see-- these are rice paddies.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.250
So this is really a
very special place

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:58.430
left in this highland plateau,
that's still forested.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.930
And this sort of
gives you the view

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.690
of what Ankafobe looks like.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:06.430
And it's sort of a
moonscape environment.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.890
Now the amazing thing is--
so we got these samples back

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:10.660
to the lab.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.330
We generated some genetic data.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.530
And we took a look.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:18.560
And amazingly, in this
tiny, little forest patch,

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.700
you would expect that it would
be monotypic genetically,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.550
because you would
think inbreeding,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.550
and these little animals
have been trapped there

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.410
for a long time.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.390
And instead, the
genetic diversity

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.880
was the highest at that
locality of any locality

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.170
that she sampled.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.070
So that's when we all
took a step back and said,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.170
what is going on here?

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:42.790
So that started--
that was in December.

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.730
And we've been on
just kind of a mission

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.950
ever since to try to
get this figured out.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:52.850
For one thing, before Marina
collected these samples,

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.440
this one species is called
lehilahytsara, which

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.120
means Goodman's, or good man.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.950
So it's named after
Steve Goodman.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:05.770
So it was thought to be sort of
a rainforest edge specialist,

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.200
because the very
few samples that

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.000
had been collected
previously had all

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.990
been collected sort of on
the edge of the rainforest.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.480
And you can see that,
well, here's Ankafobe here.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.070
So it's quite a bit
to the west of what

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.910
had been previously collected.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.920
So we have now revised
our view of this animal

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.490
from being a forest edge
specialist to being a plateau

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:29.170
specialist.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.710
And this is the first
lemur ever to have

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.780
been determined as potentially
a plateau specialist.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.930
Because the plateau now pretty
much looks like a moonscape,

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.530
as you saw.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.480
So I just want to give you
sort of an overview of what

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.190
Madagascar looks like-- the
environmental heterogeneity.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.550
So you'll see that on the
east coast, it's very steep.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.090
This is where India
used to connect.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.290
It's rain forest.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.200
And then there's this sort of
highland plateau in the middle

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.810
that is the moonscape.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:02.240
And then it gradually goes
down to sea level on the west.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.780
And there is continuous--
or at one time,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.390
there was continuous--
sort of dry deciduous

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.500
and spiny forest along the west.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.260
So it's quite distinct, the
east and the west, and then

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.944
this highland plateau, which
is right in the middle.

00:49:14.944 --> 00:49:17.360
And again, thinking way back
to the beginning of the talk,

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.630
this is why I was so sure that
the eastern mouse lemurs would

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.412
be more closely
related to each other,

00:49:22.412 --> 00:49:23.620
and the western mouse lemurs.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.560
But we found
something different.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.820
So that's Madagascar's
environmental heterogeneity

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.460
in a hurry.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.210
So this has all raised
so many questions.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:37.190
Is lehilahytsara
sort of a smoking gun

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.200
for east-west
corridors of the past?

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.000
Because that was
the work from 2000,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.440
is that I found that there
were close connections

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.770
between eastern and
western mouse lemurs.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.600
And I was baffled by this.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.170
I just couldn't get
my head around that.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.470
And I've been worrying
about it ever since.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.650
When did their
diversification commence?

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:00.390
Have they been living on
this moonscape environment?

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.030
How long?

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.020
What will the patterns
of their gene flow look

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.490
like among and within
the populations?

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.660
And are these relic forest
museums of genetic diversity,

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:15.250
which is what the data
indicates so far, because there

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.350
is such high genetic diversity
in this tiny, little place.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.240
So it was a great, big puzzle.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.557
And this is sort of
the most recent work

00:50:22.557 --> 00:50:23.390
that I'm presenting.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:27.660
So it's still very
much hypothetical.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.440
So just again to
refresh your memory

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.170
about the environmental
heterogeneity in Madagascar--

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.910
so we have eastern
rainforest here in the green.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:39.700
We have this dry, deciduous
forest in the blue.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.870
And then here is this highland
plateau, which at this point

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:48.510
is just this vacant
grassland with just

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:49.790
little bits of forest.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:55.070
So the traditional hypothesis
of Madagascar's deforestation

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.600
profile is that it was
completely forested, top

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.790
to bottom, east to west.

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:00.950
Humans arrived.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.200
And we know that humans
arrived around 2,000 years ago,

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.750
and that entirely as a
consequence of human arrival,

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.720
the deforestation occurred.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.007
And then you see
this in anything

00:51:14.007 --> 00:51:15.090
you read about Madagascar.

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:17.800
Only 10% of the
original forest remains.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.070
Well, that relies
on this assumption

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.660
that it was entirely forested
before humans arrived.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.360
Very recently, there have
been some publications showing

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.330
that grass actually arrived
in Madagascar about 23

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.610
million years ago.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.020
So there's another new camp
that has just sort of popped up

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.300
in the literature that says,
hey, this grassland plateau is

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:38.800
ancient.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.400
And it's been around
for 23 million years.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.130
So what we see now is not
actually that different

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.554
from the natural environment.

00:51:45.554 --> 00:51:46.970
And then there's
something sort of

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.230
in between-- the mosaic
hypothesis, which

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:52.420
is that yes, grasses
have been with us

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.950
for a long time in Madagascar.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:59.120
But it has been this sort web
of forests on this plateau.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.810
And this is this
mosaic hypothesis.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.520
So if that is true--
I mean, we can

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.380
test this with genetic data.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:12.220
So lehilahytsara now is living
in this kind of environment.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.510
You saw that-- these little,
sinuous forest pieces.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:20.040
And one can imagine
before human habitation

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.960
that there would have been
natural little forests, much

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.730
like Ankafobe all
throughout the plateau.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.550
And if you have
continuous forest,

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.040
animals should be able to
move freely in any direction.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.930
So it's more of a
diffusion model of gene

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.365
flow within the populations.

00:52:37.365 --> 00:52:40.600
And we can test this
directly, and we have.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.030
And I'm just going to
cut to the punchline.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:46.690
So we have found that
lehilahytsara does, indeed,

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:49.860
show a very different
pattern of gene flow

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.540
relative to a sort
of diffusion model.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.700
So it supports
the idea that they

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.080
have been living in a mosaic
environment for a long time,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:04.990
meaning that humans were not
the intensely destructive agents

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:07.830
that we have inferred
them to be presently

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.130
in the traditional hypothesis.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:13.920
Also, again, I'm
just jumping around--

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.850
this is complicated data.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.430
But the geogenetic patterns
show that there was actually

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.550
sort of a bridge
across the island--

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.560
a genetic bridge
across the island--

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.480
and that this occurred right
around 500,000 years ago.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:34.220
So there have been
forests across Madagascar,

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.510
but over the past
500,000 years, they've

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.650
been breaking up
throughout the plateau.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:44.320
And this summer, these
data will we published.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.440
So stay tuned, if
you're interested.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.520
OK, so just to summarize
that part of the talk--

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.110
so prior to human
arrival, there was

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.940
a mosaic of woodlands,
bushland, and open areas.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.330
Fire from human
activities dramatically

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.900
transformed the landscape
at about 1,000 years ago.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.640
We know that.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:06.190
But forest fragments
comprised of endemic plants

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.220
and restricted to
valleys along streams

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.800
were isolated far earlier
than 1,000 years ago.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.730
So this has been a natural part
of the Madagascar landscape.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:20.850
And the forests have
been pulsing in response

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:24.535
to climate changes over
this long period of time,

00:54:24.535 --> 00:54:28.650
thus depositing these very
distantly related mouse lemurs,

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:30.757
and then trapping them
in these little forests.

00:54:30.757 --> 00:54:31.840
And then they pulse again.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.631
And they reconnect.

00:54:32.631 --> 00:54:36.180
So it's been this connection
and disconnection ongoing

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.570
for 100s of thousands of years.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.410
So I just want to
acknowledge Team Mouse Lemur.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.780
Everybody has been working
really hard on this project.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.100
And it was announced
rather abruptly

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.550
that we were going to
do this in a hurry.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.890
So Marina Blanco, Ryan Campbell,
Kelsie Hunnicutt, Peter Larson,

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.870
Dave Swafford, Dave
Weisrock-- want

00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:01.990
to thank my funding sources--
NSP, the Helmsley Charitable

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:05.260
Trust, and the Duke Tropical
Conservation Initiative.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.070
So those are the
acknowledgements.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:10.590
Now, what does Google have
to do with any of this?

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.782
Well, a lot.

00:55:11.782 --> 00:55:13.990
I mean, you've been seeing
me use Google Earth, which

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.140
has been my favorite
new toy to play with,

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:21.190
because I can say hey, is
there a forest corridor

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.700
between these two big forests?

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.450
Just Google Earth it, and
I get a good look at it.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.100
It's just a remarkable tool.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.920
So thank you for that.

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.580
And I've been reading
up on Google Loon, which

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:36.350
is just remarkable, if
ya'll can pull this off.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.330
And if you just think
about what we're

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:42.530
trying to do in Madagascar--
training teachers

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.370
to train other teachers
and students-- so

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.820
we're very involved with
environmental education.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.430
But you could see the
infrastructure in Madagascar

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.210
is not good.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:56.530
So certainly in Tana,
yes, you have internet.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.150
But if you get out into
the villages, which

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:04.270
is where our project is, you're
not going to get internet.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.030
You can't go to
Starbucks and get Wi-Fi.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.890
And certainly, if you're in the
field conducting your research,

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.040
you are offline for the entire
time that you're in the field.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.050
So it would be really
magnificent to be able to tune

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.680
in, upload your data,
and work on a cloud,

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.760
or whatever you can imagine.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.380
So this would be
very empowering.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.370
But as my final slide,
I'm just going to ask you,

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.600
please, to hurry with this.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.870
Because I live in a sort
of a rural community

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.960
outside of Chapel Hill.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.570
We're in a green belt. And
the internet infrastructure

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:43.040
is about 15 years old out there.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.930
And we have a
neighborhood listserv.

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.290
And you cannot believe the
complaining that goes on.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.270
And we're fighting
with AT&amp;T every day,

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.390
because we get these--
it's ridiculous

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.340
how awful our internet is.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.140
And so I just copied from an
e-mail from one of my neighbors

00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.190
last fall.

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:02.450
"227 Kbps right now.

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:03.810
Seriously?

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:05.040
I had work to do today."

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.630
So you can impact
people in Madagascar

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.480
and in the outskirts
of Chapel Hill when

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.470
you get Google Loon launched.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.430
So that's it.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:16.630
And thank you.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.680
[APPLAUSE]
