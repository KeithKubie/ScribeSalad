good afternoon so we never finished this

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270
good afternoon so we never finished this
 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.140
good afternoon so we never finished this
guy last time why is this wrong why is

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
guy last time why is this wrong why is
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.350
guy last time why is this wrong why is
this toy wrong so remember what virus

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
this toy wrong so remember what virus
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.200
this toy wrong so remember what virus
this is HIV it's got a label on it so

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
this is HIV it's got a label on it so
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.570
this is HIV it's got a label on it so
can you do you remember anything we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
can you do you remember anything we
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.760
can you do you remember anything we
talked about last time that would tell

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770
talked about last time that would tell
 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.890
talked about last time that would tell
you that this is incorrect you know if

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
you that this is incorrect you know if
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.509
you that this is incorrect you know if
any of you ever start a company to do

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
any of you ever start a company to do
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.070
any of you ever start a company to do
this one day you'll get it right this is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
this one day you'll get it right this is
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.460
this one day you'll get it right this is
not right

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
not right
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.680
not right
it's Ranney to anyone no it has an

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
it's Ranney to anyone no it has an
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600
it's Ranney to anyone no it has an
envelope so what's what about this tells

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
envelope so what's what about this tells
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.670
envelope so what's what about this tells
you that it probably doesn't have an

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
you that it probably doesn't have an
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520
you that it probably doesn't have an
envelope the pointy

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
envelope the pointy
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.150
envelope the pointy
it looks like an icosahedron right it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
it looks like an icosahedron right it's
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490
it looks like an icosahedron right it's
not supposed to it should be a morphus

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
not supposed to it should be a morphus
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220
not supposed to it should be a morphus
in fact but you see a nice fivefold axis

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
in fact but you see a nice fivefold axis
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709
in fact but you see a nice fivefold axis
of symmetry here at the bottom right you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
of symmetry here at the bottom right you
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.270
of symmetry here at the bottom right you
shouldn't see that right right now there

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
shouldn't see that right right now there
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.540
shouldn't see that right right now there
are remember there are some structured

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550
are remember there are some structured
 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.280
are remember there are some structured
envelopes some viruses where the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
envelopes some viruses where the
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560
envelopes some viruses where the
envelope is structured and you can see

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
envelope is structured and you can see
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359
envelope is structured and you can see
the glycoproteins taking on the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
the glycoproteins taking on the
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.830
the glycoproteins taking on the
underlying symmetry because they

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
underlying symmetry because they
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.330
underlying symmetry because they
interact with the capsid but this isn't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
interact with the capsid but this isn't
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760
interact with the capsid but this isn't
one of them HIV is not structured it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
one of them HIV is not structured it's
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.230
one of them HIV is not structured it's
unstructured shouldn't have any of this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
unstructured shouldn't have any of this
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840
unstructured shouldn't have any of this
symmetry so I think it's great that they

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
symmetry so I think it's great that they
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390
symmetry so I think it's great that they
want to engage people with viruses but

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
want to engage people with viruses but
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.020
want to engage people with viruses but
they really need to get it right okay

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030
 
 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.310
 
before we go on to entry of viruses into

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
before we go on to entry of viruses into
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740
before we go on to entry of viruses into
cells I want to mention one thing from

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
cells I want to mention one thing from
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.850
cells I want to mention one thing from
last time I showed you this slide to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
last time I showed you this slide to
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.819
last time I showed you this slide to
explain how capsid proteins assemble

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
explain how capsid proteins assemble
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649
explain how capsid proteins assemble
into virus-like particles and we used

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
into virus-like particles and we used
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109
into virus-like particles and we used
the examples of the HPV and the human

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
the examples of the HPV and the human
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060
the examples of the HPV and the human
papilloma virus vaccines you just need

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
papilloma virus vaccines you just need
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.819
papilloma virus vaccines you just need
to express one or a few viral proteins

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
to express one or a few viral proteins
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.319
to express one or a few viral proteins
and they assemble they self assemble

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
and they assemble they self assemble
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600
and they assemble they self assemble
into a capsid and that's shown here and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
into a capsid and that's shown here and
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.460
into a capsid and that's shown here and
these are vaccines that are made this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
these are vaccines that are made this
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.490
these are vaccines that are made this
way now someone said someone asked me

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
way now someone said someone asked me
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.399
way now someone said someone asked me
can you express the it for a helical

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
can you express the it for a helical
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800
can you express the it for a helical
capsid can you express those proteins

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
capsid can you express those proteins
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.440
capsid can you express those proteins
that bind to the RNA and will they form

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
that bind to the RNA and will they form
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150
that bind to the RNA and will they form
a capsid and I said no and that's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
a capsid and I said no and that's
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820
a capsid and I said no and that's
correct but those viruses that have

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
correct but those viruses that have
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.550
correct but those viruses that have
helical symmetry like influenza

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
helical symmetry like influenza
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800
helical symmetry like influenza
there are other ways to make virus-like

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
there are other ways to make virus-like
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.100
there are other ways to make virus-like
particles and one example is for

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
particles and one example is for
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080
particles and one example is for
influenza which we haven't talked about

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
influenza which we haven't talked about
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.160
influenza which we haven't talked about
much we will

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
much we will
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.430
much we will
it has glycoproteins in its membrane and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
it has glycoproteins in its membrane and
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040
it has glycoproteins in its membrane and
it's lipid envelope and one of them is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
it's lipid envelope and one of them is
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.660
it's lipid envelope and one of them is
called the hemagglutinin it's a very

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
called the hemagglutinin it's a very
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.100
called the hemagglutinin it's a very
important one which we'll learn about

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
important one which we'll learn about
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.470
important one which we'll learn about
today it attaches to the cell receptor

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
today it attaches to the cell receptor
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.770
today it attaches to the cell receptor
if you just Express the hemagglutinin in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
if you just Express the hemagglutinin in
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.330
if you just Express the hemagglutinin in
cells you will get viral particles or

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
cells you will get viral particles or
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.920
cells you will get viral particles or
just the hemagglutinin the membrane

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
just the hemagglutinin the membrane
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.500
just the hemagglutinin the membrane
glycoprotein is enough to make the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
glycoprotein is enough to make the
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750
glycoprotein is enough to make the
particles form and we'll talk about how

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
particles form and we'll talk about how
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.860
particles form and we'll talk about how
they form later on in assembly but so in

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
they form later on in assembly but so in
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.400
they form later on in assembly but so in
fact some influenza virus like particle

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
fact some influenza virus like particle
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.199
fact some influenza virus like particle
vaccines are being tested right now and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
vaccines are being tested right now and
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.930
vaccines are being tested right now and
they're made simply by expressing the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
they're made simply by expressing the
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.229
they're made simply by expressing the
hemagglutinin in a cell alright so there

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
hemagglutinin in a cell alright so there
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.420
hemagglutinin in a cell alright so there
are other ways besides making a capsid

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
are other ways besides making a capsid
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.270
are other ways besides making a capsid
protein or it doesn't work with these

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280
protein or it doesn't work with these
 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.500
protein or it doesn't work with these
proteins that make the helical nucleic

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
proteins that make the helical nucleic
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.900
proteins that make the helical nucleic
acids but it will work with proteins

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
acids but it will work with proteins
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.210
acids but it will work with proteins
that are in the membrane now for other

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
that are in the membrane now for other
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.430
that are in the membrane now for other
viruses you can express other proteins

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
viruses you can express other proteins
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.039
viruses you can express other proteins
so for flu you express the H a you get

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049
so for flu you express the H a you get
 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.430
so for flu you express the H a you get
particles for HIV there's an internal

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
particles for HIV there's an internal
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.229
particles for HIV there's an internal
protein actually within this there's a

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239
protein actually within this there's a
 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.319
protein actually within this there's a
capsid and it's a shell basically and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329
capsid and it's a shell basically and
 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.449
capsid and it's a shell basically and
it's made up of a protein called gag and

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
it's made up of a protein called gag and
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.979
it's made up of a protein called gag and
if you express gag

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
if you express gag
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.020
if you express gag
you also get virus-like particles made

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
you also get virus-like particles made
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.940
you also get virus-like particles made
ok so again there are many ways to do

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
ok so again there are many ways to do
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.080
ok so again there are many ways to do
this I want to leave you with the idea

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
this I want to leave you with the idea
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.509
this I want to leave you with the idea
that you can't do it for viruses with

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
that you can't do it for viruses with
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.420
that you can't do it for viruses with
helical symmetry ok in fact you can do

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
helical symmetry ok in fact you can do
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.449
helical symmetry ok in fact you can do
this for flu in plants plants in tobacco

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
this for flu in plants plants in tobacco
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.599
this for flu in plants plants in tobacco
you can express the H a of influenza in

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609
you can express the H a of influenza in
 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.930
you can express the H a of influenza in
tobacco plants and make vaccines out of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940
tobacco plants and make vaccines out of
 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.940
tobacco plants and make vaccines out of
it you get particles and these vaccines

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950
it you get particles and these vaccines
 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.940
it you get particles and these vaccines
are being tested and the reason why it's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
are being tested and the reason why it's
 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.309
are being tested and the reason why it's
interesting is because because it's very

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
interesting is because because it's very
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.559
interesting is because because it's very
cheap to do this and I think a square

so when viruses do infect cells they

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
so when viruses do infect cells they
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.300
so when viruses do infect cells they
collide randomly with them they don't

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310

they bind junk they found debris as well
 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.170
they bind junk they found debris as well
as cells so that's that's why there have

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180
as cells so that's that's why there have
 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.880

to be a lot of virus particles in part

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890
to be a lot of virus particles in part
 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.590
to be a lot of virus particles in part
because this is a random process and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600
because this is a random process and
 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.740
because this is a random process and
also because the viruses can bind junk

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750
also because the viruses can bind junk
 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.830
also because the viruses can bind junk
for example in your respiratory tract

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840
for example in your respiratory tract
 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.560
for example in your respiratory tract
you have a lot of mucus and that mucus

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570
you have a lot of mucus and that mucus
 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.750
you have a lot of mucus and that mucus
has receptors for influenza virus in it

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760
has receptors for influenza virus in it
 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.570
has receptors for influenza virus in it
so virus influenza virus bumps into that

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580
so virus influenza virus bumps into that
 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.220
so virus influenza virus bumps into that
mucus and binds it and there's no cell

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230
mucus and binds it and there's no cell
 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.930
mucus and binds it and there's no cell
there for it to replicate in so the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940
there for it to replicate in so the
 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.890
there for it to replicate in so the
virus is gone so binding junk can be a

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900
virus is gone so binding junk can be a
 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.430
virus is gone so binding junk can be a

the initial binding of the virus is

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930
the initial binding of the virus is
 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.430
the initial binding of the virus is
independent of temperature but the

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440
independent of temperature but the
 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080

synchronize infection so we can attach
 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.320

viruses will bind very well but they

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900
viruses will bind very well but they
 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.300
viruses will bind very well but they
will stay on the surface of the cell

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310
will stay on the surface of the cell
 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.310
will stay on the surface of the cell
because the uptake of viruses into cells

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
because the uptake of viruses into cells
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.350
because the uptake of viruses into cells
is energy dependent and doesn't occur at

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360
is energy dependent and doesn't occur at
 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.810
is energy dependent and doesn't occur at
four degrees so you can saturate your

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820
four degrees so you can saturate your
 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.969
four degrees so you can saturate your
cell with virus particles and then warm

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979
cell with virus particles and then warm
 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.129
cell with virus particles and then warm
them up to 37 degrees and they will all

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139
them up to 37 degrees and they will all
 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.260
them up to 37 degrees and they will all
enter synchronously so it's a very nice

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270
enter synchronously so it's a very nice
 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.010
enter synchronously so it's a very nice
way of synchronizing the entry process

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020
way of synchronizing the entry process
 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.200
way of synchronizing the entry process
so we take advantage of that so how does

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210
so we take advantage of that so how does
 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.020
so we take advantage of that so how does
a virus find the right cell well it has

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030
a virus find the right cell well it has
 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.300
a virus find the right cell well it has
to of course find a cell to begin with

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310
to of course find a cell to begin with
 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.200
to of course find a cell to begin with
and it will adhere to the cell surface

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210
and it will adhere to the cell surface
 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.570
and it will adhere to the cell surface
now it is drawn close to the cell by

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580
now it is drawn close to the cell by
 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.670
now it is drawn close to the cell by
electrostatic interactions but these

electrostatic interactions but these
 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.650
electrostatic interactions but these
have no specificity and if there is no

replicate in that cell in order to
 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.969
replicate in that cell in order to
replicate the virus has to attach to a

19 so it's the sum of the forces between

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.050
19 so it's the sum of the forces between
 

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.570

the protein of the virus and the
receptor avidity x' is a measure of the

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:13.540
receptor avidity x' is a measure of the
 

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.650

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:16.660
overall binding of the receptor to the
 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.290
overall binding of the receptor to the
virus particle and it involves multiple

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.300
virus particle and it involves multiple
 

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.780
virus particle and it involves multiple
binding sites and it's influenced by how

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:21.790
binding sites and it's influenced by how
 

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.360
binding sites and it's influenced by how
many sites exist on the receptor and the

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.370
many sites exist on the receptor and the
 

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.070
many sites exist on the receptor and the
ligand and viruses are particularly

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080
ligand and viruses are particularly
 

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.500
ligand and viruses are particularly
influenced by this because they have

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:28.510
influenced by this because they have
 

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.620
influenced by this because they have
multiple receptor binding sites remember

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:31.630
multiple receptor binding sites remember
 

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.960
multiple receptor binding sites remember
virus particles are repetitive they are

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:33.970
virus particles are repetitive they are
 

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.850
virus particles are repetitive they are
the same proteins repeated over and over

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:35.860
the same proteins repeated over and over
 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.070
the same proteins repeated over and over
so any virus buying any receptor binding

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080
so any virus buying any receptor binding
 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.600
so any virus buying any receptor binding

site is going to be repeated many times
 

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.450
site is going to be repeated many times
as well and usually avidity is more than

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:42.460
as well and usually avidity is more than
 

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.580
as well and usually avidity is more than
the sum of the individual affinities so

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:44.590
the sum of the individual affinities so
 

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.220
the sum of the individual affinities so

the affinity for one antigen binding the
 

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.620
the affinity for one antigen binding the
antibodies 10 to the fourth but when you

add to this now is described in terms of
 

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.290
add to this now is described in terms of
avidity and the avidity has an affinity

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.300

as a constant of 10 to the sixth and if

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:06.730
as a constant of 10 to the sixth and if
 

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.700
as a constant of 10 to the sixth and if
you add more interactions it goes up in

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:08.710
you add more interactions it goes up in
 

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.400
you add more interactions it goes up in
even higher so it's not a simple sum the

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.410
even higher so it's not a simple sum the
 

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.810
even higher so it's not a simple sum the
avidity is not just a sum of the

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:12.820
avidity is not just a sum of the
 

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.040

that reaction we just looked at was not
 

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.320
that reaction we just looked at was not
a viral reaction but viruses in general

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.330
a viral reaction but viruses in general
 

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.750
a viral reaction but viruses in general
have low affinities for their receptors

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760
have low affinities for their receptors
 

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.180
have low affinities for their receptors
but because there are multiple

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:26.190
but because there are multiple
 

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.130
but because there are multiple
interactions of receptors with virus

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.140
interactions of receptors with virus
 

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.360
interactions of receptors with virus
attachment protein fluidity is high so

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.370
attachment protein fluidity is high so
 

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.910
attachment protein fluidity is high so
for example you can have at least five

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920
for example you can have at least five
 

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.670
for example you can have at least five
or six receptors interacting with

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680
or six receptors interacting with
 

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.520
or six receptors interacting with
icosahedral virus particles and even if

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:41.530
icosahedral virus particles and even if
 

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.260
icosahedral virus particles and even if
the affinity is for the individual virus

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:45.270
the affinity is for the individual virus
 

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.580
the affinity is for the individual virus
protein receptor interaction is low the

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:47.590
protein receptor interaction is low the
 

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.650
protein receptor interaction is low the
avidity can be high so the virus sticks

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:49.660
avidity can be high so the virus sticks
 

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.590
avidity can be high so the virus sticks
effectively to the cell surface so it's

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600
effectively to the cell surface so it's
 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.270
effectively to the cell surface so it's
because of the multi marek nature of

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.280
because of the multi marek nature of
 

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.850
because of the multi marek nature of
this interaction that that is so now

was just very inefficient

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.170
was just very inefficient
 

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.400

the affinities are very low and it

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:16.410
the affinities are very low and it
 

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.079
the affinities are very low and it
wasn't it was very difficult to identify

any receptors but we'll have genetic

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.730

readily and so these are three different

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420
readily and so these are three different
 

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.930

approaches for using genetics to
 

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.689
approaches for using genetics to
identify a viral receptor so we start

00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:29.699
identify a viral receptor so we start
 

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:33.170
identify a viral receptor so we start
with a cell that doesn't have a receptor

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180
with a cell that doesn't have a receptor
 

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.689
with a cell that doesn't have a receptor
it's a an important reagent if you will

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:35.699
it's a an important reagent if you will
 

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.600
it's a an important reagent if you will
you have a cell that it doesn't bind

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:38.610
you have a cell that it doesn't bind
 

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.480
you have a cell that it doesn't bind
your virus so it's not susceptible it

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.490
your virus so it's not susceptible it
 

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.650
your virus so it's not susceptible it
doesn't have a receptor but it's

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660
doesn't have a receptor but it's
 

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.389
doesn't have a receptor but it's
permissive which means that if you can

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399
permissive which means that if you can
 

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.730
permissive which means that if you can
put the nucleic acid of your virus in

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740
put the nucleic acid of your virus in
 

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.189
put the nucleic acid of your virus in
that cell the virus will replicate so

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199
that cell the virus will replicate so
 

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:52.400
that cell the virus will replicate so
poke beyond the receptor binding this

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:52.410

replication that's not often easy to

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:57.029
replication that's not often easy to
 

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:58.639
replication that's not often easy to
find but if you have it it helps you

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:58.649
find but if you have it it helps you
 

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:02.060
find but if you have it it helps you
clone receptors then you take another

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.070
clone receptors then you take another
 

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.210
clone receptors then you take another
cell which isn't shown here and that has

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220
cell which isn't shown here and that has
 

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.310
cell which isn't shown here and that has
a receptor for your virus so if it has a

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320
a receptor for your virus so if it has a
 

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.960
a receptor for your virus so if it has a
receptor it must have a gene encoding

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:08.970
receptor it must have a gene encoding
 

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.240
receptor it must have a gene encoding
that receptor right assuming it's a

that receptor right assuming it's a
 

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.110
that receptor right assuming it's a
protein so then you take DNA from those

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120
protein so then you take DNA from those
 

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.630
protein so then you take DNA from those
cells that express your receptor and you

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:17.640
cells that express your receptor and you
 

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.850
cells that express your receptor and you
put it into these receptor negative

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860
put it into these receptor negative
 

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.720
put it into these receptor negative

you do that because you would like to

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339
you do that because you would like to
 

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:28.340
you do that because you would like to
now have that gene encoding the receptor

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.350
now have that gene encoding the receptor
 

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.230
now have that gene encoding the receptor
expressed in these receptor negative

with DNA you're going to kill them the

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940
with DNA you're going to kill them the
 

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.220

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300
to kill and you won't have them anymore
 

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.150
to kill and you won't have them anymore
so that's not very useful so you have to

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160
so that's not very useful so you have to
 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.610
so that's not very useful so you have to
design clever ways to try and identify

design clever ways to try and identify
 

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.079

one you could if you have an antibody to
 

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.340
one you could if you have an antibody to
the receptor so you could screen for

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.350
the receptor so you could screen for
 

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.199

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480
years ago so I came to Columbia and saw
 

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.569
years ago so I came to Columbia and saw
silverstein develop had developed a way

00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579
silverstein develop had developed a way
 

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:26.630
silverstein develop had developed a way
of putting DNA into cells and I say

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:26.640
of putting DNA into cells and I say
 

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.700
of putting DNA into cells and I say
could we use this to clone a receptor

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:28.710
could we use this to clone a receptor
 

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.340
could we use this to clone a receptor
for a virus and he said yeah so we did

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:31.350
for a virus and he said yeah so we did
 

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.190
for a virus and he said yeah so we did
and we made DNA from susceptible cells

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.200
and we made DNA from susceptible cells
 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.900
and we made DNA from susceptible cells
we put it into cells that didn't have

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:35.910
we put it into cells that didn't have
 

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.320
we put it into cells that didn't have
the receptor and then we we happen to

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.330
the receptor and then we we happen to
 

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.970
the receptor and then we we happen to
find someone who had an antibody to the

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980
find someone who had an antibody to the
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.000
find someone who had an antibody to the
receptor and we took that antibody we

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.010
receptor and we took that antibody we
 

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.740
receptor and we took that antibody we
coupled it to red blood cells red blood

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:45.750
coupled it to red blood cells red blood
 

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.380
coupled it to red blood cells red blood
cells are very big and then if you put

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.390
cells are very big and then if you put
 

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.110
cells are very big and then if you put
those on top of these transform ins you

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120
those on top of these transform ins you
 

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.820
those on top of these transform ins you
can easily see in a culture dish the

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:52.830
can easily see in a culture dish the
 

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.350
can easily see in a culture dish the
ones that are binding red blood cells

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360
ones that are binding red blood cells
 

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.330
ones that are binding red blood cells
just under a microscope so we pick those

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:56.340
just under a microscope so we pick those
 

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.060
just under a microscope so we pick those
and grew them up and sure enough they

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.070
and grew them up and sure enough they
 

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.850
and grew them up and sure enough they
were susceptible to polio infection so

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860
were susceptible to polio infection so
 

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.550
were susceptible to polio infection so
you can use antibodies now if you have a

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560
you can use antibodies now if you have a
 

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.710
you can use antibodies now if you have a
virus that is not killing yourself like

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720
virus that is not killing yourself like
 

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.110
virus that is not killing yourself like
retroviruses you can put genes into

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120
retroviruses you can put genes into
 

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.440
retroviruses you can put genes into
those viruses which then you can find in

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.450
those viruses which then you can find in
 

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.210
those viruses which then you can find in
the transform cell so here for example

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220
the transform cell so here for example
 

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.160
the transform cell so here for example
you add a recombinant virus carrying a

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.170
you add a recombinant virus carrying a
 

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.740
you add a recombinant virus carrying a
drug resistance gene so only the cells

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:18.750
drug resistance gene so only the cells
 

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.330
drug resistance gene so only the cells
that have a receptor will take up that

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:20.340
that have a receptor will take up that
 

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.150
that have a receptor will take up that
virus and you put drug on those cells it

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160
virus and you put drug on those cells it
 

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.500
virus and you put drug on those cells it
kills all the cells that haven't been

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:24.510
kills all the cells that haven't been
 

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.780
kills all the cells that haven't been
infected and the ones that are left now

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.790
infected and the ones that are left now
 

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.820
infected and the ones that are left now
have the drug resistance gene delivered

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:28.830
have the drug resistance gene delivered
 

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.040
have the drug resistance gene delivered
by the virus and then you can clone out

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.050
by the virus and then you can clone out
 

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.560
by the virus and then you can clone out
the gene from them very easily and then

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:33.570
the gene from them very easily and then
 

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.180
the gene from them very easily and then
you could use an indicator you could put

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.190
you could use an indicator you could put
 

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.740
you could use an indicator you could put
green fluorescent protein into your

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:36.750
green fluorescent protein into your
 

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.020
green fluorescent protein into your
virus as well and then sort out the

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.030
virus as well and then sort out the
 

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.610
virus as well and then sort out the
green cells so lots of ways these are

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620
green cells so lots of ways these are
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.940
green cells so lots of ways these are
just three but having these DNA based

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:43.950
just three but having these DNA based
 

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.710
just three but having these DNA based
approaches really opened up the field

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720
approaches really opened up the field
 

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.050
approaches really opened up the field
and we now have lot as I said lots and

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060
and we now have lot as I said lots and
 

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.660
and we now have lot as I said lots and
lots of virus receptors identified and

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:50.670
lots of virus receptors identified and
 

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.180
lots of virus receptors identified and
so here are some of the criteria that we

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.190
so here are some of the criteria that we
 

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.520
so here are some of the criteria that we
have developed for identifying cell

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:55.530
have developed for identifying cell
 

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.770
have developed for identifying cell
receptors you can have a monoclonal

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:57.780
receptors you can have a monoclonal
 

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.570
receptors you can have a monoclonal
antibody so you take cells that have

00:16:59.570 --> 00:16:59.580
antibody so you take cells that have
 

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.040
antibody so you take cells that have
your receptor you raise monoclonal

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.050
your receptor you raise monoclonal
 

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.450
your receptor you raise monoclonal
antibodies against them

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:02.460
antibodies against them
 

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.880
antibodies against them
and then you identify the ones that

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:04.890
and then you identify the ones that
 

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.329
and then you identify the ones that
block infection and you say okay these

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339
block infection and you say okay these
 

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.310
block infection and you say okay these
are these are interesting they could be

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:10.320
are these are interesting they could be
 

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.870
are these are interesting they could be
against the receptor but they might not

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880
against the receptor but they might not
 

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.610
against the receptor but they might not
be so it's not enough just to have a

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620
be so it's not enough just to have a
 

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.890
be so it's not enough just to have a
monoclonal you can imagine that here you

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900
monoclonal you can imagine that here you
 

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.750
monoclonal you can imagine that here you
have a receptor for your virus and next

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760
have a receptor for your virus and next
 

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.420
have a receptor for your virus and next
to it is a very close other protein and

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:20.430
to it is a very close other protein and
 

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.920
to it is a very close other protein and
maybe your monoclonal is there against

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:21.930
maybe your monoclonal is there against
 

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.620
maybe your monoclonal is there against
that protein and they sterically block

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:24.630
that protein and they sterically block
 

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.620
that protein and they sterically block
virus attachment so a monoclonal doesn't

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:27.630
virus attachment so a monoclonal doesn't
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.370
virus attachment so a monoclonal doesn't
necessarily identify the receptor if you

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380
necessarily identify the receptor if you
 

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.050
necessarily identify the receptor if you
take that monoclonal and identify the

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:33.060
take that monoclonal and identify the
 

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.510
take that monoclonal and identify the
protein and clone its gene and you show

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520
protein and clone its gene and you show
 

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.550
protein and clone its gene and you show
that expression of that gene in a Cell

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:37.560
that expression of that gene in a Cell
 

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.310
that expression of that gene in a Cell
can

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320
can
 

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.140
can
susceptibility then the case is even

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:40.150
susceptibility then the case is even
 

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.450
susceptibility then the case is even
better so if DNA encoding the protein

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.460
better so if DNA encoding the protein
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.300
better so if DNA encoding the protein
makes the cell susceptible it's good but

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.310
makes the cell susceptible it's good but
 

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.050
makes the cell susceptible it's good but
on its own it's not enough let's say you

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.060
on its own it's not enough let's say you
 

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.450
on its own it's not enough let's say you
you have a gene and you put it into a

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
you have a gene and you put it into a
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.130
you have a gene and you put it into a
cell and it makes it susceptible to your

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.140
cell and it makes it susceptible to your
 

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.440
cell and it makes it susceptible to your
virus and you want to publish a paper

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.450
virus and you want to publish a paper
 

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.230
virus and you want to publish a paper
saying this is the receptor a reviewer

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240
saying this is the receptor a reviewer
 

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.690
saying this is the receptor a reviewer
may say well what if you actually need

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:00.700
may say well what if you actually need
 

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.470
may say well what if you actually need
two proteins to get into the cell and

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480
two proteins to get into the cell and
 

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.240
two proteins to get into the cell and
this is just one of them and the other

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.250
this is just one of them and the other
 

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.160
this is just one of them and the other
ones already present in the cell and to

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.170
ones already present in the cell and to
 

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.320
ones already present in the cell and to
which you put your DNA so you're kind of

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.330
which you put your DNA so you're kind of
 

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.840
which you put your DNA so you're kind of
being misled by the fact that that one

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:12.850
being misled by the fact that that one
 

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.360
being misled by the fact that that one
DNA or that one gene is enough to confer

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:15.370
DNA or that one gene is enough to confer
 

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.330
DNA or that one gene is enough to confer
infection so each of these on its own is

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:18.340
infection so each of these on its own is
 

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.160
infection so each of these on its own is
not sufficient to but when you put them

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.170
not sufficient to but when you put them
 

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.870
not sufficient to but when you put them
together then you have a strong case

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880
together then you have a strong case
 

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.600
together then you have a strong case
some in some cases different viruses

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:30.610
some in some cases different viruses
 

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.140
some in some cases different viruses
bind the same receptor so for example

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.150
bind the same receptor so for example
 

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.090
bind the same receptor so for example
adenoviruses which are DNA viruses

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.100
adenoviruses which are DNA viruses
 

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.810
adenoviruses which are DNA viruses

was driving up you know I've drove past

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.170
was driving up you know I've drove past
 

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.530
was driving up you know I've drove past
this many times in my years of doing

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:52.540
this many times in my years of doing
 

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.090
this many times in my years of doing
biology and I said I have to take a

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:54.100
biology and I said I have to take a
 

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.400
biology and I said I have to take a
picture of that and finally two years

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.410
picture of that and finally two years
 

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.140
picture of that and finally two years
ago I was driving and I picked up my

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:58.150
ago I was driving and I picked up my
 

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.480
ago I was driving and I picked up my
camera and did it so that's going at 60

agree with that or do you think they're

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000
agree with that or do you think they're
 

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.960
agree with that or do you think they're
there for viruses no of course not

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:50.970
there for viruses no of course not
 

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.950
there for viruses no of course not
they're there because they have a

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960
they're there because they have a
 

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.659
they're there because they have a
function in the cell and the viruses

00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:53.669
function in the cell and the viruses
 

00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:55.759
function in the cell and the viruses
have evolved to utilize them so these

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:55.769
have evolved to utilize them so these
 

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:58.220
have evolved to utilize them so these
all have specific functions in the cell

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.230
all have specific functions in the cell
 

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.830
all have specific functions in the cell
for example these a lot of these IG like

beginning a structure of polio I said
there are cavities and Peaks on this and

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:41.860
there are cavities and Peaks on this and
 

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.130
there are cavities and Peaks on this and
in fact one of those cavities is where

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:44.140
in fact one of those cavities is where
 

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.710
in fact one of those cavities is where
the receptor binds and this is the

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720
the receptor binds and this is the
 

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.110
the receptor binds and this is the
fivefold axis of symmetry so around each

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120
fivefold axis of symmetry so around each
 

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.060
fivefold axis of symmetry so around each
fivefold axis there are five copies of

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.070
fivefold axis there are five copies of
 

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.700
fivefold axis there are five copies of
the protein that make it up and there

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:53.710
the protein that make it up and there
 

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.060
the protein that make it up and there
are five binding sites for the receptor

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.070
are five binding sites for the receptor
 

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.380
are five binding sites for the receptor
and we know that this is the way the

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:58.390
and we know that this is the way the
 

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.270
and we know that this is the way the
receptor binds is because a number of

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.280
receptor binds is because a number of
 

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.240
receptor binds is because a number of
years ago we took with poliovirus which

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.250
years ago we took with poliovirus which
 

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.780
years ago we took with poliovirus which
is in red and blue and yellow and we

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:06.790
is in red and blue and yellow and we
 

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.909
is in red and blue and yellow and we
mixed it with a purified version of the

00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919
mixed it with a purified version of the
 

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.890
mixed it with a purified version of the
receptor without membranes present and

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:10.900
receptor without membranes present and
 

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.100
receptor without membranes present and
did cryo-electron microscopy to solve

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.110
did cryo-electron microscopy to solve
 

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.380
did cryo-electron microscopy to solve
the structure of the complex so this is

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:16.390
the structure of the complex so this is
 

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.510
the structure of the complex so this is
the complex of polio with the receptors

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520
the complex of polio with the receptors
 

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.630
the complex of polio with the receptors
which are all in grey or grayish blue

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640
which are all in grey or grayish blue
 

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.909
which are all in grey or grayish blue
you can see that there are five of them

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919
you can see that there are five of them
 

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.980
you can see that there are five of them
around each fivefold axis so here is a

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:25.990
around each fivefold axis so here is a
 

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.860
around each fivefold axis so here is a
fivefold axis of symmetry one two three

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:28.870
fivefold axis of symmetry one two three
 

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.320
fivefold axis of symmetry one two three
four five receptors and you should be

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:31.330
four five receptors and you should be
 

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.030
four five receptors and you should be
able to calculate how many total

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.040
able to calculate how many total
 

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.770
able to calculate how many total
receptors could bind this particle right

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780
receptors could bind this particle right
 

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.020
receptors could bind this particle right
because you know all about icosahedron

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.030
because you know all about icosahedron
 

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.850
because you know all about icosahedron
symmetry I'm gonna save that for a quiz

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:41.860
symmetry I'm gonna save that for a quiz
 

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.650
symmetry I'm gonna save that for a quiz

so that is poliovirus the receptor fits

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600
so that is poliovirus the receptor fits
 

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.539
so that is poliovirus the receptor fits
into this little groove now in contrast

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:51.549
into this little groove now in contrast
 

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:54.659
into this little groove now in contrast
here is rhinovirus binding to one of its

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:54.669
here is rhinovirus binding to one of its
 

00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:57.480
here is rhinovirus binding to one of its
receptors and this receptor happens to

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:57.490
receptors and this receptor happens to
 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.090
receptors and this receptor happens to
be the low-density lipoprotein receptor

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.100
be the low-density lipoprotein receptor
 

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.340
be the low-density lipoprotein receptor
which has a role in cholesterol

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.350
which has a role in cholesterol
 

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.610
which has a role in cholesterol
metabolism of course and here the

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:05.620
metabolism of course and here the
 

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.130
metabolism of course and here the
receptor is actually well it's also

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:08.140
receptor is actually well it's also
 

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.289
receptor is actually well it's also
around the fivefold axis of symmetry you

00:24:10.289 --> 00:24:10.299
around the fivefold axis of symmetry you
 

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:12.390
around the fivefold axis of symmetry you
can see one two three four five grey

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400
can see one two three four five grey
 

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.549
can see one two three four five grey
receptors sitting up there but it's not

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559
receptors sitting up there but it's not
 

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.980
receptors sitting up there but it's not
in this little groove Rhino virus has a

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:16.990
in this little groove Rhino virus has a
 

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.140
in this little groove Rhino virus has a
similar groove

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.150
similar groove
 

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.170
similar groove
around its fivefold axis but it's up on

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:21.180
around its fivefold axis but it's up on
 

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.290
around its fivefold axis but it's up on
this Plateau if you will right up here

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:24.300
this Plateau if you will right up here
 

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.240
this Plateau if you will right up here
so it's sitting on top of the plateau at

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.250
so it's sitting on top of the plateau at
 

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.530
so it's sitting on top of the plateau at
the fivefold axis so there are many

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:27.540
the fivefold axis so there are many
 

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.030
the fivefold axis so there are many
different ways that a receptor can

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.040
different ways that a receptor can
 

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.130
different ways that a receptor can
interact with the virus particle as you

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140
interact with the virus particle as you
 

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.450
interact with the virus particle as you
can see here now influenza virus also

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460
can see here now influenza virus also
 

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.610
can see here now influenza virus also
binds to a receptor of course and that

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620
binds to a receptor of course and that
 

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.350
binds to a receptor of course and that
is that is a very different receptor

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360
is that is a very different receptor
 

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.150
is that is a very different receptor
that is a single molecule of sugar

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:41.160
that is a single molecule of sugar
 

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.010
that is a single molecule of sugar
called sialic acid

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020
called sialic acid
 

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.020
called sialic acid
so here's influenza virus it's a

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.030
so here's influenza virus it's a
 

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.090
so here's influenza virus it's a
envelope the virus with two different

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100
envelope the virus with two different
 

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.730
envelope the virus with two different
glycoproteins actually two different

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740
glycoproteins actually two different
 

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.770
glycoproteins actually two different
glycoproteins and the third protein in

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780
glycoproteins and the third protein in
 

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.010
glycoproteins and the third protein in
its membrane the hemagglutinin the h a

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020
its membrane the hemagglutinin the h a
 

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.320
its membrane the hemagglutinin the h a
we'll talk about over and over in this

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.330
we'll talk about over and over in this
 

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.840
we'll talk about over and over in this
course is the protein that binds the

00:24:59.840 --> 00:24:59.850
course is the protein that binds the
 

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.210
course is the protein that binds the
cell receptor alright that's when this

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220
cell receptor alright that's when this
 

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.190
cell receptor alright that's when this
virus attaches to a cell as we're

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200
virus attaches to a cell as we're
 

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.620
virus attaches to a cell as we're
showing here it is attaching via the

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:06.630
showing here it is attaching via the
 

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.040
showing here it is attaching via the
hemagglutinin and the receptor is on the

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.050
hemagglutinin and the receptor is on the
 

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:13.640
hemagglutinin and the receptor is on the
cell sciatic acid so here is sialic acid

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:13.650
cell sciatic acid so here is sialic acid
 

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.980

silac acid is typically when it's used

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.630
silac acid is typically when it's used
 

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.830
silac acid is typically when it's used
as a receptor for influenza virus it is

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840
as a receptor for influenza virus it is
 

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.470
as a receptor for influenza virus it is
present on a glycoprotein so here is an

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480
present on a glycoprotein so here is an
 

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.690
present on a glycoprotein so here is an
example of a cell protein a

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700
example of a cell protein a
 

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.180

it's glycosylated it has sugars attached
 

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.200
it's glycosylated it has sugars attached
to it and each of these little balls is

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.210
to it and each of these little balls is
 

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.630
to it and each of these little balls is
a different sugar and when sciatic acid

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640
a different sugar and when sciatic acid
 

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.310
a different sugar and when sciatic acid
is present and it's present on all of

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320
is present and it's present on all of
 

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.610
is present and it's present on all of
our tissues it's the last sugar in these

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620
our tissues it's the last sugar in these
 

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.860

the proteins all right so say Allah cast

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:53.790
the proteins all right so say Allah cast
 

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.000
the proteins all right so say Allah cast
it's always the terminal sugar and that

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.010
it's always the terminal sugar and that
 

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.600
it's always the terminal sugar and that
is the sugar to which influenza binds

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:58.610
is the sugar to which influenza binds
 

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.150
is the sugar to which influenza binds
sialic acid it doesn't matter what the

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:02.160
sialic acid it doesn't matter what the
 

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.400
sialic acid it doesn't matter what the
rest of the sugar is it doesn't matter

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:04.410
rest of the sugar is it doesn't matter
 

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.400
rest of the sugar is it doesn't matter
what the protein is all that matters is

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:06.410
what the protein is all that matters is
 

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:11.030
what the protein is all that matters is
silac acid and in fact we have silac

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.040
silac acid and in fact we have silac
 

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.390
silac acid and in fact we have silac
acids in in our mucus and that serves as

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400
acids in in our mucus and that serves as
 

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.580
acids in in our mucus and that serves as
a good foil for influenza as it tries to

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:16.590
a good foil for influenza as it tries to
 

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.590
a good foil for influenza as it tries to
infect us because the virus will bind

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600
infect us because the virus will bind
 

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.660
infect us because the virus will bind
those free sialic acids and not be able

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:20.670
those free sialic acids and not be able
 

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.410
those free sialic acids and not be able
to bind to a cell there are three types

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:24.420
to bind to a cell there are three types
 

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.450

which is binding in the pocket and you

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:50.259
which is binding in the pocket and you
 

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.840
which is binding in the pocket and you
can see it interacts with a variety of

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:51.850
can see it interacts with a variety of
 

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.330
can see it interacts with a variety of
amino acids in the hemagglutinin so it's

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:54.340
amino acids in the hemagglutinin so it's
 

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.100
amino acids in the hemagglutinin so it's
evolved to have a high affinity binding

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
evolved to have a high affinity binding
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.229
evolved to have a high affinity binding
site in there well it's a reasonably

00:28:58.229 --> 00:28:58.239
site in there well it's a reasonably
 

00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:00.450
site in there well it's a reasonably
good affinity but remember the virus can

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:00.460
good affinity but remember the virus can
 

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.940
good affinity but remember the virus can

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:02.950
bind to multiple silac acids on the cell
 

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.830
bind to multiple silac acids on the cell
as it attaches so it has a good avidity

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840
as it attaches so it has a good avidity
 

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.779
as it attaches so it has a good avidity
even even though this is not terrific

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:06.789
even even though this is not terrific
 

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.970
even even though this is not terrific
all right so that's the sialic acid

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:08.980
all right so that's the sialic acid
 

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.070

a receptor and a co-receptor you need

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:47.769
a receptor and a co-receptor you need
 

00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:50.220
a receptor and a co-receptor you need
both for this virus to infect cells so

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.230
both for this virus to infect cells so
 

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.710

interaction is enough for HIV you need
 

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.349
interaction is enough for HIV you need
to to do that you need the receptor for

00:29:58.349 --> 00:29:58.359
to to do that you need the receptor for
 

00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:01.889
to to do that you need the receptor for

the south now what do we have here okay
 

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.149
the south now what do we have here okay
so this is a drawing of the interaction

00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159
so this is a drawing of the interaction
 

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:14.820
so this is a drawing of the interaction
of HIV with its receptor here's the

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:14.830
of HIV with its receptor here's the
 

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.159
of HIV with its receptor here's the
cellular receptor for HIV this is the

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:17.169
cellular receptor for HIV this is the
 

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:19.859
cellular receptor for HIV this is the
primary receptor cd4 the yellow is the

00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:19.869
primary receptor cd4 the yellow is the
 

00:30:19.869 --> 00:30:22.409
primary receptor cd4 the yellow is the
part where the viral glycoprotein is

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:22.419
part where the viral glycoprotein is
 

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:24.570
part where the viral glycoprotein is
going to interact and here is a

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:24.580
going to interact and here is a
 

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.909
going to interact and here is a
structure of the viral glycoprotein and

00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919
structure of the viral glycoprotein and
 

00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:28.619
structure of the viral glycoprotein and
this is the part of the protein that is

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:28.629
this is the part of the protein that is
 

00:30:28.629 --> 00:30:30.389
this is the part of the protein that is
sort of a cavity which is going to sit

00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399
sort of a cavity which is going to sit
 

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:32.190
sort of a cavity which is going to sit
down on top of this receptor here's a

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200
down on top of this receptor here's a
 

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.499
down on top of this receptor here's a
cartoon of how that works so this is the

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:34.509
cartoon of how that works so this is the
 

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:37.289
cartoon of how that works so this is the
viral glycoprotein here and this is the

00:30:37.289 --> 00:30:37.299
viral glycoprotein here and this is the
 

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:39.779
viral glycoprotein here and this is the
cellular receptor it fits down on top of

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:39.789
cellular receptor it fits down on top of
 

00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:44.669
cellular receptor it fits down on top of
it very nicely other viruses also are

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679
it very nicely other viruses also are
 

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:46.409
it very nicely other viruses also are
interesting to think about in terms of

00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:46.419
interesting to think about in terms of
 

00:30:46.419 --> 00:30:48.960
interesting to think about in terms of
how they attach this is adenovirus which

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:48.970
how they attach this is adenovirus which
 

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.210
how they attach this is adenovirus which
we've looked at a few times it is a

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.220
we've looked at a few times it is a
 

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.909
we've looked at a few times it is a
large DNA virus with an icosahedral

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919
large DNA virus with an icosahedral
 

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:56.519
large DNA virus with an icosahedral
shell and remember this photograph with

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:56.529
shell and remember this photograph with
 

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:59.070
shell and remember this photograph with
the antennae coming out that's that's

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080
the antennae coming out that's that's
 

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.979
the antennae coming out that's that's
here there are 12 of those fibers and at

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:01.989
here there are 12 of those fibers and at
 

00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:04.049
here there are 12 of those fibers and at
the end of each fiber there's a knob and

00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:04.059
the end of each fiber there's a knob and
 

00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:06.180
the end of each fiber there's a knob and
that knob interacts with the cell

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.190
that knob interacts with the cell
 

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.139
that knob interacts with the cell
receptor for adenovirus and this is the

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:10.149
receptor for adenovirus and this is the
 

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:12.359
receptor for adenovirus and this is the
structure of that knob it's a trimer so

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:12.369
structure of that knob it's a trimer so
 

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:13.799
structure of that knob it's a trimer so
it's one protein repeated three times

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:13.809
it's one protein repeated three times
 

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:16.710
it's one protein repeated three times
and it makes it has a nice little area

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720
and it makes it has a nice little area
 

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.629
and it makes it has a nice little area
in the middle which is conserved and

00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639
in the middle which is conserved and
 

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:20.489
in the middle which is conserved and
which interacts with the cell receptor

00:31:20.489 --> 00:31:20.499
which interacts with the cell receptor
 

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:22.279
which interacts with the cell receptor
which is the same one shared with

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:22.289
which is the same one shared with
 

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:24.899
which is the same one shared with
coxsackievirus so here you have an

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:24.909
coxsackievirus so here you have an
 

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:26.909
coxsackievirus so here you have an
icosahedral virus member polio is

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919
icosahedral virus member polio is
 

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:29.159
icosahedral virus member polio is
icosahedral the receptor though sits

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:29.169
icosahedral the receptor though sits
 

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:31.560
icosahedral the receptor though sits
down into a groove and the capsid but

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:31.570
down into a groove and the capsid but
 

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.859
down into a groove and the capsid but
here adenovirus has these fibers

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:34.869
here adenovirus has these fibers
 

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:36.359
here adenovirus has these fibers
sticking out so it's a different way of

00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:36.369
sticking out so it's a different way of
 

00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:39.509
sticking out so it's a different way of
attaching an icosahedral virus all right

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519
attaching an icosahedral virus all right
 

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.099
attaching an icosahedral virus all right
so that's attachment that's just the

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:41.109
so that's attachment that's just the
 

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:43.109
so that's attachment that's just the
first step this is a way of getting a

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:43.119
first step this is a way of getting a
 

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:44.609
first step this is a way of getting a
virus to the right cell because the

00:31:44.609 --> 00:31:44.619
virus to the right cell because the
 

00:31:44.619 --> 00:31:47.099
virus to the right cell because the
right cell has the receptor that the

00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:47.109
right cell has the receptor that the
 

00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:49.649
right cell has the receptor that the
virus has evolved to interact with then

00:31:49.649 --> 00:31:49.659
virus has evolved to interact with then
 

00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:51.299
virus has evolved to interact with then
the virus has to get into the cell

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:51.309
the virus has to get into the cell
 

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.310
the virus has to get into the cell
because it's nucleic acid needs to go

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320
because it's nucleic acid needs to go
 

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.570
because it's nucleic acid needs to go
there so let's talk about how that

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.580
there so let's talk about how that
 

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.169
there so let's talk about how that
happens virus is just usurped cellular

00:31:58.169 --> 00:31:58.179
happens virus is just usurped cellular
 

00:31:58.179 --> 00:31:59.909
happens virus is just usurped cellular
pathways cells are very good at taking

00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919
pathways cells are very good at taking
 

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.859
pathways cells are very good at taking
up things from the extracellular medium

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:01.869
up things from the extracellular medium
 

00:32:01.869 --> 00:32:03.389
up things from the extracellular medium
they have to be able to do that to

00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399
they have to be able to do that to
 

00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:05.909
they have to be able to do that to
survive here are two general ways that

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919
survive here are two general ways that
 

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:07.200
survive here are two general ways that
they do that they take up large

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.210
they do that they take up large
 

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.399
they do that they take up large
particles by phagocytosis but we're not

00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:11.409
particles by phagocytosis but we're not
 

00:32:11.409 --> 00:32:12.869
particles by phagocytosis but we're not
going to consider that today because

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:12.879
going to consider that today because
 

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:14.460
going to consider that today because
that's not how viruses get into the

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.470
that's not how viruses get into the
 

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.759
that's not how viruses get into the
cells they usually get in by some form

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:17.769
cells they usually get in by some form
 

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.979
cells they usually get in by some form
of endocytosis and this is the way cells

00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:19.989
of endocytosis and this is the way cells
 

00:32:19.989 --> 00:32:24.389
of endocytosis and this is the way cells
take up smaller material so a subset of

00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399
take up smaller material so a subset of
 

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:27.029
take up smaller material so a subset of
endocytosis is called pinocytosis the

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039
endocytosis is called pinocytosis the
 

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:29.099
endocytosis is called pinocytosis the
membrane of a cell is always pinching in

00:32:29.099 --> 00:32:29.109
membrane of a cell is always pinching in
 

00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:31.649
membrane of a cell is always pinching in
invaginate and taking up components of

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:31.659
invaginate and taking up components of
 

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:33.479
invaginate and taking up components of
the extracellular medium it's also

00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:33.489
the extracellular medium it's also
 

00:32:33.489 --> 00:32:35.519
the extracellular medium it's also
called cellular drinking it's their way

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:35.529
called cellular drinking it's their way
 

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:37.529
called cellular drinking it's their way
of getting small molecules into the cell

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:37.539
of getting small molecules into the cell
 

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:39.210
of getting small molecules into the cell
it's not specific

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:39.220
it's not specific
 

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.039
it's not specific
it's whatever ends up being in these

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:41.049
it's whatever ends up being in these
 

00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:43.259
it's whatever ends up being in these
vesicles as they invasion ate and

00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:43.269
vesicles as they invasion ate and
 

00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:45.659
vesicles as they invasion ate and
pinched off this is a continuous process

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:45.669
pinched off this is a continuous process
 

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:48.570
pinched off this is a continuous process
many cells do this all the time a good

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:48.580
many cells do this all the time a good
 

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.279
many cells do this all the time a good
fraction of their plasma membrane is

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:50.289
fraction of their plasma membrane is
 

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:52.470
fraction of their plasma membrane is
always imaginating and bringing material

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480
always imaginating and bringing material
 

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.200
always imaginating and bringing material
in there's a variant of this called

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.210
in there's a variant of this called
 

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.109
in there's a variant of this called
receptor mediated endocytosis and this

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:58.119
receptor mediated endocytosis and this
 

00:32:58.119 --> 00:33:00.989
receptor mediated endocytosis and this
there are specific receptors for ligands

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:00.999
there are specific receptors for ligands
 

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:02.759
there are specific receptors for ligands
on the cell surface that the VAR that

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:02.769
on the cell surface that the VAR that
 

00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:04.769
on the cell surface that the VAR that
the cell wants to bring in and when

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:04.779
the cell wants to bring in and when
 

00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:07.739
the cell wants to bring in and when
those ligands bind that stimulates the

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:07.749
those ligands bind that stimulates the
 

00:33:07.749 --> 00:33:09.330
those ligands bind that stimulates the
endocytic pathway so this is not

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:09.340
endocytic pathway so this is not
 

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.240
endocytic pathway so this is not
constitutive this only occurs when

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.250
constitutive this only occurs when
 

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.000
constitutive this only occurs when
the ligand is bound and these are taken

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.010
the ligand is bound and these are taken
 

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.430
the ligand is bound and these are taken
up into vesicles which eventually

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440
up into vesicles which eventually
 

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.850
up into vesicles which eventually
proceed into the cell till viruses usurp

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:20.860
proceed into the cell till viruses usurp
 

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.740
proceed into the cell till viruses usurp
this pathway to get it and not all of

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:22.750
this pathway to get it and not all of
 

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.510
this pathway to get it and not all of
them do but many of them do as you will

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:24.520
them do but many of them do as you will

them do but many of them do as you will
see now to move yes this one now this is

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:34.809
see now to move yes this one now this is
 

00:33:34.809 --> 00:33:37.470
see now to move yes this one now this is
just a ligand that sells something that

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480
just a ligand that sells something that
 

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.230
just a ligand that sells something that
the cell wants to take up there are

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240
the cell wants to take up there are
 

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.840
the cell wants to take up there are
receptors for various compounds in in

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:42.850
receptors for various compounds in in
 

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.640
receptors for various compounds in in
the extracellular fluids that the cell

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:44.650
the extracellular fluids that the cell
 

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.789
the extracellular fluids that the cell
wants to bring in and so there is a

00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799
wants to bring in and so there is a
 

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:50.250
wants to bring in and so there is a
process endocytosis that is evolved to

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:50.260
process endocytosis that is evolved to
 

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.289
process endocytosis that is evolved to
do that it's the same pathway that the

00:33:52.289 --> 00:33:52.299
do that it's the same pathway that the
 

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:54.000
do that it's the same pathway that the
virus is used so this is not a virus

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.010
virus is used so this is not a virus
 

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.830

such as this the virus would compete

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080
such as this the virus would compete
 

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.330

ik pathway one thing you have to
 

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.290
ik pathway one thing you have to
remember is that this kind of a picture

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:16.300
remember is that this kind of a picture
 

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.540

long it's not efficient so there are

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.070
long it's not efficient so there are
 

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.160
long it's not efficient so there are
active pathways that's what the point is

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.170
active pathways that's what the point is
 

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.800
active pathways that's what the point is
here and these are summarized on the

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:32.810
here and these are summarized on the
 

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.140
here and these are summarized on the

transport machinery so here's a summary

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760
transport machinery so here's a summary
 

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.750
transport machinery so here's a summary
of some of those and there are very

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760
of some of those and there are very
 

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.490
of some of those and there are very
specific ways that vesicles and acidic

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:42.500
specific ways that vesicles and acidic
 

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.880
specific ways that vesicles and acidic
vesicles get into the cell via this from

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:45.890
vesicles get into the cell via this from
 

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:51.700
vesicles get into the cell via this from
the cell surface yeah

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:51.710
 
 

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.579
 
I think it's roughly the maybe it

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:54.589
I think it's roughly the maybe it
 

00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:56.109
I think it's roughly the maybe it
depends you know if it's a flat cell and

00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119
depends you know if it's a flat cell and
 

00:36:56.119 --> 00:36:58.089
depends you know if it's a flat cell and

00:36:58.089 --> 00:36:58.099
a cell culture dish versus a round sound
 

00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:00.609
a cell culture dish versus a round sound
suspension but it's roughly the this the

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:00.619
suspension but it's roughly the this the
 

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:02.260
suspension but it's roughly the this the
height of a cell growing on a tissue

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.270
height of a cell growing on a tissue
 

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.210
height of a cell growing on a tissue
culture this yeah that's the point of

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.220
culture this yeah that's the point of
 

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.620
culture this yeah that's the point of
that calculation how long it would take

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.630
that calculation how long it would take
 

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.140
that calculation how long it would take
to get to get into the deep part of the

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.150
to get to get into the deep part of the
 

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.410
to get to get into the deep part of the
cell so here are some pathways that

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:11.420
cell so here are some pathways that
 

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.089
cell so here are some pathways that
viruses use and we'll talk about some of

00:37:13.089 --> 00:37:13.099
viruses use and we'll talk about some of
 

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:16.420
viruses use and we'll talk about some of
these some some viruses fuse right at

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:16.430
these some some viruses fuse right at
 

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.089
these some some viruses fuse right at
the cell surface but they still have to

00:37:19.089 --> 00:37:19.099
the cell surface but they still have to
 

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:22.720
the cell surface but they still have to
get through this microfilament boundary

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:22.730
get through this microfilament boundary
 

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.130
get through this microfilament boundary

just can't pass through it has to do

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.210
just can't pass through it has to do
 

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.700
just can't pass through it has to do
something to disrupt it and there are

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:30.710
something to disrupt it and there are
 

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.990
something to disrupt it and there are
signaling pathways that are being

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000
signaling pathways that are being
 

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.240
signaling pathways that are being
identified where virus binding to a

identified where virus binding to a
 

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.730
identified where virus binding to a
receptor causes the actin to dissociate

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:36.740

taken up into an endosome and moved into
 

00:40:16.759 --> 00:40:18.640
taken up into an endosome and moved into

are envelope 2 viruses with helical
genomes this virus fuses right at the

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.150
genomes this virus fuses right at the
 

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.960
genomes this virus fuses right at the
plasma membrane and so the nucleic acid

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:28.970
plasma membrane and so the nucleic acid
 

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:30.549
plasma membrane and so the nucleic acid
can get into the cytoplasm and that's

00:40:30.549 --> 00:40:30.559
can get into the cytoplasm and that's
 

00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:31.839
can get into the cytoplasm and that's
where it needs to be it doesn't have to

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:31.849
where it needs to be it doesn't have to
 

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:34.390
where it needs to be it doesn't have to

go to the nucleus if it had to be in the
 

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.950
go to the nucleus if it had to be in the
nucleus it would have evolved to be

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960
nucleus it would have evolved to be
 

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.989

00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:37.999
taken up by endocytosis and moved down
 

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:40.089
taken up by endocytosis and moved down
in microtubule track all right but this

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:40.099
in microtubule track all right but this
 

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:42.489

virus that once the RNA is in the
cytoplasm it can start replicating but

showing any of those microfilaments here
so this is a little misleading it's not

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:49.609
so this is a little misleading it's not
 

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:51.759
so this is a little misleading it's not
easy to get from here to here there have

00:40:51.769 --> 00:40:54.339
easy to get from here to here there have

there is a viral glycoprotein it's

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:01.849
there is a viral glycoprotein it's
 

00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:05.739
there is a viral glycoprotein it's
called the hn4 paramyxovirus --is which

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:05.749
called the hn4 paramyxovirus --is which
 

00:41:05.749 --> 00:41:08.829
called the hn4 paramyxovirus --is which
interacts with a cellular receptor so

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839
interacts with a cellular receptor so
 

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:11.349
interacts with a cellular receptor so
here for example the HN is recept is

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359
here for example the HN is recept is
 

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:13.569
here for example the HN is recept is
interacting with a red protein on the

00:41:13.569 --> 00:41:13.579
interacting with a red protein on the
 

00:41:13.579 --> 00:41:16.029
interacting with a red protein on the
cell this is the cell receptor but

00:41:16.029 --> 00:41:16.039
cell this is the cell receptor but
 

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:18.460
cell this is the cell receptor but
that's not enough to fuse the viral in

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.470
that's not enough to fuse the viral in
 

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.789
that's not enough to fuse the viral in
this

00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:18.799
this
 

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:20.559
this

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.130
enough you have to have something else
 

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.150
enough you have to have something else
to confer specificity because if this

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160
to confer specificity because if this
 

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.160

is normally hidden but when this HN

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:48.709
is normally hidden but when this HN
 

00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:52.150
is normally hidden but when this HN
binds its receptor it unfolds the fusion

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160
binds its receptor it unfolds the fusion
 

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.249
binds its receptor it unfolds the fusion
protein so that can now stick into the

00:41:54.249 --> 00:41:54.259
protein so that can now stick into the
 

00:41:54.259 --> 00:41:58.029

receptor causes a conformational change

00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119
receptor causes a conformational change
 

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:07.359

HIV also does a similar thing it fuses

00:42:20.169 --> 00:42:20.179
HIV also does a similar thing it fuses
 

00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:23.799
HIV also does a similar thing it fuses
at the plasma membrane here is a variant

00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:23.809
at the plasma membrane here is a variant
 

00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:26.169
at the plasma membrane here is a variant
of HIV and this is the glycoprotein that

00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:26.179
of HIV and this is the glycoprotein that
 

00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:28.299
of HIV and this is the glycoprotein that
is going to be involved in attachment

00:42:28.299 --> 00:42:28.309
is going to be involved in attachment
 

00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:32.289
is going to be involved in attachment
and fusion it has two components the TM

00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:32.299
and fusion it has two components the TM
 

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:34.390
and fusion it has two components the TM
or transmembrane component and that has

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400
or transmembrane component and that has
 

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.969
or transmembrane component and that has
the fusion peptide on the end and then a

00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:36.979
the fusion peptide on the end and then a
 

00:42:36.979 --> 00:42:41.199
the fusion peptide on the end and then a
su which stands for surface the su binds

00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:41.209
su which stands for surface the su binds
 

00:42:41.209 --> 00:42:45.130
su which stands for surface the su binds
the cellular receptor which is cd4 shown

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:45.140
the cellular receptor which is cd4 shown
 

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.989
the cellular receptor which is cd4 shown
in green here when that happens there is

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:46.999
in green here when that happens there is
 

00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:51.099
in green here when that happens there is
a conformational change in su which then

00:42:51.099 --> 00:42:51.109
a conformational change in su which then
 

00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:53.199
a conformational change in su which then
allows it to bind the co receptor which

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:53.209
allows it to bind the co receptor which
 

00:42:53.209 --> 00:42:55.449
allows it to bind the co receptor which
is shown here is the chemokine receptor

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:55.459
is shown here is the chemokine receptor
 

00:42:55.459 --> 00:42:57.569
is shown here is the chemokine receptor
so this is a virus that needs two

00:42:57.569 --> 00:42:57.579
so this is a virus that needs two
 

00:42:57.579 --> 00:43:00.249
so this is a virus that needs two
distinct cellular receptors to get into

00:43:00.249 --> 00:43:00.259
distinct cellular receptors to get into
 

00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:03.519
distinct cellular receptors to get into
the cell once the co receptor and the

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:03.529
the cell once the co receptor and the
 

00:43:03.529 --> 00:43:07.359
the cell once the co receptor and the
receptor both engaged with su then the

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:07.369
receptor both engaged with su then the
 

00:43:07.369 --> 00:43:10.150
receptor both engaged with su then the
TM segment unfolds and the fusion

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160
TM segment unfolds and the fusion
 

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.509
TM segment unfolds and the fusion
protein goes into the membrane so two

00:43:13.509 --> 00:43:13.519
protein goes into the membrane so two
 

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:16.569
protein goes into the membrane so two
receptor requiring virus both of the Co

00:43:16.569 --> 00:43:16.579
receptor requiring virus both of the Co
 

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:19.089
receptor requiring virus both of the Co
receptors interact with su it has to

00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:19.099
receptors interact with su it has to
 

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:23.109
receptors interact with su it has to
happen in in sequence first cd4 has to

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119
happen in in sequence first cd4 has to
 

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:26.049
happen in in sequence first cd4 has to
be engaged and then that allows su to

00:43:26.049 --> 00:43:26.059
be engaged and then that allows su to
 

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:28.689
be engaged and then that allows su to
engage the chemokine receptor and this

00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:28.699
engage the chemokine receptor and this
 

00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:30.980
engage the chemokine receptor and this
again happens at the plasma membrane

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:30.990
again happens at the plasma membrane
 

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.470
again happens at the plasma membrane
this fusion is triggered right there and

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480
this fusion is triggered right there and
 

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.080
this fusion is triggered right there and
the virus nucleic acid is deposited into

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.090
the virus nucleic acid is deposited into
 

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.230
the virus nucleic acid is deposited into
the cell now this is in contrast to a

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240
the cell now this is in contrast to a
 

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.790
the cell now this is in contrast to a
mechanism we'll talk about in a moment

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800
mechanism we'll talk about in a moment
 

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.820
mechanism we'll talk about in a moment
where some viruses get into the cell via

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:43.830
where some viruses get into the cell via
 

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.740
where some viruses get into the cell via
endocytosis and there's a different

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:45.750
endocytosis and there's a different
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.580
endocytosis and there's a different
trigger for fusion and that's low pH all

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:49.590
trigger for fusion and that's low pH all
 

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.920
trigger for fusion and that's low pH all
right but at the plasma membrane there's

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:51.930
right but at the plasma membrane there's
 

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.960
right but at the plasma membrane there's
no way to lower the pH of the

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:53.970
no way to lower the pH of the
 

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.090
no way to lower the pH of the
extracellular medium so there has to be

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.100
extracellular medium so there has to be
 

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.090
extracellular medium so there has to be
another trigger for fusion and that

00:43:59.090 --> 00:43:59.100
another trigger for fusion and that
 

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.210
another trigger for fusion and that
trigger is engagement of a receptor or a

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220
trigger is engagement of a receptor or a
 

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.670
trigger is engagement of a receptor or a
receptor and a co-receptor in unfolded

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680
receptor and a co-receptor in unfolded
 

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.520
receptor and a co-receptor in unfolded
from the fusion protein so that in mind

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:07.530
from the fusion protein so that in mind
 

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.560
from the fusion protein so that in mind
in this case there's no acid involved

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:09.570
in this case there's no acid involved
 

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.840
in this case there's no acid involved
but there are still mechanisms to get

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:11.850
but there are still mechanisms to get
 

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.840
but there are still mechanisms to get
that fusion protein activated that was

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:14.850
that fusion protein activated that was
 

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:25.480
that fusion protein activated that was
their question yeah

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:25.490
 
 

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.220
 
the fusion peptide is what allows the

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:28.230
the fusion peptide is what allows the
 

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.340
the fusion peptide is what allows the
membranes to fuse so the you know you

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:31.350
membranes to fuse so the you know you
 

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.620
membranes to fuse so the you know you
have a virus membrane here and a plasma

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:33.630
have a virus membrane here and a plasma
 

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.570
have a virus membrane here and a plasma
membrane they have to fuse in order to

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:35.580
membrane they have to fuse in order to
 

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.430
membrane they have to fuse in order to
get the nucleic acid out of the particle

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440
get the nucleic acid out of the particle
 

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.859
get the nucleic acid out of the particle
so the fusion protein is crucial for

00:44:39.859 --> 00:44:39.869
so the fusion protein is crucial for
 

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:43.099
so the fusion protein is crucial for
that what I what I wanted to say was the

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:43.109
that what I what I wanted to say was the
 

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:45.109
that what I what I wanted to say was the
fusion protein can't be exposed all the

00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119
fusion protein can't be exposed all the
 

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:46.730
fusion protein can't be exposed all the
time because these viruses would be

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740
time because these viruses would be
 

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.490
time because these viruses would be
fusing with any cell they bump into so

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500
fusing with any cell they bump into so
 

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.130
fusing with any cell they bump into so
the fusion protein is hidden and it will

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140
the fusion protein is hidden and it will
 

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.440
the fusion protein is hidden and it will
only be exposed when the receptor is

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:54.450
only be exposed when the receptor is
 

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.170
only be exposed when the receptor is
engaged so that gives it the specificity

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180
engaged so that gives it the specificity
 

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.910
engaged so that gives it the specificity
ok that's if I didn't say that that's

00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920
ok that's if I didn't say that that's
 

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:08.030
ok that's if I didn't say that that's
what I meant to say right yes

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040
 
 

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.799
 
do only viruses with envelopes have

00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:10.809
do only viruses with envelopes have
 

00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:16.140
do only viruses with envelopes have
fusion peptides only envelopes need to

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.150
fusion peptides only envelopes need to
 

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.530
fusion peptides only envelopes need to
fuse with host cells yes the viruses

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:19.540
fuse with host cells yes the viruses
 

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.680
fuse with host cells yes the viruses
with protein shells get in in different

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:22.690
with protein shells get in in different
 

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.089
with protein shells get in in different
ways as we'll see so they don't have

00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:24.099
ways as we'll see so they don't have
 

00:45:24.099 --> 00:45:25.950
ways as we'll see so they don't have
what we call fusion proteins they have

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960
what we call fusion proteins they have
 

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.349
what we call fusion proteins they have
other mechanisms to encode so let's keep

00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359
other mechanisms to encode so let's keep
 

00:45:28.359 --> 00:45:29.970
other mechanisms to encode so let's keep
a fusion protein in a fusion peptide

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:29.980
a fusion protein in a fusion peptide
 

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.539
a fusion protein in a fusion peptide
restricted to the fusion of the envelope

00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:33.549
restricted to the fusion of the envelope
 

00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:35.250
restricted to the fusion of the envelope
of the virus with the plasma membrane or

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:35.260
of the virus with the plasma membrane or
 

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:43.760
of the virus with the plasma membrane or
some other membrane in the cell okay yes

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:43.770
 
 

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:50.579
 
the f2 is all right so the in E and some

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:50.589
the f2 is all right so the in E and some
 

00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:53.339
the f2 is all right so the in E and some
viruses the fusion peptide is actually

00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:53.349
viruses the fusion peptide is actually
 

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.289
viruses the fusion peptide is actually
internal in the sequence it's this

00:45:55.289 --> 00:45:55.299
internal in the sequence it's this
 

00:45:55.299 --> 00:45:58.440
internal in the sequence it's this
squiggly line here and so it's another

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:58.450
squiggly line here and so it's another
 

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.750
squiggly line here and so it's another
way to protect it from reacting with

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760
way to protect it from reacting with
 

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.780
way to protect it from reacting with
anything it bumps into so the way it's

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:03.790
anything it bumps into so the way it's
 

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.870
anything it bumps into so the way it's
exposed is these proteins have to be

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880
exposed is these proteins have to be
 

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.390
exposed is these proteins have to be
cleaved by a protease that's usually a

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400
cleaved by a protease that's usually a
 

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.460
cleaved by a protease that's usually a
cellular protease and that gives you an

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:11.470
cellular protease and that gives you an
 

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.099
cellular protease and that gives you an
end terminus which is the fusion peptide

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:14.109
end terminus which is the fusion peptide
 

00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:16.680
end terminus which is the fusion peptide
and then when you get engagement of the

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:16.690
and then when you get engagement of the
 

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.200
and then when you get engagement of the
receptor and the fusion protein unfolds

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:19.210
receptor and the fusion protein unfolds
 

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.270
receptor and the fusion protein unfolds
then that that is exposed so if you

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280
then that that is exposed so if you
 

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.490
then that that is exposed so if you
don't have cleavage even if you engage a

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:23.500
don't have cleavage even if you engage a
 

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.710
don't have cleavage even if you engage a
receptor if the protease isn't present

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720
receptor if the protease isn't present
 

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.480
receptor if the protease isn't present
you will not infect the cell so it's

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:27.490
you will not infect the cell so it's
 

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:34.920
you will not infect the cell so it's
another level ensuring specificity yeah

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:34.930
another level ensuring specificity yeah
 

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.190
another level ensuring specificity yeah
exactly so they're held together by the

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200
exactly so they're held together by the
 

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.180
exactly so they're held together by the
disulfides

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:39.190
disulfides
 

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.609
disulfides
and presumably there is some role in f2

00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:41.619
and presumably there is some role in f2
 

00:46:41.619 --> 00:46:43.799
and presumably there is some role in f2
and that's why it's kept there though

00:46:43.799 --> 00:46:43.809
and that's why it's kept there though
 

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:48.180
and that's why it's kept there though
I'm not sure that we know that okay so

induces conformational changes now they
take away that so you'll get confused so

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:04.810
take away that so you'll get confused so
 

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.900

the F the fusion protein now unfolds and
 

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.080
the F the fusion protein now unfolds and
inserts into the cell membrane so to get

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.090
inserts into the cell membrane so to get
 

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.090
inserts into the cell membrane so to get
fusion just requires that you bring

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:12.100
fusion just requires that you bring
 

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.010
fusion just requires that you bring
membranes very close together which is

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:14.020
membranes very close together which is
 

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.720
membranes very close together which is
energetically not easy because there's

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:15.730
energetically not easy because there's
 

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.220
energetically not easy because there's
water in there if you have to squeeze it

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:17.230
water in there if you have to squeeze it
 

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.470
water in there if you have to squeeze it
out so the unfolding of that fusion

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480
out so the unfolding of that fusion
 

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.330
out so the unfolding of that fusion
protein is part of that process which is

not shown here eventually the membranes
 

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.050
not shown here eventually the membranes
come very close together and they will

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:25.060
come very close together and they will
 

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.960
come very close together and they will
fuse and release the core of the

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.460
in the cytoplasm and eventually it will
come apart and the rest of the cycle

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:34.470
come apart and the rest of the cycle
 

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.370
come apart and the rest of the cycle
will occur of course there are a lot of

pH causes the heads to fall away here

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:41.570
pH causes the heads to fall away here
 

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.350
pH causes the heads to fall away here
and allows the unfolding of the fusion

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:44.360
and allows the unfolding of the fusion
 

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.390
and allows the unfolding of the fusion
peptide so here are three fuse this is a

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200
fusion peptides stuck in the membrane
 

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.570
fusion peptides stuck in the membrane
these are initially folded down here so

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:55.580
these are initially folded down here so
 

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.980
these are initially folded down here so
here are the fusion peptides at the

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:56.990
here are the fusion peptides at the
 

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.980
here are the fusion peptides at the
bottom in this neutral pH state when the

00:49:59.980 --> 00:49:59.990
bottom in this neutral pH state when the
 

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.290

these HeLa C's actually extend very much

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.150
these HeLa C's actually extend very much
 

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.420

goes into the endosome membrane and that

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:12.830
goes into the endosome membrane and that
 

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.490
goes into the endosome membrane and that
catalyzes the fusion of the membrane so

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:15.500
catalyzes the fusion of the membrane so
 

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.980
catalyzes the fusion of the membrane so
here that's shown at a larger scale the

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:17.990
here that's shown at a larger scale the
 

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:21.310
here that's shown at a larger scale the
pH is dropping the viral membrane fuses

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:21.320
pH is dropping the viral membrane fuses
 

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.830
pH is dropping the viral membrane fuses
with that of the endosome and that then

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:23.840
with that of the endosome and that then
 

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.930
with that of the endosome and that then
the nucleic acid of the virus can be out

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:25.940
the nucleic acid of the virus can be out
 

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.810
the nucleic acid of the virus can be out
in the cytoplasm all right so these two

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:28.820
in the cytoplasm all right so these two
 

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.880
in the cytoplasm all right so these two
membranes fused by this mechanism and

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:30.890
membranes fused by this mechanism and
 

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.450
membranes fused by this mechanism and
that lets the nucleic acids out now

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:34.460
that lets the nucleic acids out now
 

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.800
that lets the nucleic acids out now
these eventually have to get in the

these eventually have to get in the
 

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:39.880
these eventually have to get in the
nucleus and the way they do that is

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:39.890
nucleus and the way they do that is
 

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:42.670

interior of the particle do that and so
 

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.930
interior of the particle do that and so
now these RNAs get into the nucleus

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:13.940
now these RNAs get into the nucleus
 

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.640

what does that but they've been down

00:52:59.050 --> 00:52:59.060
what does that but they've been down
 

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.790
what does that but they've been down
that and doing that brings the membranes

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800
that and doing that brings the membranes
 

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.370
that and doing that brings the membranes
together so eventually they can fuse all

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:03.380
together so eventually they can fuse all
 

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.770
together so eventually they can fuse all
right so initially you have an extended

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:05.780
right so initially you have an extended
 

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.450
right so initially you have an extended
conformation which puts the fusion

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:07.460
conformation which puts the fusion
 

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.820
conformation which puts the fusion
protein in the distal membrane then the

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:09.830
protein in the distal membrane then the
 

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.980
protein in the distal membrane then the
hair pinning occurs which brings the

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:11.990
hair pinning occurs which brings the
 

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.140
hair pinning occurs which brings the
membranes very close together and when

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:14.150
membranes very close together and when
 

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.930

you put two lipid bilayers right next to
 

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.460
you put two lipid bilayers right next to
each other you squeeze all the water out

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:18.470
each other you squeeze all the water out
 

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.020

a little bit about this because you

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:47.330
a little bit about this because you
 

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.640
a little bit about this because you

influenza virus goes through this same
 

00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:43.029
influenza virus goes through this same
pathway it goes through low pH mediated

00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039
pathway it goes through low pH mediated
 

00:58:43.039 --> 00:58:46.539
pathway it goes through low pH mediated
fusion the viral envelope fuses with the

into the nucleus so I have a movie of
 

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.689
into the nucleus so I have a movie of
this that I want to show you and look at

00:58:55.689 --> 00:58:55.699
this that I want to show you and look at
 

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:58.449
this that I want to show you and look at
this very carefully because I want you

00:58:58.449 --> 00:58:58.459
this very carefully because I want you
 

00:58:58.459 --> 00:59:00.039
this very carefully because I want you
to tell me what's wrong with it

00:59:00.039 --> 00:59:00.049
to tell me what's wrong with it
 

00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:04.329
to tell me what's wrong with it
I love finding these artistic errors but

00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:04.339
I love finding these artistic errors but
 

00:59:04.339 --> 00:59:07.209
I love finding these artistic errors but
it's actually instructive to do so so

00:59:07.209 --> 00:59:07.219
it's actually instructive to do so so
 

00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:11.049
it's actually instructive to do so so
this is a movie called influenza virus

00:59:11.049 --> 00:59:11.059
this is a movie called influenza virus
 

00:59:11.059 --> 00:59:14.339
this is a movie called influenza virus
entry let's see what this looks like

00:59:14.339 --> 00:59:14.349
entry let's see what this looks like
 

00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:18.669
entry let's see what this looks like
alright so they're depicting the the

00:59:18.669 --> 00:59:18.679
alright so they're depicting the the
 

00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:22.659
alright so they're depicting the the
entry of flu into a cell they're

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:22.669
entry of flu into a cell they're
 

00:59:22.669 --> 00:59:24.539
entry of flu into a cell they're
assembling a vy what's wrong with that

00:59:24.539 --> 00:59:24.549
assembling a vy what's wrong with that
 

00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:28.649
assembling a vy what's wrong with that
all right you can tell me later

00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:28.659
 
 

00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:32.589
 
so this is purportedly an influenza

00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599
so this is purportedly an influenza
 

00:59:32.599 --> 00:59:36.130
so this is purportedly an influenza
virus that is the capsid within the

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:36.140
virus that is the capsid within the
 

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.109
virus that is the capsid within the
envelope here oh the glycoproteins on

00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119
envelope here oh the glycoproteins on
 

00:59:38.119 --> 00:59:40.929
envelope here oh the glycoproteins on
the surface here the virus moving around

00:59:40.929 --> 00:59:40.939
the surface here the virus moving around
 

00:59:40.939 --> 00:59:44.439
the surface here the virus moving around
your respiratory tract it's going to

00:59:44.439 --> 00:59:44.449
your respiratory tract it's going to
 

00:59:44.449 --> 00:59:51.930
your respiratory tract it's going to
attach to a receptor

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:51.940
 
 

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:57.070
 
taken up by clathrin-coated vesicles you

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:57.080
taken up by clathrin-coated vesicles you
 

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.380
taken up by clathrin-coated vesicles you
see the nice clathrin structure there

00:59:59.380 --> 00:59:59.390
see the nice clathrin structure there
 

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.060
see the nice clathrin structure there
eventually the clathrin is gonna come

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.070
eventually the clathrin is gonna come
 

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:10.030
eventually the clathrin is gonna come
off and it's riding down a microtubule

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.040
off and it's riding down a microtubule
 

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.750
off and it's riding down a microtubule
very quickly clathrin is coming off now

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760
 
 

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.950
 
still you have it so that's an endosome

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960
still you have it so that's an endosome
 

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.130
still you have it so that's an endosome
containing your virus and there's the

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:21.140
containing your virus and there's the
 

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.060
containing your virus and there's the
fusion event and those are the

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:24.070
fusion event and those are the
 

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.530
fusion event and those are the
ribonucleoproteins

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:25.540
ribonucleoproteins
 

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.640
ribonucleoproteins
which are now going to go into the

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:27.650
which are now going to go into the
 

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:30.160
which are now going to go into the
nucleus through the nuclear pores if you

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:30.170
nucleus through the nuclear pores if you
 

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:33.490
nucleus through the nuclear pores if you
will okay so that's the same thing

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:33.500
will okay so that's the same thing
 

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.920
will okay so that's the same thing
repeating itself so anyone want to guess

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:35.930
repeating itself so anyone want to guess
 

01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:41.790
repeating itself so anyone want to guess
what's wrong with it

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:41.800
 
 

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.410
 
right there is the problem one of the

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:44.420
right there is the problem one of the
 

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:49.860
right there is the problem one of the
problems No

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:49.870
problems No
 

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:52.330
problems No
how about when it comes apart that's

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:52.340
how about when it comes apart that's
 

01:00:52.340 --> 01:01:07.240
how about when it comes apart that's
that's a bit later on

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:07.250
 
 

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:11.390
 
this is okay so we had one problem we're

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400
this is okay so we had one problem we're
 

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.180
this is okay so we had one problem we're
reading there's going to be a second one

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:13.190
reading there's going to be a second one
 

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:39.880
reading there's going to be a second one
they're just too

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:39.890
 
 

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:51.240
 
yeah

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:51.250
 
 

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.320
 
yeah they're showing it as having a

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:53.330
yeah they're showing it as having a
 

01:01:53.330 --> 01:02:08.740
yeah they're showing it as having a
capsid right which okay no the RNA and

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:08.750
capsid right which okay no the RNA and
 

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.950
capsid right which okay no the RNA and
the RNA proteins remain together it's

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960
the RNA proteins remain together it's
 

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.460
the RNA proteins remain together it's
it's another protein that comes off but

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:14.470
it's another protein that comes off but
 

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:17.170
it's another protein that comes off but
that's okay the the capsid is one issue

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:17.180
that's okay the the capsid is one issue
 

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.609
that's okay the the capsid is one issue
it doesn't have a capsid as a nucleo

01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:18.619
it doesn't have a capsid as a nucleo
 

01:02:18.619 --> 01:02:20.109
it doesn't have a capsid as a nucleo
capsid and they're showing it as an

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119
capsid and they're showing it as an
 

01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:22.300
capsid and they're showing it as an
icosahedral structure if you look at the

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:22.310
icosahedral structure if you look at the
 

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:25.750
icosahedral structure if you look at the
movie and you'll have it on the file you

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760
movie and you'll have it on the file you
 

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.510
movie and you'll have it on the file you
can see that when it comes apart it

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520
can see that when it comes apart it
 

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.390
can see that when it comes apart it
comes apart in triangles and that's

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400
comes apart in triangles and that's
 

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.580

and the guide said Sam Leakey so he

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:28.970
and the guide said Sam Leakey so he
 

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:31.060
and the guide said Sam Leakey so he
called it Sam Leakey forest virus but

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:31.070
called it Sam Leakey forest virus but
 

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.760

stranded RNA virus so the first thing

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319
stranded RNA virus so the first thing
 

01:04:30.319 --> 01:04:31.900

that is happening is the viral RNA is
 

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.170
that is happening is the viral RNA is
translated so here the fusion gets the

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:35.180
translated so here the fusion gets the

it's just out of the envelope and what
does that is the ribosomes that begin to

does that is the ribosomes that begin to
 

01:04:45.499 --> 01:04:49.059
does that is the ribosomes that begin to
pick out the RNA that's what they've

transition and this is a little wrong
 

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.620
transition and this is a little wrong
because it's not near the the membrane

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:29.630
because it's not near the the membrane

result is that the membranes are brought

01:05:45.819 --> 01:05:45.829
result is that the membranes are brought
 

01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:48.309

together okay and then eventually when

01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319
together okay and then eventually when
 

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:50.410
together okay and then eventually when
they do touch they fuse and that makes

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:50.420
they do touch they fuse and that makes
 

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.049
they do touch they fuse and that makes

pH is encountered so then the capsid

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:11.910
pH is encountered so then the capsid
 

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:16.039

capsid that doesn't have the ability to
 

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.599
capsid that doesn't have the ability to
fuse with the cell so how does the

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:47.609

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:51.140
fuse with the cell so how does the
nucleic acid get out it in this case the

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.150
nucleic acid get out it in this case the
 

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.019
nucleic acid get out it in this case the

little channel beneath where the
 

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:26.300
little channel beneath where the
receptor binds and that's occupied by a

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:26.310
receptor binds and that's occupied by a
 

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:29.030
receptor binds and that's occupied by a
lipid in the virus when the receptor

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040
lipid in the virus when the receptor
 

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.490
lipid in the virus when the receptor
binds the lipid gets pushed out and that

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500
binds the lipid gets pushed out and that
 

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.590
binds the lipid gets pushed out and that
gives the virus breathing space it can

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600
gives the virus breathing space it can
 

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.780
gives the virus breathing space it can

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.900
and this is illustrated by Coxsackie
Group B viruses which require two

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:44.910
Group B viruses which require two
 

01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:48.680
Group B viruses which require two
receptors to get into cell they require

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:48.690
receptors to get into cell they require
 

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:51.830
receptors to get into cell they require
decay accelerating factor and a second

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840
decay accelerating factor and a second
 

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.110
decay accelerating factor and a second
receptor car which is the Coxsackie as

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120
receptor car which is the Coxsackie as
 

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.720
receptor car which is the Coxsackie as
no virus receptor the interesting thing

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:56.730
no virus receptor the interesting thing
 

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.960
no virus receptor the interesting thing
is that car receptor is a component of

01:10:59.960 --> 01:10:59.970
is that car receptor is a component of
 

01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:02.540
is that car receptor is a component of
tight junctions that is the junctions

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:02.550
tight junctions that is the junctions
 

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.030
tight junctions that is the junctions
between cells in an epithelial surface

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040
between cells in an epithelial surface
 

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.550
between cells in an epithelial surface
it's not available on the apical surface

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560
it's not available on the apical surface
 

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.180
it's not available on the apical surface
and I think we'll save the explanation

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:11.190
and I think we'll save the explanation
 

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:13.490
and I think we'll save the explanation
of this for next time we're going to

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500
of this for next time we're going to
 

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.420
of this for next time we're going to
tell you about how these viruses in fact

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:17.430
tell you about how these viruses in fact
 

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:21.830
tell you about how these viruses in fact
get at this receptor which is in between

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840
get at this receptor which is in between
 

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:32.600
get at this receptor which is in between
cells by disrupting the tight junctions

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:32.610
