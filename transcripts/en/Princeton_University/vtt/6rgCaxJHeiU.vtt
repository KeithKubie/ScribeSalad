00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.079
OSCAR MAHONEY: I
think the first time

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.016
I heard about the
Humanities Sequence was

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:30.093
when I got the literature in the
mail advertising this program,

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.082
talking about it as
this intensive course.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.086
DANIEL GRANBERG: When I
got accepted to Princeton

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:36.075
and got my package
with all the stuff,

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:39.092
I remembered the pamphlet, the
HUM pamphlet, in particular.

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:43.023
And I think it said something
along the lines of hungry

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:44.084
for knowledge.

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:46.075
And immediately I was
drawn toward that.

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.029
DENIS FEENEY: The
Humanities Sequence

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:50.068
is a yearlong introduction
to the toolkit

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:53.020
that you need to understand
the building blocks

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.096
of Western European tradition.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.079
We begin with Homer
in the first semester,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.024
and we end with Dante at the
end of the first semester.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:01.068
And then we pick
up the beginning

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.048
of the second
semester with Petrarch

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.018
and carry through
to Virginia Woolf.

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:08.000
YELENA BARAZ: I gave the
opening lecture on Homer,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.009
and I introduced the
students to Homer.

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.031
In very general terms, I
talked about oral tradition

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.044
and the origins of the text.

00:01:15.044 --> 00:01:17.060
It really is a team effort.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.038
So for instance, this
semester our group

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:23.002
includes an ancient
philosopher, a classicist,

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.002
a medieval historian,
a Dante scholar,

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.021
someone who works
in late antiquity,

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.096
and a comparative
literature professor.

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:31.092
All of us have specialties
but we are also

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:33.048
learning from each other.

00:01:33.048 --> 00:01:35.046
And going to each
other's lectures

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:39.029
really creates a kind of flow
where people will pick up

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.071
on each other's lectures and
each other's texts in ways

00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:44.024
that they might not
otherwise think of.

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:46.098
And it goes along very well
with the student experience

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:51.011
because we're experiencing the
course alongside the students.

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.010
And we are remembering
things from lecture

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.083
that they are also
remembering, so it

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:57.006
creates a kind of
trajectory that

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.069
really is the distinctive
feature of the course.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.061
CRYSTAL LIU: I remember
at the very beginning,

00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.012
I was kind of
apprehensive because I

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:05.072
felt like I didn't really
have any background

00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:07.006
in ancient texts.

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.001
And I went to Professor
Baraz and asked her,

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.091
am I expected to know
some Latin, some Greek?

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.030
Do you think that not having
those skills would hinder me?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.082
And she said absolutely not.

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:21.073
We don't want you to feel
like that's the case.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.078
We want you to learn.

00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:24.066
That's exactly why
this course is here.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.020
ESTHER SCHOR: When
I saw the syllabus

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.095
for the first time four
years ago, I was intimidated.

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.066
And I realized that
you're not going

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:36.078
to address every page of
these books in detail.

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:39.038
The point is to have
a sense for what

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:41.061
strikes you, what's important.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:43.077
JAMAL JOHNSON: I
think really being

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:49.012
able to sort of historicize
some of the ideas that

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:51.041
are prevalent in the thinking,
not just of white males,

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:55.059
but of people from a
diverse range of backgrounds

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.022
is something that was
really valuable for me.

00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:00.068
CLAIRE ASHMEAD: All the
thinkers we look at,

00:03:00.068 --> 00:03:02.026
again because they're
asking questions

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:04.040
that are so central,
end up being

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.010
very useful tools for thought
and for change and for argument

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.049
for people everywhere.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.057
ESTHER SCHOR: Well, we
hear a lot about difference

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.044
these days.

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:15.076
We hear about what
makes people different.

00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:18.087
Ethnicity can make
people different.

00:03:18.087 --> 00:03:20.089
Social class can make
people different.

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.087
Whether your parents
went to college or not

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:24.046
can make you different.

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:27.019
And we have a lot of
testimony about the difference

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.025
that difference makes.

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:32.037
And the question that
arises in this course

00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:36.057
is what is this talking back to?

00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:38.085
I mean, what is this
idea of the human that

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.078
is being questioned here?

00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:44.095
What we're finding is that
we're listening to human beings

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:48.030
across time and we're
hearing difference

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.092
across the centuries.

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.063
DANIEL GRANBERG: After
reading "Antigone"

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:53.038
we went and saw
"Antigone" performed.

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:56.065
And that was definitely
an experience

00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:59.041
because it wasn't
expected, I would say.

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.031
It was performed in
a very different way

00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.047
than one might see
it being performed

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:04.046
when reading the book.

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:07.079
And there were
things that really

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.079
made that an experience that
was able to help me, at least,

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.017
connect "Antigone," the
play, to our modern-day life

00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:18.009
and how this is
related to me today.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.080
CASSIE RODRIGUEZ: One
thing that I really

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.004
enjoyed was going to the Met.

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:23.033
We went on a Greek
and Roman tour.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:26.018
And as you walk through the Met
and you look at different art,

00:04:26.018 --> 00:04:30.058
and being able to use textual
support for your analysis

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:32.099
and stuff like that, and
facilitate a connection, I think,

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.091
is the best part.

00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.046
BENJAMIN MORISON: Going to
the museum you can actually

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:36.093
be in touch with the object.

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:40.021
You're looking at the objects
that the ancient Greeks were

00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:43.012
also looking at or that the
Romans were also looking at.

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:46.062
And the skills that
we've given the students

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:49.031
at reading text and
deciphering details

00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:50.097
and putting things into context â€”

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:53.060
And I think it really
gave the students a chance

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.031
to see that this isn't
just a dead culture that's

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.050
on the page.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.058
This was a living culture
where the texts were performed,

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:05.089
but the texts also
made an impression

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.066
on the decorative
arts that would

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:10.066
have been surrounding the
people that lived in those days.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.052
OSCAR MAHONEY: So
we had a small event

00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:14.090
and we invited all
of the first-semester

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.002
students in the HUM Sequence
at the moment, the freshmen.

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:20.057
And they brought in some
alumni from the program,

00:05:20.057 --> 00:05:23.015
people that had taken it that
were currently sophomores,

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:25.068
juniors, seniors, to talk a
little bit about what they

00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:27.060
thought about the program
and why they thought

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.064
it would be a good
idea to continue

00:05:29.064 --> 00:05:31.047
taking into second semester.

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:34.023
To have a foundation to be
able to walk into a seminar

00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:36.060
and read a text,
whether it's something

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.032
that I've ever been
exposed to or not,

00:05:38.032 --> 00:05:43.057
and kind of get those nuances
from other texts in the past,

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:47.002
start to see the threads running
through the Western tradition

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:49.081
history and be able
to talk about them

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.027
and add something
new to discussion

00:05:51.027 --> 00:05:53.084
that I would have otherwise
been completely blind on.

00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:55.089
Most of the things
are a reflection

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.002
on what you guys have
already read and experienced

00:05:58.002 --> 00:05:58.042
in the first semester.

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.075
So this is why I really wish
that I had taken the first.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:03.019
But if anybody, I think
there are one or two of you,

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:04.085
haven't taken the
first, I absolutely

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.003
recommend that you
take the second

00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:08.044
because you're going to find
yourself thanking yourself.

00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:10.076
Graduates of the HUM
program have the opportunity

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:14.011
to go to either Greece
or Rome on a fall trip.

00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:16.011
The great thing about it
is that it's completely

00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:17.054
paid for by the HUM department.

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:19.008
CLAIRE ASHMEAD: I
had the opportunity

00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:21.004
to go to Greece,
which was amazing.

00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:25.011
So that was the fall
break of my sophomore year

00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.094
after I'd completed
the HUM Sequence.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:32.003
And going to the origin
of Western culture,

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:37.020
because the HUM Sequence starts
with Homer and "The Iliad,"

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.042
that was really wonderful.

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:42.027
I think, not just because it's
a little bit of a pilgrimage,

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.096
because you get to
see, this is the place

00:06:44.096 --> 00:06:49.011
that inspired these thinkers
that are the foundations of why

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.039
I think the way I do.

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.097
The HUM Sequence and
the HUM community

00:06:51.097 --> 00:06:53.047
is something that's
known on campus.

00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:55.036
It's something that
other professors respect.

00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:57.037
It's something that
tells them something

00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:59.074
about who you are when you
tell them that you've done it.

00:06:59.074 --> 00:07:01.098
JAMAL JOHNSON: You
sort of, just grow

00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:03.067
to be a more
questioning thinker.

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:05.017
Someone who's
equipped with the tool

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:11.011
set to really to dig deeper
and trying to find answers

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.079
to some of those questions.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.014
