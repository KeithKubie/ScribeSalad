I have this idea that
I wanted to, umm,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.000
I wanted to make a video
with you guys but --

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.100

have to do very much

some of you might already know
that I sing this song called

I was sound checking it
and, umm,

00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:08.433

work without a disco ball.

And I was like, "Oh. If only
we had a disco ball."

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.800

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.633

ball -- [laughing]

here's where I start
to run into a problem.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.834
Umm, so I was thinking that the concept of the video would be

00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:47.133
that you would all be in here
and I would be playing the song

00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:50.734
but you would all just
be on your laptops.

00:22:50.734 --> 00:22:51.300
[laughing]

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.700
But then I didn't know if you
were all gonna bring your laptops

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.734
so I figured if you didn't have your laptop with you,

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:58.166
you could use a PDA,

00:22:58.166 --> 00:22:59.433

00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.667

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:05.600
Does everyone have
at least a thing?

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.734
Can you wave it in the air?

00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:12.834

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.533
So how 'bout can we, umm,

00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:22.934
can we fill in the front row
with at least a few people

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:26.900
that actually have laptops?

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.166
The only sad thing about
shooting this video is that

00:23:29.166 --> 00:23:30.867
you won't be able
to watch me play

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:33.300

It's about --

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:09.033
I don't know.
It's, like, three minutes long.

00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:09.934
It's not that bad.

00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:12.500

I'll leave it out.

00:55:56.467 --> 00:56:00.066
And I was gonna --
is Zoe still back there?

00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:02.433
You wanna come up?

00:56:02.433 --> 00:56:04.867
I thought, umm,

00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:07.667
if you guys felt like it I thought
we could do a really quick

00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:09.333
I don't even think
I need this --

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:12.233
we can do a really quick Q
and A given that-- we're, like,

00:56:12.233 --> 00:56:15.266
two of the geekiest musicians I know.

00:56:15.266 --> 00:56:17.133
Umm,

00:56:17.133 --> 00:56:19.233
and, yeah.

00:56:19.233 --> 00:56:21.133
Yeah, yeah. Why don't
you give Zoe the mic?

00:56:21.133 --> 00:56:23.834
Umm

00:56:23.834 --> 00:56:25.166
Yeah. You can ask us questions.

00:56:25.166 --> 00:56:29.000
We're massive twitterers.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.533
[laughing]

00:56:30.533 --> 00:56:32.266
And we're, uh,

00:56:32.266 --> 00:56:34.700
umm, you know,
Zoe is --

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.734
I'm on a major label.

00:56:35.734 --> 00:56:37.300
But I'm trying desperately to get off

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.667
and Zoe has been
independently awesomely

00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:42.567
doing her thing for a while.

00:56:42.567 --> 00:56:46.834
So yeah. If you guys have
any questions about anything,

00:56:46.834 --> 00:56:47.934
hit us.

00:56:47.934 --> 00:56:49.900
[inaudible question]]

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.967
Amanda: What did I what?

00:56:50.967 --> 00:56:52.734
[inaudible question]]

00:56:52.734 --> 00:56:58.867
Amanda: Because there are
kids in the house. [laughing]

00:56:58.867 --> 00:57:01.200
[laughing]

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.967
Amanda: Any -- anybody else?

00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:06.800
Yeah?

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.033
[inaudible question]]

00:57:10.033 --> 00:57:11.800
Amanda: Umm, you know,

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.000
I compose in my head

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.233
and I use -- I mean,
I've played piano all my life

00:57:15.233 --> 00:57:21.834
but I've been -- more and more
I've been composing just,

00:57:21.834 --> 00:57:24.033
you know, songs for whatever

00:57:24.033 --> 00:57:25.400
and then trying to figure out
how to produce them

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.667
when I put them onto --
onto record. But,

00:57:28.667 --> 00:57:30.734
I mean, I don't play any other
instrument

00:57:30.734 --> 00:57:32.467
with any kind of proficiency.

00:57:32.467 --> 00:57:35.000
I'm a hack ukulele lay lee player but,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.367
umm,

00:57:36.367 --> 00:57:38.567
speaking of which. Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:41.166
I think I left it upstairs.

00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:44.166
Umm, but yeah.
I mean, really --

00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:47.834
if you listen to my records
it's all piano based.

00:57:47.834 --> 00:57:50.967
That might change on my next record,
actually.

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.166
Umm, because I'm not --

00:57:52.166 --> 00:57:54.100
Like I really don't consider myself
a piano player.

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.133
I'm okay at it
but I'm not great.

00:57:56.133 --> 00:57:58.767
And my records aren't really
about the piano playing.

00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:00.300
They're about the songs.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.400
So.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.266
Yeah?

00:58:03.266 --> 00:58:06.333
[inaudible question]]

00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:08.967
Amanda: Any more scoring?
Have I done any scoring?

00:58:08.967 --> 00:58:10.967
[laughing]

00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:13.166
Umm, that's Zoe's job.

00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:14.800
Zoe does the scoring.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.767
Uh, I -- you know,
if asked, I would.

00:58:17.767 --> 00:58:18.967
Umm,

00:58:18.967 --> 00:58:20.700
Zoe does a lot of
film music and stuff.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.500
I've never actually really been asked.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.800
Zoe: Oh. Should I make that happen?

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.333
Amanda: Yeah.
Hook it up, Zoe.

00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:28.266
Put me out.

00:58:28.266 --> 00:58:31.367
Umm ...

00:58:31.367 --> 00:58:32.900
you know, that's kind of embarrassing.

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.300
Do you use an iPod?

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.033
Zoe: Nope.

00:58:36.033 --> 00:58:37.200
Amanda: Yeah. I don't really either.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.734
Zoe: I don't listen to music at all.

00:58:38.734 --> 00:58:40.200
Amanda: I have a --

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200
yeah. No. Zoe --

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.166
Zoe and I neither of us
really listen to music.

00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:47.033
And I know that sounds ridiculous

00:58:47.033 --> 00:58:50.133
but I-- in the course of an average
day I just don't --

00:58:50.133 --> 00:58:51.200
don't do it.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.100
And I have an iPod
and it's got --

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:58.133
it's got, like, uh, you know,

00:58:58.133 --> 00:58:59.233
yoga lessons on it.

00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:00.066
Zoe: Yeah.

00:59:00.066 --> 00:59:03.033
Amanda: [laughing] And some --
and mixes from my record

00:59:03.033 --> 00:59:05.800
because I needed to, like,
carry them around.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.767
But I think like, I was
a fanatic Walkman wearer

00:59:09.767 --> 00:59:11.533
as a teenager as always had one.

00:59:11.533 --> 00:59:13.333
like everywhere I went.

00:59:13.333 --> 00:59:15.367
And I think, you know,

00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:16.567
as I --
as I got older and,

00:59:16.567 --> 00:59:19.767
like, the more I toured especially
I just --

00:59:19.767 --> 00:59:21.300
there was always music
and noise around

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.967
and I find now that I can't --

00:59:23.967 --> 00:59:25.400
I can't do --
I can't listen to music

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.066
and do anything else
at the same time.

00:59:28.066 --> 00:59:29.433
I can't think even.

00:59:29.433 --> 00:59:32.000
So unless I'm washing dishes.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Yeah. I can't handle it.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.967
Uh, it's Frank Sinatra.

00:59:38.967 --> 00:59:41.633
I mean, it depends.
I'm really obsessive, too.

00:59:41.633 --> 00:59:43.300
Like I'll find a record that
I like and then

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.033
I'll just listen to that
for a couple months.

00:59:47.033 --> 00:59:48.800
And sometimes it's an old record,

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.834
sometimes it's a new record.

00:59:49.834 --> 00:59:52.433
I really like Tegan
and Sara's new record.

00:59:52.433 --> 00:59:53.934
I -- I --
I really did --

00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:56.900
I feel like last year I learned
at the beauty of Frank Sinatra

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.700
and I just listened to this
one record of his over,

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.467
and over, and over again.

01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.500
I didn't like any of his other records.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.000
I still don't. It's just that one.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.867
Umm,

01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:08.767
uh, "Come Dance with Me".

01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:10.500
It's awesome.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:11.567
Umm,

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:12.100
but yeah.
It's weird.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.433
Like, music listening has changed.

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:15.367
Zoe and I wanted to start
a non-profit organization

01:00:15.367 --> 01:00:17.433
called "Musicians for Less Music."

01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:19.333
[laughing]

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.166
And I got --
I got into this --

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:23.300
I mean, this is a good --
is that even on?

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.166
Is your mic even on?

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.066
Zoe: I don't think so.
Oh, there it is.

01:00:26.066 --> 01:00:28.600
Amanda: Umm, there's --
there's this thing

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.900
that's happening where, like,

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.367
I actually think
we have too much music.

01:00:32.367 --> 01:00:35.233
I think we've -- I think we've
gone overboard and I was --

01:00:35.233 --> 01:00:36.767
I was having this conversation

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.266
actually with some friends of Neil's

01:00:39.266 --> 01:00:42.467
we were all sitting around
talking about, umm,

01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:46.133
how -- I was talking about how I think
music has just been not --

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:50.333
not devalued but
it's lost its intimacy.

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:54.000
you know like, I used to have a record
collection and it was this big.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.600
And I knew every record and
I knew basically all the songs

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.300
and all the records,
even the bad ones,

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.367
but I had a relationship
with the records.

01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:04.834
And I feel like now with
the availability of everything

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:08.033
it's so hard to have a relationship
with an album,

01:01:08.033 --> 01:01:10.367
like, a real one where you hold it
and you know it,

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.600
and you -- like, if you take it out
with a Walkman

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.433
you have to commit to just
listening to that record.

01:01:14.433 --> 01:01:16.300
Like, you made a choice.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.633
And I feel really fuddy duddy.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:19.934
Zoe: It's like having, like,

01:01:19.934 --> 01:01:21.600
ten different kinds of ketchup.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.033
[laughing] You know.

01:01:23.033 --> 01:01:26.500
Like, do you really need ten
different kinds of ketchup?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.033
Amanda: Yeah. I --
it's really --

01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:29.800
I mean, it's really interesting to see

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.867
what it's gonna do to people

01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:33.166
and the way they relate to music.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.400
It's gonna really change things.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.166
Our idea was to just
limit the number of songs

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:39.200
in the world to 100.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.900
[Talking in the background]

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.500
Amanda: What?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.133
[inaudible question]

01:01:45.133 --> 01:01:47.900
Amanda: Oh. Well, pretty
much everybody. [laughing]

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.500
But no.
But here's the point.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.767
You can have a hundred songs

01:01:52.767 --> 01:01:55.734
but as many variations of
those songs as you want.

01:01:55.734 --> 01:01:57.700
So artists basically just
have those hundred songs

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.300
to pick from and they can perform
all of them. So ...

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.333
[inaudible quesiton]

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:05.033
Amanda: Exactly.

01:02:05.033 --> 01:02:06.934
Zoe: This does break down once
you get so specifics

01:02:06.934 --> 01:02:08.433
so we probably shouldn't go there.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:11.300
Amanda: [laughing]
There would be wars.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.500
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about
your theater projects?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.133
Amanda: Umm, yeah. I mean,
I did a theater project

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:20.567
this past spring
with my high school,

01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:24.800
umm, 'cause I really,
I worship the director

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.400
who was a real huge influence
on me in high school

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.667
and I sort of went back and
did an original workshop play

01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:32.367
with the kids and it was great.

01:02:32.367 --> 01:02:34.066
It was based on,

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:37.367
umm, loosely based on,

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:40.734
uh, a great modern album
that I actually really love

01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:43.734
by Neutral Milk Hotel,
if you guys know them.

01:02:43.734 --> 01:02:45.467
Umm, and they were playing
over the Seas.

01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:48.266
So we basically used the music
as source material

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:52.166
and we wrote this story around
it and it was sort of about --

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:53.967
it used a lot of music from the album

01:02:53.967 --> 01:02:56.000
and was sort of based around
Anne Frank.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.734
And it was a really
beautiful play.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:00.433
And you can see it --
it's up on USTREAM

01:03:00.433 --> 01:03:05.767
and we're trying to get a better
edit of it up but, umm ...

01:03:05.767 --> 01:03:07.166
I have a theater background.

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:08.033
That's where I came from.

01:03:08.033 --> 01:03:10.066
And I'm always trying to do,

01:03:10.066 --> 01:03:12.100
you know, not just live
in rock 'n' roll world

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.533
but I also do theater stuff.

01:03:15.533 --> 01:03:16.400
&gt;&gt; So, what's your inspiration?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
I grew up with a lot of
pictures of you dancing.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.900
Amanda: Oh. 'Cause well,
I had a bunch like you do.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.900
And, umm,

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.867
you know, I had a handful

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.300
and I was gonna use them
as album art work.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.667
You know, I had been in
these various situations

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:30.734
where I wound up with pictures
of me dead.

01:03:30.734 --> 01:03:32.867
I did a performance art project
in college

01:03:32.867 --> 01:03:35.333
that had a bunch of dead
photos in it.

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.400
You know, when I was on tour

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.900
and I was sort of like
in a bad mood

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.967
I would go off early
in the morning

01:03:38.967 --> 01:03:42.266
and take dead pictures
of myself and, you know,

01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:44.066
in with the beautiful architecture

01:03:44.066 --> 01:03:45.533
in Europe and whatever.

01:03:45.533 --> 01:03:49.300
And I was gonna make
them album artwork but,

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.767
umm, my record label,

01:03:51.767 --> 01:03:54.734
umm, who I don't get along
with very well,

01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:56.200
gave me no packaging budget.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.667
So I wanted to digipack
'cause --

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.600
because I wouldn't put out
a jewel case

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.066
but they wouldn't
give me a booklet.

01:04:02.066 --> 01:04:05.100
So instead of complaining
I just decided to make a book.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.633
And then it just grew

01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:08.200
and I kept adding more
and more dead pictures,

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.233
and then Neil got involved
and wrote the stories,

01:04:11.233 --> 01:04:13.300
and now it's --
now it's a whole thing.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.533
So, it's actually it's like --

01:04:14.533 --> 01:04:21.533
it's like a big glorified CD booklet
in spirit.

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:26.567
Umm, so, yeah. That's sorta
where the idea came from.

01:04:26.567 --> 01:04:29.233
In the -- in the corner over there.
Yeah.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:33.734
[inaudible question]

01:04:33.734 --> 01:04:35.000
Amanda: Oh. Thank you.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.900
Yeah. You ruined my life.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.967
Yeah. But I forgive you personally.
What?

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:43.900
[inaudible question]

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.333
Amanda: Sure.

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:47.300
If you guys are wondering
what we're talking about

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.934
all of the Dress and Dolls
videos got pulled off of YouTube

01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:53.834
during the Warner YouTube war.

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:56.133
Did you guys know about that?

01:04:56.133 --> 01:05:01.066
Yeah, so-- My band was sadly
a casualty of that battle

01:05:01.066 --> 01:05:03.100
and the videos are still not out.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.233
Umm,

01:05:05.233 --> 01:05:06.333
but things are actually --

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:07.767
things are looking okay with the label.

01:05:07.767 --> 01:05:10.233
We're sort of in that negotiating phase

01:05:10.233 --> 01:05:11.567
so I don't wanna talk too much
about it

01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:15.934
but I think that I might be --
I might be set free.

01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:17.767
Umm,

01:05:17.767 --> 01:05:20.100
but,I mean,things are just
changing so fast

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.333
it's ridiculous.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:24.133
And I just , you know,

01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:27.266
actually, I've been
working on a big long,

01:05:27.266 --> 01:05:29.800
umm, kind of manifesto --

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.700
not manifesto but, like,
a big long explanation.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.433
Sort of not unlike the --

01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:37.133
have any of you guys
read that e-mail that, umm,

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:40.734
Courtney Love wrote back
in 1999 or 2000?

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:42.834
It's -- hers is kind of irrelevant now

01:05:42.834 --> 01:05:45.200
but it's in the same spirit
of basically like

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200
this is how it breaks down.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.066
Like, when I signed with
a major record label

01:05:48.066 --> 01:05:50.367
I knew that I wasn't gonna make
any money on my recordings

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:52.066
'cause I was smart.

01:05:52.066 --> 01:05:54.100
I was, like, okay.
I'm not trading this for that.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.700
I'm not gonna make any
money on my recordings.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.600
I can dupe my own CDs at home
myself so I don't --, you know,

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.166
like, I can see the direction
that things are going in.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:09.033
Umm, and I'm trading their powerful
promotion for,

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:11.700
you know,

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.734
the lack of royalties that I'll
ever see 'cause I knew that.

01:06:14.734 --> 01:06:17.567
But then the label sort
of stopped promoting.

01:06:17.567 --> 01:06:19.767
They stopped promoting the band,
they stopped promoting me.

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:20.767
They, you know,

01:06:20.767 --> 01:06:23.967
I put the Solar record out with them
because I had to, contractually,

01:06:23.967 --> 01:06:26.400
and that was -- that was,
like, hugely disappointing

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.700
because it was this big
important record

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.000
and I made it with Ben Folds,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.266
and I thought it was gonna
be really fancy

01:06:31.266 --> 01:06:33.400
and then they just sort of did nothing.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.100
And that's when I decided
I wanted to go.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.000
Umm,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.800
but it's really tough.
I mean, it's, like,

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.166
the human being in me just feels,

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:44.900
you know, so badly for anyone
working in a major label

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.367
because they're clinging
so desperately

01:06:48.367 --> 01:06:50.166
to things that aren't working.

01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:51.433
And they're trying,
and trying,

01:06:51.433 --> 01:06:55.000
and they're trying to evolve
but they're so late in the game

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.033
it's just -- it's,
you know,

01:06:57.033 --> 01:06:58.967
it's over.

01:06:58.967 --> 01:07:02.100
Umm, meanwhile -- [laughing]

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.433
Meanwhile on twitter,

01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:06.433
uh, things are actually
really exciting.

01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:10.500
I mean, I'm doing shows
nowadays like,

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.734
you know, 12 hours in advance

01:07:11.734 --> 01:07:14.967
where I just tell people to show up
in a field and they give me

01:07:14.967 --> 01:07:17.834
they just give me cash.
[laughing]

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:20.867
It's awesome.

01:07:20.867 --> 01:07:23.266
So, you know, I think --

01:07:23.266 --> 01:07:25.033
but mostly when I write this blog --

01:07:25.033 --> 01:07:27.900
you know, and hopefully it'll
circulate around and stuff --

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.800
umm --

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.333
the thing to explain
to a lot of people

01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:36.300
in talking about it lately is as
a musician or artist in general

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.467
you have to learn that,

01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:41.066
you know, superstardom isn't
really an option anymore

01:07:41.066 --> 01:07:43.834
and you have to want to
be a working artist

01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:46.633
willing to just make a living doing
what you're doing,

01:07:46.633 --> 01:07:48.233
and willing to tour,
and willing to promote,

01:07:48.233 --> 01:07:49.700
and willing to connect with your fans,

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.033
and be available and not just be,

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:55.633
you know, that old idea
we have from the 80s

01:07:55.633 --> 01:07:57.967
of what it means to,
you know, to be a rock star,

01:07:57.967 --> 01:07:58.667
be a musician.

01:07:58.667 --> 01:07:59.967
'Cause it's just --

01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:03.900
the system isn't set up
that way anymore.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.567
Yeah?

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:07.066
&gt;&gt; What kind of difference
have you noticed

01:08:07.066 --> 01:08:09.734
with personal interaction with fans?

01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:12.400
How do you make yourself so
obsessed along that line?

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.734
[inaudible question]

01:08:16.734 --> 01:08:18.400
Amanda: Well, I was always like that.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.200
So there was never a difference
to detect.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.166
I mean,

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.467
could you speak to that
at all in 'cause --

01:08:26.467 --> 01:08:26.934
Zoe: No.

01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:29.133
Amanda: You were in bands
before the internet

01:08:29.133 --> 01:08:31.433
was really a thing.
Zoe: Yeah.

01:08:31.433 --> 01:08:33.233
Amanda: But you were
in a grass roots band.

01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:38.000
Zoe: In other words
I'm kinda old. [laughing]

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.800
Uh, I would say that, umm,

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.900
people nowadays just know
so much more about you

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.600
than they ever did before.
Amanda: Yeah.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.834
Zoe: So, umm,

01:08:44.834 --> 01:08:46.700
but, uh,

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.533
it's been such a gradual change.

01:08:48.533 --> 01:08:51.533
I think I'm so used to that now.

01:08:51.533 --> 01:08:53.800
Amanda: Yeah. I think
it's a personality thing

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.967
because there are plenty of artists

01:08:54.967 --> 01:08:58.333
who still don't make themselves
accessible to their fans at all

01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:01.100
even though they have a million
ways of doing it.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.066
And there were artists
back before the, you know,

01:09:06.066 --> 01:09:08.734
days of the internet making
everything so accessible

01:09:08.734 --> 01:09:12.166
who were accessible simply
by going out

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:14.200
after shows and hanging
out with their fans.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.066
And that's just a personality
thing I think.

01:09:17.066 --> 01:09:20.266
And the internet has just
enabled those

01:09:20.266 --> 01:09:22.333
who wanna be super connectors.

01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:23.700
Zoe: I wanna say one other thing,
though,

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.333
is it becomes less of
an option not to interact.

01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:28.367
Like, there's a lot of musicians

01:09:28.367 --> 01:09:31.000
who really don't want to
interact with their fans

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.166
and it wasn't necessarily
so noticeable in the past.

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:35.900
But now if you're
one of the artists

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.900
who doesn't come out to sign
or doesn't make an effort

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.333
to stay in touch it can kill you.

01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:43.100
Amanda: Yeah.
And it will.

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.200
Zoe: And it's really noticeable.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.066
Amanda: That's still pretty
entitled I think nowadays

01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:49.533
that they're gonna be able
to know a lot about you.

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:50.066
Zoe: Right.

01:09:50.066 --> 01:09:52.767
Amanda: And that's fine
for me 'cause I like it.

01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:53.834
Umm, but, you know,

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:56.266
for someone who just wants
to just sort of make music.

01:09:56.266 --> 01:09:58.567
Zoe: But I think that for people
who are really introspective

01:09:58.567 --> 01:10:00.533
and are not necessarily
extroverts --

01:10:00.533 --> 01:10:02.500
Amanda: Be a sculptor.
Zoe: -- it's difficult.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:06.100
[laughing]

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.467
Amanda: That's a really
good question, though.

01:10:07.467 --> 01:10:08.500
I mean, I think about that a lot

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.734
because it sort of raises
that question of, like, okay.

01:10:12.734 --> 01:10:15.300
So you wanna be a musician
nowadays

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.734
and you wanna actually
make money.

01:10:17.734 --> 01:10:19.567
That really is sort of the job.

01:10:19.567 --> 01:10:23.000
Like, the job is
to be connected,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.567
and to be sociable,

01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:25.900
and that was kind of always
the way

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.133
but I guess like Zoe said

01:10:27.133 --> 01:10:30.767
you used to be able to
just hide and nowadays,

01:10:30.767 --> 01:10:35.200
you know, everything you do
is instantly kinda public.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.533
And I was thinking about that.
I was wondering, how, you know,

01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:41.233
especially when you think about, like,

01:10:41.233 --> 01:10:43.266
real big celebrities and stuff,

01:10:43.266 --> 01:10:44.100
pretty much,

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.500
you know, the minute
you're out in public

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.734
your life is recordable,

01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:48.800
it's archiveable,

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.400
and you're accountable
for everything you do

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.700
and the way you look
and you can't really --

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.500
can't really hide.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.433
And when I think about that
I just feel really lucky

01:10:58.433 --> 01:11:00.900
'cause I'm not the kind of
person who really wants to hide

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.367
'cause I'm the opposite of private.

01:11:03.367 --> 01:11:05.967
But, umm, yeah.

01:11:05.967 --> 01:11:09.000
But for those who aren't that's
gotta feel like a living hell.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Zoe: Uh-huh.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.333
Amanda: And here we go being
depressing again. Sorry.

01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:15.400
[laughing]

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.333
Amanda: Can someone else --
Zoe: I think it's the lighting.

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:18.133
Amanda: Yeah.
It's the lighting.

01:11:18.133 --> 01:11:19.233
The lighting is kinda sad.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.600
Zoe: And the lack of drinks.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600
Amanda: And the lack
of drinks. Yeah.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.967
We'd be laughing about this
if we were ...

01:11:23.967 --> 01:11:26.300
does anyone else have any
questions or should we wrap up?

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.100
'Cause I know it's getting kinda late.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.033
[inaudible question]

01:11:31.033 --> 01:11:32.066
Amanda: Can I what?

01:11:32.066 --> 01:11:34.133
&gt;&gt; We have drinks at 4:30.

01:11:34.133 --> 01:11:38.767
Amanda: Oo. I don't know.
Maybe.

01:11:38.767 --> 01:11:42.233
Amanda: Umm, anything else?
Anything else that's quick?

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:44.667
Yeah?

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.800
&gt;&gt; Can I prevent file sharing?

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.300
Amanda: No.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.967
[laughing]
Amanda: I was.

01:11:49.967 --> 01:11:50.333
Zoe: However,

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:52.533
I would like to make a distinction
with that, however.

01:11:52.533 --> 01:11:53.867
Amanda: Yeah. You should buy
Zoe's stuff.

01:11:53.867 --> 01:11:56.667
Zoe: Yeah. Umm,
[laughing]

01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:57.700
Zoe: You should buy my records.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.734
I think that you should know
that for artists

01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:02.367
who are not on record
labels file sharing,

01:12:02.367 --> 01:12:05.567
uh, it's a different game
because there's no middlemen.

01:12:05.567 --> 01:12:06.767
Like, with my CD,

01:12:06.767 --> 01:12:08.967
if you buy my CD on iTunes,

01:12:08.967 --> 01:12:12.000
it's only iTunes in
between you and me.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.867
Umm, whereas if you were
to buy Amanda's CD

01:12:13.867 --> 01:12:15.233
she's never gonna see anything.

01:12:15.233 --> 01:12:17.000
However, but I pay my mortgage
with iTunes

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.667
so I care a little bit
more about file sharing.

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:23.100
But because I like file
sharing in some ways

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.800
'cause people can get the music

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.467
and I know that a very small
percentage of people will buy it

01:12:27.467 --> 01:12:30.133
but since I get to
keep more of the profits

01:12:30.133 --> 01:12:32.100
then that small percentage
that buys it

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.800
I can still pay my mortgage.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.233
So ...

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:37.667
Amanda: Yeah. I mean,
I would -- I think that,

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:39.300
like, even I become independent

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:44.166
I'm still gonna encourage people
to file share because I --

01:12:44.166 --> 01:12:45.500
like, I personally am working on

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.633
so many other different kinds
of revenue stream

01:12:48.633 --> 01:12:51.033
assuming that people
who share my music

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.100
are going to come to my shows,

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.433
you know,

01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:57.433
buy my merchandise,

01:12:57.433 --> 01:12:59.133
get involved in projects,
buy this book.

01:12:59.133 --> 01:13:01.967
Like, you know, I'm doing
that very deliberately

01:13:01.967 --> 01:13:05.300
because I know that the music is,
like, even if we try

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.300
and I will continue to sell music

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.900
and, like, the people who
are the hard core fans

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.633
and who understand that that
money is going into my hand,

01:13:11.633 --> 01:13:14.433
I will still be selling them
CDs and I will expect them,

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:15.600
you know, and hope that
they'll buy them

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.200
because the music's gonna
cost money to make.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.934
But, umm,

01:13:19.934 --> 01:13:21.834
but in general I think,

01:13:21.834 --> 01:13:22.967
you know --

01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:24.700
one of the things
I'm really hoping is that

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.133
music fans and the audience
can hopefully kind of change

01:13:29.133 --> 01:13:33.166
its perception of what it means
to be a music fan

01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.767
and that they will be less afraid
to just actively

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:39.233
support the artists that they listen to

01:13:39.233 --> 01:13:42.166
and that it might not be
as direct as an exchange

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:45.734
where I pay you this amount of
money for this piece of music

01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:49.133
but that it's sort of more
like a, umm,

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:53.100
a support system of patronage
where like your fans will know

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.266
to support you or tip you

01:13:55.266 --> 01:13:56.100
and that, you know,

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.400
and that system will actually
evolve to exist in a way

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.233
that makes it, you know,

01:14:00.233 --> 01:14:01.467
that makes sense.

01:14:01.467 --> 01:14:02.166
I hope.

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:05.100
I'd like to think that that could work.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:09.533
[inaudible question]

01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:10.467
Zoe: You are too kind.

01:14:10.467 --> 01:14:14.100
It's called "One Cello Times 16".

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.600
Yeah. [laughing]

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.100
&gt;&gt; Are you guys going to be
working together for recording?

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.400
Amanda: Uh, yeah.
We actually are.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.300
Zoe: Yes.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.000
Amanda: You wanna say about it?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.667
I don't know how much
we're keeping secret but...

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:29.033
yeah. Well, we're hoping to, umm,

01:14:29.033 --> 01:14:32.500
to do some kind of project
that's improv based sometime

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.033
soon because we just really
love playing with each other.

01:14:35.033 --> 01:14:36.734
Zoe came on tour with me,

01:14:36.734 --> 01:14:38.133
umm, I put this record out,

01:14:38.133 --> 01:14:40.900
this "Who Killed Amanda" record
out it came out in September

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.367
and she came on tour
as the opening act

01:14:43.367 --> 01:14:46.233
and also backed me up on stage

01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:48.834
and we just really
liked working together.

01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:50.967
So hopefully we'll do --

01:14:50.967 --> 01:14:54.600
we'll do something soon I hope.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.433
And, umm,

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:57.100
I think we should end.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.133
But, umm,

01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:02.433
I wanted to thank you guys
for having us and, umm,

01:15:02.433 --> 01:15:05.700
if you wanna find out more
just go to --

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:09.967
my site is Amandapalmer.net
and Zoe's --

01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:11.533
Zoe: Zoekeating.com.

01:15:11.533 --> 01:15:14.533
Amanda: Yeah. And we're both
all over the internet so just go --

01:15:14.533 --> 01:15:17.700
just Google us.
[laughing]

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.400
Amanda : And yeah. It's been
really wonderful being here.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.000
Thank you guys.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.266
Thank you also for lunch.
That was just awesome.

01:15:23.266 --> 01:15:24.233
[laughing]

01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:25.633
Amanda: And ridiculous.

01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:27.233
Zoe: Will that lunch
still be there?

01:15:27.233 --> 01:15:28.033
Can we have it again?

01:15:28.033 --> 01:15:28.900
Amanda: Yeah.
[laughing]

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.233
Amanda: We're gonna have
to come back tomorrow.

01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:33.467
Umm, but yeah.
I'm also --

01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:36.166
I'm playing for those of
you who are in the area

01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:39.767
I'm playing on Saturday
at the Fire Arts Festival

01:15:39.767 --> 01:15:41.100
which is in Oakland.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.667
It's actually a gig that
Zoe hooked me up with and, umm,

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:48.800
further south I'm playing in San Diego
at ComicCon next week

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.834
if any of you guys are headed down.

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:51.567
So --

01:15:51.567 --> 01:15:53.500
and that's a benefit show

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.967
for the comic book
legal defense fund

01:15:55.967 --> 01:15:58.100
and that's kind of it.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.033
Umm, if you wanna stay connected
I really -- like,

01:16:01.033 --> 01:16:03.500
I strongly, strongly, strongly
urge you

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.800
and beg you to sign my actual
e-mail list which is,

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.600
you know, will be really obvious
on the front page of my web site

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.700
and that's kind of it.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.066
I think we've lumped
ourselves out and, umm,

01:16:15.066 --> 01:16:18.533
and obviously the video
will be going out.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:21.333
So you'll know. [laughing]

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:23.166
You'll know when that
video goes up because

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.200
someone will probably tell you.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.433
But we'll try and get that up.

01:16:26.433 --> 01:16:27.200
You know, it's a one-take thing

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:31.266
so we'll try and get it up
in the next couple days.

01:16:31.266 --> 01:16:32.900
And that's it.
Thank you guys so much.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:44.900
[applause]

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:45.967
Amanda: Zoe Keating.

01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:46.333
[applause]

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:47.433
Zoe: Thank you, guys.

01:16:47.433 --> 01:16:52.600
[applause]
