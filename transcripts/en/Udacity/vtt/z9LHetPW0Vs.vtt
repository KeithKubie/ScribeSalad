00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.360
To understand caches, we must first
understand the concept of locality,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.780
which is also called
the locality principle.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.750
It says that things
that will happen soon

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.170
are likely to be close to
things that just happened.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.450
This means that if we know
something about past behavior,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.440
we're likely to be able to guess
what's going to happen soon.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.480
We have already used this
locality principle, for example,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.801
when we did branch expression.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.060
Now we will use it for caches.
