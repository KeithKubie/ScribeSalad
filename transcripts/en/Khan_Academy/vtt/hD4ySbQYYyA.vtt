00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.800
What we have here is
a simulation, created

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.680
by Peter Collingridge
in response

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.050
to one of our computer
science challenge

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.980
to show how many particles
might interact gravitationally.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.610
And the whole point
of the simulation

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.660
is to get an intuition
for how galaxies form,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.980
why they have the
structures they have,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.380
how solar systems form, how they
have the structures they have,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.165
and how gravity alone can
kind of define that structure.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.290
And what's really interesting
about the simulation,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.020
besides the fact that it's just
mesmerizing and extremely cool,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.520
is it shows the
particles collide.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.390
Once they get to a
certain critical mass,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.947
you see that they
get colored yellow,

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:35.780
maybe to indicate that
there are now a star.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.470
Fusion can now occur.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.410
And you can zoom in
at different levels

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.224
to really see how the
different particles

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.890
or the different
masses are interacting.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.275
And then you can actually
rotate that to see

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:48.150
a little bit clearer.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.520
This is if I'm looking
kind of right on top of it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.050
to see how they're interacting.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.040
And it's a three-dimensional
simulation,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.140
so it's a very rich way
of thinking about these.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.900
And what's exciting
for me is it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.270
highly dependent on what
the initial conditions are.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.000
In an earlier version
of Peter's simulation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.390
he did not give a net angular
momentum to the system.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.310
And so you did not have as
much of the planet satellite

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.594
or as much of the disk
structures forming.

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:17.010
Although right
here, we don't have

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.240
too much of a disk structure.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.140
Although it does
seem to-- there does

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.510
seem to be a dominant
plane in this scenario.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.650
And what's exciting is here
we have a binary system.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.590
Sometimes you restart it.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.120
You might not have
a binary system,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.270
depending on the
initial conditions.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.769
You might have
something that starts

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:35.214
to look like the Milky Way.

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:36.630
Sometimes you might
have something

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.210
that looks very different
than the Milky Way.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.680
And it really gives
us clues of why

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.760
we see such diversity,
especially when we're

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.165
looking at galaxies, the
structure of galaxies,

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:47.620
that it's highly dependent
on initial conditions.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.110
One can argue that
our own solar system

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.400
did have some net
initial angular

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.540
momentum because the current
theory, what really catalyzed

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.450
it was a nearby supernova
that sent a shock wave

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.920
and allowed the dust that would
form our solar system to reach

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.700
a critical mass and
start to condense

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.300
into the sun and the planets.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.169
And so this isn't,
at least in my mind,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.834
too unrealistic of a scenario.

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.030
And it's really cool to
look at, and it really

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.850
gives you a sense of things.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.474
You already see you
have a binary star.

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:17.330
They're kind of orbiting
around each other,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.220
or orbiting around the center
of mass, which kind of looks

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.364
like around each other.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:21.780
And then this star
right over here

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.730
has its own kind
of captive planet

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.702
that is just rotating around it.

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:27.160
We can see it a
little bit clearer.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.400
If we had a very, at least from
this perspective, a very close

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.550
range, we can zoom
in a little bit more

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.267
to see it a little bit better.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:35.850
This has a satellite,
but then they're

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.920
are also kind of dancing
around each other.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.179
So it's a really
fascinating simulation.

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.470
I could really stare at this
and play with it for days.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.829
I encourage you to play
with it, restart it,

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.620
see how the initial
conditions or what type

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.760
of solar systems or galaxies
you might end up with.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.510
Whether they form disks, whether
you have binary systems or not,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.570
whether you have
planets with satellites.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.060
And then if you
are more advanced,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.010
actually play with
the code, and see

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.150
if you can really change
the initial conditions,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.914
the starting
velocities of things,

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.330
the number of
particles of things,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.830
the distribution of mass that
you start off with, the angular

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.200
momentum that you
start off with.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.400
And see how that might change
the structure of the universes

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.410
that you create.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.618
And I'm going to add an
annotation to this video that

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:18.240
links directly to
this simulation,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.230
and I'll also put the link
inside of the description.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.834
So have fun.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.500
I could literally
spend hours with this.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.097
It's a fascinating,
fascinating module

00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:27.930
that he's created where
you zoom in and out.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.000
And I really thank
Peter Collingridge

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.542
for this incredible
contribution.
