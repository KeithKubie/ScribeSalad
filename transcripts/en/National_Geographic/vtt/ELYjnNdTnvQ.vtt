00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.533
- So check this out.

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.734
You guys are both athletes.

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:03.934
So I read this great
article, and it was talking

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:07.567
about how athletes are
able to deal with pain

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.500
unlike regular people.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
Non-athletes cannot deal
with pain the way athletes--

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.900
So it's real.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.734
Because I was suspecting
that was true,

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.667
But you're saying that the
research verifies that.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:17.867
Research vers it out.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:21.333
And so because I know that
you're an athlete, I--

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.633
- In my day, in my day,
- In your day.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.567
Well, yeah.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.734
Well, I'm just
going to continue.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.300
Next to me, you are an athlete.
- OK.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.100
All right.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.367
All right.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.667
So there's a little thing
called the pressure test.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.300
You know what the
pressure test is, right?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.734
So you stick your hand
in a bucket of ice.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.000
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.066
And most people can only
do that for, I don't know,

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.600
maybe 30 seconds
before the pain that

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.166
is associated with
the cold causes

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.333
you to pull your hand out.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.800
Because you can't
find the last Budweiser

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.600
at the bottom of the--

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.967
[laughter]

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.033
CHUCK NICE: Which is how I--

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.700
Beer drinkers are good
at this, presumably.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.533
CHUCK NICE: That's right.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.867
OK

00:00:56.867 --> 00:01:01.033
CHUCK NICE: So I wanted to
see if your resistance to pain

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.333
was any higher than a regular
person's resisting to pain,

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.567
and that would be me.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.333
Oh, so what, are you going
to punch me in the face?

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.200
CHUCK NICE: So I
have a bucket of ice.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.600
Come here.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Oh, you're
going to do the ice challenge.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.834
Yes, I have it right here.

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.767
Oh!

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:15.700
Oh!

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.166
Hey.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.166
Simmer down.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.800
- Oh, you have two, we have two.
- Oh!

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600
One for each of us.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
Fantastic.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.633
Oh!

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.700
OK, I can tell you already
I don't want to do this.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.033
[laughter]

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.367
All right, let me get a thing
out, you know what I mean.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:30.567
You're going to
get an arm out?

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:33.533
So the idea is you stick
your hand in the ice,

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.133
and the first person
who pulls it out

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:40.533
is the person who has the
least resistance to pain.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.033
I got a feeling that will
be me, because I stub my toe

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.200
and I call out of work.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.767
[laughter]

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:46.734
All right.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.033
So we just do this.
CHUCK NICE: Yes.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:49.266
OK.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:49.834
CHUCK NICE: And we can
continue on with this show.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:50.800
Right, right.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.533
Because I can't wait
around for this.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.734
Right.
Are you ready?

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:53.867
OK.
Let me get mine a little closer.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.066
CHUCK NICE: Yeah, and
I'll get mine over here.

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.066
All right.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.100
OK, but I got to
continue to show.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.333
OK.
We can continue the show.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: OK.
Ready?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.800
Ready?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.567
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: OK.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:01.734
Three, two, one, go.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.500
So here's something
interesting.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.367
Athletes--

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:11.166
I have to pee.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.000
--they sit in ice baths.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.633
They sit in ice baths
to-- you know, pitchers.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.367
You were a pitcher in baseball.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:19.667
Didn't you ice
down your shoulder?

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:20.500
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.133
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah, OK.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.700
[laughter]

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.433
(LAUGHING) Chuck,
what's the matter?

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:26.667
What's the matter, Chuck?

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.533
[laughter]

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.934
This is [bleep].

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.533
[laughter]

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.700
So is this mental
toughness here?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.500
All right, that's it.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.767
Oh my god.

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
What is going on here?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.133
Is it mental toughness?

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.300
[applause]

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.567
No, no.

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:44.734
Just to be clear, it's not
that this doesn't hurt me.

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:49.600
It's just that I'm OK with it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.200
You are a
dominatrix best dream.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.300
[laughter]

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: OK.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.533
[applause]
