00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:01.526
- [Voiceover] We have other videos where we talk

00:00:01.526 --> 00:00:03.883
about how small molecules, or ions,

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:07.238
might be able to go through a cell's membrane

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:09.990
in different ways, whether actively or passively,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.952
maybe facilitated in some way.

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:13.392
What we wanna talk about in this video

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:16.050
is how we can do this for larger things.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.790
We're gonna focus on here is bulk,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.019
bulk transport.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.320
Transport.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.492
So this first example,

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:26.917
you could imagine this cell with this mauve

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.553
or purple-colored membrane is engulfing

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:30.992
this big green thing which is

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:33.082
maybe a bacteria or something.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:34.951
And so you see that the membrane...

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.892
Let me make it very clear.

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:38.539
This is inside.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.188
This is inside the cell.

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.022
This is outside.

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:43.195
Outside the cell.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:44.553
And you can see the cellular membrane

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:46.561
starts to wrap around this,

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.081
I guess we can think of this a bacteria,

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.217
then it fully wraps around and then

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.226
that membrane that was wrapping around

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.826
the bacteria pinches off and now the bacteria

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.450
is inside of the cell, and it's wrapped

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.959
by this membrane.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.953
And this process where you're engulfing these large things,

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:06.623
we call this Phagocytosis.

00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:09.387
So this is phago...

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:12.556
Phagocytosis.

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.679
And the prefix I guess you'd say, phago

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.920
comes from the Greek for "to eat".

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.927
So this is literally about cell eating.

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:23.516
And in many cases, this thing that is now in here,

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.327
you could view this as the cell's food,

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:29.114
this compartment that is holding this,

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:31.295
in this case bacteria, is gonna transport it

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.489
maybe to a lysosome, so it can be processed

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.172
and digested in some way.

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.285
We would call this big compartment,

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:38.922
this membrane-bound compartment,

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:42.382
we would call this a food vacuole.

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:43.752
Food.

00:01:43.752 --> 00:01:46.806
Food vacuole.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:51.055
Now this scenario down here is similar but different.

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:52.785
Over here I have the cell

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:55.084
which is I see part of its membrane

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:56.488
and it's in magenta right over here.

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:58.056
We can see The Phospholipid Bilayer .

00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:02.084
That's why I drew two lines for the membrane.

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:05.451
And instead of engulfing a large particle or bacteria,

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.017
it's just engulfing some fluid.

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:09.561
It's engulfing some fluid, so you see it's starting

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.686
to wrap around this section of fluid,

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:13.694
wraps even more around this section of fluid,

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:15.656
and then the membrane that was around it

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.118
completely pinches off and goes into the cell.

00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:20.556
And I'm drawing all of these things in two dimension,

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.286
but this would actually be happening in three dimension.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.725
So this wouldn't just be a circle,

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.850
this would right over here would be a sphere.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.358
And this thing that has been pinched off

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.690
and is now inside the cell, we call this a vesicle,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.290
which is just a general term for these membrane-bound

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.019
compartments inside of cells.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.190
And this process where the cell has essentially drunk

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.757
a bunch of fluid and the stuff

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:42.487
that happens to be in the fluid,

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:44.995
we call this Pinocytosis.

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.292
Pinocytosis.

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:50.126
Pinocytosis.

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.924
And pino comes from the Greek word "to drink".

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:54.852
And I'm always fascinated by word roots.

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:57.288
And I'm not a linguistic expert here,

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.424
but it's neat because even in languages

00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:02.024
I'm familiar with like Hindi and Urdu,

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:04.360
the word pina means "to drink",

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.624
so maybe it's even related to the word pani

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.691
which is in those words in those languages.

00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:10.723
I know all of these have a shared linguistic root,

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.655
so it's always fascinating to see

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:14.484
these linguistic connections.

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:17.886
So this is Pinocytosis where the cell is drinking

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:19.891
so to speak, but it's also getting the other stuff

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.427
that's in that fluid.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:23.923
This is Phagocytosis, the cell is eating.

00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:26.489
And these are both special cases

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.590
of I guess the more general term

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.158
of engulfing in this way

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:32.851
which is called Endocytosis.

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:38.110
Endocytosis.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.280
So Phagocytosis is a form of Endocytosis,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.158
and Pinocytosis is a form of Endocytosis.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.481
Now the next question you might say is:

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.757
OK I can get that this happens,

00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:51.114
this can be observed under a microscope,

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:52.460
but how does it happen?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.119
How does the cell wrap around and pinch around?

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.151
And like I say in a lot of videos,

00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.159
people think that we understand some of it,

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.923
but this is not fully fully understood.

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:05.539
There is views that well the cytoskeleton

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.774
must be involved in some way.

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:11.454
It has to create space here for this thing

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:15.587
to be able to pinch off and move in that direction.

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:20.545
It maybe will help actually the cell's membrane wrap around

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:23.424
in some way, but these are all areas of active research.

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:26.187
How does this Endocytosis actually occur?

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:30.286
How does the cell know what to consume

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.050
I guess you could say, and then how does the membrane

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.625
actually behave in this way to do it,

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.084
to do it well?
