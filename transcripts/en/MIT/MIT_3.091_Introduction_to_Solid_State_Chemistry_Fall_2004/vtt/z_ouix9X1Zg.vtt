00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.660
A couple of comments about the test.
You should have gotten your test

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.330
back yesterday.
And here is the way things panned

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.990
out. We have a class average of
about 77%. I said settle down.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.660
Perhaps you think you have come to
math or physics.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.330
This is 3.091 and we have standards
here. 77% is class average and the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:01:06.593
standard deviation was 17%,
so you can see where things lie.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
50% is a pass.
Congratulations,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a lot of people put in the effort
and there is some learning going on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
While at the same time as I say
congratulations,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I want to remind you that I think it
comes as no surprise given the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
lateness of Labor Day this year that
this first test came rather early

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and for many of you much of this
material you had seen

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:22.300
in high school.
Perhaps the data rate was a little

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.920
bit faster than you were accustomed
to, but you had some familiarity.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.530
Please don't, if you are up here,
become complacent because a month

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
from now we will have another test.
And I think you will wish you are

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.760
continuing to make the investment in
time. If you are down here,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.380
what I want you to do is talk to
somebody. Talk to either your

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:03.760
recitation instructor, come
in and talk to me.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:54.570
We will provide tutorial assistance
at no charge. If you want to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.140
amplify the exposure to question and
answer, all you have to do is

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.710
contact either Hillary or Lori at my
office and we will arrange for

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.280
tutorial meetings.
And maybe down here you got rattled

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.850
or maybe you weren't feeling too
well that day.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.420
Maybe you have to bone up on your
test-taking skills.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:36.440
I don't care what the score is down
here at the moment.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:25.250
As I told you,
on the first day,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:45.533
I do look at trends.
And so let's make every effort to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:31.750
take the steps necessary to master
that material and move forward.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:53.033
The good news is that we are going
to be shifting gears very soon and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:38.250
moving into subject matter unlike
anything you have seen in high

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:59.333
school, and so you will get a fresh
start. So I don't want anybody

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:44.750
feeling that if he or she is down
here that it is hopeless at this

00:02:44.750 --> 00:03:03.900
point. It is not.
Quite the contrary.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:51.860
And I have actually seen evidence
over the years,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.730
mercifully, just a small amount of
evidence, but there are,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.590
in a group like this, always a few
students who come in with a really

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.460
strong background in high school.
They do extremely well on the first

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.330
test and conclude that chemistry is
in the bank and they can focus on

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.190
the other subjects.
And little by little they start

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.060
creeping down here.
It happens. The model solutions

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.770
will be posted, as I told you.
And we pride ourselves in giving you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.330
a rapid return,
but there is a tradeoff.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.880
And that is we are going to make
some mistakes.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.440
The mistakes are not indelible.
You can come in and have your

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.990
grades adjusted.
The first thing you do,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.550
please talk to your recitation
instructor. If the recitation

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.100
instructor feels that there was an
oversight then the recitation

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.660
instructor will recommend that you
come and see me and I will change

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.220
the grade. If it's just an addition
error, the recitation instructor has

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.230
authority to make that adjustment.
And you don't all have to go

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.690
stampeding down to my office right
away. You can adjust those grades,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.150
let's leave it until next week and
we can take it at a leisurely pace.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.610
But there is no time limit on it.
In fact, you could be sitting three

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.070
years from now waiting before
commencement and you can get that

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.530
grade adjusted.
I can adjust the grade right up

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:33.793
until the moment you get your degree.
After that the records are sealed.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:22.920
The reason I tell you this is that I
don't want people feeling that,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.840
well, the paper is going to start to
decompose or something if I don't

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.760
get to him by 5:00 today.
Don't hurt yourself in the stampede

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.690
to my office. Congratulations again
to those that did well and let's do

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.610
what we can to get everybody over to
the right of that blue line.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.530
And just to keep the rhythm going,
we will have a test on Tuesday, the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.380
weekly quiz.
And I know it is only the third quiz,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
but I like to keep the quiz number
the same as the homework number.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.920
So Q4 covers homework 4, otherwise
there is some confusion later on.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.690
Last day, Professor Ballinger
introduced you to Lewis who taught

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.460
us that octet stability could be
achieved via electron sharing as an

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.230
alternative to electron transfer.
And he coined the term covalent

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:35.326
bonding. It means cooperative
sharing of valence electrons.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That is what gets crunched down to
covalent bonding.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Pauling came along later and told
us that the electrons are not shared

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
equally, and this was important
because there were problems in

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
computing the bond energies of
heteronuclear molecules.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
If you looked at heteronuclear
molecules and you wanted to compute

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the bond energy,
you might start with the bond

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
energies of the two constituents.
And you would find that the bond

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
energy of the heteronuclear molecule
was nowhere on the average

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:56.920
of the two.
And that did not make sense.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.760
If I have one that's 400 kilojoules
per mole and another that's 200

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.610
kilojoules per mole and I blend them,
how do I get 500 kilojoules per mole?

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.460
That bothered people.
And Pauling came along and said the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.300
unequal sharing of electrons in a
covalent bond can explain that extra

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.150
energy. And he coined the term
"polar covalency."

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:36.033
And, in particular,
he introduced a quantitative measure.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:23.840
This is why he gets the Nobel prize
and Lewis did not get the Nobel

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.690
prize, although Lewis did brilliant
work, but Pauling's work was

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.530
quantitative. He introduced the
concept of electronegativity which

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.380
was a measure,
therefore, it is quantitative,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.230
of the atom's ability to attract
electrons within a covalent bond and

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.070
developed a scale of
electronegativity.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.170
That is shown here.
And this looks a lot like the

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.520
average valence electron energy
where the lowest values of

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.880
electronegativity are in the
metallic zone and the highest values

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.230
of electronegativity are on the
nonmetallic zone.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.580
Think about it. If this is a
measure of the ability of an

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.930
electron to be pulled in a covalent
bond, so if I have H here and F here

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.290
and F is more electronegative than H,
and so the electrons,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.640
instead of being shared equally,
I am going to show them over here as

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:36.080
if to say fluorine is
hogging the electron.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:25.370
It makes sense.
If this is metallic,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.740
it is a good electron donor.
Well, if it is a good electron

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.120
donor in an electron transfer
reaction, if the same element finds

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.490
itself in a covalent bond,
it is going to be a good electron

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.870
donor, although it is not full
transfer. Likewise,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.240
the element that is a good electron
acceptor in an electron transfer

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.620
reaction is going to be the element
that is going to hog the electrons

00:07:45.620 --> 00:08:05.773
in a covalent bond.
So there is some consistency here.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And you see where the most
electronegative elements are,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and fluorine is the most
electronegative of the active

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
elements. I know neon has a higher
yet electronegativity,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
but normally it is inert.
So how do we use this

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
electronegativity?
Well, I mentioned to you that there

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
was this mystery.
Let's go back and review one of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
these. This is the homonuclear bond
energy for hydrogen in pure hydrogen.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:21.810
There we have perfect covalency.
Both hydrogens are going to share

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.450
equally. We don't have two
different species of hydrogen here,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:33.090
so the electrons are perfectly
shared. And this turns out to have

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:38.720
a bond strength of 435 kilojoules
per mole. And,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.360
likewise, if we look at fluorine in
its diatomic molecule,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:09:03.053
it is 160 kilojoules per mole.
And you have the bond energy in HF.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Just so that we are clear,
this is the bond in this compound.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
As we see a little bit later, I
could talk about the carbon-hydrogen

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
bond in methane where there is a
plurality of bonds.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
In this case, there is only the one
bond but I just want to get the

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
formulas. And so this is the H-F
bond in HF. It is nowhere on this

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
interval. And this is what puzzled
people. It is 569 kilojoules per

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
mole. So there is something extra
going on. And so what Pauling gave

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:23.750
us was a formula.
He said if you take the XY bond

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:31.250
energy starting with the bond
energies XX, and YY bond energies,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:38.750
this is how to make sense of it.
What Pauling taught us was that the

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:46.250
energy of the XY bond is equal to
the average. We are going to start

00:09:46.250 --> 00:10:04.133
with the average.
That is a good place to start.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.500
And he defined the average in terms
of not the sum divided by two,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.500
but he chose the geometric mean.
So you take the square root of the

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.500
product. In fact,
there are some very old books that

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.500
show this as the average,
the sum divided by two arithmetic

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.500
mean, but the modern practice is to
use the geometric mean.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500
And then he said there is a second
term here, a contribution to the

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.500
unequal sharing.
And to measure the intensity of

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.500
unequal sharing,
we take the difference in

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500
electronegativity,
which I am going to use the Greek

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:22.570
symbol chi for.
This is lower case chi.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.710
I will take chi X minus chi Y.
And the functionality goes as the

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.850
square of the difference in
electronegativity.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.990
And the prefactor is 96.
when you want to get a result in

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.140
kilojoules per mole.
Let's go through this calculation

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.280
for HF. If we look at 435 times 160,
take the square root of that,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.420
we will end up with 264 kilojoules
per mole, which sensibly lies

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.440
between these two values.
And then this second term,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.330
if we go to the Periodic Table,
we will find that the value here for

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.220
hydrogen is 2.
and the value for fluorine is 3.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.110
8. You plug all of this in and you
get 344 kilojoules per mole,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:31.086
which then sums to 608. Now,
608 is not 569.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:22.570
But, remember,
this is a very rough estimate.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.140
But the beauty in this calculation
is it shows that this concept of

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.710
electron sharing in an unequal
manner is sound and it gets you into

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.280
the right ballpark.
And so Pauling went further and

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.850
said this is the purely covalent
component. This is purely covalent

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.420
because all it is is homonuclear
bond energies.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:12:04.840
Homonuclear means both elements in
the molecule are the same.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
There is no homoelemental.
They say homonuclear. So this is

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
purely covalent.
And what is this?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
He said this is partial ionic
character. Why did he choose that

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
term? Well, I like to think of it
as I have this sort of sharing meter.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I will give you the extremes.
If I look at a homonuclear molecule

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
such as molecular hydrogen,
this is perfect sharing.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:26.660
If this is my sharing meter,
this is my electron sharing meter.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:33.330
It is right at 12:00. Now, if I
get over here,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:39.990
HF, I know that fluorine is hogging
the electron, so it is not equal

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:46.660
sharing. It is over here.
This is pure covalency. This is

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.930
polar covalency.
And why did he call it polar

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.790
covalency? Because,
if you look at this molecule,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.660
you say that, well, the electrons
are a little bit closer to the right

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.530
than to the left so the charge is
not uniformly distributed.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.390
The molecule is net neutral,
but this right end is a little bit

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.260
more negative and the left end is a
little bit more positive.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.130
And in physics, when physicists
want to say "a little bit of,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:35.860
they write lower case delta. That
is physics talk for a little bit of.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:23.570
So this is a little bit negative and
this is a little bit positive,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.140
which means I could model this by
drawing a dipole.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.710
This is a dipole.
It has a negative end and a

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.280
positive end and it has certain
properties. If we put a dipole that

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.850
has the freedom to move,
we put that dipole in an electric

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.420
field, it will align itself with the
field lines. Because this is a

00:13:46.420 --> 00:14:06.306
dipole, he chose the pole part of
dipole to give us polar covalency.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:55.460
And what is the ultimate?
What is the extreme of unequal

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.920
sharing? It is electron transfer.
So this is perfect sharing, unequal

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.380
sharing. And here the electrons are
actually donated,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.840
so this becomes F minus.
This is denuded of an electron,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.300
it is Na plus. And so, this one
here, I am going to say let's bury

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.760
the needle on this one.
This is the ultimate in unequal

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.720
sharing and this is ionic.
This is ionic bonding.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.180
So you can see that polar covalency
is a tendency towards ionic bonding.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.630
And that is why Pauling called this
partial ionic character.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:39.080
And he actually quantified it.
He quantified it by this formula.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.540
He said that the percent ionic
character, and this is within a bond,

00:14:44.540 --> 00:15:01.680
not for a compound, for
a covalent bond.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:55.630
He said that is going to equal one
minus the exponential.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:01.270
This is just base e, natural
logarithm. E to the power of minus

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:06.900
one-quarter times the difference in
electronegativity squared.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.540
It is this thing again. You see
the difference in electronegativity,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:18.180
square it, multiply it by
one-quarter and raise

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.930
that to the power e.
Subtract that from one,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.790
multiply it by 100 and you have
something between zero and 100.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.660
And I think there is some evidence
of that here. This is right off

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.530
your Periodic Table.
If you look up in the corner of

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.390
your Periodic Table on one of the
sides, they have actually tabulated

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.260
this for you. I have rewritten the
formula here. And there are two

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.130
different scales of ionic character.
One by Pauling. Actually, there

00:15:46.130 --> 00:16:05.126
are more than two. But
they show these, too.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:55.380
There is Pauling and there is Hannay
and Smyth. Here is Pauling.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.760
And we could do this for our
compound here,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.150
HF. For HF, just for grins and
chuckles, let's do it.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:11.530
The electronegativity of fluorine
is 3.98 and the electronegativity of

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.920
H is 2.20 on this scale.
And so, if you plug these values

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.300
into this formula,
that will give you the percent ionic

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.090
character for the H-F bond.
And I want to make sure that you

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.270
don't think that this is the percent
ionic character of the compound,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.450
so I am going to be really
fastidious here and indicate that I

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.630
am talking about the H-F bond.
If you plug into this formula here,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.810
you end up with 56%. And that has
already been tabulated up there in

00:16:43.810 --> 00:17:02.286
the nomograph. You will
see if you get --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:53.810
I think the delta here is 1.
8, which is roughly 1.8. And there

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:59.630
you see the 56.
Just to give you a sense of what

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.450
that means, if the 264 figure is
pure covalency and the 344 is

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.270
partial ionic character,
what fraction of the 608 is 344?

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:17.090
344, which is partial ionic
character, divided by

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:21.760
608 times 100 is 57%.
So it makes sense.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.290
That is good. We can do all sorts
of things with this.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.820
So I indicated the molecule.
There is another orthography that

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.350
is used to indicate dipole.
You can use delta minus, delta plus.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.880
Some people like to use an arrow,
and the arrow points in the

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.410
direction of the more
electronegative end.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.940
And the way I remember that is I
put a little cross here,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.460
and then I make that the plus end.
I don't know. You can have your

00:17:46.460 --> 00:18:06.253
own mnemonic device to figure that
out, but anyway.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:55.380
Let's go on and look at another one.
I think last day Professor

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.760
Ballinger did this one.
He did some hybridization of

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.150
methane. Here is methane.
Methane looks like this with the

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.530
sp3 hybridization.
Let's look at that one.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:16.920
Here we have a dipole. We only
have the one bond so the actual HF

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.300
molecule is polar,
it has a net dipole.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.790
Whereas, H2 is nonpolar.
How do I know its charge

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:33.390
distribution? It's perfectly
symmetric. The electrons here are

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.990
shared equally.
That is nonpolar.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:44.590
And likewise for fluorine,
F2. Let's look at methane. Methane

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.190
we can draw. It looks like this.
We have carbon, sp3 hybridization.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.880
CH4 is sp3 carbon hybridization.
It allows four bonds to form instead

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.640
of just two. And so now I have
hydrogens at the four corners of a

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.410
tetrahedron. Now I want to ask,
what's the nature of the

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.170
carbon-hydrogen bond?
And I look up and see that the

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.930
electronegativity of carbon is 2.
5 and the electronegativity of

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.700
hydrogen, we already know,
is 2.20. So there is a difference

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.460
in electronegativity.
And since carbon's

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.230
electronegativity is higher than
that of hydrogen,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:41.926
which you would expect from where
carbon lies on the Periodic Table.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:28.570
Think about it.
See, if you know the Periodic Table

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.140
then you know where elements are
relative to one another.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.710
So, at any moment, you know in any
bond which is the more

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.280
electropositive.
Electropositive is down to the left

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.850
because that is where the metals
live. So carbon is to the right of

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.420
hydrogen, this is more
electronegative.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:20:05.440
Let's look at this carbon-hydrogen
bond.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
What does that tell you?
It tells you that, first of all,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
there is polarity here. The
electrons are not equally shared and

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
the carbon hogs the electrons a
little bit more than the hydrogen,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
so the carbon is electron-rich and
the hydrogen is just a little bit

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
electron-deficient. Now,
the question is --

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:14.750
Well, first of all,
let's get that down.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:34.000
Let's show that carbon-hydrogen is
polar. It is a polar bond.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:24.250
This is delta minus and this is
delta plus. So I have a polar bond.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:43.633
Here is the question. Is methane a
polar molecule or a nonpolar

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:33.750
molecule? Let's look carefully.
How do I answer that question? I

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:53.266
have to ask is there a net dipole?
Let's look carefully here. All

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:43.250
four of these hydrogens are
electron-deficient in the same

00:20:43.250 --> 00:21:02.966
manner. Where is the center of net
negative charge in this molecule?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:52.610
The center of excess negative charge
on all of the dipoles is at the very

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.220
center of the molecule.
Where is the center of the excess

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.840
positive charge?
And by here, I mean it's net

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.460
neutral, but the electron deficiency.
But can you see that the centers of

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.070
electron deficiency lie on a sphere
equidistant from the center?

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.690
So where is the center of the delta
minus? The center of the delta

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.530
minus is the center of the molecule.
So now that means if this is where

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.610
the center of positive excess charge
lies and on top of it is the center

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:30.690
of negative excess charge there is
no displacement of the charge so

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.760
there is no net dipole.
And so, methane is nonpolar.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.840
It is an aggregate of four polar
bonds, but they are symmetry

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.920
arranged in space.
Symmetric disposition of polar

00:21:45.920 --> 00:22:03.640
bonds still results in
a nonpolar molecule.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:56.800
We can say that a nonpolar molecule
you can have as a result of two

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.600
different conditions.
Nonpolar molecules result from

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.400
either, it's one or the other.
One is the trivial case,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:26.266
homonuclear. If it is homonuclear
they are all the same.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.000
They all share. Homonuclear
species.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
For example, H2,
N2, they are going to share the

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
electrons uniformly,
equally. And you can have P4,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
S8. All of these multiatomic
moieties are nonpolar.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
The second way to have something
that is net nonpolar is to have

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
spatially symmetric disposition
of polar bonds.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:23:01.250
A good example of that is CH4,
because the CH bond is polar but

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:18.800
symmetrically disposed in space.
Now I want to look at the

00:22:47.500 --> 00:23:13.750
energetics. I have not talked about
it from a graphical standpoint.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:30.500
We looked at it from an analytical
standpoint.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:24.710
Let's go back and look at it from an
energetic standpoint.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.420
There is too much talking in the
room so I am asking you to stop now

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.140
in respect for your classmates.
I do not like the rudeness. I want

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.850
it perfectly quiet in here.
There is no compromise on that.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.570
None. When you walk through that
door it's an act of free will,

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:48.280
and I will not have anything other
than complete silence.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:24:07.693
It is not fair to classmates to
have to listen to conversation.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:24:05.830
Now let's look at the energetics

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:11.490
graphically now.
I want to go back to our energy

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:17.160
level diagrams and see if I can
rationalize energy level diagrams.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.140
But now not for single atoms.
I want to do energy level diagrams

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.420
for molecules.
That is different.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.710
Where am I going to get those
energy levels from?

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.990
I get the energy levels from the
Schršdinger equation.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.280
The Schršdinger equation will give
us the energy levels in molecules.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.570
We saw the Schršdinger equation for
atomic hydrogen,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.850
but you can write it for more
complex systems. And

00:24:47.850 --> 00:25:05.733
it is horrible.
But there is good news.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.500
The Schršdinger equation is a
linear equation.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.500
And this is one of the times when
you are actually going to be able to

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.500
use some of that math they teach you.
What is one of the properties of a

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.500
linear equation?
Linear equation means that

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.500
solutions are additive.
For example, if I have an equation

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.000
that looks like this, f of x, y, z.
I might as well do it as x,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
y, z because we are talking about
something that is going in three

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
space. Suppose f of x,
y, z equals k1, that is my equation,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
and it gives me a solution s1. And
I have another equation f of x,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
y, z. This is the same equation,
the Schršdinger equation, only it

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
has different boundary conditions.
It has k2 as the boundary

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
conditions. And when I solve it for
k2 boundary conditions,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I get s2. Here is the power of
linearity.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:55.070
The power of linearity is if I come
across f of x,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.150
y, z equals k1 plus k2,
if it is a linear equation,

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:05.220
I don't have to go and solve it all
over again. Instead I can write

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.300
with impunity the solution will be
s1 plus s2. And that saves a lot of

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.380
time. Linearity is the desirable
way to go if you can manage.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.460
What does this mean? Linearity of
solutions, the elegant way of saying

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.230
it is superposition holds.
And that is what people are going to

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.690
use. They are going to say,
well, what is the solution? I said

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.150
here is a solution s1.
What is the solution to the

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.610
Schršdinger equation?
The solution of the Schršdinger

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:43.070
equation is psi,
a wavefunction. What we are going

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.530
to say is that the wavefunction for
molecular orbitals is going to be an

00:26:47.530 --> 00:27:06.526
additive sum of the wavefunctions of
atomic orbitals.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I am going to sum up the atomic
orbitals that go into the molecular

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
orbital, and they are going to have
some coefficients.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
We are going to have coefficients
on this, and they will add up.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And then we are going to construct
molecular orbitals.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
And the technique is called,
watch because this is a six-letter

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
initialization,
linear combination of atomic

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
orbitals into molecular
orbital, LCAO-MO.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:24.610
Linear combination of atomic
orbitals into molecular orbitals.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.220
And so we are going to use that in
order to construct some energy level

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.840
diagrams. And so let's look at a
few. Here is the first one.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.460
I want to do one that is going to
show that hydrogen,

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.070
H2 is favored over atomic hydrogen.
Here is what we are going to do.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.690
We are going to set up an energy
level diagram. This

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.380
is E equals zero.
N equals infinity.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.150
And this is the ground state,
n equals one. This is the 1s. And,

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.920
just to be clear, this is the 1s
atomic orbital in atomic hydrogen.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.690
And I am going to do the same thing.
I am going to put another one over

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.460
here and put another one over here.
Here are two hydrogens, and they

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.230
both look the same.
And then over here is H2.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:35.460
And, by using LCAO-MO, we can come
up with the orbitals here.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:25.460
And you are not going to calculate
these. This would be given to you.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.920
We would give you the energy levels
and ask you to rationalize something

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.380
that we are going to tell you is
true. What happens?

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.840
Well, we have to use two other
ideas. Superposition.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.300
We use the concept of conservation
of states and the Aufbau Principle.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.760
That includes Pauli Exclusion
Principle and includes

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.810
Hund's Rule and so on.
Let's look at electron filling first

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.430
of all. This has a single electron.
And since it is Friday, I think I

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.060
will even give its quantum numbers,
1, 0, 0, ½. I only do this on

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.680
Fridays. And here is another one.
It is over here. And its quantum

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.300
address is 1, 0,
0, ½. And you are saying wait a

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.930
minute, he has violated the Pauli
Exclusion Principle.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.560
He has two electrons here with the
same set of quantum numbers.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.180
But these are two separate hydrogen
atoms. They are not part

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.380
of the same system.
But now what we are going to do is

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.150
bring them in together sort of along
the lines of this.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.920
This cartoon shows the probability
density function of 1s.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.690
And this is kind of nice because
you see it is not an abrupt

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.460
spherical surface.
What you see is a scatterplot.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.230
And you see that the dot intensity
grows as you get closer and closer

00:29:45.230 --> 00:30:03.260
to the center. So it tails
off to infinity.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:53.730
Now here are these two isolated
hydrogen atoms.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.460
Now they get close enough together
that they start to sense that they

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.190
are becoming part of one system.
And once they start to become part

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.930
of one system,
Pauli Exclusion Principle kicks in.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.660
You start to have to conserve
states. We cannot have two 1s's

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.390
sitting at the same level.
And ultimately we are going to get

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.130
to this state where we are going to
form a bond. What happens is these

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:21.090
two levels displace.
One is a little bit higher and one

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:27.290
is a little bit lower than they are
in the atomic situation.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:33.490
And so this lower level is called a
bonding orbital,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:39.690
and it is a bonding molecular
orbital. And this one here,

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:45.890
because it is at a higher energy is
called antibonding molecular orbital.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:51.230
And these are s's.
This is 1s atomic orbital.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.690
This will be called lowercase sigma.
And, since it came from 1s,

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.150
it will be called sigma 1s. And I
am going to superscript it molecular

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.610
orbital, and this upper one,
to indicate that it's antibonding,

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:09.070
has the asterisk. This is sigma
star with the antibonding orbital

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.530
that came from 1s,
and it is a molecular orbital.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:33.726
This is the energy level diagram of
H2. Now let's put the electrons in.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:22.260
How do I do it?
I put in the first one spin-up.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.530
I put in the second one spin-down.
I started with two electrons, one

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.790
each from two atomic hydrogens.
And now I have to fill this

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.060
molecular hydrogen.
The question now is,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.330
is H2 stable or will it not form?
And the answer lies clearly in the

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:43.590
energy difference.
What we do is ask ourselves what is

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.860
the delta E? What is the energy
change going from two atomic

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.610
hydrogens to one H2?
That is going to equal the energy of

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.840
the electrons in H2 minus the
energies of the electrons in H.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.070
And, if this quantity is less than
zero, the bonding is favorable.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:08.300
We know it is favorable. We got it
out of the tables,

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:13.530
it is 435 kilojoules per mole.
That is pretty favorable. What is

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.760
happening is it turns out that
putting the electrons in that lower

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:36.186
energy state is stabilizing
that molecule

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:28.720
So that works.
What about H2 plus?

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.450
What would that look like?
H2 plus would take one electron out.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:38.180
Would H2 plus be stable?
According to this energy level

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.900
diagram, yes. H2 plus is stable and
is observed in plasmas.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.630
Let's go on. Let's do a few more.
I want to ask about helium. Let's

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.380
start. Here is the zero.
This is energy zero.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.150
And here is 1s, atomic orbital for
helium. Here is another 1s,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.920
atomic orbital for helium. And,
again, we will split. Here is the

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.690
antibonding and here is the bonding.
And, in this case, I start with

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:11.460
helium - is 1s2.
Each of the heliums has two

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.230
electrons. Now let's go and fill
the molecular states for the

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:34.793
putative He2. I don't know if it
exists yet or not.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
We go one, two,
three, four. Now,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
He2, stable or not?
Well, it is going to depend upon

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
whether this delta is greater than
this delta. In other words,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
if the rise in instability is
greater than the fall in stability,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
this is a positive delta E. And it
turns out that is the case.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
It turns out that the antibonding
orbital is a little bit higher from

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
the atomic orbital level than the
bonding orbital is lower.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:34:01.110
And so the result is that the delta
E, in this case,

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:06.220
delta E in going from the atomic
states to the molecular states is

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.330
greater than zero.
And so He2 unstable.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:16.440
I would ask you to see how such
energy level diagrams rationalize

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.210
what we know to be true.
I don't expect you to start with one

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.640
of these and then predict what is
going to happen.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.070
I would say with the aid of an
energy level diagram explain the

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:34.490
fact that helium is found as atomic
gas and not molecular.

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.920
How about this one? What about He2
plus? What would that one look like?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.350
For He2 plus there would be one
electron missing.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.780
And what do you see here?
You have two electrons at much

00:34:47.780 --> 00:35:06.126
lower energy.
You have one electron at a higher

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.500
energy. And so,
in fact, the delta here is negative.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.500
And He2 plus is observed in helium
plasmas at high pressure,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.500
but not neutral He2. You don't see
those because it's just not in the

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.500
cards. Let's do one more because I
am having a ball.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.500
I don't know about you,
but this is so fun. Let's do one

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:22.460
more. Let's do lithium.
Again, you know the drill.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.380
Here is 1s atomic. But lithium has
2s1, so I need a 2s atomic orbital

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.300
here and likewise over here.
Here is 2s atomic orbital. Here is

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.220
1s atomic orbital.
This is lithium, lithium.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.150
And this is all gas phase.
These are single atoms. It has to

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:47.070
be gas phase. And now let's use the
same principle.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:36:05.273
Here is sigma star,
sigma, sigma star and sigma.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:56.330
These are the bonding and
antibonding. The lower ones come

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.660
from 1s and the upper ones come from
2s. Let's look at the electron

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.990
filling in lithium,
one, two, three. 1s2,

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.330
2s1 over here. The same thing,
1s2, 2s1. Because these lithiums

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.660
are independent.
Now, what if they get close enough

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:33.586
together to start forming one system.
Let's fill. What do we get?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:23.140
One, two, three,
four, five, six. What is the

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.280
conclusion? This indicates that by
combining two lithiums,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.420
the energy of the combined system is
lower than the energies of the

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.560
atomic systems.
Dilithium is stable.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.710
And, in fact, this is the case for
all the alkali metals.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.850
When you go down the highway and
you look up and see those sodium

00:36:48.850 --> 00:37:07.233
vapor lamps, the sodium vapor exists
as the dimer Na2.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:59.190
This is good, dilithium is stable.
So far we have looked only at the

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.390
formation of single bonds.
Well, let's look at multiple bonds.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.590
Let's try nitrogen. We know
nitrogen bonds multiple bonds,

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.790
so let's look at nitrogen. How
would that look?

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:33.113
Well, first of all,
let's look at the Lewis structure.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:24.830
Lewis structure for N2 is one,
two, three, four, five. Here is the

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.660
second nitrogen,
one, two, three, four,

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.490
five. Here is octet for the left,
octet for the right. We see three

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:39.330
bonding pairs so this is a triple
bond, indeed a multiple bond.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:44.160
The bond is the electron pairs.
This is homonuclear and so these

00:37:44.160 --> 00:38:03.653
are nonpolar. They are perfectly
shared between the two nitrogens.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
And, furthermore,
to put the background in front,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
let's do the electronic structure.
It is 1s2, 2s2, 2p3. That would be

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
one, two, three,
four, Hund's Rule,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
five, six, seven. Three unpaired
electrons in nitrogen.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Oh, by the way. Look at this.
I wasted your time here. I was

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
supposed to apologize to you.
We learn nothing from examining

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
what is going on down here in n
equals one shell.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
It is filled here.
It is filled here.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:24.410
We learn nothing.
Let's take this whole thing and

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.820
throw it away.
So what is the lesson here?

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.230
If you want to understand whether
compounds form or not look only at

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.640
the valence shell.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.050
This is another example, sort of
another thing that comes out of that

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.460
analysis. You can see that there is
no value in studying inner shell

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.880
electrons to ask questions about
bonding. What do these look like?

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.290
These are p-orbitals. And what
does a p-orbital look like?

00:38:48.290 --> 00:39:07.713
It is this dumbbell shape.
That is what a p-orbital looks like.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And I have three of them. You know
from the m quantum number there are

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
three. They are orthogonal.
What does that look like? Here is

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
one, here is two and here is three.
Put a second one next to it. One,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
two, three. Excuse my drawing,
but this is what you get. And the

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
convention is that when two atoms
bond, they bond along the z-axis.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So the convention will be that the z
is moving from left to right.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And so then the right-hand rule
will kick in and require that you

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
start with the thumb as x and then
you move to y and z.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
And so if that happens this will be
x into the board,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
y will be the vertical and z will be
moving to the right.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:53.330
What we want to do is ask ourselves
what happens when these two interact.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:58.660
And here is what it looks like.
I am going to do it first

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.990
pictorially and then I will write
the algebra. What happens here?

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:09.330
We have two of them on the z-axis
like this. These are both z-axis.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:14.660
This is 2pz atomic orbital plus 2pz
atomic orbital,

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:33.253
and they react to form something
that smears in this manner.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.000
It is going to smear in this manner
and will look something like this

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.000
where I have dumbbell shapes with
smearing. And this is now sigma of

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
2pz. And why did I call it a sigma?
The sigma bond is characterized by

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000
continuous electron density
between nuclei.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:56.660
We say there are no nodes,
no dropouts, no holidays. No nodes.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.330
You can start from one nucleus and
go to the next nucleus,

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.990
and there are no zero planes,
no nodes, nothing. And the same

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.660
thing that happens over here,
what is this one going to look like?

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.330
Here you would have a 2s, here is a
2s, and when the two of them smear

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:34.726
we end with something that looks
like this. Here is the sigma.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:24.610
Again, we have continuous electron
density from one nucleus to the

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:29.220
other. That gets us the first one.
What are the other two going to do?

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.840
The other two have to do something
different. The other two are going

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.460
to smear laterally.
Let's look at 2py, which is

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.070
vertical. Here is a 2py atomic
orbital, and it will react with a

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.690
second 2py atomic orbital.
But it is not going to be able to

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.870
give a sigma.
Because already I can see there is a

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:55.620
line of sight from one nucleus to
the other with no electron density

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.370
whatsoever. These two are going to
smear laterally.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:03.120
They will smear to give you
something like this where here are

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.870
the two nuclei.
And these are called lobes.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.620
This is a lobe. I have two lobes
in a p-orbital.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.370
And that zero point is the node.
The node is the same thing you see

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:18.120
in a string. Point of absolute rest
in a vibrating string we call a node.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:37.040
This is the same idea.
And how do you get from one side to

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
the other? You're vibrating.
You're acting as a wave. That is

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
how you get from one side to the
other. The two lobes smear and I

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
end up with something that looks
like this. And so both of these

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
lobes together constitute a pi bond.
And this will be called pi of 2py

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:53.660
molecular orbital.
And so it has what?

00:42:53.660 --> 00:43:00.990
In contrast to the sigma,
it has a nodal plane containing both

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:08.330
nuclei. Let's take a look at some
of these. First of all,

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:15.660
this is the two s orbitals in
hydrogen, 1s plus 1s smearing to

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:30.720
give us this sigma
molecular orbital.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:27.330
And this one, just for completeness,
is what the antibonding orbital

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:31.660
would look like.
Where are we getting these again?

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.990
We are getting these by plotting
the values from the Schrodinger

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.330
equation. You get these plots by
taking the wave function times its

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:44.660
complex conjugate and operating on
that. That is proportional to

00:43:44.660 --> 00:44:03.986
probability. These functions are
what are being plotted.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:53.110
And there is a proportionality
between that and where we expect the

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:57.230
electron to reside.
That might be the contour of 99% of

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.350
the time. There is a 1% chance it
is beyond, but the 99% surface is

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.460
spherical. Here is from your
textbook. Same idea.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.580
1s plus 1s gives you this oval
ellipsoid which is the bonding,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.700
and here are the antibonding, and
then these are the energy levels

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.820
that I have been drawing for you.
Now, from your book as well, this

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.940
is the pz's of the two atomic
orbitals forming the

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.160
bonding orbital.
You can see this is sort of p-like

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.490
but smeared. And then the
antibonding which we don't care

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.830
about. And this is the lateral
smearing. They call it x.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:39.160
This is the vertical direction y.
And just to give you a sense, if

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.490
you do a cross-cut of this,
you cannot show it from this angle,

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:47.830
but it should really be sort of a
dumbbell shape with the nodal plane

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.070
in between the two nuclei.
Now let's go and do the energetics.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:56.210
We can do the energetics on this
one now. Let's look at it.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:00.350
You would be given this filling
sequence. What do you see here?

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.490
This is now for nitrogen. There is
the 2s. Why are we not looking at

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:08.640
1s? Because it is not the valence
shell. Forget about it.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.780
We are only looking at 2s and 2p.
Here is the atomic nitrogen, here

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.920
is the atomic nitrogen and these are
the orbitals of molecular nitrogen.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.120
This is just the ladder.
Now we are going to put electrons on

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.370
the shelf here.
Let's add them.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:29.620
Nitrogen we start with 2s2,
2p3. One, two, three, four, five.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.870
One, two, three, four, five. Five
and five is ten.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:38.120
Two, four, six, eight,
ten. Look at that. When you are

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.370
done you have three electron pairs
in bonding orbitals.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:46.620
That is a good solid triple bond.
What does it look like up here?

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.870
What it looks like up here,
the simple Cartesian model of it is

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:55.070
these things smear this way.
There is a sigma orbital.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:59.230
And they are smearing this way.
That is one pi orbital. There is

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:03.380
one sigma, one pi and there is a
second pi, and that is how we are

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.530
getting the triple bond.
N is one sigma and two pi.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.690
There they are right here. You can
see that on this one.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:15.840
And so it gives us a whopping 946
kilojoules per mole.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:35.680
That is a lot of energy because
there is a really solid bond.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.280
Here is oxygen and fluorine.
And it is just a little bit

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.570
different. And I draw attention to
it. We would tell you the filling

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:32.850
sequence, but I just want you to see
that there are some subtle

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.140
differences here that in the case of
oxygen and fluorine the p-orbitals,

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:41.420
the sigma and the pi flip-flop. See
that? But we would tell you the

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.710
sequence. Let's go through it now.
This is oxygen. Oxygen has six

00:46:45.710 --> 00:47:03.886
valence electrons.
Six plus six is 12.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:53.870
Just as in nitrogen,
we get two, four, six here,

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:57.740
but now we have two more electrons.
And because of the way those

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.620
antibonding orbitals are stacked,
the two electrons go one each into

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.490
those antibonding.
At the end of the day you have some

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:09.370
unpaired electrons.
You have two electrons in

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.240
antibonding to kind of offset the
bonding. And so the double bond is

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.120
498. Remember the other one was 960.
Now here is fluorine,

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:36.973
same skeleton, only fluorine has
seven valence electrons.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:25.260
Seven and seven is 14,
so you can see that there is going

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.530
to be two sets in antibonding,
three sets in bonding for a net of

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.790
one, giving us the single bond.
And it is only 160 kilojoules per

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.060
mole. This energy level diagram
helps us understand the relationship

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.330
between electron filling and bond
strength. It is very nice.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:46.590
And one last thing. Because these
things are unpaired,

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.860
we have already seen how unpaired
electrons play a role in the

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.920
Stern-Gerlach experiment.
Here this leads to paramagnetism

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.760
because there is some mutual
induction. Both of these are

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.610
spinning but they are spinning in
the same level.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.460
And so what happens is the result
is paramagnetism.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.300
Liquid oxygen is paramagnetic.
And what can happen is that this

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.150
cartoon shows that if you put a
magnetic field on liquid oxygen,

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:34.300
that liquid oxygen would be drawn
towards the magnetic field.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:22.570
And, in fact, if you take the jaws
of a powerful magnet and pour liquid

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:27.140
oxygen in between the jaws,
the oxygen will stop and will sit in

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.710
the jaws. Of course,
it is evaporating like crazy because

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:36.280
it is so warm in the room.
Whereas, liquid nitrogen just goes

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.850
zooming right through.
This is a consequence,

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:45.420
again, of knowing the electron
filling. Well,

00:48:45.420 --> 00:49:04.506
let's see something really crazy
with electronegativity.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:53.750
This one I learned about in my own
research about 20 years ago,

00:48:53.750 --> 00:49:13.333
and it never ceases to amaze me.
If you look at the

00:48:37.500 --> 00:49:01.250
electronegativity difference for
sodium iodide,

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:21.700
it is 1.73. And everybody would
agree that is an ionic compound.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:08.750
Sodium is a metal, iodine is a
nonmetal. Look at cesium.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:29.333
Cesium versus gold is the same
delta electronegativity difference.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:49:16.250
They are both metals, cesium and
gold. When you melt them,

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:36.700
cesium melts at about 28 degrees
centigrade, gold melts at 1063.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:24.140
Liquid metal. Solid metals melt and
become a liquid metal like mercury.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.280
But when the concentration in the
alloy is 50/50 by mole,

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.420
something magical happens.
You have equal numbers of donors

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.560
and acceptors.
Electron transfer occurs.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.710
And you have this liquid alloy at
600 degrees centigrade,

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:44.850
and it turns into a molten salt.
It just goes bang, clear and

00:49:44.850 --> 00:50:04.833
colorless because salts are
colorless. High band gap materials.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:54.230
The electrical conductivity plummets
about three orders of magnitude.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:59.460
And, instead of being an electronic
conductor, a liquid metal,

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.690
it is an ionic conductor. It is
cesium auride.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:09.920
And if you cool that it
crystallizes in the form of salt.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.150
You start with liquid metal one,
liquid metal two,

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:20.380
you have the atom ratios proper,
they mix, electron transfer occurs

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.250
and poof, it is clear and colorless.
Sorcery. All right.

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:26.583
Have a nice weekend.
