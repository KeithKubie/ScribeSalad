00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
&gt;&gt; Well, after spending three days here at
the World Economic Forum in

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.280
the India Economic Summit, I think it's very
realistic India can become

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.200
a superpower.
I mean, you might argue already that India

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.330
is a superpower, with the
size of the population, the potential of the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.000
country.
So again, superpower, superpower, super country

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.450
has many definitions.
I'm convinced India will become, and will

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.519
continue to be, a major
presence in the world economic stage.
