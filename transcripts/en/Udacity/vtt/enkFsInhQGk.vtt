00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.540
That ends our sort of little
introduction to video analysis.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.820
And what we'll do for
the next lecture is,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.920
we'll take a little bit of a look at how
people do activity recognition in video.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040
One of it will be some
slightly more modern method,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.260
which is really just like
a discriminative classification.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.980
We'll just do that real short.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.520
And then there's one
that I really enjoy.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.770
Why?
because my students invented it.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.940
But it, it's become, useful,
about a way of describing human motion,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.980
which you could then apply
the discrimination methods to, so,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.800
the idea is that it's
a representation of the action.
