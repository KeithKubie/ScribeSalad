at all the people around know that a dog

if it just isn't
 

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.500
if it just isn't
isn't right so it's thought that the

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:48.510
isn't right so it's thought that the
 

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.470
isn't right so it's thought that the
white rats were kept aside by the

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480
white rats were kept aside by the
 

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.310
white rats were kept aside by the
breeders by their adders as pets more or

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320
breeders by their adders as pets more or
 

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.500

less and then they found that when they

less and then they found that when they
 

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.060
less and then they found that when they
bred the white rats with one another

00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.070
bred the white rats with one another
 

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.000
bred the white rats with one another
they had a strain of white rats that

but by-and-large interbreeding is your

but by-and-large interbreeding is your

see them mating and yet if you were to

see them mating and yet if you were to
 

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:34.130

you would produce a dog you wouldn't you

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880
you would produce a dog you wouldn't you
 

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.710

incompatible now we realize that this

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.210
incompatible now we realize that this
 

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.510
incompatible now we realize that this
has to do with the number of genes with

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520
has to do with the number of genes with
 

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.440
has to do with the number of genes with
the DNA etc etc but what was somewhat

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:51.450
the DNA etc etc but what was somewhat
 

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.839
the DNA etc etc but what was somewhat
surprising was that animals in the wild

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:55.849
surprising was that animals in the wild
 

00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:58.820
surprising was that animals in the wild
tended to look very much like one

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:58.830
tended to look very much like one

animals looked very different from one

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380
animals looked very different from one
 

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.940
animals looked very different from one
another so just as a Chihuahua looks

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:10.950
another so just as a Chihuahua looks
 

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:15.530
another so just as a Chihuahua looks
different from a from a Great Dane so as

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540
different from a from a Great Dane so as
 

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.400

people thought about people this became

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.410
people thought about people this became
 

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:23.180

something of a condom our humans a

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:23.190
something of a condom our humans a
 

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:29.570
something of a condom our humans a
species and if they are a species can

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:29.580
species and if they are a species can
 

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.560
species and if they are a species can
all humans interbreed with one another

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:35.570
all humans interbreed with one another
 

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:40.460
all humans interbreed with one another
and in fact does that matter supposing

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:40.470
and in fact does that matter supposing
 

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.380
and in fact does that matter supposing
they can maybe it's like the lion and

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:42.390
they can maybe it's like the lion and
 

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.030
they can maybe it's like the lion and
the tiger and that they're different

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040
the tiger and that they're different
 

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.820
the tiger and that they're different
species but they do interbreed and then

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:46.830
species but they do interbreed and then
 

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.740
species but they do interbreed and then
you say well but when we look at a

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:48.750
you say well but when we look at a
 

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.470
you say well but when we look at a
cross-section of humans we find that

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480
cross-section of humans we find that
 

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.200
cross-section of humans we find that
they look very different from one

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:54.210
they look very different from one
 

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.780
they look very different from one
another but do they look different from

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:56.790
another but do they look different from
 

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.589
another but do they look different from
one another after the fashion of

chihuahuas and Great Danes or after the
fashion of say no Wolverines and foxes

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640
fashion of say no Wolverines and foxes
 

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.200

No

is the difference a species difference

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160
is the difference a species difference
 

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.309
is the difference a species difference
or the difference of breed and there was

00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319
or the difference of breed and there was
 

00:39:17.319 --> 00:39:22.950
or the difference of breed and there was
a difference a breed how could you how

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960
a difference a breed how could you how
 

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.309
a difference a breed how could you how
would you how could you understand that

00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319
 

00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:32.220
one of the things that that occurred to

people certainly by the time of Darwin
 

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:44.309
people certainly by the time of Darwin
was that if you could breed animals for

00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319
was that if you could breed animals for
 

00:39:44.319 --> 00:39:45.809
was that if you could breed animals for
characteristics you could breed humans

00:39:45.809 --> 00:39:45.819
characteristics you could breed humans
 

00:39:45.819 --> 00:39:49.440
characteristics you could breed humans
for characteristics and you could say

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.450
for characteristics and you could say
 

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.299
for characteristics and you could say
well supposing we want to have

00:39:51.299 --> 00:39:51.309
well supposing we want to have
 

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:54.630
well supposing we want to have
monstrously fat humans if we get a

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640
monstrously fat humans if we get a
 

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.700
monstrously fat humans if we get a
monstrously fat mother and made her with

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:56.710
monstrously fat mother and made her with
 

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.829
monstrously fat mother and made her with
an Australian fat father we'll get a

00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839
an Australian fat father we'll get a
 

00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:01.650
an Australian fat father we'll get a
really really chubby baby why you would

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:01.660
really really chubby baby why you would
 

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.960
really really chubby baby why you would
want to do that as I'm clear because you

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:03.970
want to do that as I'm clear because you
 

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.210
want to do that as I'm clear because you
don't have a market incentive there's no

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:06.220
don't have a market incentive there's no
 

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.740
don't have a market incentive there's no
big market for really fat babies on the

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:10.750
big market for really fat babies on the
 

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.970
big market for really fat babies on the
other hand there might be a market for

extremely tall people in an era of

extremely tall people in an era of
 

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:19.200
extremely tall people in an era of
basketball playing and of course this is

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:19.210
basketball playing and of course this is
 

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.960

what has been suggested for the People's

what has been suggested for the People's
 

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.089
what has been suggested for the People's
Republic of China that they have engaged

basically Elle is breached for good so

00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:46.269
basically Elle is breached for good so
 

00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:49.140
basically Elle is breached for good so
it's good genes essentially and that

it's good genes essentially and that
