00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.140
Hey guys!

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.340
You may notice that I'm sitting around in the dark today, and that's because today

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.189
We're gonna be doing some experiments with glow sticks.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.200
We've got a huge selection of different glow sticks right here,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.240
And we're gonna see what we can learn about them just by playing around.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.260
we'll see what happens if we open some up and

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.389
Really get a feel for what these things are like. What's the texture of the fluid like? Does it have a smell does it have?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.779
A taste? What happens if we combine lots of glow sticks together?

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.050
Can we pull out the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.070
Separate fluid chemicals inside the glow sticks? And then combine them when we're ready to have a large amount of glow

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.469
Today is the day to learn all of these things

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.999
The first step will be cracking open one of these plastic tubes and seeing what's going on inside

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.980
when I look at one of these tubes up close I can see that there's liquid coming up to about here and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.980
Just below that is what appears to be a glass vial

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.009
I'm gonna try and cut the plastic off above the level of the liquid so that when it cuts. It doesn't just leak out everywhere

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.169
All right the top of that kind of came off pretty easily

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.860
There's definitely some liquid running out

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.960
So may be kind of hard to see

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.669
But there's now what looks like maybe a teaspoon of clear liquid down inside this bowl

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.759
And I have a vial which sounds like it's made of glass

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.569
And I think it is because I'm pretty sure these are activated by cracking the glass vial

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.009
inside the plastic tube

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.759
Has a slightly sweet smell not like sugary sweet, but some sort of chemical sweet

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.739
Interesting now we've got our vial which I think is glass and i'm gonna see if I can crack this the same way

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.979
I'm just gonna see if our pliers and take the top off of this

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.420
Hopefully not

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.170
Shoot glass bits everywhere. I'm gonna cover with my hand a little bit. Just so it doesn't shoot shards of glass throughout the kitchen..

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.779
It sounded kind of like when you pop a Christmas light bulb and this is also full liquid

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.559
So let's see what happens if we pour this liquid into that liquid I bet it starts glowing

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.920
Fun kind of swirl patterns in there when it's not mixed all the way yeah that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.320
Bowl is looking pretty good

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.260
It's almost acting as a little bit of a fiberoptic Bowl the edges of it look like they're glowing quite a bit

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.770
So there is the contents of a single glow stick it's not much like I said that looks like it's about one

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.969
Teaspoon of liquid maybe a little bit more, but not a lot all right now

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.839
I don't know. What kind of liquid says is so I'm just gonna dip my gloved hand into it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.310
It does feel pretty oily. This doesn't feel like a water substance on the hands. It just feels like oil

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.650
It's very slippery

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.230
That was the result of getting one glow sticks worth of fluid. I kind of wonder. What would happen if we got like

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.020
20 glow sticks worth of fluid together

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.889
We've got eight cups here, and I'm gonna divide it out into the four different colors and the two different liquids for each color

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.710
There's no visible blue dye in this it looks clear

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.659
I only know that it's going to be blue because the package says there is one and I already cracked some other ones open so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.569
It looks clear at this point, but when I hit it with a black light

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.880
It glows blue the yellow. Glows yellow the green glows green

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.690
Also, interesting is the activating fluid down at the bottom doesn't seem to glow at all it looks purple on video

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.550
But that's just because the blacklight looks purple. It's not fluorescing the way that the vials are a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.209
Pink fluorescing in the blacklight as well so all of the dyes, and whatever else is in that vial lights up under a blacklight

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.329
That's pretty neat all of our activator fluid is now harvested

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.169
So we need to crack open the glass vials and pour that into some separate cups

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.880
I'm also going to clean off each glass vial with a paper towel to get rid of the excess oil on the outside

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.059
Because I don't want it to start glowing before I start combining oh

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.959
And

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.379
Something's already activating. We're getting some blue showing up

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.859
Maybe I need to make sure to clean off my pliers better, so this is the empty cup or all of my blue. Dye

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.380
glass vial fluid into here

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.199
Looks like a pretty similar consistency

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.240
This also feels oily

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.320
Maybe even more oily than the other fluid we now have our for fluids drained into four cups with the four cups of their respective

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.909
Activators, let's hit this with a blacklight again, and see how it's looking look pretty good. Well. It was in the sticks

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.979
Whoo look at that. I love that blue like there's no color

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.490
Until you hit it with the blacklight, and then it is vibrantly

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.359
Brilliantly blue pink magenta red whatever color you want to call that it's it's bright

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.989
We now have glow stick fluid out of 20 glow sticks divided up into its four different colors

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.700
And I think it's time we start combining

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.619
I want to see what happens if we have five glow sticks worth of fluid at once in a cup and then once we've got

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.609
All four I think we're gonna see what happens if we have 20 glow sticks worth of fluid in a cup

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.900
It looks like there's a little bit more of the activator fluid than the glow fluid just eyeballing it. I would say it's 60% activator

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.099
40% die here go pouring the activator into the dye

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.270
Yeah

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.219
It's a nice bright glow, let's do the other colors

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.330
That's a pretty great glow I would say that the green one is definitely brighter than the other three

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.830
But all three of them are putting off some pretty good light. Let's put this in rainbow order for you

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.580
slightly

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.349
Obsessive people out there now. I want to see what happens if we mix them

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.620
Let's see what happens if we mix the magenta and the yellow

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.269
I wonder if we can get orange by doing that there are orange glow sticks, and I have some of those

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.329
But I want to see if we can get orange just by mixing the magenta and yellow. All right. Let's try some pink

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.380
magenta color

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.490
and

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.170
some yellow

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.830
Hmm that is a really cool. Swirl look right there. They haven't mixed together on their own

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.830
There's little bits of orange in there, but right there. It just looks like swirls of glowing fire or something, ooh

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.740
That is mixing and now we have orange glow fluid

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.340
That's actually interesting though like it doesn't look pure orange somehow it has like a slight green tint to it

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.600
It's thicker in some spots. Where looks really orange, but kind of right behind the thick spot

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.819
There's a thin spot, and they have almost looks and green. Oh, man. We've almost got the whole rainbow here

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.219
I think we have to see if we can push that just a little farther

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.309
And get purple. I'll pour off a little bit of blue add a little bit of magenta see if we can get a violet oh

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.720
Yeah a glow rainbow

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.100
Well that looks pretty great, and now I think we need to combine them all together and see how they look

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.969
I don't know what color that's gonna be normal if you mix all these colors together

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.890
You're gonna get a murky brown, but I'm having a hard time imagining. What does glowing Brown look like?

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.410
Let's find out

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.238
So apart just looks like fire and a cup

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:29.359
Curiously all of the colors combined gave us just orange. I really thought we would lose more of that orange color

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.360
I don't know what I thought it would turn into

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:37.338
The blue seemed like it was so vibrant compared to the red and the yellow that I thought it would overpower it

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:42.079
But it hasn't I tilt it like this you can see where it's thin at the back

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.489
That's what I'm talking about that looks green in real life. It's not just a trick of a camera

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:52.218
Looking at this I would say we probably have I don't know about half a cup

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:57.439
Maybe a little less than half a cup of fluid. It's glowing quite nicely very orange, which is

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.889
Interesting since we didn't start with any orange fluid this is

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:08.718
yellow or magenta or blue and our green and those combined to make bright orange wouldn't have guessed that I

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:11.569
Think I know where that smell

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:17.268
What that smell reminds me of if you've ever used a wasp trap that has a liquid bait in it?

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:20.088
It smells a lot like that liquid bait

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.229
pod

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:27.109
Still pretty oily think that's interesting on my black. Glove that just looks green

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:33.469
That's the same stuff that looks orange in the container, but smeared onto my fingers it looks green

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:43.130
Well I have to try this it says non-toxic on the packaging I'm not gonna swallow it

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:52.039
Is it working ah I can feel it tingling on like gum

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:57.649
I've heard the glowsticks will glow a much brighter when they're warm and much less when they're cold

00:08:57.899 --> 00:08:59.600
So I've got a set of glow sticks

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.819
and I'm gonna set them in this cup of hot water and

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:07.549
We'll let them heat up for a bit after that will activate them and compare that to a set of glow sticks that have been

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.819
cooling down in the freezer for several minutes on this side

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:14.899
We have our glow sticks, which have been sitting in the freezer for about 45 minutes and this side

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:18.258
We've got glow sticks that have been sitting in hot water for I don't know 20 minutes

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.589
So let's try cracking all eight and see which glow the best

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.860
first the cold ones

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.469
Oh boy

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.390
Really not a very intense glow yet

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.249
Pink ones barely going at all all right now for the warm ones

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.330
Wow

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.480
Well, I'm gonna say that is confirmed

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.409
Heating it up. Definitely makes it put off more light

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.880
Here's our cold ones

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.480
Which barely seem like they're glowing at all in every case the warm one is glowing way more than the cold one

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.690
Warmth definitely makes a difference cold ones not as bright

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.150
Although it's also interesting that I believe if it's colder it will last longer

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.129
So it won't put out as much light all at once but over time it might put out the same amount of light

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.800
There's something floating on the top of this water

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.759
And I got this cup it was just one of the cups that had some activator in it

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.160
Which makes me think that maybe the oily?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.099
Feel of the glowsticks isn't just in my head, maybe it's actually an oil of some sort

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.599
So let's see what happens if we try and mix a little bit of our glow stick fluid with some water

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.850
There's a little bit of water at the bottom of that cup. Let's pour in some glow stick fluid and see what happens

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.930
Yeah, they don't mix

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:51.239
You can see that our glow fluid is underneath our layer of water, and interestingly once again. It looks green

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.629
We go we can see the glow fluid comes up to about here, and then the water is just sitting on top of it

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.630
So the two do not mix together

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.169
Soap is an emulsifier that can often let polar and nonpolar fluids bond

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.110
So let's add some of that and see if we can get them to mix

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.210
Mmm. The soap is activating with the Glo fluid itself

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.010
Wow that's getting a lot brighter

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:25.050
Which I think is probably a result of the very warm water that I was using which lends some support to the idea that heat

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:31.200
Will make these glow more intensely compare that to our other fluid. Here's the the difference between the two at the moment

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.090
This is putting off a lot more light after being mixed with warm water and even with the soap

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:41.939
It's still separating back out mostly now. That's so point in and it immediately started doing something really cool

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.080
I don't what it was but I have to try it again

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.540
So I'm gonna pour off a little bit more of our glow fluid here

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.509
I'm just gonna drip some soap in without any of a warm water this time

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:59.229
Elgar's really cool kind of reminds me of when we made patterns in milk with food coloring by dripping in some liquid soap

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.040
Okay, so

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.130
Now it's getting even brighter

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.680
But there's no hot water in this one

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.079
So I think soap might chemically activate this stuff either that or it's just the stirring motion

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.360
But I think it's the soap now

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.419
I want to see just how bright we can get some of this to go

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.339
We know that heat makes them brighter, and it seems that adding soap makes them brighter as well

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.930
So let's take both of these fluids let them sit in a bath of warm water for a few minutes

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:35.949
then combine them with a little bit of soap and see if we can just get like an ultra bright glowing lantern look I

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:43.510
Think our two different fluid. Halves are ready and probably fairly warm after sitting in that so let's take those out

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:50.680
Let's combine them together and then add soap and see how bright this thing gets this is five green glow sticks worth of fluid oh

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.070
That's just the warm fluids mixed together that is already

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.129
You know affects us the colour that'll kill Superman right there alright. Let's try adding a drop of soap

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.200
Yep that gets a lot right oh my gosh that is insanely bright

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.140
I don't think it's gonna last very long, but something about the soap pulls all the chemical reaction into one spot

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.989
And it just boy that is a lantern check this out scary stories tonight

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.820
