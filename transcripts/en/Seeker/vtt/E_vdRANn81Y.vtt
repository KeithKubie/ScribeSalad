00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.460
When some stars die they explode in a huge
supernova.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.669
But what separates a supernova from an “it’s
alright I guess,” nova?

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.120
Hey everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.750
The sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma
that’s been burning for about 4.6 billion

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.750
years.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.580
In another 5 billion it’ll run out of hydrogen
fuel and after going through some expansions

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.710
and contractions will eventually lose its
outer layer, leaving a little glowing core

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.160
called a White Dwarf to cool off in space.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.000
As star deaths go it’ll be a pretty peaceful
one, but sometimes stars say YOLO and go out

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.570
in a blaze of glory.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.040
They explode with a flash brighter than entire
galaxies and send shock wave shooting out

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.460
in all directions.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.760
We call these explosions supernovae.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.330
So what separates our sun’s fade to black
from a grand finale?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.820
Something called the Chandrasekhar limit,
named for the Indian physicist Subrahmanyan

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.880
Chandrasekhar who figured out why some stars
go boom, and he did it at the age of 19.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.140
Feeling old yet?

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.620
Chandrasekhar calculated that if a white dwarf
had a mass about 1.4 times that of our sun’s

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.850
it would not be able to fend off the force
of gravity.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.170
It would collapse, but as it collapsed it
would ignite a runaway chain of fusion reactions

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.220
and Bam!

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.220
Supernova.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.170
So mass is the key to the galaxy’s greatest
fireworks show, and there are two ways stars

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.150
can reach that Chandrasekhar limit.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.800
The first way is by leaching off another nearby
star.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.140
If a white dwarf is in a binary system it
can pull matter from its partner until, like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.550
all unhealthy relationships, it ends with
a fiery explosion.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.610
This is called a Type Ia supernova.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.690
A Type II supernova begins with a single star
that was huge in the first place.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.600
A star would have to be at least 8 times more
massive than our sun to have a core heavy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.310
enough to light that giant space candle.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.260
Stars that massive don’t stop at fusing
carbon and helium into oxygen like ours will.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.049
They’ll burn neon, oxygen, and silicon to
keep the fusion going.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.090
But once they create iron, they’re done
for because iron uses more energy to fuse

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.270
than it puts out.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.340
When the fusion can’t be maintained gravity
wins out and the star contracts, cramming

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.770
protons and electrons together into neutrons,
unleashing a wave of neutrinos that would

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.710
exert a huge outward pressure.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.149
The contracting outer layers would also rebound
off the dense inner ones.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.120
When these layers slam into each other heavier
elements are created and distributed through

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120
space.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.650
The explosion also frees up elements like
carbon and oxygen that would otherwise have

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.310
been locked up in the star’s core, so from
a star’s death we get life.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.299
Once the explosion dissipates as a nebula,
it leaves behind a ball of densely packed

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.400
neutrons called a neutron star that’s only
a few miles across.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.689
If the star was really massive, the neutrons
will be crushed and form a black hole.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.749
And if the star was really really massive,
it leaves behind something called your mom.

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.480
Because stars have to be so huge to explode,
supernovae don’t happen very often.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.480
In our galaxy they only happen about twice
a century.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.230
One star on supernova watch is Betelgeuse,
burning off the shoulder of Orion.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.180
Betelgeuse is a red supergiant at least 430
light years away.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.900
When it does go, it’ll be visible in daylight,
but it probably won’t explode for another

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.269
100,000 years, unless someone says its name
3 times.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.510
Betelgeuse is far from the most massive star
ever discovered.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.760
The snappily named R136a1 holds that distinction,
at 265 solar masses.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.670
Stars like this are pushing the upper limits
of size, and their supernovae will be mind

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.670
blowing.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.680
The largest supernova ever observed was seen
by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.189
or ASAS-SN.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.639
Designated ASASSN-15lh, the explosion was
20 times brighter than all the stars in our

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.219
galaxy combined.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.909
The explosion released 10 times more energy
than the sun will in its entire lifetime.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.319
Luckily it was 3.8 billion light years away.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.450
Knowing how massive a star is gives us a good
idea of what it’ll do.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.549
But how do we figure that out in the first
place?

00:03:43.549 --> 00:04:13.109
Trace explains that here.
