00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
- And researcher Randi's with UC Davis

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.200
and Director of the Fragile X
Research and Treatment Center

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300
of the MIND Institute.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.150
She knocks our audience off their feet

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.020
every time she speaks.
(Randi groans)

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.810
And we are so happy to have you back.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.010
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm not gonna list

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.555
all your accomplishments and things.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:33.388
- Good.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.630
- You're gonna talk about
fragile X, I take it.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.990
- Yeah, new treatments.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.290
- New treatments.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.320
- And then stay afterwards
because we're gonna get

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.733
the afternoon speakers together
to talk about what's next.

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:51.630
- Okay, wow, that's exciting.
- That's your pointer.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.630
- Okay, my pointer and my advancer, okay.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.243
So you guys all know
about the MIND Institute,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.340
and we love it.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.530
So my disclosures are,
I'm carrying out a number

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410
of treatment trials, we just got funded

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.870
to do the Zynerba trial about CBD,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.850
so I'll talk a little bit about that.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.380
Our metformin study, which
is a new targeted treatment

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.450
for fragile X, and perhaps
other forms of autism,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.040
is funded by the Azrieli Foundation.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.040
AFQ056 is an mGluR5 antagonist
and we're funded by NIH.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.470
But AFQ056 is made by Novartis
and we have a fragile X

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.190
LEARN study with that combined with using

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.610
parent implemented, the
language intervention or PILI

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.400
developed by Len Abbeduto at the MIND.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400
I'm also funded by Ovid
to do a gaboxadol study.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400
This is a new GABA agonist for individuals

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.333
with fragile X.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.300
And I've consulted with
Zynerba to help them develop

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.780
their protocol for the
fragile X treatment trials.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.390
So enough for disclosure.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.610
My overview is to really talk
about the latest treatments

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.437
for both fragile X syndrome and for autism

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.360
and a future look at
treatments for both disorders.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.910
Learning objectives,
understand the relationship

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.010
between fragile X and
autism spectrum disorders.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.880
Name a couple medications
for new treatments

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.750
for fragile X, the same with autism

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.710
and to understand the
difference in fragile X

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.360
between the pre mutation
and fragile X syndrome.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.930
I have, I follow a lot
of individuals that have

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.150
pre mutation disorders
like FXTAS, tremor ataxia

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.090
or fragile X associated tremor ataxia

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.020
and I have so many neurologists that see

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.070
an older guy with a tremor ataxia syndrome

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.660
associated with the pre mutation

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900
and the neurologists say, you don't look

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.650
like you have fragile
X syndrome, you know,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.240
you're a smart lawyer and blah, blah blah.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.730
And so a lot of people don't
understand the difference

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.000
between pre mutation disorders

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.230
and full mutation disorders in fragile X

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.300
and it's really fragile X syndrome,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.520
those with the full mutation
or more than 200 repeats

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.590
that'll I'll talk about related

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.392
to these targeted treatments today.

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:24.920
So this is a new age
of targeted treatments.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.950
It's been going on for the last decade

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.930
and we're very excited about that.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.930
Actually things are moving
into stem cell studies,

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.519
being able to correct the genetic defect

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.519
in stem cells and then
insert it into patients.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.570
It's a very excited new
age, stem cell therapy

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:53.410
and gene manipulation therapy.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.170
So we're gonna have a
conference next year,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.110
probably a year and a half from now

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.840
at the MIND Institute
about stem cell therapy

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.300
for neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.880
You hear a lot about stem cell therapy

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.480
for neurodegenerative
disorders, but not so much

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.800
about neurodevelopmental.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.320
And there's so many bogus places out there

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.120
that are injecting stem cells for autism

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.790
and it's just bull.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.960
And you need to be able to sort out

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.540
what's real, what's
happening in the research

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.910
for many genetic disorders.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.360
It's pretty exciting in the animal models

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.114
and I think in a few years it'll move

00:04:27.114 --> 00:04:29.380
more into humans.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.370
So but before that takes
place, we are really focused

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.410
on targeted treatments that could reverse

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.100
some of the neurobiolgical
abnormalities related

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.690
to different genetic disorders.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.750
And there's a lot of 'em
going on in fragile X syndrome

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:47.680
and I'll touch on each one of these.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.590
But also it's not just fragile X syndrome.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.350
Angelman syndrome,
gaboxadol has some nice data

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.320
for Angelman syndrome and
minocycline was somewhat helpful.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.080
But for Prader-Willi, you get
diagnosed in the first year,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.660
you get put on growth hormone.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.950
I mean, this makes a real difference

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.240
for that disorder.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.080
And tuberous sclerosis of
course, various mTOR inhibitors

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.380
including rapamycin.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.690
And even Rett syndrome,
there's this paper coming out,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.250
I wrote an editorial for Neurology

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.890
because the trofinetide
treatments for Rett syndrome,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.290
this is the IGF1 analog,
there's a real nice study

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.800
that's gonna come out in
Neurology I think next month

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.530
about trofinetide
treatment in Rett syndrome.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.130
And anavex is a new treatment
that looks really good

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.500
in the Rett syndrome animal model.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.450
So these are new targeted treatments

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.450
for many more disorders that
you'll hear much more about

00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:55.320
and some of these treatments are available

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.160
like for instance the
metformin that I'll talk about.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.960
But it's also important to
think about the similarities

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.693
across disorders.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.430
Like autism and fragile X both
have real significant GABA

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.000
glutamate imbalances and many disorders

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.680
with the GABA deficits
will do well I think

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.680
with medications that really
enhance GABA pathways,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.690
these inhibitory pathways, and I think

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.810
that can help with behavior.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.610
I think just about every
disorder that we look at

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.963
has mitochondrial dysfunction
associated with it.

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:37.650
You're not having a mitochondrial mutation

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.460
in the mitochondrial
DNA but the mitochondria

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.560
don't work as well.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.273
It's very dysfunctional
and so people are doing

00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:48.110
more mitochondrial
studies and thinking about

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.900
medications that can improve
mitochondrial abnormalities

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.050
that impact the development of the child.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.920
Of course all the aging
syndromes, when we talk

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.670
about Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.010
or whatever, all the
neurodegenerative disorders,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.090
they all have mitochondrial abnormalities

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.960
and actually everybody gets
more mitochondrial dysfunction

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.110
with aging.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.190
If you're older, you really
feel weak in your extremities

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.080
sometimes and these are all related

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.580
to mitochondrial changes
that occur with aging.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.050
So oxidative stress,
reactive oxygen species

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.540
and things that are dramatic antioxidants

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.325
that can turn on the
internal antioxidant system

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:36.880
in cells I think can
really make a difference

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.490
and we'll maybe talk
about that at the end.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.420
Environmental toxicity
impacts many neurodegenerative

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.050
or neurodevelopmental disorder and also

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.210
many neurodegenerative disorders.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.380
We study that in FXTAS
and are very worried

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.410
about general anesthesia
and the isofluranes

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.980
that cause more neuronal cell death.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.080
But we don't worry about it as much

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.500
in neurodevelopmental
syndromes, although I think

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.010
it does have a big impact in autism

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.060
and many other disorders.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.840
I'll talk a little bit
about the fragile X protein

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.760
and how this can be a problem
for many other disorders

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.710
besides fragile X syndrome.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.430
And when you think about autism and people

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.203
have talked about the
heterogeneity and all

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.030
of the comorbidities, and this has been

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.390
such a great conference, and
I'm sure you've heard a lot

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.270
over the last couple days
and many of the things

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.230
that we use to treat
autism is maybe focused

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.990
on the mood instability
or the ADHD or the anxiety

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.240
and we don't really
have something that gets

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.910
at the core deficits of autism with social

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.056
and communication and these
repetitive behavior problems.

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:58.150
And of course these are just a short list

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.900
of all the different disorders associated

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.760
with autism and fragile X
is either the most common

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.440
or the second most common
cause of genetic disorders

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.050
associated with autism.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.320
So whenever you see in autism patients,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.680
this is just to remind
you about the workup.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.530
I'm sure you heard from
Cindy Curry not only

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.530
about fragile X DNA testing but CGH array

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.690
and battery, you can
look out for ASD genes

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.510
and then so much more
whole exome sequencing

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.190
and whole genome sequencing.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.880
And you know the genetics
people at UC Davis

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.200
are just cranking on the
whole genome sequencing

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.370
and finding so many interesting mutations.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.090
We had an interesting
adult not too long ago

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.410
that turned out to have
a mutation in a gene

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.180
that causes iron deposition in the brain

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.280
and you could see it on his MRI

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.790
and it was a BPAP mutation.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.300
And this is the only cause of autism

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.320
that I think benefits from chelation.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.910
And in fact we put him on despiropone

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.720
and he has gotten better as the iron

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.990
has gotten out of his brain.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.250
But this is a specific
mutation that causes

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.610
iron deposition and in adulthood.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.360
And in his 20s he started developing more

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.940
Parkinsonian features
and really deteriorating.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.780
And so he got better.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.173
But that was found through
whole genome sequencing.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.910
So I just wanna talk
about how FMRP deficits

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.820
can occur across many disorders, not only

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.510
in those that have the
whole mutation of fragile X

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.747
or even the upper end of the pre mutation

00:10:53.747 --> 00:10:57.530
and the pre mutation is 55 to 200 repeats

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.790
but actually studies of brains, particular

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.310
by Fatemi et al, have
shown deficits of FMRP

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.730
in the brains of individuals with autism,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.550
severe depression and bipolar disorder

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.970
and most dramatically in schizophrenia

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.020
and in fact the age of
onset in schizophrenia in IQ

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.230
in a population in Eastern
Europe in those papers there

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.740
correlate with the level of FMRP.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.140
So the lower the level of
FMRP, and these are individuals

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.870
without a fragile X
mutation, the lower the level

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.804
of FMRP, the earlier the
onset of schizophrenia

00:11:35.804 --> 00:11:38.943
and the lower the IQ.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.923
Even tuberous sclerosis
neurons have been shown

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.920
to have deficits of
FMRP within the neuron.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.920
Hypoxia at birth lowers FMRP
and even early life seizures

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.533
can significantly lower FMRP.

00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:06.480
So seizures actually pull
FMRP away from the synapse

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.480
and FMRP is a protein
that regulates translation

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.550
of messages right at the
synapse and that relates

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.920
to environmental stimuli.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.360
So it kinda turns on
and regulates messages

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.280
right at the synapse
that are really important

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.840
for synaptic plasticity.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.080
And when you have repetitive seizures,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.410
FMRP goes away from the synapse
and towards the cell body.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.530
And maybe that's part of the reason why

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.040
there can be cognitive
deficits for individuals

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.270
with recurrent seizures.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.120
But this just shows some
of the brain studies

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.670
in individuals with
bipolar disorder there,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.730
depression and schizophrenia compared

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.730
to control brains, and none
of these have a mutation

00:12:52.803 --> 00:12:56.420
in the FMR1 gene, the fragile X gene.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.420
And early life seizures
pull these dots here,

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.750
are FMRP among the dendritic spines and

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.470
with early life seizures,
FMRP, which is this green

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.490
fluorescent, it goes away from the synapse

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.750
and to the cell body.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.930
So when you dysregulate
FMRP from the synapse,

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.713
you're gonna have some cognitive deficits.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.710
So FMRP not only controls translation

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.170
but it also is a messenger RNA carrier.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.080
It's one of these proteins that does

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.230
just about everything.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.060
It even controls epigenetic regulation

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.410
and I'll show you that in a moment,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.830
or at least one of the
proteins, Brd4, important

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.280
for epigenetic changes in the DNA.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.280
It can enhance the release
of neurotransmitters

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.700
presynaptically much more
rapidly so that the synapse

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.561
gets flooded with the neurotransmitters

00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:08.561
so that individuals have,
when there's an absence

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.490
of FMRP, the synapse gets flooded

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.044
and they can't detect subtle
changes in the environment

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:20.360
that are important for learning.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.860
It down regulates, when FMRP
is absent, the GABA receptors

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.447
are down regulated and then it
up regulates mGluR5 pathways.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.750
So it has a lot of
effects and I think we're

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.870
just beginning to see some of the effects.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.790
So it's a big mother controller protein

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.830
that when you mess with
FMRP, you get a lot

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.871
of effects in many different pathways

00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:48.208
and we're learning more about it.

00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:52.120
It actually up regulates
the insulin receptor

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.490
and I'll get more into that.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:58.490
But this is the effects
on the Brd4 protein,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.020
which is really important
for epigenetic regulation.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.900
And so FMRP usually inhibits translation

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.260
but sometimes it stimulates translation.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.810
And so when it's absent,
there's an up regulation

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.870
of proteins including Brd4 which produces

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.550
a lot more changes in transcription

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.630
because of the epigenetic regulation.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.520
And then that in turn
influences what happens

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.010
at the synapse.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:34.010
So this interaction, epigenetic
mechanisms with genetic

00:15:36.956 --> 00:15:41.956
and environmental influences
is a very complex interaction

00:15:43.573 --> 00:15:47.920
that can cause some
commonalities across disorders

00:15:49.337 --> 00:15:52.990
and there's a lot of evidence
for epigenetic dysregulation

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.890
in individuals with autism, even in some

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.170
of the twin studies, monozygotic twins,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.640
some of the methylation
studies that we've done

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.570
at UC Davis in Flora
Tussone's laboratory shows

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.070
dramatic methylation
changes in individuals

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.000
with idiopathic autism.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.360
And whether that's related
to environmental toxins

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.869
or other factors in the
environment, we don't know.

00:16:20.869 --> 00:16:24.190
I just wanna show you just a partial list

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.120
of some of the genes that are controlled

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.120
by FMRP, and this circle
are genes associated

00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:36.340
with autism spectrum disorders.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.760
These are all regulated by FMRP.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.230
And these are the genes
associated with schizophrenia

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.960
or mood disorders.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.660
So in about 10% of
individuals with fragile X,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.900
they can be on the psychotic spectrum.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.780
We've even seen psychosis
in some individuals

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.550
with the pre mutation, particularly those

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.180
that smoke a lot of
marijuana, which can push you

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.833
towards the psychotic spectrum.

00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:06.950
And so we're very interested
in the interaction

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.380
in those with a fragile X
mutation with psychosis.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.380
But you can also see
psychosis, I've seen many aging

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.930
ASD patients that have
developed psychotic thinking

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.160
over time too that's not associated

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.700
with smoking a lot of marijuana.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.540
But there may be other
environmental toxins

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.113
that can enhance that.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.710
So again as I mentioned,
many of the proteins

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.200
or the messages that
FMRP regulates, it binds

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.320
to actually almost over
3,000 mRNA targets.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.190
Many of these genes again are associated

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:57.190
with fragile X or other
disorders, Angelman,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.380
Prader-Willi, Rett
syndrome, actually MECP2

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.550
controls FMRP expression.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.320
But FMRP controls the
cannabinoid system also.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.453
So there's dysregulation
in the cannabinoid system.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.640
I just wanna show you this complex slide

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.650
just to point out about the mTOR pathway.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.530
Here's tuberous sclerosis
and this MET ERC pathway.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:32.530
And those with P10 mutations
can have big heads.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.270
This is neurofibromatosis
and these are all related

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.150
to this mTOR pathway and
this is gonna be important

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.970
when I also talk about metformin a minute.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.820
So again, just to point out
how common the fragile X

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.660
mutations are, basically
about one in 200 females

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.710
in this area, I just
came back from Columbia

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.680
in South America and
there are huge pockets

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.940
of fragile X in different villages there.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.300
In one village, one in 50 individuals has

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.060
a full mutation and more
have the pre mutation.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.950
And we found some other villages where

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.520
there's just pockets of
fragile X I think related

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.313
to a founder effect.

00:19:18.313 --> 00:19:22.620
And many pre mutation disorders there.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.190
And so the pre mutation
disorders, it's the most

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.690
common cause of early ovarian failure,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.180
the most common genetic cause
of early ovarian failure.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.640
FXTAS is the fragile X
associated tremor ataxia syndrome

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.020
and it usually begins in the 50s or 60s

00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:45.840
and affecting about 45 to 50% of the males

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.140
and about 16% of the females.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.420
We've also identified
the fragile X associated

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.450
neuropsychiatric disorders or FXAND

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.400
because depression,
anxiety, ADHD, obsessive

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.900
compulsive disorder, chronic
fatigue, chronic pain

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.260
and fibromyalgia are definitely associated

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.280
with the pre mutation.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.800
So the pre mutation is common
in the general population

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.490
whereas the full mutation
of fragile X is not

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.090
and the difference between
the two is the level

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.770
of messenger RNA.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.320
So pre mutation carriers,
which are quite common

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.830
in the general population,
have dramatic elevation

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.270
in the messenger RNA,
as you can see there.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.950
In the full mutation, the
whole gene gets methylated

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.070
so it shuts off message
unless you're a girl

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.875
and you have another normal X chromosome.

00:20:34.875 --> 00:20:39.670
But it's the lack of the
message in the protein

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.480
that causes fragile X syndrome.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.890
And again we have a subgroup of fragile X

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.220
that has a Prader-Willi like phenotype

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.460
with obesity and hyperphagia.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.340
And these are the individuals
that I started treating first

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.620
with metformin 'cause it
is a treatment for obesity

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.113
and hyperphagia and it
helps them lose weight.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.260
But then we found some
significant improvements

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.170
in language and conversational speech.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.980
And that's why we're carrying
out a control trial now.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.880
But hand flapping, hand
biting, poor eye contact

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.527
even those that don't
have a diagnosis of autism

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:21.270
and about 60% also meet
criteria for autism.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.890
Some of 'em that don't have
autism and are very social

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.450
can still have poor eye
contact and hand flapping

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.760
and so some autistic features.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.760
So the GABA deficit causes
a lack of habituation.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.050
So here we look at sweat
response to repetitive stimuli

00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:43.480
and usually whether it's a loud noise

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.100
or a visual stimulus, you
habituate in your sweat response

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.800
to repetitive stimuli.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.710
But fragile X don't
because they don't have

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.990
a good GABA system.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.750
They don't have a good inhibitory system.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.520
And so they get activated
with repetitive stimuli.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.450
So if you yell at them or try to spank 'em

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.980
or whatever, you often
will get into trouble

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.976
with significant aggression.

00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:11.640
So you really have to
go into a calming mode

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.410
as this guy is telling me non verbally

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.640
that I'm taking too many pictures of him.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.910
And so this is one of
the reasons why there's

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.740
significant aggressive outbursts.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.980
They just get overwhelmed in
over stimulating situations.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.350
And of course they have macro orchidism

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.310
which begins at about
eight or nine years of age

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.360
and these top lines
represent about 180 patients

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.020
we published many years ago,
and these are the normals

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.910
in terms of testicular volume here.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.880
But they usually have
double jointed thumbs,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.350
hyper extensibility
and this boy has a very

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.200
subtle strabismus, but
it led to amblyopia.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.600
And biting on your shirt and biting things

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.913
are quite common.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.470
So just getting into some
of the targeted treatments

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.470
as we talked about when FMRP
is usually the inhibitor

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.970
of this mGluR5 pathway.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.690
And when it's not there,
there's up regulation

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.090
of many proteins including the proteins

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.700
that internalize the AMPAR receptors

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.480
and that's why you get long and immature

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.730
and weak dendritic spines.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.270
So people thought, oh gosh, you just use

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.610
an mGluR5 antagonist and
you could cure this disorder

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.350
and that's what started the
targeted treatment field.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.060
And we tried many mGluR5
antagonist, down regulating

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.850
this MET ERC pathway and in turn

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.500
maybe the mTOR pathway.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.480
But none of them really worked,
particular in adolescents

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.730
and adults.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.880
Tried many other things.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.210
I'll touch on minocycline,
ganaxolone, allopregnanolone

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.210
is a neuro steroid, or
baclofen, a GABA agonist.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.840
Even lithium will down
regulate this pathway

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.910
but it doesn't cure fragile X.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.610
So now it's thought that
the earlier you start

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.590
a targeted treatment, you
will build a better brain

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.483
on which you can apply learning.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.760
And so if you give an mGluR5 antagonist

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.230
in adulthood, which we have in many cases,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.130
sometimes they do better
but the overall study

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.841
didn't show improvement.

00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:34.841
So now NIH through
NeuroNEXT funded an AFQ056,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.950
it's an mGluR5 antagonist made by Novartis

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.330
in a control trial, but on top of that,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.210
at the end of the study
they can go on open label.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.270
But on top of this
controlled trial of AFQ056

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.160
we added Parent Implemented
Language Intervention,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.150
also called PILI, which
is done through Skype

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.970
by a speech and language pathologist

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.900
right into the patient's home.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.160
And basically what it's doing
is it's teaching parents

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.970
how to stimulate language
at home, how to talk

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.640
about the things that
the kid's interested in,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.520
how to promote language,
how to scaffold language.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.440
I mean many of you know
about Hannon techniques

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.273
and other techniques.

00:25:23.273 --> 00:25:28.120
Well it combines all of this
and it's very effective alone

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.010
for improving language
in kids with fragile X

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.390
between the ages of three and six.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.510
And we've been able to demonstrate that.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.163
And now we're analyzing the data,

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.170
well actually we're not
finished with the study yet.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.410
We are not analyzing the data yet.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.950
We have until May to do the enrollment.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.630
It's at 14 different sites in the US

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.670
and hopefully will show some good results.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.360
We've had some kids, I don't
know, it's a double blind

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.740
control trial so I don't
know what they're on.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.116
But many have improved.

00:26:06.116 --> 00:26:09.130
And so we're excited to look at the data

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.650
and to analyze the data soon.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.410
It's led by Liz Berry
Kravitz, who's a really

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.293
great neurologist at Rush
University in Chicago.

00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:20.900
And then we're all helping
her with this study,

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.840
and MIND is one of the sites.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.200
So we did a minocycline
study a few years ago now.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.200
And minocycline can down
regulate matrix metaloprotein

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.970
ACE9 or MMP9, which is up regulated

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.550
without the fragile X protein around

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.040
and that interferes
with synaptic plasticity

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.430
so you can bring it down to normal.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.140
It actually improves
cognition and behavior

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.850
in the fragile X mice.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.421
And we did a controlled
trial a few years ago

00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:55.060
and we did show efficacy.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.080
In blue on the CGII here, you can see

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.640
that it was somewhat better.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.780
Of course there was a big placebo effect,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.380
but we do get a significant effect.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.660
It wasn't dramatic, but
we had a number of kids

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.390
that did very well on minocycline.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.190
And most importantly, we
developed an event-related

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.900
potential, so this is
an EEG hat that's put on

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.020
that can look at habituation here,

00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:27.840
looking at habituation with placebo

00:27:29.257 --> 00:27:32.160
and with the minocycline.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.960
And we brought back and
improved habituation.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.960
Also looking at some of the amplitudes

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.980
which changed for the better.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.040
But habituation improved dramatically

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.200
with minocycline.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.490
So we've been using that
habituation paradigm

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.180
in many of our outcome measures along

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.300
with some new expressive language sampling

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.670
that Len Abbeduto, who's the director

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.170
at the MIND Institute, has developed.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:07.170
Now in those with autism,
there is in the brain

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.830
a deficit of serotonin
production, particularly

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.830
in kids five or six
years of age and younger

00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:20.130
compared to non autistic children.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.650
This is a very old study by Chigani.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.090
But then there was some metabolic studies

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.350
that demonstrated a paper by Boccoto et al

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.537
found abnormal expression
in the tryptophan metabolism

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.110
pathway in individuals with autism.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.950
So here's tryptophan
and it gets metabolized

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.640
up to serotonin in the brain.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.770
But all of these enzymes marked in blue

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.556
are all dramatically
down regulated compared

00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:55.080
in individuals with autism
compared to controls.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.210
So that was another factor that suggested

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.090
that the synthesis of
serotonin in the brain

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.680
is deficient in individuals with autism.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.358
Now around that time, I also showed that

00:29:09.358 --> 00:29:13.190
in a retrospective study,
that those young children

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.160
with fragile X syndrome,
when they were treated

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.160
with sertraline or Zoloft,
that their trajectory

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.540
of language development was much better

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.330
when I didn't treat them with sertraline.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.440
Now the reason I was
treating them is because

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.320
anxiety kinda begins by
the second year of life.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.140
And the anxiety can be
very severe in individuals

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.530
with fragile X syndrome.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.530
And it seems to worsen
social interactions.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.760
And here when I treated
them with sertraline,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.840
I saw an improvement in language.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.930
I didn't expect that.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.840
I was just treating the anxiety.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.640
And maybe if they were less anxious,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.920
that's why they talked more.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.790
But that's one of the reasons
why we did a control trial

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.800
and this has been published now in Journal

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.720
of Developmental and
Behavioral Pediatrics.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.890
But it was a randomized controlled study.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.770
And what we saw was that on the Mullen,

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.780
here's the reference here in the Journal

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.830
of Developmental and
Behavioral Pediatrics,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.530
these are months improved
on those on sertraline

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.600
versus placebo, and we saw significance

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.620
in many of the sub tests on the Mullen.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.090
Not all, I expected to see the best effect

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:38.090
in language but about
60% of those in the study

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.600
had autism and a post
hoc analysis in looking

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.430
at just those who had autism,
that they were the ones

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.403
that had a significant
improvement in expressive language

00:30:50.403 --> 00:30:54.010
raw scores on this study.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.920
So I thought, wow, well maybe
we should be using sertraline

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.910
in those individuals that have autism

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.160
without fragile X syndrome.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.070
And we got funded to do a
low-dose sertraline study,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.750
2 mg to 5 mg in kids
two to six years of age

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.520
with autism.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.480
The vast majority were idiopathic.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.196
We had a couple that had
a known point mutation

00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:23.130
but without fragile X syndrome.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.800
And we used very similar outcome measures

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.703
including the Mullens
and it was a randomized

00:31:29.703 --> 00:31:30.710
control trial.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.763
Here's the consort diagram.

00:31:34.172 --> 00:31:37.683
And what we found is that
looking at the CGI-I,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.820
this is sertraline in red, we had many

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.650
that actually really
did well on sertraline

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.130
and some looked like they even pulled out

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.150
of their autism.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.150
But the overall
significance was not there.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.110
So there's clearly just a subtype of those

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:05.240
with idiopathic autism
that seems to improve

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.010
with sertraline.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.430
And we didn't see improvement
in any of the Mullen measures.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.050
This is kinda broken up.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.656
But a lot of this was in the negative

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:17.650
and those that were in the positive

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.770
were not dramatic.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.310
So most, there weren't
any significant findings

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.680
on any of the Mullen sub tests.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.650
That hasn't been published yet

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.520
but it is under revision
now also to General

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.560
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.200
So we hope to finish that
in the next few weeks.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.610
So why did sertraline
work better in fragile X

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.660
than in idiopathic autism?

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.070
Well anxiety is a much
more significant problem

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.520
in individuals with
fragile X syndrome compared

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.280
to idiopathic autism, even
though anxiety can be a problem.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.500
But in fragile X syndrome,
it's a major driver

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.500
of the severity of the
ASD because anxiety leads

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.370
to social isolation in individuals

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.720
with fragile X syndrome.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.090
And the level of the anxiety correlated

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.810
with the level of the severity of autism

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.690
in children with fragile X syndrome.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.690
And this very nice study
came out just recently

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.950
in Journal of Developmental Disorder

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.109
where they're looking at either pictures

00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:29.610
of faces, they're also
looking at face processing,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.000
where you look on a face.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.260
And you remember that those with autism

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.040
and also with fragile
X syndrome don't look

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.873
at the eyes.

00:33:35.873 --> 00:33:38.030
They look at the nose and at the mouth.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.020
But there are social pictures
and then abstract pictures

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:47.020
here and compared to typical controls,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.230
those with autism were less interested

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.640
in the social pictures.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.270
Those with fragile X were more interested

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.430
in the social pictures.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:01.908
And in the face processing,
there were differences,

00:34:01.908 --> 00:34:05.780
I can't see this so well,
but the blue is fragile X

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.653
and the green is autism.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.940
And this is where they look on the face

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.260
and how much time they
spend looking at the face.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.630
But there are significant differences.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.990
And in fragile X, there's
a lot less fixation

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:24.820
on the eyes.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.260
Supposedly that's
overwhelming to the amygdala

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.070
compared to those with autism.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.860
The interesting thing
is that in fragile X,

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.475
those with more anxiety
had less eye contact

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:42.475
but they were more interested
in the social scenes

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:46.150
and almost as if they were hypervigilant

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.410
to the social scenes.

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:52.230
So that was very interesting, that those

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.690
with fragile X with more
anxiety, were even more

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.160
interested in the social
scenes even though

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.470
they might have had a diagnosis of autism.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.540
And that's very different for those

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.373
with idiopathic autism.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.910
So let me get on to metformin.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.290
It's a type two diabetes medication.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.810
It's known to help with
overeating and obesity

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:18.810
and it's mainly used for
elevated hemoglobin A1Cs

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.293
in emerging and present type two diabetes.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.700
But in the drosophila fragile X model

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.640
they found that in fragile X syndrome,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.770
there was elevated insulin signaling

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.840
and that was brought down
to normal with metformin.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.840
And the PI3K, Akt and mTOR
pathway was all down regulated

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.730
with metformin, and it
improved the circadian rhythm

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.830
deficits and the memory problems

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.390
in the fragile X drosophila model.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.140
And it also rescued
the fragile X phenotype

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.950
in the fragile X mouse model,

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.890
the knockout mouse model.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.040
So at this time, when I
was reading these papers

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.080
in 2017, I thought well
gosh, I should be using

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.340
more metformin in individuals
with fragile X syndrome,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.540
particularly those that are fat or have

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.350
the Prader-Willi
phenotype and hyperphagia.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.620
And indeed they all lost weight.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.080
They improved their weight.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.740
But the parents told me,
gosh, we're not so concerned

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.573
about the weight.

00:36:21.573 --> 00:36:24.830
We really like the fact
that they could talk more

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.983
and I could finally carry out
a conversation with my son.

00:36:30.217 --> 00:36:32.540
And so I thought, wow,
maybe there are cognitive

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.990
and language benefits.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:38.090
And so I read a lot more about metformin.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.425
Basically when you're on
metformin, it up regulates

00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:46.425
AMPK and this inhibits this mTOR pathway.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.970
But it also has a lot of other effects,

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:53.410
not only lowering the excess
protein that's produced,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.060
but it has effects on
the autophagi, effects

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.253
on inflammation and a
lot of positive effects.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.490
It has protection because
it lowers mTOR pathway,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:09.190
it protects you against breast cancer,

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:14.190
cervical cancer, uterine
cancer, ovarian cancer

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.150
and not just female cancers
but many male cancers.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:22.140
So I thought wow, this
is a really great drug.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.260
So I decided I was gonna
go on metformin. (laughing)

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.620
I wanna be protected against these cancers

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.640
and live longer with
better cognitive abilities,

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.093
to spend time playing
with my grandchildren.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.770
And the main side effect is diarrhea

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.060
but I didn't have any diarrhea.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.730
And most patients don't have diarrhea.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.480
But you increase the dose slowly

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.470
and we're doing a controlled
trial, ages six to 25

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.673
that the FDA approved and gave us an IND.

00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:56.890
It's a randomized double
blind crossover study,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.700
very easy study only lasting four months

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.520
with just a visit at baseline,
a visit at two months

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.600
and a visit at four months.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.790
So if you have any fragile X patients,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.620
send them to us because
this and many other trials

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.650
we have going.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.950
And we're using the best of
the outcome measures we know.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.573
The NIH toolbox that
David Hessel has organized

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.530
to be more valid for those
with intellectual disability,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.680
behavioral measures, the
event-related potentials,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.410
eye tracking with the Tobii tracker.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.410
We have molecular biomarkers, MMP9

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.020
and a lot of other downstream proteins

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.620
on the mTOR pathway.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.930
And so I think I'm seeing good effects

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.540
but I'm blinded.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.650
We were funded by the Azrieli Foundation

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.910
to also do it in two centers in Canada,

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.970
Sebastian Jacquemont Center in Montreal

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.970
and Francois Boldec Center
in Edmonton in Canada.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.820
So they were just with us this week.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.500
So it's just a pleasure to
work with the Canadian teams.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.310
So then I had a mom of
this two-year-old child

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.947
who's a pediatrician
at University of Utah.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.490
And she's a developmental
and behavioral pediatrician.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.710
She says after I presented
some of the metformin data

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.360
at a fragile X conference, she says I want

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.676
my two-year-old son on metformin.

00:39:24.676 --> 00:39:27.770
And so I said well you
know, it's not approved

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:28.750
for two-year-olds.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.280
And she said, I don't care.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.860
I want it in my son.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.330
And so we talked about using it clinically

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.250
and talking about a safe
dose, maybe just beginning

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.430
at 50 mg once and then twice a day

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.180
and sneaking up to a couple
of hundred milligrams

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.050
over the next year or so.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.292
And she found some amazing effects.

00:39:49.292 --> 00:39:52.630
He was stacking two blocks and then after

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.180
a couple weeks on metformin
he was stacking 11 blocks,

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.170
and she put that on her Facebook.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.900
And then the next day
I had a slew of emails

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.650
from other mothers with two-year-old kids.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:08.233
And actually we've had
a group of, actually

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.270
this is nine kids here and we're seeing

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.490
some improvements in behavior.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.530
We looked at the developmental
testing on the Mullen

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.390
and compared it to the
developmental results

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.860
of those with fragile
X syndrome not treated

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.370
with metformin and it looked
like it boosted development

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.700
about twice of what you
would expect in fragile X.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.700
So we think it has some good effects.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.110
It's not a cure all.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.750
I just wanna point out that
usually there's IQ decline

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.540
in fragile X over the
years and it's because

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.050
they don't keep up with
abstract reasoning.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.210
So even though they don't lose skills,

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.700
their IQ over time will plateau faster

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.543
than the general population.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.470
We have this kid who had
the Prader Willi phenotype.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.720
We put him on Metformin.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.500
He went back to the normal percentiles

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.490
but he was on metformin two years

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:08.670
before he went into
puberty and then I saw him

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.230
when he was Tanner stage three

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.520
and his testicles were normal sized.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.750
For those of you who know
about a testicle increase

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.540
in fragile X, it really increases to

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.730
two to three times normal.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.430
So I thought well gosh,
at least at the end

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.420
of my career I'm curing
the macro orchidism

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.440
in fragile X.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.940
It's not a lot to be said for that

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.040
but I'd like to cure language.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.850
But then we've had a couple of adults here

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:37.610
who have really boosted their
IQ after a year on metformin.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.110
So we don't have all the
results of the controlled trial

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.240
on metformin, but we're
very hopeful it'll have

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.240
some significant language benefits

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.310
and maybe some cognitive benefits.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.760
So I just wanna talk about
some other new treatments

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.160
for fragile X and autism.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.343
The IGF1 analog, which is trofinetide,

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.870
it has been beneficial in fragile X

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.120
in a previous study that we did,

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.760
and it looks like it's very
beneficial in Rett syndrome.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.770
We maybe even starting
an IGF1 analog study

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.330
in Rett syndrome at the MIND Institute

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.803
in the near future.

00:42:20.178 --> 00:42:24.630
And there's gaboxadol that I talked about.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.720
We're re enrolling 13 to 22
year-olds with fragile X.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.290
It's a controlled trial.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.810
Cannabidiol or CBD, different from THC

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:39.650
or a tetrahydrocannabinol,
will likely be helpful

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.120
from anecdotal information that I have

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.460
from many families with
autism and fragile X syndrome

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.130
for the anxiety and the
tantrums and aggression

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.170
that can occur.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.460
And they get it from the marijuana stores

00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:00.460
but it synthesizes the CBD.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.810
So it's pure, it doesn't
have any THC in it

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.320
and the blood is negative for THC.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.483
So the FDA really likes this.

00:43:13.429 --> 00:43:16.880
And it's an ointment that
you rub on the shoulders

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.423
and use it twice a day.

00:43:18.423 --> 00:43:22.491
So we're in the midst of
that controlled trial now

00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:25.000
and they'll be enrolling this spring.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.530
And hopefully we'll have the results

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.563
in the very near future,
we hope by next year.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.900
They have done studies in Australia

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.250
and I'll show you that data.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.673
These are open label studies in Australia.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.920
Let me just, wait a second.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.730
I don't need to talk about epidiolex.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.160
But here's the zynerba
CBD studies in Australia

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.030
where each of these behavioral problems

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.490
from behavioral checklists
had significant benefit.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.810
But of course an open label
study is very different

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.000
from a controlled trial.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.350
So I'm not sure what we'll be seeing

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.250
with the controlled trial, but
I think it'll have benefit.

00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:11.190
I just wanna mention about bumetanide.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:15.940
That's been going on in a
study in Europe for autism.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.940
Bumetanide is a very old
diuretic and it is impacting

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.270
the GABA system early on.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.400
It's a diuretic and it can even be given

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.280
to one and two-year-olds.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.110
And I haven't had much experience.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.090
I've used it clinically.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.750
We don't have a controlled trial going now

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.230
but I think the people from France

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:41.530
who started Lemonet and Benare and others

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.610
who started the Bumetanide
trial for autism in Europe

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.510
want to get more studies going.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.020
They have a special liquid
preparation of bumetanide

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.620
but it does come in one
and two-milligram tablets.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.340
And I use it on a five-year-old,
very severely autistic kid

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.150
from actually Korea who was visiting me

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.563
and were just desperate.

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:08.310
And I got an email a month later, this is

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.550
an amazing drug and my kid is talking.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.250
So maybe we should use it more.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:15.690
So think about bumetanide.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.690
You have to look for calcium,
I'm sorry potassium deficiency

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.600
that sometimes can happen
with using a diuretic.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.530
So sometimes you have to
supplement the potassium levels

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.690
but anecdotally it seems to be quite good

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.690
and there's control data
from the European studies

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.130
that have been published,
at least two papers on this.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.823
So it's definitely something
we need to look at.

00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:43.180
Epidiolex, I'm not gonna get into.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.120
You can get CBD Gummies
that are 25 milligrams

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.873
per gummy on the internet.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.170
And when you go to the
marijuana stores though,

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:58.960
they have all kinds of different solutions

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.960
of CBD to THC 20 to one
and it's really hard

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.980
to sort out how many
milligrams are in some

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.370
of the (mumbles) preparations.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.870
But I think many of these
pure CBD preparations

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:16.703
are coming out.

00:46:16.703 --> 00:46:19.610
And I'm not so sure you
need to include THC.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.930
That seems to be the
anecdotal information around

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.260
that CBD won't work unless you have THC.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.230
But the data from
Zynerba on the open label

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.490
in Australia shows that that's
not necessarily the case.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.110
So I'd be happy to talk to anybody.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.330
And oxytocin nasal spray twice a day

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:42.330
and ASD, those with the lowest
pre treatment oxytocin levels

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.390
benefited the most on the
social reciprocity scale

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.190
in autism.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.060
So I think there will be
more use of the oxytocin

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.360
nasal spray, but I'm
not sure you can get it

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.839
by prescription yet,
and I haven't used it.

00:46:56.839 --> 00:47:01.839
I also like yoga and
mindfulness meditation.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.393
That really improves your GABA inhibition.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.780
This is a high-functioning fragile X guy

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.960
who does yoga every day and he says

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.880
that his life centers around it.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.750
And then also when we talk
about targeted treatments,

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.430
it's really important to think
about educational programs.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:26.170
David Hessel has some data
on CogMed intervention

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.000
for individuals with fragile X.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.300
Headsprout programs for
reading, AT devices,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.930
particularly for those
that are non verbal,

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.330
iPad applications.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.470
And this PILI intervention
of Parent Implemented

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.820
Language Intervention or even Sally Rogers

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.250
Early Start Denver model
of course is great,

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.830
and there's a paper out
a couple of months ago

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.360
showing it's great in individuals

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.700
with fragile X syndrome too, not just

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.543
in individuals with autism.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.750
So many great educational
and behavioral problems.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.990
So my time is up and I gotta stop.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:01.890
But I wanna thank many of the people

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.230
that we collaborate with not only

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.360
at the MIND Institute, but we have a lot

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.850
of international
collaborations in Indonesia,

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.850
Philippines where I'm going
tonight and Australia,

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:20.780
Canada, and we do just a
lot of international work

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.190
and thank you very much.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:25.357
(audience applauding)
