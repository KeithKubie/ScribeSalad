00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.540
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah, I'm going
to tell you a story, but

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.530
what I thought I'd start with
is a little puzzle.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.580
And then while people are
thinking about the puzzle,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.020
I'll tell you a little story,
one of the big legends of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.570
mathematics.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.920
And then we'll see what the
answer to the puzzle was.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.120
The puzzle is fairly
easy to state.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.570
I just want you to add up the
digits from 1 to 1 million.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.820
Now I want you to add
up all the digits--

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.360
if you imagine you've
wrote out the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.150
numbers 1 to 1 million.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.310
I want you to add up all the
digits, not the numbers.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.630
So if I want to say 123
plus 124, that's not

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.850
what I want to do.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.430
I want to add up all the digits
of those numbers, 1

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.160
plus 2 plus 3 plus
1 plus 2 plus 4.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.080
Imagine writing a list of all
the numbers from 1 to 1

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.210
million with all those digits,
and I want you to add up all

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.660
the digits.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.550
And what answer will you get?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.860
While you think about that, I'm
going to tell you one of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.110
these famous mathematical
stories.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.870
So this is the story of Gauss.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.230
Carl Gauss.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.830
Carl Gauss is possibly one of
the greatest mathematicians of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.210
the last few hundred years.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.020
He really is a really
large figure.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040
Now the story goes that when
he was nine, he started to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.750
attend, at school, his
arithmetic class.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.630
Now arithmetic class would
include lots of boys, all the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.520
way up to the age of 15.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.340
Imagine, right?

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.100
This is 1780 we're talking
about, a long time ago.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.390
Imagine it's a drab schoolroom,
and it's very

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.060
worn, and the floor
was uneven.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.640
And the teacher was also drab
and worn and uneven himself.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.160
Apparently he was
quite a bully.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.450
He would walk around with
his cane and he

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.320
would thrash the boys.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.480
Now one day, to keep
them quiet--

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.500
yeah, this'll keep 'em
quiet for an hour--

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.840
he gave them a problem--

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.410
to add up all the numbers
from 1 to 100.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.235
So add up all the numbers
from 1 to 100.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:10.240
So 1 plus 2 plus
3 plus 4 plus--

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.250
all the way up to 100.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.670
That was the problem
he gave the pupils.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.360
And they had to write on
slates in those days.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.360
And when you got the solution,
you would put your slate on

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.530
the teacher's table.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.810
Now Gauss, when he was given
this problem, immediately

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.760
threw his slate onto
the teacher's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.090
table with an answer.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.430
Now the other boys continued
their work, adding up all the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.810
numbers, multiplying and
adding and subtracting,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.700
whatever they had to do.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.000
This brute of a teacher strolled
around the classroom,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.730
throwing just pitying looks at
poor Gauss, this guessing the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.550
answer and throwing
it onto the table.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.020
When the hour was over, he
took the stack of slates,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.130
turned them over so that Gauss's
answer was on the top,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.630
and read out the answer.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.680
To his astonishment, he
got the answer right.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.090
The answer is 5,050.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.820
Which meant that Gauss was able
to solve it in seconds.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.850
How did he solve it?

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.820
Well, he had a trick.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.360
The trick was, he noticed
that if you add

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.670
the numbers in pairs--

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.760
I'm going to start with 1 and
I'm going to add it to 100.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.020
What you get is 101.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.570
Now if you take the second
number and add it to the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.320
second to last number,
99, you get 101.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.840
You take 3 and add it
to 98, you get 101.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.560
In fact, each pair that
you make in this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.980
way would equal 101.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.990
How many pairs do you make?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.150
Well, there's 100 there.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.470
50 pairs, you make.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.910
So he just took 101
and timesed it by

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.560
50, and he got 5,050.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.830
So this story was first written
about in an obituary

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.860
by one of Carl Gauss's
friends.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.810
Apparently, Carl Gauss would
tell this story himself.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.160
So it seems to be fairly true.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.950
Some embellishments over
the years have been the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.530
brutishness of this
teacher, with this

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.230
cane and his thrashing.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.870
That's been added onto
over the years.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.360
The problem I gave you about
adding the numbers 1 to 100,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.650
that's been added onto over
the years, as well.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.385
We don't know what the
original problem was.

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.200
So to finish our puzzle
now, maybe

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.930
you've got time to think.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.890
We're going to use this method
that, well, Gauss may have

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.050
used to solve his problem.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.170
But we were adding the numbers
1 to 1 million.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.090
But we weren't adding
the numbers.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.190
I threw in a twist.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.920
We were adding all the digits
of the numbers.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.210
So let's just write out
the numbers first.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.640
I'll start with 1.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.230
Then I'll have 2,
and 3, and 4.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.890
I'm going to skip a few.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.330
And then we'll go to the end.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Let's go to something like
999,995, 999,996--

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.880
getting there--

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.400
999,999.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.554
And let's have 1,000,000.

00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:11.530
There we go.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.150
Right.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.330
So we were going to add up
all the digits, though.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.680
Well, how about this?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.030
Let's just start with the 0.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.830
I'm going add on the 0.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.080
I didn't say that before,
but let's add on a 0

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.670
there at the front.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:30.866
If I use pairs, 0 paired
up with 999,999--

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:38.470
if you add those together, you
get this number, 999,999.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.390
If you try this pair, we get
the same answer, of course.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.440
And 2 plus this one.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.075
And do 3 and 999,996.

00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:54.250
And 4 with 999,995.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.910
And all those pairs equal
the same thing.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.460
Now if all those pairs equal the
same thing, we can now add

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.300
up these digits.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.240
And this gives me-- what
does this give?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.026
9 plus 9 plus 9 plus
9 plus 9 plus 9?

00:06:06.026 --> 00:06:07.655
54.

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:09.720
And how many pairs
have I made?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.500
Half a million.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.480
Times half a million.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.190
Which is equal to--

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.520
it's actually equal
to 27 million.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.310
So all the digits added up to 27
million, except I have left

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.440
out my 1,000,000 there.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.710
I didn't add that in
my pair, did I?

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.440
So let's add up up those
digits, too.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.720
That is 1.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.020
So we add that on.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.770
And so the answer is, adding
all the numbers--

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.230
all the digits of the numbers--
from 1 to 1 million

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:48.456
is 27,000,001, using
Gauss's trick.

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:51.080
MALE SPEAKER: Now at this point,
you can go wild, right?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.150
How many-- how many arrows
do you want?

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.540
So the next one, let's say we
did 3 to the power of, to the

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.785
power of, to the power--or
arrow, arrow, arrow, or

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.160
whatever you want
to call this.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.290
3--

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.540
well that, that--
