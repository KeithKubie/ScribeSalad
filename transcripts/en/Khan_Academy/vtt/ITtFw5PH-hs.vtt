00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:01.431
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.431 --> 00:00:04.741
in this video is get
some practice classifying

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.115
whether a random variable
is a binomial variable,

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.120
and we're gonna do it by
looking at a few exercises

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.518
from Khan Academy.

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:14.001
So this says a manager
oversees 11 female employees

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.863
and nine male employees.

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:17.810
They need to pick three of these employees

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.138
to go on a business trip,

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.759
so the manager places
all 20 names in a hat

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.456
and chooses at random.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.623
Let X equal the number of
female employees chosen.

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:31.316
So they're going to do three trials.

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:33.132
And on each of those trials,

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:36.634
you could say success is if
they pick a female employee.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:38.752
And then the random variable X is

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:41.578
the number of females out of those three.

00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:42.991
Is X a binomial variable?

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.305
Why or why not?

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:45.237
So pause this video,

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:47.582
and see if you can work
through this on your own.

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.119
All right, now let's
go through each choice.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.702
Choice A says each trial
isn't being classified

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:55.458
as a success or failure, so
X is not a binomial variable.

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:56.554
I disagree with this.

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:59.737
Each trial is being classified
as a success or failure.

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:01.507
It's either going to be female or not.

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:05.027
And since we're counting the
number of female employees,

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:08.183
if in a trial, we pick a
female, that would be a success,

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:11.260
so each trial is being classified
as a success or failure.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.486
So this one over here isn't true.

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.426
There is no fixed number of trials,

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.316
so X is not a binomial variable.

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:18.602
There is a fixed number of trials.

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:19.654
They're doing three trials.

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:23.780
They're picking three names out of a hat.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.649
The trials are not independent,

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.493
so X is not a binomial variable.

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.304
So this is interesting.

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:33.341
So, for example, trial one,

00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.174
what's the probability of success?

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:40.969
Well, there are 20 employees,
20 names in the hat,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.736
and 11 of the outcomes would be success,

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.236
so you have 11/20 probability of success.

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:48.653
But in trial two,

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.121
what's the probability of success

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.527
given success,

00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:00.381
success in, I'll say trial one, T one?

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:03.823
Well, if you succeeded in trial one,

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:07.911
that means that there's now
only 10 female names in the hat

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:08.744
out of 19.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:13.997
And if you don't have
success in trial one,

00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:16.104
then it'll be 11 out of 19.

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:19.629
So your probability does change
based on previous outcomes.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.773
And so the trials are not independent,

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:24.714
and so X is not a binomial variable.

00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:26.062
So this one is true.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.765
The trials are not independent,

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.205
so that violates that condition

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:30.520
for being a binomial variable.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.540
In order to be a binomial variable,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.304
all your trials have to be
independent of each other.

00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:38.276
And so we'd rule this last one out

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:39.783
because this last one says that

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:43.264
X has a binomial distribution
or is or does meet

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:46.988
all the conditions for
being a binomial variable.

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:49.071
Let's do another example.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.535
So here we have different scenarios,

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:57.559
and I have the conditions

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.266
for a binomial variable
written right over here.

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.062
And so once again, pause the video,

00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:04.518
and look at each of these
scenarios for random variables.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.687
And look at these conditions,

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:08.355
and think about whether these

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.844
random variables are binomial or not.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:12.766
So let's look at the first one.

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.378
In a game involving a standard
deck of 52 playing cards,

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:19.185
an individual randomly draws seven cards

00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:21.260
without replacement.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.796
Let Y be equal to the
number of aces drawn.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.228
Well, in our introductory
video to binomial variables,

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:30.066
we talked about, if we're
doing without replacement,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.899
your probability of getting an ace

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.183
on a given trial,

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:39.491
where a trial is you're
taking a card out of the deck,

00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.758
it's going to be dependent

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:43.261
on whether you got aces
in previous trials.

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.913
Because if you got an
ace in a previous trial,

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:45.746
well, that ace,

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.597
then you're gonna have
fewer aces in the deck.

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:51.876
So the trials, in this
case, are not independent,

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.209
not independent,

00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:58.722
not independent trials.

00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:00.194
Now, on the other hand,

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:03.252
if on every trial you looked
at whatever card you got

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:05.101
and put it back in the deck,

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.801
then they would be independent trials.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:08.982
The probability of getting an ace

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.635
on each trial would be the same,

00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:12.768
but not when you have without replacement.

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:13.601
So this is

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.353
not binomial right over here

00:04:17.353 --> 00:04:21.413
because you don't have independent trials.

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:22.714
The second scenario,

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:26.583
60% of a certain species of tomato

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:29.994
live after transplanting
from pot to garden.

00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:33.318
Eli transplants 16 of these tomato plants.

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:36.197
Assume that the plants live
independently of each other.

00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:37.829
So whether one plant lives isn't dependent

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.308
on whether another plant lives.

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:43.408
Let T equal the number of
tomato plants that live.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.005
All right, so let's
look at the conditions.

00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:47.205
The outcome of each
trial can be classified

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:49.411
as either success or failure.

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.462
So each trial over here is
one of the tomato plants,

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:54.104
and we have 16 of those trials.

00:04:54.104 --> 00:04:56.418
And success is if the tomato plant lives,

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:58.306
and failure is if it dies.

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:00.697
So we have either success or failure.

00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:02.815
Each trial is independent of the others.

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:05.279
They tell us, the plants live
independently of each other.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.762
So whether or not a neighboring
plants lives or dies

00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:10.694
doesn't affect whether the
plant next to it lives or dies.

00:05:10.694 --> 00:05:13.116
So each trial is
independent of the others.

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:14.511
There is a fixed number of trials.

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:17.196
Yes, we have 16 right over there.

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:21.180
The probability p of success
on each trial remains constant.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.087
Well, yeah, according to
at least the scenario,

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:24.897
they're saying that we have a 60% chance

00:05:24.897 --> 00:05:28.113
for each tomato plant,
which is each trial.

00:05:28.113 --> 00:05:30.830
So it meets all of the
conditions right over here,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.830
so this one is binomial.

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:36.142
Now let's look at this third scenario.

00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:39.991
In a game of luck, a turn
consists of a player continuing

00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:42.897
to roll a pair of six-sided die

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.957
until they roll a double,

00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.057
two of the same face values.

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:49.798
Let X equal the number
of rolls in one turn.

00:05:49.798 --> 00:05:52.716
So you're gonna keep rolling
until they roll a double.

00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.058
Well, the thing that jumps out at me is

00:05:54.058 --> 00:05:56.742
that you don't have a
fixed number of trials,

00:05:56.742 --> 00:05:57.575
not fixed

00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:01.459
number of trials.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.068
You could say each trial,
each roll is a trial.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.082
Success is getting a double,
which has a fixed probability.

00:06:08.082 --> 00:06:10.526
Whether or not you get
a double on each trial

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:12.862
is gonna be independent
of the previous roll.

00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:14.354
So it meets all the other constraints,

00:06:14.354 --> 00:06:16.819
but it does not meet that
there's a fixed number of trials.

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.279
You're gonna keep, someone,

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.390
there's some chance you might have to roll

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.140
20 times or 200 times

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.137
or who knows however many
times until they roll a double.

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:32.581
And so this violates there
is a fixed number of trials.

00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:34.884
So since there is not a
fixed number of trials,

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:37.384
this variable X, not binomial.
