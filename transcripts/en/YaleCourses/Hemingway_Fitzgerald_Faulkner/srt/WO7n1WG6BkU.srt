1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,070
Last time on Tuesday, we
was talking about, um,

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,000
the use of the word Nigger,
uh, by various people.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm in contact sometimes, uh,
trying to be a true realizing,

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,860
um, sometimes obviously agonized by
trying to the do this guy's have fact.

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,420
Uh, but uh, sometimes by one's
neighbors, sometimes by oneself,

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,460
but, um, always, uh, in the
kind is nontrivial usage.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,630
Um,

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,630
so today we're turning to the other side
of the phenomenon and thinking about

9
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,850
what it means to inhabit
that adjective Negro,

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,450
whether it means to embrace
that as once identity.

11
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,480
So, um, the, a list of Joel Christmas,

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,190
part of the story of light in August,
um,

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
is really about what it means for
somebody to choose to be black race.

14
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,840
So it's very important to recognize
that this is a volitional act,

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,070
is a decision, active
conscious decision. Um,

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,730
but in that sense is also
about someone poise. Um,

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
onto contrary possibilities
don't Christmas could be
either black or he could be

18
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,140
like,

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,140
so the either or a possibility is
something that actually becomes quite

20
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,270
important in American literature.
The side of the farmer.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,890
So I just wanted to talk about
one other word published,

22
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:40,440
very close to like an honors
plant, never last. And, um,

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,280
as we can see now lost in
herself in someone, uh,

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,310
who could go either way. Um,
it's just classified as, um,

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
African American because
of the one drop rule.

26
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:57,240
So if you have the slightest bit of
African American heritage of classified as

27
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:01,170
black, so the black raider,
um, but she, you know,

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,860
really could be anything.
Um,

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,320
and in fact sheet there's no clear
and after I'm in mid career, um,

30
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,420
and just completely vanish from
public and until she was fun there.

31
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,930
And, um, there was a lot of the,

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,510
is that actually as she was
passing on those years, uh,

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,970
when she disappeared and
she wrote the novel, uh,

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
calm housing about two black women,

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,700
one Tuesday to be married to
someone who is identified with,

36
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:31,530
are black and the others using
to pass as a white woman.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,190
But I'm not succeeding
at this, not being, uh,

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,500
very happy with that
decision. Um, so passing, um,

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,920
this was publishing in putting us are
very close to let an artist and um,

40
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,050
in, as we can see from the book cover is
really about the choice of someone who

41
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,230
looks completely wait,

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,390
who is classify as black,

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,630
but who chooses to behave as a white
person live the life of a white person.

44
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,980
So, um, in fall,

45
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,990
no in one way see is
also a kind of passing.

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
So let's not forget that Ashley is very
much similar to the dynamics and Ella

47
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,750
Lawson's passing.
It is someone,

48
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,810
a man who looks as white as the woman
here who actually is initially classified

49
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,410
as white but then chooses in spite of his
outward appearance to embrace the life

50
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,290
of black men.
So it is

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,130
passing into the opposite direction.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,020
It is self blackening or white
person blackening himself.

53
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,330
There's no way you can,
and there's interior,

54
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,020
but at least he can try to black and
black and his inside try to black and his

55
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:59,890
emotions, his choice of
companions and all the rest of it.

56
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,310
So this is what Joe
Christmas decides to do. Um,

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
when he starts on this run down this
long street that goes from the south to

58
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:14,410
Chicago, um, to the north
and analysts for 15 years,

59
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,120
he was on this street.
Um,

60
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,780
and that's what happens to him when
he's on this 15 year long street.

61
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,550
He lived with me, Bruce shunning
white people. He eat with them,

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,440
slapped with them, belligerent,
unpredictable, uncommunicative.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,280
He now lives as man and wife with a
woman who is assembled and Emily coughing

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,500
and they'd, he would lie in bed beside
her sleepers beginning to breathe.

65
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,500
Do you and how he would do it.

66
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,501
Deliberately feeling even watching is
what chess arched deeper and deeper within

67
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,530
this room cage trying
to breathe into himself,

68
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:58,531
the dark order to dark and inscrutable
thinking and being of Negroes with each

69
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:05,291
sort of Spiration separation and trying
to expel from himself the way blood and

70
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:10,831
the way thinking and being and all
the while his nostrils at the older,

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
when she was trying to make his own
with waiting and taught Watson is whole

72
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:22,861
being arrive and the string with
physical outreach as spiritual deny.

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,650
So this is an incredible
in a status of self black.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,520
Some of the group doesn't
have to be black to the,

75
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,890
against every thing in him has sends
us from our sense of sight and sense of

76
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,860
touch.
Everything again is everything in him.

77
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,200
Even though every endothelium
is revolving, again,

78
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,290
it's being classified and as
black and associating with blacks,

79
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,330
that's what he chooses to do. So it
was a very, very complicated, um,

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,630
kind of psychology. Usually when
somebody identifies with someone who's,

81
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,170
they're not usually obviously identified
with us because they believe like that

82
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:06,830
identity,

83
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,830
but in this case is absolute though
than of being black and at the same time

84
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,970
deciding to be black and stuff.

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,390
So this is a much more complex
psychology that we've seen in this novel.

86
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,840
And I think to understand this,
um,

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I think we need to borrow the terminology
from someone who talks about what it

88
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:32,770
costs double consciousness
services. Um, uh,

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
W e B Dubois, um, um,
very important thinker.

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm an activists from
the 19th century to 20th.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,030
It's a bit 20th century.
Um,

92
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,240
and he wrote a book called
the souls of black folk,

93
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,340
which you as probably heard of, um, came
up by the wall before light in August.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,370
And um,
this is what he says about blacks.

95
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,170
Let's not forget he's talking about
blacks, people who love black. Um,

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,640
this is what he's asked about the kind
of complicated consciousness of the

97
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:08,090
blacks have.
It is the peculiar sensation,

98
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,010
this double consciousness,

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,520
this sense of always looking at
oneself through the eyes of others,

100
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,300
of measuring one.

101
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,860
So by the tape of the world
that those on in the news,

102
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:26,861
content and pity when I'm with
fuse is tumors and American,

103
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,710
a Negro, two souls, two thoughts,

104
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,100
two unreconciled strivings two
warring ideas in one dark body.

105
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,010
So, um, this is this, keep
looking at this person.

106
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,510
A person who looks black has no choice
but to inhabit this double consciousness,

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,750
both to be aware of oneself as oneself,
you know,

108
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,050
having a completely internal
relation to oneself,

109
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,470
but at the same time having another views
superimposed upon oneself because of

110
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:06,290
the way other people are looking at you.

111
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,680
So it is this doubleness one is looking
at one through and supplies and then in

112
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,890
voluntarily through the
eyes of other people.

113
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,710
But we shouldn't forget that in fact,

114
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,990
Joe Christmas doesn't
look like the black one.

115
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,590
He looks like the male counterpart
to this white looking woman.

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,600
So is even more complicated than
what two boys is suggesting.

117
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:34,430
It's not the double consciousness
of an obviously black man,

118
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,620
but the double consciousness of a white
looking person who even though he's

119
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,450
really pow, but blackness
nonetheless embraces blackbirds.

120
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,950
So it is just, you know, it's, it's,

121
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,320
it's double consciousness redoubled um,
in,

122
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,780
in terms of this degree of complexity.
Um,

123
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,260
and today I like to talk about
this kind of readable, double,

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,910
double consciousness. The involvement, um,

125
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,150
along three last January.

126
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,690
One is obviously the importance
of the light and shadow,

127
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,730
which is advertised strong
ties in the title. Um,

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,450
the other is something that
we've sort of been talking about,

129
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:17,740
which is the relation between at a single
individual and then the population of

130
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,280
a group or motors here today.
That's what I like to introduce. Um,

131
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,140
and then something that
we've been talking about. Um,

132
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,620
all the way through about the question
John [inaudible] and whether the,

133
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,540
the dynamics between comedy and tragedy.
Um,

134
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,410
but let's start with also, um, given this,

135
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,460
this configuration, um, I like
to look at three characters,

136
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,930
basically the two ends of the spectrum.
And then the point, um, I think that,

137
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,311
you know,

138
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:51,120
is to answer the spectrum would be would
be Joel prisoners and Lehman Grove. Um,

139
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,360
one tragic figure in the comic figure.
Um,

140
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,710
and between the two of them I like to put
now the furthest they go with just the

141
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,310
reverend hightower.
Um,

142
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,780
we've been talking about the revenant
and hire talent in various contexts,

143
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:08,781
but I like to bring him to bear now on
the two obvious protagonists of light in

144
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,630
August. Um, but first styling
with Joe Christmas, um,

145
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,570
like to talk about three moments,
actually more than three,

146
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,170
but three clusters and moments, um, uh,

147
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,830
revolving around the APP.
A striking match is so the,

148
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:31,050
so obviously a pattern,
the symbolic pattern, uh,

149
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,100
revolving around that act that I think
is really worth thinking about the three

150
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,390
of them in sequence and
in the interrelations. Um,

151
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,190
so the first instance of strike,
striking or manage is,

152
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,800
um, is when he's contemplating,
um, killing Joanna.

153
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,140
So Christmas lit the cigarette and
snapped the match to what the open door

154
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,100
watching the flame vanish in there.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,620
Then he was listening for
the night trivial sound,

156
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,710
which their match with me
when they struck the floor.

157
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,470
And then this theme to
him that he heard it.

158
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Then his thing to him studying on the
card in a dark room that he was hearing.

159
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,660
And myriad sounds of no
greater volume of voices,

160
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,910
murmurs,
whispers of trees,

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,950
darkness of people,

162
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,550
his own voice other than is evocative of
names and times and places which he had

163
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,491
been conscious of his life without
knowing which worries life thinking God

164
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,240
and me not knowing that too,

165
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,320
he could see it like a blended sentence,

166
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,110
foodborne and really debt.

167
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,250
God loves me to let the
feeling and whether my owners
of last year's billboard,

168
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,930
God,
me too.

169
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,200
So it isn't just an incredible acid.
Um,

170
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,940
and I just want to say some obvious things
about it and then come back to it. Um,

171
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,880
but this, the striking of the match
and then the dying out of the match.

172
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,850
So literally the light dying up.

173
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,780
But well there's also an interesting
is that Ashley is the light guys out.

174
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,700
Then it becomes a completely
all the tree, um, moment.

175
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,210
Um, is all about the
sounds that come to, um,

176
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,860
to Joe prisoners out of worries
is, is he hears it, the light,

177
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,650
the visual,
um,

178
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,780
tableau completely gives
away to an arbitrary the
soundscape bits of questions.

179
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,870
Um,

180
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,870
and then there's this weird kind
of emergence of the kind of,

181
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,270
um, his own theology. Right. You know,

182
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:54,040
we've been talking about importance
of Calvin, um, last time,

183
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,220
um, and the play at the repetition of
the name Calvin in light in August. Um,

184
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,831
and hear this,

185
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:04,831
this obvious and vocation of his relation
to God and what it means to repeat

186
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:10,690
that line. Lanka, those me
too. So just want to point
out is obvious things, but uh,

187
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,080
because this is the last class, um, I
thought that, you know, would be good to,

188
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,680
to bring back some other one. The
other two others. So just to, um,

189
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,140
the obvious detail,

190
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,970
I've gone appearing on the bill of
what we actually have seen exactly this

191
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,730
before and the great
gas bed. Um, and I said,

192
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:32,100
God knows what you've been doing.
Everything you've been doing this is, um,

193
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,820
uh, um, make them, as I'm
talking to George Wilson,

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,250
Mattos a husband,
I'm standing behind the,

195
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:47,251
and you make a mistake with a shock that
he was looking at the eyes of the after

196
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,160
Tj at cover,

197
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,570
which had just emerged pale and
enormous from us and solving made.

198
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,150
So as George Wilson at the moment,

199
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:02,640
when he is on his starting out
on this quest to kill the killer,

200
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,480
what do you think the person who
needs things kills is why? Um,

201
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,540
and pointing to this God on the
billboard as the authority in that.

202
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,380
Alrighty. Um, to justify his, the
mission that's just beginning.

203
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,970
Um, the, the other way in which
fixture will also come into play.

204
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:25,690
It's obvious later dinette links
between the visual and the auditory.

205
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,580
So this you talked about before
about the essence voice for a moment,

206
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,620
but last sunshine fell with romantic
affection upon a gluing fares.

207
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,600
Who've always compelled me. Four with
breakfast. Lee as I listen, and a girl,

208
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,110
the ish like discerning,
heard with, lingering regret,

209
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,580
my children leaving a pleasant street
at that rate. So it's quality of voice.

210
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,980
Describe in terms of the visual image.

211
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,040
And finally the great Gatsby and the great
self made man in American literature,

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,950
but describe by Fitzgerald as
a quasi religious stuff making.

213
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,220
The truth was that Jay Gaspe of worst
eight long island sprang from his platonic

214
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:14,240
conception of himself. He
was a son of God, a phrase,

215
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,360
which if it means anything,
it means just that the,

216
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,090
he must be about his father's business,

217
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,920
the servers of a vast
vulgar [inaudible] building.

218
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,030
So he invented himself,

219
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,090
just the sort of Jay Gatsby for the 17
year old boy would be likely to invent.

220
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,600
And to this conception, he
was faithful to it. Now.

221
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,120
So it is very hard to ignore the central
reality of religion in both the great

222
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:44,660
Gatsby and, and light innocuous. Um,

223
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,250
and the case of the great Gatsby.
Um,

224
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,300
the religious language is really used
to underwrite the special kind of stuff

225
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,180
making and what it means
to be the son of God, um,

226
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,300
in the 20th century and in
the base of environment. Um,

227
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,300
and that's the kind of some
of making that, um, that,

228
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,420
that their first was talking a relatively
non racialized even though we're,

229
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,240
that there's a little bit of
race in the Great Gatsby as well.

230
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,140
So against that, that, uh,

231
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,310
example of Fitzgerald, this
is the one more time, um,

232
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,980
at what farmer is doing with exactly
that configuration, that billboard,

233
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,140
the interplay between the visual and
auditory and some in vocation of God.

234
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,370
Um,
it seems that when the light dies out,

235
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,490
when we saw the only relation to
life is by way of a death match,

236
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,710
right?
That meshed.

237
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,770
And then if it hits the ground and then
the light goes out completely and it's,

238
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,440
that we get is all the sounds,

239
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,900
then come to Dr. Smith and he becomes an
involuntary strictly passive recipient

240
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,290
of Sam's.

241
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:08,291
I come to him and that really is the
central function of Joel Christmas with

242
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,613
Todd [inaudible].

243
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,890
We've talked before about how passive
he is that his school as an actor,

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,480
then a recipient of either the goodwill
or in this case the ill will come in

245
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:25,440
from other people. Um, so he
really is a blank slate, um,

246
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,840
that on wish other people,
the entire community, um,

247
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,130
can write the collective signature.
Um,

248
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,340
he really is the bearer of,

249
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,990
it's not a very good mellophone concerning
that we're looking at and monitoring

250
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,790
image, but just the switch
to visual image briefly.

251
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,390
Um, here's the bearer of the collectors,
the nature of that community.

252
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,690
So the transition from light to darkness
in this moment and the transition from,

253
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,180
uh,

254
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,180
from the input coming into the eye and
the [inaudible] ear is the increasing or

255
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,230
the dramatized positivity
of Joel prisoners. The,

256
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:15,231
he's really completely a blind patient
that everyone else writes the ds onto.

257
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,150
But there's this further complication
because this is a racialized landscape.

258
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,270
It seems to give us a racialize version
of a Calvinist theology that we talking

259
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,680
about last time. So just wonder,
think about what it means that, okay,

260
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:39,090
the first item of size, um, costume,

261
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,210
worst God perhaps been here,
not doing that too.

262
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,460
And then God loves me to repeat it twice.

263
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,270
It's almost as if the only thing George
Christmas is true about is that God

264
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,010
loves other people. That is an
undisputed statement, right?

265
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,780
So God loves other people,
maybe got lost, everyone else,

266
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,350
maybe he lost me too.

267
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,600
So they can be more devastating.
Um,

268
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,680
self reflection or speculation about,
uh,

269
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,770
yourself is that every hour,
everyone hours come before you.

270
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,800
You basically you are an after thought
and maybe not even an afterthought in gas

271
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,320
mine.
Um,

272
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,380
and even if it is an after thought it
was written on gas consciousness is

273
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:39,390
written like this, those failure
than weather leathers of last year's,

274
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,770
they overboard, um, that
you're that unimportant,

275
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,380
that negligible to God.
So it definitely is a,

276
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,970
um, interesting, uh,

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,020
racialized variation on predestination.
So just,

278
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,280
it's worth going back to Calvin for
that reason and see why and actually who

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:04,281
lands itself so readily to this particular
negative kind of revitalization.

280
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,110
Uh, last time we talked
about original sin. So,

281
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,670
and so this is another very famous

282
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,710
statement coming from Calvin
on predestination. Um,

283
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,710
and you know this nobody more up front
than Calvin about predestination of what

284
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:27,690
it means by eternal and immutable counsel.

285
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,170
God has ones for or determine those who
he would admit to salvation and those

286
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:40,311
whom he would condemn to destruction
to those who hate the Vost,

287
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,710
to condemnation the gate of how the
game of life is close by Justin.

288
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,890
And we rent, rent, EU reprehensible,

289
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,070
but in comprehensible Joshlynn.

290
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,810
So the game of life is close by just,

291
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,200
and you reprehensible in
comprehensible judgment.

292
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:09,160
There's no way you can quarrel with God
is his decision.

293
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,980
He decides that you are
going to be condemned. Um,

294
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,130
it doesn't make any sense to you.
Basically, if you are the condemn, um,

295
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,650
you can make any sense of it
is completely incomprehensible.

296
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,940
But at the same time,

297
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,230
if you'll Calvin is you also have to
believe that it is a reprehensible,

298
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,720
that God has every right to condemn you,

299
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,930
even though it's from your point of view,
it seems completely arbitrary.

300
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,350
So that really is the
meaning of predestination in
particular interpretation of

301
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,714
a rage,

302
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,810
racialized context is that to be black
is to be predestined in that particular

303
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,070
ways.

304
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,070
Always to comes that always to be an
after thought and maybe even less than an

305
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,480
afterthought in the mind of God.

306
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,990
And that is what Joe Fritz
was metaphorically as well
as pragmatically chooses

307
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:05,500
to give him his own sense of
being so negligible in the world.

308
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,061
Um,
so you know,

309
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,680
that that would be one interpretation
of why he chooses to black and himself,

310
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,840
even though he doesn't have to.
Um,

311
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,230
so this is thoughtless version
of predestination itself.

312
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:20,060
Black names of white looking man.
Um,

313
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,440
it completely honors
the logic of the gate,

314
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:28,480
the flight being closed by just an
you reprehensible, but incompetence,

315
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,390
judgment and it's always
under the shadow of race.

316
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:37,360
So I would say that the pod of light
in August that is associated with Joe

317
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,500
Christmas, it's very much the regime of
shadows. Um, and thoughtfulness. Bachelor,

318
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,780
quite heavy handed about
how often in, you know, the,

319
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,890
we've said the original title I
was nine in August was dog house.

320
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,120
It can also be the shadows
of augers because so much
of the book is really about

321
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:59,380
shadows. So, um, and the
shadows tend to emerge,

322
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,960
um,
in the context of striking a match.

323
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:04,900
So let's go onto the next moment.

324
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,930
That's next episode of Joe Christmas
striking [inaudible] turning on the,

325
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,720
um, lighting aware. Um,

326
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,210
this is the moment after the,

327
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,240
the dialogue that we've looked at last
time of Joanna offering to send him into

328
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,300
a black to stand with a black lawyer
and turning over our funds to him. Um,

329
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,890
and then the next thing that she asked
him to do is to kneel with her and pray.

330
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,470
So this is all in that context.
Like the land.

331
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:38,880
She said it won't need an invite.
He said like the man,

332
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,350
no,
he said he's too for the bed.

333
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,450
He held him razor in his head,

334
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,460
but it was not open yet,
but she did not speak again.

335
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,910
And then his body seem to walk away from
him if when to the table and his hands

336
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,840
late, the racer on the table
and found blam as match.

337
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,340
So very heavy handed.

338
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,670
An alienation of Joe Christmas
from his bar, the rate,

339
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,550
it's not jog Christmas
that's doing the walking,

340
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,600
his body seem to walk away from him.

341
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,570
It's not Joe Christmas who was uh,

342
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,220
laying the razor on the table as his
hands that was doing it and his hands that

343
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,340
is striking the right the lamb.
So it's just uh,

344
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,760
the ash and kind of the strictly just
from the front man of barley part and the

345
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,784
consequence.

346
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,740
So just highlighting the other passively
of dog business themselves and serves

347
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,660
individual front mounted bypass health
agency but not dope business as a whole.

348
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,153
Um,

349
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,810
the consequence of the
lighting this lab is this,

350
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,890
this is what we see when
the land is that um,

351
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,950
he had today's see something
else that casts a shadow on warp.

352
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,880
It held an all star single action cap
and ball revolver almost as long and

353
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:05,840
heavier than the small rival.

354
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,500
But the shadow of it and off her arm and
hand on the wall did not waver at all.

355
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,000
The shadow of both monsters,
the car hammer,

356
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,820
monstrous back haute and
viciously boys like arch,

357
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,780
head of the snake. It in that way for
them. And their eyes do not waver.

358
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,580
Ally there were as still as the round
black ring of the pistol muscle,

359
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,170
there was no heat and no theory,
but he was not watching them.

360
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,080
He was watching the shadow
pistol on the while.

361
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,520
He was watching the cock shadow
of her hand slipped away.

362
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:47,000
I mean it's almost as if it's irrelevant,
it's actually coming up.

363
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,030
The most important thing is
the play of that shadow on war.

364
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:54,170
But we don't do know that the shadow
is produced by that revolver. Um,

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,590
but here we have actually
the symmetry of weaponry.

366
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,220
So geography is come fully equipped.

367
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:04,290
He has the razor in his head even though,
um,

368
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,370
is not open and Joanna has to revolve and
are ready and she thinks that is ready

369
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,910
to go.
And that's what Joe Christmas is seeing.

370
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,911
So this is the outcome of that particular
relationship that is completely under

371
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:27,281
the shadow raised [inaudible] with
and they are with Nivo or Negro League

372
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,200
reliever.
Um,

373
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,980
bad relationship is completely
under the shadow of race.

374
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:38,930
So this is actually the earliest moment
which talks about race and it's a curse

375
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,190
as an internal course,
as the equivalent of predestination.

376
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,370
But after that last thing, to see
them for the first time novice people,

377
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,840
but as a thing,

378
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,730
a shadow in which I live with
all white people or other people,

379
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,260
I thought with all the children coming
forever and never run into the wall white

380
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,210
with a black shadow already falling
upon them before they drew a graph.

381
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,540
And I seem to see the black
shadow in the shape of a cross.

382
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,780
I'm not even going to read you
the whole thing you guys remember,

383
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:12,750
this message is very much the vocation,

384
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,720
the black shadow as the modern
incarnation of the Calvin,

385
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:22,660
this doctrine of original sin and
occurs the falls upon you, uh,

386
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,890
before you were even born,
before when you were a baby,

387
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,210
before you've done anything,
even before you won,

388
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,310
when you're in your mother's womb, that
shadow of Israeli fall into the party.

389
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,320
So it's a very,
very extreme version of count.

390
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,570
The carbon is the allergy and bright.
Here.

391
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,571
We also see it not only as theology but
as dramatic action as the shadow of that

392
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,100
historical, um, on the wall.
And we now know the, the final,

393
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,070
uh, moment of striking to
Christmas striking badge.

394
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,770
Um,

395
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,770
then he paused and he struck a match
and examine the pistol in the puny dying

396
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:04,280
glare,
the match burned.

397
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,730
And whether they still seem to see
the Asian thing with is too low.

398
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:11,190
The chambers,

399
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,350
the one upon which they have
or haven't really fallen in,

400
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,360
which had not exploded the other upon
wish no hammer had fallen further behind,

401
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,660
which I hammer had been
planned for for her.

402
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,661
And from the is that his arm came back
and through your hurt the pistol crash

403
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,930
once through the undergrowth,
then there was no sound again for her.

404
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,823
And for me.

405
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,350
So this is the basically the
tragic and a Latin artist.

406
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,060
There's no denying the
importance of tragedy, uh,

407
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,930
and is, uh, is, you know,

408
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,480
it depends on how much weight
we assigned to the job.

409
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:58,080
Trismus and to put that in
the section of the novel. Um,

410
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,970
if we were to give primacy
to that session, then the,

411
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,470
the cemetery of weapon as
the razor and the pistol, um,

412
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,150
than the boat,
the boat chambers loaded into pistol,

413
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,990
that she really means, uh, for
the two of them to die together.

414
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,310
This is the appropriate
for a tragic narrative,

415
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,000
even though Christmas doesn't
die from that. Uh, nonetheless,

416
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,590
the stage is really sad for
that particular tragic outcome.

417
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,620
Um, so there's really not
a whole lot more, you know,

418
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,360
it couldn't be any other outcome.
There could be no,

419
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,640
no other ending, uh, for
children's and Joanna,

420
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,500
either one of them would have to die with
the two of them would have to die. Um,

421
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,970
but there's really no other thought and
can't really think of any other ending

422
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:52,120
for the two of them. Um, so let's,

423
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,720
but thank God they're not the
only ones in light in August.

424
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,270
So we're beginning to move,
um,

425
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,310
to somewhat to the other side was
the other side of the spectrum. Um,

426
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,060
and,
uh,

427
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,330
actually a very interesting transitional
figure about someone who's at mid

428
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,350
midpoint between Joe Prisoners and
leader growth is high tower. Um,

429
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,260
and um, the as the, the, the
image of the light and shadow, um,

430
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,300
and the kind of contest between light and
shadow is also the visual landscape in

431
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:27,260
which hightower is situated.
Um,

432
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,850
so this is the moment when baron bunch,
um,

433
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,370
and enjoy Christmas grandparents at
this point we used to pay related,

434
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,010
um, but, but basically Byron Bunch, um,

435
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,040
go into hightower and begging him to
tell a lie so that Joe Christmas can have

436
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:51,280
an alibi. So bar inside is really
your word again as Joel grounds,

437
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,180
if you would just say that
he was with you that night,

438
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,260
that will be better, stronger evidence
than a, and then coming home from jail,

439
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,094
Bruh.

440
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,100
So high pug could have told a lie
and the lynching would have happened,

441
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,390
but this is what he does because now
like how is shouting I won't do it.

442
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,251
I won't.

443
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,960
With his hands raised and clench
his face when his lived through,

444
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,430
lifted.

445
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,430
The pan is cleansed and rotting teeth
from about which the sagging of flabby and

446
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,050
Publico Flash Fos away.
Suddenly his voice rises high again.

447
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,290
Get out of these screams, get
out of my house, go my house.

448
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,630
Now he falls forward onto the desk,

449
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:38,110
his face between his expanded
arms and his claimed.

450
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,820
This fits as to two people
moving ahead of him.

451
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:44,350
Baron looks back from the door,

452
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:49,351
he sees that hightower has not moved his
ball head and has expanded and clenched

453
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:55,311
fist of arms while I four in the
pool of light from the shaded plan.

454
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,280
Um,

455
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
so this particular visual image suggests
that hightower's completely poise

456
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:06,130
between Biden Shadow, um, this light,

457
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,220
but it's coming from the shaded lab and
he's given an opportunity actually to do

458
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:15,490
something significant in well
to have saved two Christmas.

459
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,570
We'll have been a significant decrease
in the life for some of you actually has

460
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:23,470
not done a lot of significant
things. Um, you know,

461
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,670
does it very, his life could have
been much more consequential.

462
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,880
And in fact, it hasn't been all
that consideration. So Sally,

463
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,470
Joe Christmas would have been
a consequential action. Um,

464
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,980
but hide hell just cannot bring himself
to do with all kinds of reasons.

465
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:44,960
So we can speculate why
he chooses not to do it,

466
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:49,961
but that is the moment when his voice
is very high as befitting his name,

467
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:51,834
the high tower.

468
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,220
But what the very highs voice is doing
is turning away this opportunity.

469
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,380
I think all of us will have different
decisions whether or not to lie that over.

470
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
His decision is not alive and to allow
the violence to erupt as everyone can see

471
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:11,600
that it's about to. Um,
but this is not the,

472
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,980
so this is the moment when his sort
of 'em in the satellite from the ship,

473
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,730
poor machine, wham. But this, um,

474
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,760
and another possibility for height,
how that comes.

475
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:25,460
Actually we five page after that.
Um,

476
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
so far that actually I will say is quite
gentle towards high tower in terms of

477
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,780
the final place, um, given to him, um,

478
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,910
in the story in the novel.
Um,

479
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,470
so we know that once before hightower
how tried with deliver the baby. Right?

480
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:47,471
So like we have a black woman and he
spit the doctors most common Dr Raj to

481
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,620
banks who hide out the lose
the baby and the baby is dead.

482
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,190
And then the rumors go around the
town that the baby is his. So, so, uh,

483
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,320
it turns out that he actually gets
a second chance to deliver a baby.

484
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,990
Of course we know whose baby it is,
um,

485
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,940
but he gets to deliver the baby because
the doctor also arrived too late the

486
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:08,900
second time.

487
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,240
So the doctor arrived too late this time.
Also,

488
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Byron had to wait for him to dress virals
Santa fast adopter Barron than to wait

489
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:21,421
for him to dress.

490
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:26,390
He was an oldish man now and Farsi and
somewhat disgruntled and having been

491
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,710
awaken at this hour.

492
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,220
Then he had to hunt for the switch key
to his car or was your captain and a

493
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:35,600
small metal strong box. The key to which
in turn he could not find that once.

494
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,510
So when they reached the cabin that lasts,

495
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,690
the ease was primrose color and there
was already handled this with some of

496
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,940
summer and again,

497
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:51,941
two men both older now met at
the door of one room cabin.

498
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,090
The professional having
lost that again to them too.

499
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,520
First he enter the door to Dr. Hood,
the infant.

500
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,550
So it is crucial that
this is a repetition.

501
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,640
This is a replay of an earliest scenario.

502
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,190
Fuckwit Amazon's is this over again,

503
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,600
it's the second time growth too
late this time also also and again,

504
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,080
so it turns out that actually the second
time around makes all the difference in

505
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:28,721
the world because at this time high
tower is evil to deliver the baby

506
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,240
successfully.

507
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,270
This is actually the consequential action
that he manages to do that is granted

508
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:42,640
him. He's not granted the, the on the, um,

509
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,920
bravery or you know,

510
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:48,750
I don't even know what word to use
for if he had chosen to lie. He,

511
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,810
he's not granting that whatever
mental ability or mental Thomas,

512
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,100
uh, to, to lie to life or
for, um, for Joel Christmas.

513
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
But he has ran or something that Ashley
is both more uncontroversial and with an

514
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,300
obviously the night outcome to delivery
of a baby where the professional,

515
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,930
the doctor is to like this time too.

516
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,610
So it turns out that Faulkner
has given us not only,

517
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,670
and that is why the double consciousness
is we doubled or maybe we doubled again

518
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,060
in late in August,

519
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,860
is that there are two
meanings to be in second,

520
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,340
um, in Joe Christmases, usage,

521
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
God loves me to be in second means that
basically you and nobody that you are

522
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,070
nothing that you'd council nothing at all.

523
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,090
You're always going to be an
afterthought for me too. Um,

524
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,820
that's what being stabbed is,

525
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,470
means losing out and maybe not
even having the dignity of losing.

526
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:55,770
I would just meaning being
a non contender really, um,

527
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,190
in a field where everyone else
is going to be ahead of you.

528
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,750
Being in that camp contender is what
being sad and having the word to attach to

529
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,280
you.
Um,

530
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,340
but that's not the only meaning
of two or in a variation.

531
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,753
Awesome.

532
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:20,060
So the second time when we see that in
the case of high tower to darker arrive

533
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,450
to make this time also

534
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,060
second actually means a second chance
that you messed up the first time around.

535
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,801
You know,

536
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,820
he didn't actually really wasn't so much
messing up a meeting or some ladies are

537
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:40,650
just born there. Um, but the,
I is with some messing up,

538
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,230
you know, it wasn't a completely
satisfied, it wasn't, that's fine.

539
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,500
Outcome wasn't acceptable
outcome to most people. Um,

540
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,150
so you messed up the first time around,

541
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,260
you get a second chance
to do it one more time.

542
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,620
So being second,

543
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Ashley completely supports that sat
in usage and that is why to my mind,

544
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,070
um,

545
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:07,070
hightower decision and put in mid point
between Joe Christmas and the Grove,

546
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,810
is that his athlete ticking on us,
um,

547
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,590
halfway,
um,

548
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,060
and the direction of a much more
affirmative view of, you know,

549
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,780
one as possible, um, much more
further to the view of the world.

550
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,130
Um,

551
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,130
but it is important to recognize that
this is actually a completely accidental

552
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,100
development, right? There's no reason,

553
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:40,790
no logical reason why the
doctors should arrive too late.

554
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,480
And it's only because the
doctor arrives two ways,

555
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:46,120
then I targets to deliver the baby.
The doctor arrives, two emphases.

556
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh wait to be working out
in the middle of the night,

557
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,440
can find it's key to the car. Um,
all this accidental development,

558
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,830
um, contribute to, and
the doctors had told her,

559
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,990
other than the fact that
he's a at once before,

560
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,550
he really is an absolute stranger to
novel. He's such an original character.

561
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,860
So third,

562
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,250
second chance coming to tie tower comes
to him by virtue of the pregnancy and

563
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,180
childbirth of a total stranger in a
row and the exit download weightness of

564
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,110
another accidental person,
the doctor.

565
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,340
So we're beginning to get into, um, uh,

566
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
an arena where is really not
high towers action alone,

567
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,760
but the combined action
of all these other people,

568
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,630
um,
many of whom are strangers to him,

569
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,440
it is the combined action of all
these people that produce an outcome.

570
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,200
So this is a romantic interview. Some, um,

571
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,180
theoretical speculation on
this point and um, James,

572
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,680
uh, through a Wiki is, I'm a
staff writer for the New Yorker.

573
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,400
Um, and he, while back, he wrote
a book and you're not like that,

574
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,440
but that thing five,

575
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:08,860
10 years ago wrote a book
called the wisdom of crowds,

576
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,450
which actually got a lot of attention
when it came up. And his basic argument,

577
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,850
um, is that, um,

578
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,230
that the collective decision, uh, or,

579
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,810
or just the collective, um, congenital,

580
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,420
anyone when this is inflammation,

581
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,930
the collective conjection
collected guesswork,

582
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,060
but abrogation of gases from a lot of
people that aggregation is always going to

583
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:40,531
be closer to the truth than the
single gas was single individuals.

584
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:44,640
So it's actually a kind of complicated
mathematical argument is about

585
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,330
aggregation of conjecture being better,

586
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,600
having a much higher likelihood of
being closer to the truth. So it's,

587
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,900
even though it doesn't talk
about statistics, actually,

588
00:40:55,901 --> 00:41:00,901
it's very statistical and this is over
thinking that is about chances and

589
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:05,050
likelihood themselves.
Um, the other book, um,

590
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,490
that is also relevant and
as it has the title, um,

591
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,690
here is by Michael called and
told me angry, um, is, um,

592
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,140
burden you with a food substance.
So that argument. But this one, um,

593
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,680
I mean it's really not not
about what we're talking
about. There is one line, um,

594
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,510
that is relevant to what
we've been talking about. Um,

595
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,930
which is about the thinking
about what the meaning, um,

596
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,970
now to two could have for them mounted
to is the cooperators conversions of

597
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:41,801
subjects only the Malibu to through
its practical experimentation,

598
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,850
we're off of the models and determine
when and how the possible becomes the

599
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,860
real. So it has some, um,

600
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,900
has some resemblance to
this road wiki argument,

601
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,860
which is that it is about how the
possible can they come to Rio.

602
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,950
And it turns out that the
collective conjecture,

603
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:08,910
that amplification of individual
guesswork or individual,

604
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:13,911
the aggregation of action from long people
would put us in closer contact to how

605
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,210
the possible can become too real.
Um,

606
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,240
so these are the two sort
of can turn free, um,

607
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,600
lines of thinking about Ruth and about
human populations as opposed to human

608
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:33,080
individuals as the Asians of history.
Um,

609
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,110
it turns out that actually there's also
a 19th century precedent for a farmer.

610
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,250
And we're so used to thinking of
the scarlet letter as a combination,

611
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,650
as the bigotry of puritans.

612
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:50,150
But let's not forget actually the Hobsons
if very important statement about now

613
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:55,151
with you that brands completely countered
or stereotypical vision of Paradise

614
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,830
when,

615
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:01,640
and I'm instructed mounted to
attempts to see with his eyes,

616
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,870
it is exceedingly apt to be deceived when,

617
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:10,871
however iPhones this judgment as it
usually does and the intuitions of this

618
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,760
great and warm hot,

619
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,280
the conclusions that attained often.

620
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:22,330
So proof and so airing as to possess
the character truce supernaturally with

621
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:26,310
you.
Um,

622
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,360
it's an astonishing statement from the
scholars are saying that in fact that the

623
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,610
great and warm hot is not the attribute
of the single individual than in fact

624
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,630
the human heart in his
individual embodiment is likely
to have lots and lots of

625
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:45,470
shadows.
And,

626
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,010
and the only way that those shadows can
be relatively to activated is when we

627
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:57,020
think that the aggregate me, I think
that's the really interesting theory.

628
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,280
I'm just offering it to
you as possible. Um, so,

629
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,570
but I do think that this is
what Farbman um, things in his,

630
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,260
the use of tools, strangers,
um, doctors, you know,

631
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,650
people who have no relation to
one another and live longer.

632
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:17,651
So basically his notion often now the
two is that this random isis statistical

633
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,430
population though and this chance there.
Um,

634
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,900
and this is the moment,
and I think this is an extreme moment,

635
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,100
um, in light in August when right before
the killing, actually Joe Christmas,

636
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,600
this essentially more it get,
it's early,

637
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,440
doesn't go with the deed that follows.

638
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:42,270
But this is what's often gives us in the
land and suspension of augers intuition

639
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,830
nighters about two full income.

640
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,330
It seems to engender as rounds
out for thing or like a halo.

641
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,940
The Halo is full of phases.

642
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,340
The phases are not shame with suffering
last shape with anything, not horror,

643
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,960
pain or even reproach.

644
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,380
They are peaceful as though they have
escape and apotheosis is only is about

645
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:06,510
them. So I don't need to
talk anymore about that.

646
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:09,390
Just that the halo is not the hill.

647
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:13,970
I'm a single phase in this for our faces.
Um,

648
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,910
and it is,

649
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,240
that's the reason why he goes right back
to how you starts out talking about the

650
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:26,961
kindness of strangers and there's kindness
of strangers is not even our agonized

651
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:33,531
by everything that has happened in
between patient one of the light in August

652
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,180
and the last page, the last pages
of like the kindness of a stranger.

653
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:39,780
Yes.

654
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,780
It has to recognize and take into account
and fully and knowledge and put in the

655
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:48,940
foreground the cruelty of one's neighbors.
No question about it.

656
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,350
It has to encompass all of that,
but the kindness of strangers we means.

657
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,040
And so he's totally happy to bring in

658
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,790
personal never before mansion in,
in August in the last pages of the novel,

659
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,540
the lives in the eastern part
of the state of Virginia repair.

660
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,160
And do your who recently made a trip
into Tennessee to guess an obese as a

661
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:16,161
furniture which had
bought by correspondence
completely extraneous detail,

662
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,700
um, at the end of the novel. And the
reason this furniture dealer, um,

663
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,950
is in the picture somewhere is that
he is there to witness this ongoing

664
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:30,090
courtship train being a growth and,
uh,

665
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,140
Barton bunch,

666
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:37,620
so less see what farmer's
things about marriage.

667
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,070
Um, and it turns out that
he actually has thought,

668
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:42,810
given some thought to his rival,

669
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,670
the relation between the two
of them are not always, uh,

670
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,570
relations with cordial.
Uh,

671
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,140
so it goes right into [inaudible]
it outright in any way.

672
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,160
Poor bloke to have to marry three times
to find, know that marriage is a failure.

673
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,090
Apparently man can be cured of trucks,
gambling,

674
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,140
biting his nails and picking his nose,
but not often narrate.

675
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,150
This is what we're addicted to his
marriage. It doesn't matter. And you know,

676
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,640
you've failed thousand hundred,
you still won't get married.

677
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,060
So given the fact is totally cleared I
evaluation of the outcome of marriage,

678
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,440
Dawson, the fact that it's just
going to be an ongoing addiction, um,

679
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,970
we can maybe go,

680
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,880
we should not be surprised by what
comes to the end of Pflag Naugles.

681
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,160
And I just want this, when you're
talking about him in wintertime,

682
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,550
remind you that we spend this kind of
structured format with the structure,

683
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,090
right. And they, um,
the phone about those,

684
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,880
he lay flat on the Brown pine needles,
fall in the forest,

685
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:43,240
his chin on his phone at arms
beginning of the novel, and is awful.

686
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:46,210
He could feel his heart beating
against upon you, those little,

687
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,540
the forest and being of light in August,

688
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,780
probably at the beginning
and ending beginning,

689
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,750
although I have not been
quite a month on the road,

690
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,550
I'm ready in Mississippi and then offline,

691
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,150
all those hail and then
coming from Alabama for two
months and now it's already

692
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,350
Tennessee.

693
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:10,350
So it is Lena [inaudible] candy on the
kindness of strangers and county on the

694
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,810
statistical side than to every Lucas Bush.

695
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,140
There will always be a battery punch
because marriage is an addiction.

696
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,780
So that's one comment.
Thank you very

697
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,460
[inaudible].
