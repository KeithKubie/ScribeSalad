00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:14.431
Bees are very busy little matchmakers.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.066
Wingmen in every sense of the word.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.633
You see, the bees' side of the whole "birds and the bees" business

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.960
is to help plants find mates and reproduce.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.138
In their work as pollinators,

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:28.486
honeybees are integral to the production

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.703
of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat.

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:33.095
And these bees,

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:35.549
dutifully helping lonely plants have sex,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.001
aren't alone.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.041
But rather are part of a very complex network

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:41.706
of matchmaking creatures,

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:46.912
critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:51.232
Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex.

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:54.482
Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:56.403
They have too much photosynthesis to do,

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:58.986
and they can't find the time to evolve feet

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.982
and walk to a singles bar.

00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:03.439
Those places are called meat markets for a reason,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.006
because plants can't walk.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.231
So they need matchmaker pollinators

00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.150
to transport their pollen grains

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.675
to flowers of the same plant species,

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.563
and they pay these pollinators with food.

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:18.376
Today, around 170,000 plant species

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:20.636
receive pollination services

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:24.330
from more than 200,000 pollinator species.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.885
Pollinators include many species of bees,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:33.659
butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.693
who together help pollinate many species of trees,

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:39.576
shrubs and other flowering plants.

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:45.166
In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.217
For instance, fossil records suggest

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:50.877
bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.608
after they acquired a taste for nectar.

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:56.336
Plant pollinator networks are everywhere.

00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:59.819
Ecologists record these networks in the field

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.053
by observing which pollinators visit which plants,

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:07.616
or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies.

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:09.312
Networks, registered in these ways,

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:12.588
contain from 20 to 800 species.

00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:16.424
These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture.

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:20.482
Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way.

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:22.612
Most plants are specialists,

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:25.624
they have only one or a few matchmakers.

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.992
Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants

00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:30.847
hire a diverse team of matchmakers,

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:34.357
getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network.

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:36.437
The same occurs with pollinators.

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:40.992
Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species,

00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:43.989
while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually,

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.849
are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.305
almost all the plant species in that ecosystem.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.785
What's interesting is that specialists and generalists

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.211
across both plants and pollinators,

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.932
sort themselves out in a particular pattern.

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:04.239
Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.973
In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more

00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:10.987
with generalists than with other specialists.

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:13.308
This is because if you're a specialist plant,

00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:16.913
and your only matchmaker also specializes on you

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:18.525
as its only food source,

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.955
you're each more vulnerable to extinction.

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:24.940
So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.574
that has other sources of food

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:29.902
to ensure its persistence in bad years.

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:32.728
The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator.

00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:34.610
You're better off in the long run

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.060
specializing on a generalist plant

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.082
that gets pollinated by other species

00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:41.819
in times when you're not around to help.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.008
Finally, in addition to nestedness,

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.468
the networks are usually modular.

00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:48.764
This means that the species in a network

00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:52.438
are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:54.119
that interact more with each other

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.533
than with species in other modules.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.398
Think of them like social cliques.

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.196
A plant or pollinator dying off

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.516
will effect the species in its module,

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:07.025
but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network.

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:08.695
Why's all that important?

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:13.061
Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems.

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.425
Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:22.069
enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.223
That's critical because nature is never static.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.026
Some species may not show up every year.

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:30.542
Plants flower at different times.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.455
Pollinators mature on varying schedules.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.513
Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:39.240
depending on who's flowering when.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.787
So from one flowering season to the next,

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:44.148
the participants and patterns of matchmaking

00:04:44.148 --> 00:04:46.358
can drastically change.

00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:47.763
With all those variables,

00:04:47.763 --> 00:04:50.502
you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators,

00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:53.967
like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest,

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.601
but the entire network of plants and pollinators

00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:59.557
we see in nature, and rely on for life.

00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:02.190
Next time you see a bee fly by,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.986
remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:09.753
critical to the love lives of plants all around you.
