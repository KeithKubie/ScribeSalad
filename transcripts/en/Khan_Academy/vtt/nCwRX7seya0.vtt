00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:01.337
- [Instructor] What you
see in these pictures,

00:00:01.337 --> 00:00:03.823
this is a forward view
of a transparent man

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:05.498
or a semitransparent man,

00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:07.602
and this is a posterior, or back view

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:10.006
of a semitransparent woman.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.138
But what these organs that are depicted,

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:15.550
these organs secrete molecules
into the bloodstream,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.791
and an organ that secretes things,

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.368
these are called glands,

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:23.358
and they secrete these
molecules into the blood stream

00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:25.738
that regulate other parts of the body,

00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.515
things that might be quite
far away from the organs,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.035
the glands that actually do the secretion.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:32.254
And so these molecules

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:33.961
that regulate other parts of the body,

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.985
these are called hormones.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.368
And the word hormone
comes from Greek hormōn,

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:40.909
which means to set in motion,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.302
so one way to think about
it, these are molecules

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:46.270
that set things in motion
in other parts of the body,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.233
and this is really to
regulate the body function.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:51.924
Now this entire system
of glands is referred to

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:55.965
as the endocrine system,
endo- referring to fact that

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:59.256
it's acting within the body,
-crine originally comes

00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:02.743
from Greek word to sift or
to differentiate something

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:04.672
and it's a system of organs

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:06.059
or I guess you could say glands

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:07.703
that are secreting molecules,

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:11.179
these hormones into the
bloodstream to regulate the body.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.690
I'm not going to go in-depth

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.263
in all of these endocrine glands

00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:18.768
but just to give you an
appreciation of what they do

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:20.766
and what these hormones are all about,

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.143
we could list some of the more common ones

00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:24.741
that you might hear about.

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:29.550
So for example, the thyroid
gland produces thyroid hormone.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.862
This is a version of thyroid hormone.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.975
You see your carbons in the dark gray,

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:35.926
your hydrogens in the white.

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:38.988
You see your oxygens in
the red, nitrogen in blue,

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:42.386
and these big atoms right
over here, these are iodine,

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:44.763
and thyroid hormone
plays an important role

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:45.995
in your metabolism.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.176
In fact, if you have too
much thyroid hormone,

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:51.386
that's a disorder called hyperthyroidism,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.784
which would make your
metabolism overactive.

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:56.784
Likewise, if you have too
little thyroid hormone,

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:00.153
that's a disorder known as hypothyroidism,

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:03.699
in which case your metabolism
isn't active enough.

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:07.054
You have hormones like adrenaline

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:09.567
that are released by the adrenal glands,

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.887
and that's where it gets
the word adrenaline from.

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:14.106
It's often known as epinephrine,

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:16.440
and adrenaline, you
might hear things like,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.403
"Hey, so and so is an adrenaline junkie,"

00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:20.188
which means they really like a thrill,

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:22.444
and adrenaline actually
does play a role there.

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:24.468
It's involved in the
fight-or-flight response,

00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:26.162
where it'll increase your heart rate

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:28.356
and increase blood flow to the muscles.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.411
And what's really interesting
about all of these hormones

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.636
is they have so many impacts on the body

00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:34.556
because they're released
into the bloodstream

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:39.096
and to different cells they
might do different things.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.766
This right over here is
a variation of estrogen,

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:45.243
which is produced primarily
in females in the ovaries,

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:47.299
but it also exists in a male body

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.939
and it's associated with a
lot of female bodily function,

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.815
but once again, not strictly female.

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:55.141
Estrogen also exists in males.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:58.009
Similarly, you have testosterone,

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.983
which is associated with male function

00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:03.299
but it also exists in females,

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.285
and it's primarily produced
in men in the testes.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.175
Thus the name testosterone,

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.957
but it can also be produced
by the adrenal glands.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.451
And women, it can be
produced by the ovaries.

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:16.384
But you could also have
a molecule like insulin

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.035
which you can see is much
larger than the other hormones

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.193
that we have looked at.

00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:21.686
It's produced in the pancreas

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.502
and it plays a super-important role

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.367
in how we process sugars
and how we store fat

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.227
and scientists are constantly
discovering new roles

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.774
for these various hormones.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.279
Insulin in particular you
might associate with diabetes.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.201
People with Type 1 diabetes
aren't able to produce

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.995
enough insulin to take the
sugar out of their blood stream,

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:42.834
to have the cells absorb the sugar.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.957
Insulin will bind to the surface of a cell

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.029
so that it will start taking in sugar

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.475
from the blood stream.

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:52.241
People with Type 2 diabetes,
they have an insensitivity

00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.752
to insulin, so they might
have to take extra insulin

00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:57.862
in order for their cells to
take in the proper amount

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:58.976
of sugar.

00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:01.140
But the big idea here is
that the endocrine system,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.271
although it might not be as obvious,

00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:04.889
or it might not be as well known

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.961
as something like say the nervous system,

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.565
it plays a pivotal role in your body.

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:11.237
It helps regulate your body.

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:13.344
It helps keep it at the right temperature,

00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:14.973
the right blood pressure,

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:16.666
your heart pumping at the right rate.

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.021
One way to think about this is

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.487
the notion of homeostasis, which is

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:24.987
derived from similar and staying the same.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.837
So keeping your body at
the right temperature

00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:29.679
regardless of what the
temperature is outside

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:31.400
or regardless of what your body is doing,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.633
there's a whole series of
roles that these hormones,

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.968
which are released by
these endocrine glands

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:37.968
actually do.
