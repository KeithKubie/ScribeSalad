00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.540
Where we left off in the
last video I kind

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.400
of gave you a question.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.240
Find an interval so that we're
reasonably confident-- we'll

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.220
talk a little bit more about why
I have to give this kind

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.570
of vague wording right here--
reasonably confident that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.030
there's a 95% chance that the
true population mean, which is

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.360
p, which is the same thing as
the mean of the sampling

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.850
distribution of the
sampling mean.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570
So there's a 95% chance that
the true mean-- and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.360
let me put this here.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.910
This is also the same thing as
the mean of the sampling

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.790
distribution of the sampling
mean is in that interval.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.740
And to do that let me just
throw out a few ideas.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:46.295
What is the probability that if
I take a sample and I were

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.870
to take a mean of that sample,
so the probability that a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.260
random sample mean is within two
standard deviations of the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.500
sampling mean, of
our sample mean?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.610
So what is this probability
right over here?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.100
Let's just look at our
actual distribution.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.950
So this is our distribution,
this right here is our

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.020
sampling mean.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.580
Maybe I should do it in
blue because that's

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.730
the color up here.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.180
This is our sampling mean.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.330
And so what is the probability
that a random sampling mean is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.970
going to be two standard
deviations?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.440
Well a random sampling is a
sample from this distribution.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.980
It is a sample from the sampling
distribution of the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.040
sample mean.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.400
So it's literally what is the
probability of finding a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.360
sample within two standard
deviations of the mean?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.150
That's one standard deviation,
that's another standard

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.980
deviation right over there.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.140
In general, if you haven't
committed this to memory

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.340
already, it's not a bad thing
to commit to memory, is that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.710
if you have a normal
distribution the probability

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.170
of taking a sample within two
standard deviations is 95--

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.130
and if you want to get
a little bit more

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.600
accurate it's 95.4%.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.860
But you could say it's roughly--
or maybe I could

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.210
write it like this--
it's roughly 95%.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.400
And really that's all that
matters because we have this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.910
little funny language here
called reasonably confident,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.800
and we have to estimate the
standard deviation anyway.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130
In fact, we could say if we
want, I could say that it's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.820
going to be exactly
equal to 95.4%.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.240
But in general, two standard
deviations, 95%, that's what

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.740
people equate with each other.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.680
Now this statement is the
exact same thing as the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.170
probability that the sample
mean, that the sampling mean--

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.440
not the sample mean, the
probability of the mean of the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.700
sampling distribution is within
two standard deviations

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.350
of the sampling distribution of
x is also going to be the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.750
same number, is also going
to be equal to 95.4%.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.220
These are the exact
same statements.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.170
If x is within two standard
deviations of this, then this,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.580
then the mean, is within two
standard deviations of x.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.400
These are just two ways of
phrasing the same thing.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.090
Now we know that the mean of the
sampling distribution, the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.760
same thing as a mean of the
population distribution, which

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.940
is the same thing as the
parameter p-- the proportion

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.670
of people or the proportion of
the population that is a 1.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.780
So this right here is the same
thing as the population mean.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.900
So this statement right here
we can switch this with p.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.290
So the probability that p is
within two standard deviations

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.260
of the sampling distribution
of x is 95.4%.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.830
Now we don't know what this
number right here is.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.890
But we have estimated it.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.870
Remember, our best estimate of
this is the true standard, or

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.060
it is the true standard
deviation of the population

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.110
divided by 10.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.350
We can estimate the true
standard deviation of the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.300
population with our sampling
standard deviation, which was

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.000
0.5, 0.5 divided by 10.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.980
Our best estimate of the
standard deviation of the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.190
sampling distribution of the
sample mean is 0.05.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.470
So now we can say-- and I'll
switch colors-- the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.670
probability that the parameter
p, the proportion of the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.720
population saying 1, is within
two times-- remember, our best

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.600
estimate of this right here is
0.05 of a sample mean that we

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.500
take is equal to 95.4%.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.770
And so we could say the
probability that p is within 2

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.650
times 0.05 is going to be equal
to-- 2.0 is going to be

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.290
0.10 of our mean is equal to
95-- and actually let me be a

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.230
little careful here.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.420
I can't say the equal now,
because over here if we knew

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.110
this, if we knew this parameter
of the sampling

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.120
distribution of the sample
mean, we could

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.250
say that it is 95.4%.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.280
We don't know it.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.050
We are just trying to find our
best estimator for it.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.450
So actually what I'm going to
do here is actually just say

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.260
is roughly-- and just to show
that we don't even have that

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.510
level of accuracy, I'm going
to say roughly 95%.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.680
We're reasonably confident that
it's about 95% because

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.880
we're using this estimator that
came out of our sample,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.070
and if the sample is really
skewed this is going to be a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.950
really weird number.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.810
So this is why we just have to
be a little bit more exact

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.590
about what we're doing.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.890
But this is the tool
for at least saying

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.910
how good is our result.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.840
So this is going to
be about 95%.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:46.500
Or we could say that the
probability that p is within

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.870
0.10 of our sample mean
that we actually got.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.840
So what was the sample mean
that we actually got?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.460
It was 0.43.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.550
So if we're within 0.1 of 0.43,
that means we are within

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:07.730
0.43 plus or minus 0.1 is
also, roughly, we're

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.850
reasonably confident
it's about 95%.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.870
And I want to be very clear.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.060
Everything that I started all
the way from up here in brown

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.610
to yellow and all this magenta,
I'm just restating

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.340
the same thing inside of this.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.490
It became a little bit more
loosey-goosey once I went from

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.950
the exact standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.340
to an estimator for it.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.960
And that's why this is just
becoming-- I kind of put the

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.540
squiggly equal signs there
to say we're reasonably

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.110
confident-- and I even got rid
of some of the precision.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.950
But we just found
our interval.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.240
An interval that we can be
reasonably confident that

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.460
there's a 95% probability that
p is within that, is going to

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.190
be 0.43 plus or minus 0.1.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.460
Or an interval of-- we have
a confidence interval.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:59.620
We have a 95% confidence
interval of, and we could say,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.240
0.43 minus 0.1 is 0.33.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.710
If we write that as a percent
we could say 33% to-- and if

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:16.630
we add the 0.1, 0.43 plus
0.1 we get 53%-- to 53%.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.890
So we are 95% confident.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.340
So we're not saying kind of
precisely that the probability

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.550
of the actual proportion is 95%,
but we're 95% confident

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:35.870
that the true proportion
is between 33% and 55%.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.830
That p is in this
range over here.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.980
Or another way, and you'll see
this in a lot of surveys that

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.070
have been done, people will say
we did a survey and we got

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:55.180
43% will vote for number one,
and number one in this case is

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.430
candidate B.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.450
And then the other side, since
everyone else voted for

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:13.290
candidate A, 57% will
vote for A.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.460
And then they're going to
put on margin of error.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.750
And you'll see this in any
survey that you see on TV.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.350
They'll put a margin of error.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.920
And the margin of error is just
another way of describing

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.480
this confidence interval.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.330
And they'll say that the margin
of error in this case

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:37.200
is 10%, which means that there's
a 95% confidence

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.919
interval, if you go plus or
minus 10% from that value

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.510
right over there.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.850
And I really want to emphasize,
you can't say with

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.620
certainty that there is a 95%
chance that the true result

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.180
will be within 10% of this,
because we had to estimate the

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.030
standard deviation of
the sampling mean.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.140
But this is the best measure
we can with the information

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.500
you have. If you're going to
do a survey of 100 people,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.570
this is the best kind of
confidence that we can get.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.600
And this number is actually
fairly big.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.560
So if you were to look at this
you would say, roughly there's

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.360
a 95% chance that the true
value of this number is

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.100
between 33% and 53%.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.240
So there's actually still a
chance that candidate B can

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.170
win, even though only
43% of your 100 are

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.920
going to vote for him.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.250
If you wanted to make it a
little bit more precise you

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.770
would want to take
more samples.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.390
You can imagine.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.710
Instead of taking 100 samples,
instead of n being 100, if you

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.310
made n equal 1,000, then you
would take this number over

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.800
here, you would take this number
here and divide by the

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.570
square root of 1,000 instead
of the square root of 100.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.250
So you'd be dividing
by 33 or whatever.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.550
And so then the size of the
standard deviation of your

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.760
sampling distribution
will go down.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.350
And so the distance of two
standard deviations will be a

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.480
smaller number, and so
then you will have a

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.210
smaller margin of error.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.290
And maybe you want to get the
margin of error small enough

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.920
so that you can figure out
decisively who's going to win

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.340
the election.
