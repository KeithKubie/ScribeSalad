00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.200
Minerals are literally everywhere, and scientists
have found that we’re accidentally creating

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
new ones.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.870
But wait, do you even know what a mineral
is?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
They are defined as solid substances with
a definite chemical formula, a crystalline

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.530
structure, and are naturally occurring

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.430
Remember that natural part for later.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.539
You might have seen some of these beauties
before: amethyst, quartz, tourmaline, azurite

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.080
are all minerals … and they’re so mesmerizing.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.010
And you can also find minerals in your grocery
store, they can be nutrients too! like sodium,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.910
magnesium, and calcium.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.510
Minerals aren’t just pretty to look at;
they’re essential for us humans to function

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.510
properly.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.510
But how do minerals form?

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.170
Well, they develop when atoms of one or more
element join together and a crystalline structure

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.170
forms.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.260
And, most importantly, minerals are forged
in nature, born in the crucible of the Earth’s

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
interior!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.820
So, when magma cools or liquids evaporate,
a mineral is born.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.329
There are around 4,000 different types of
natural minerals!

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.340
But … according to a study published in
American Mineralogist, 208 of them, aren’t

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.379
exactly born of natural causes.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.379
They’re here on earth ... thanks to us humans.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.290
THESE … ARE MAN-MADE MINERALS.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.820
Well, to clarify a bit, these minerals did
form “naturally” … but in man-made places,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.110
like mines, smelters, and other industrial
contamination sites.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.810
When we dig into the earth, we're opening
up areas that wouldn't naturally be there,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.969
allowing water and air to interact with the
soil.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.090
Industrial activities cause chemical reactions
... we’re inadvertently creating something

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.659
new when this happens.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080
Mineralogists are so pumped about this.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.280
For instance, this mineral, andersonite, is
found in the tunnels of abandoned uranium

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.080
mines in the Southwest.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.840
The sandstone that lines the tunnel walls
interacts with mine water, creating this crust

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.729
of yellow and green crystals.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.260
Extra cool points: andersonite glows under
a blacklight.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.520
And this pretty one Simonkolleite is found
in old copper mines.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.399
This other newly classified mineral is Abhurite.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.939
It was found on the not-so-happy wreck of
the SS Cheerful, a steamship that sank almost

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.689
150 years ago.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.370
When the seawater interacts with ship’s
cargo of tin metal, Abhurite popped up.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.140
Minerologists are calling the appearance of
these man-made minerals a “punctuation event”,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.720
which are notable periods of time in earth's
geological record.”

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.530
Researchers are pegging this one at the start
of the industrial revolution to present day.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.360
The first punctuation was called the Great
Oxidation event and it happened over 2 billion

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360
years ago.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.680
Back then, there was a massive increase in
the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, spurring

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.090
the creation of 2/3s of the minerals we see
today.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.410
The fact that it took only 300 years for these
man-made minerals to appear is a big deal.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
We've done more to diversify minerals on the
planet in such a short period of time than

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.870
the earth has done on its own in 2 billion
years.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.940
And that’s lead some to suggest that we’re
living in the anthropocene, or “the age

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.290
of humans.”

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.970
Some environmentalists think our impact on
the planet is so profound that a new geological

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.360
epoch needs to be declared.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.070
But this has been hotly debated in the science
community.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.000
It's really up to the international geologic
community to decide; they’re looking for

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.020
something called the golden spike, or a marker
in the environment that determines the start

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.270
of this new epoch.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.500
A working group has been basically working
on this since 2009, with no answer yet.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
So, these newly found minerals could be a
contender.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.210
Whether or not these man-made rocks herald
the beginning of the age of man, it’s hard

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.580
to deny that we’re leaving a mark on this
planet.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.180
And speaking of changing the planet, humans
might have actually caused a river to disappear!

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.090

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090
And what about you?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.020
Do you think these pretty rocks signal the
beginning of a new epoch?
