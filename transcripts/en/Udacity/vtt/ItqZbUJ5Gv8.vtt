00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:02.650
All right, so we see that the code
with the single bracket and

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.410
a percent sign on either side
is the logical code that we

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.540
want to execute in our HTML,
like a for loop.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.600
The double brackets indicate the code
that we want it's results printed into

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.420
the html document itself.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.590
Since, from within HTML codes,
we cannot use indentations to mark

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.220
the beginning and ending of statements
and loops, we must use keywords,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.000
like endfor, and endif, to indicate
the end of a loop, or statement.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.510
Going back to my menu.html, I can
see how I'm obtaining the result of

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.510
a query and executing the output
here in my HTML page.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.876
I will also need to substitute the code
I had in my restaurant menu method, so

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.890
that instead of returning a string,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.420
we will return a rendered template
with the new menu.html file.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.040
Since I'm querying on my restaurant and
menu items table, I will path my queries

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.930
into the template, so that my escape
code has access to these variables.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.000
I will also need to import
the render_template function from my

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.270
Flask library.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.220
By saving and refreshing the page,
I see the same code with

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.480
a few stylistic modifications
I added inside of my template.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.620
You'll be building your
own templates very soon.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.510
I just want to talk about two more
topics to help you get the most out of

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.050
them first.
