leaderboards controller that doesn't

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
leaderboards controller that doesn't
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.450
leaderboards controller that doesn't
show anything because we have no leader

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
show anything because we have no leader
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.310
show anything because we have no leader
boards so let's think about adding some

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
boards so let's think about adding some
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680
boards so let's think about adding some
now we have three difficulty levels in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
now we have three difficulty levels in
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840
now we have three difficulty levels in
our game easy medium and hard probably

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
our game easy medium and hard probably
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.220
our game easy medium and hard probably
make sense for each one to have its own

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
make sense for each one to have its own
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290
make sense for each one to have its own
leaderboard so let's go ahead and do

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
leaderboard so let's go ahead and do
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.050
leaderboard so let's go ahead and do
that I'm going to pop over to Chrome

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
that I'm going to pop over to Chrome
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.440
that I'm going to pop over to Chrome
here and shrink this a bit and I'm going

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
here and shrink this a bit and I'm going
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.860
here and shrink this a bit and I'm going
to go to play google com / app / publish

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
to go to play google com / app / publish
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.130

the developer console and check out our

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
the developer console and check out our
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280
the developer console and check out our
game services and let's go into guess my

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
game services and let's go into guess my
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.389
game services and let's go into guess my
number so we can go into leaderboards

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
number so we can go into leaderboards
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060
number so we can go into leaderboards
and the process here is fairly similar

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
and the process here is fairly similar
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430
and the process here is fairly similar
to adding achievements we fill out all

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
to adding achievements we fill out all
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930
to adding achievements we fill out all
the various information that we need in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
the various information that we need in
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.569
the various information that we need in
a form and then the system generates a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
a form and then the system generates a
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119
a form and then the system generates a
unique ID for us that we can use later

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
unique ID for us that we can use later
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.430
unique ID for us that we can use later
to refer to this leaderboard so let's do

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
to refer to this leaderboard so let's do
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869
to refer to this leaderboard so let's do
that I'm going to click on add

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
that I'm going to click on add
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.920
that I'm going to click on add
leaderboard and for this one our name is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
leaderboard and for this one our name is
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.190
leaderboard and for this one our name is
going to be easy and this will be the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
going to be easy and this will be the
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630
going to be easy and this will be the
leader board for an easy difficulty

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
leader board for an easy difficulty
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030
leader board for an easy difficulty
level we have some options for score

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
level we have some options for score
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039
level we have some options for score
formatting it can be numeric which would

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
formatting it can be numeric which would
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510
formatting it can be numeric which would
be like an integer or a floating-point

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
be like an integer or a floating-point
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820
be like an integer or a floating-point
we also have options for currency and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
we also have options for currency and
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.940
we also have options for currency and
time and maybe if we wanted to do a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950
time and maybe if we wanted to do a
 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.649
time and maybe if we wanted to do a
fastest time to guess the answer type of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
fastest time to guess the answer type of
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649
fastest time to guess the answer type of
leader board we can use time for that we

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
leader board we can use time for that we
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.200
leader board we can use time for that we
have an icon this is optional I do

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
have an icon this is optional I do
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510
have an icon this is optional I do
recommend using icons if you want to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
recommend using icons if you want to
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480
recommend using icons if you want to
create say actual games that you want

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
create say actual games that you want
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.140
create say actual games that you want
people to download and by the reason is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
people to download and by the reason is
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810
people to download and by the reason is
that in the play games standalone

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
that in the play games standalone
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090
that in the play games standalone
application your leaderboard icons do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
application your leaderboard icons do
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130
application your leaderboard icons do
show up fairly prominently someone looks

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
show up fairly prominently someone looks
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200
show up fairly prominently someone looks
at your game one of the three screens

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
at your game one of the three screens
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.340
at your game one of the three screens
that they're going to see about your

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
that they're going to see about your
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.690
that they're going to see about your
game are going to be your leader boards

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
game are going to be your leader boards
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670
game are going to be your leader boards
and in those cases it's nice to have

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
and in those cases it's nice to have
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859
and in those cases it's nice to have
leaderboard icons that you know look

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
leaderboard icons that you know look
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469
leaderboard icons that you know look
interesting in our case we're going to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
interesting in our case we're going to
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.120
interesting in our case we're going to
stick with the default leaderboard icon

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
stick with the default leaderboard icon
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190
stick with the default leaderboard icon

as provided by Play game services which
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980
as provided by Play game services which
is like a little crown thing ordering

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
is like a little crown thing ordering
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569
is like a little crown thing ordering
here we can choose whether larger is

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
here we can choose whether larger is
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730
here we can choose whether larger is
better or smaller is better in this case

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
better or smaller is better in this case
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.559
better or smaller is better in this case
our leaderboard is going to be based on

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
our leaderboard is going to be based on
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.390
our leaderboard is going to be based on
the number of guesses so how many

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
the number of guesses so how many
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.230
the number of guesses so how many
guesses did it take to get the mat

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240
guesses did it take to get the mat
 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.000
guesses did it take to get the mat
number so in this case smaller is better

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
number so in this case smaller is better
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520
number so in this case smaller is better
i do want to take a moment to add this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
i do want to take a moment to add this
 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.500
i do want to take a moment to add this
is my favorite feature of this developer

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
is my favorite feature of this developer
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.120
is my favorite feature of this developer
console rather than like having

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130
console rather than like having
 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.770
console rather than like having
ascending or descending and then you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
ascending or descending and then you
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.060
ascending or descending and then you
have to stop and think what was that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070
have to stop and think what was that
 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430
have to stop and think what was that
actually mean like smaller is better so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
actually mean like smaller is better so
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.980
actually mean like smaller is better so
much clearer love it anyway then we have

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990
much clearer love it anyway then we have
 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.190
much clearer love it anyway then we have
limits and these are basically the upper

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200
limits and these are basically the upper
 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.080
limits and these are basically the upper
and lower bounds of any score that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
and lower bounds of any score that's
 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.020
and lower bounds of any score that's
gets submitted to this leaderboard so i

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
gets submitted to this leaderboard so i
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.790
gets submitted to this leaderboard so i
suppose we want to say that we don't

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
suppose we want to say that we don't
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.770
suppose we want to say that we don't
want to allow scores lower than one make

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
want to allow scores lower than one make
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.960
want to allow scores lower than one make
sense you can't actually make a guess

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970
sense you can't actually make a guess
 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.500
sense you can't actually make a guess
in0 guesses and maybe for the small

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
in0 guesses and maybe for the small
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.140
in0 guesses and maybe for the small
leaderboard we want to say you know what

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
leaderboard we want to say you know what

let's not allow scores greater than 100
 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.640
let's not allow scores greater than 100
you know in theory someone could make

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
you know in theory someone could make
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.200
you know in theory someone could make
the same wrong guess over and over and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210
the same wrong guess over and over and
 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.690
the same wrong guess over and over and
over and over again and I don't know

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700
over and over again and I don't know
 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.130
over and over again and I don't know
maybe our players are going to have some

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140
maybe our players are going to have some
 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.050
maybe our players are going to have some

game contest maybe that's something you

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
game contest maybe that's something you

to cap our lower bounds or I guess their

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570
to cap our lower bounds or I guess their

leader boards where would disappear on

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
leader boards where would disappear on
 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.960

so there we go this is done I'm going to
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.740
so there we go this is done I'm going to
hit save and add another leader board

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
hit save and add another leader board
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.990
hit save and add another leader board
will create another one for medium this

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000
will create another one for medium this
 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.720
will create another one for medium this
should be pretty easy smaller's better

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730
should be pretty easy smaller's better
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.370
should be pretty easy smaller's better
and let's allow scores of one and a
