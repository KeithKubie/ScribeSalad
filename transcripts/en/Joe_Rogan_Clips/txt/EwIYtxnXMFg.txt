Speaker 1:          00:00          So when you're coming back from all these summits and all these, this time at altitude, what has actually happened to your body that causes you to be really depleted for six months? Like what? What's, what's happening other than the fact that you were at high altitude, low oxygen, like what's taking place?

Speaker 2:          00:18          So one of the things that happened to high altitude that you don't really think about too much, which is your body's not getting, so the air actually has just as much oxygen in it as it does at sea level. But the air is less dense. So that means as you breathe in the air, you're literally getting less oxygen into your blood. It's less dense, it's less nitrogen, the pressure changes, right? So at the high altitude, it's actually the pressure that's changing. It's not less oxygen, there's just as much oxygen, but in a less dense form. So in the same volume of breath, you're getting less actual o two into your blood. And what are you at a higher altitude, I guess? Uh, carbon dioxide. Is that right? Yeah. I'm not a doctor. Like I said, all I know is you're getting less oxygen. Um, you're getting less oxygen, your body.

Speaker 2:          00:58          So what ends up happening is your muscles of course need oxygen to perform. So normally if I'm in a, you know, when I'm in my most elite physical shape, you know, I resting heart rate during a professional triathlon career of like 35 getting out of bed, you know, 38 low enough that if you weren't a professional athlete and you went to a doctor with a heart rate of 35, they'd be like, oh my God, like you're going to die. There's something wrong with you. But like that's also, you know, a key marker of elite performance. You know, that of course. Um, but uh, what happens is your body can't PR, your body's getting so little auction, even as your blood is acclimatizing, you're sleeping with a resting heart rate at altitude on Everest at like 9,000 beats per minute. So, you know, that's pretty elevated heart rate, 24 hours a day.

Speaker 2:          01:37          And for, in my case, for 139 days straight. So essentially you're just career heart. It's just like cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook, Cook up and cook even at rest. And so what that does to your body in terms of, you know, it throws your hormones around it obviously you lose body weight, body fat, body composition, changes, all of those things really shift and happen, uh, in a pretty intense way. So coming back, like actually just getting your heart rate back down, getting your, you know, a pair of simple nervous system to just relax and stress free and all that kind of stuff. It takes a while for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:06          So what do you do to help yourself recover when you come back? Because there specific kinds of food that you eat or supplements

Speaker 2:          02:12          sick. Um, you know, I'll start the few different things that I find to be the work. Well, one sleep. I mean, I think that sleep in our culture in general is really underrated. I think, you know, if you go in the corporate world and everyone's like, I pulled this all night or I work in 120 hours a week, I this, I that or whatever. Like, you know, I'm telling you a story about pushing through the night and going 32 hours straight. There's a time and a place for big pushes without sleep. But like we are not built to do that sustainably, um, in any way, shape or form. So in my training, when I'm training for these things, I prioritize sleep. I prioritize taking a nap, the same thing when I'm recovering. So really making sure I get that sleep is the most for me, the most natural way to recover.

Speaker 2:          02:49          And top of that soft tissue work. I'm a huge believer in massage, um, as well as chiropractor. I've been going to a chiropractor since I was a little kid and to me that makes a big difference. Just have everything in alignment, everything kind of, you know, working well, uh, efficiently in my body. Um, and then yeah, supplements, you know, definitely reducing inflammation. So for me, gut health is huge. Um, so getting those probiotics, getting the right stuff in, you know, it's easy to have, you know, that leaky gut or things where you're not getting nutrition observed, absorbed properly. And I think we all in various states, you know, you deal with that, you know, that the standard American diet for sure. What leads to that for a lot of people. Um, so getting that nutrition clean and right. Um, so yeah, sleep, rest, recovery, nutrition. Um, and then, you know, I've definitely been, uh, taken a lot of supplements through my life. I err more towards the whole food supplements these days, but I find, you know, things like Tumeric that really reduce inflammation. Um, and, uh, you know, magnesium definitely helps a lot. So there's a few things that I, that I take daily, but a really, I think sleep and in a clean diet will goes a long way.
