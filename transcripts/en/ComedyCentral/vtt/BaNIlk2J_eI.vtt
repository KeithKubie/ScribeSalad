Welcome back

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.243 align:start size:53% position:47%
I'm Morty Jebsen.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.345 align:end position:100%
We're here today
continuing our conversation

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.448 align:end position:100%
with unbelievable
mega superstar

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.550 align:start size:44% position:56%
Young Bidness.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.318 align:start size:59% position:41%
Now, Young Bidness,
I got to tell you,

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.453 align:end position:100%
we've been
tiptoeing around

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.221 align:end position:100%
a particular subject
all day,

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.123 align:end position:100%
and I think it's time
to broach it.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.159 align:end position:100%
You've separated recently
with your actress girlfriend,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.593 align:start size:41% position:59%
Tina Bouquet.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.762
- No, Mort, Mort.
- And everybody wants to know--

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.531 align:start position:0%
We ain't gonna talk
about that.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.466 align:start position:0%
I'm not here
to talk about that.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.801 align:end position:100%
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.103 size:81% position:41%
You don't want to hear--
I told y'all motherfuckers

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.671 align:start position:0%
we weren't gonna talk
about that, Mort.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to talk
about the music.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.675 align:end position:100%
And lots of people understand
that you're talking

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.577 align:end position:100%
about your own
personal experiences.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.612 align:end position:100%
Your fans
would like to know--

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.181 align:start position:0%
How many times
I need--

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.283 align:start position:0%
Why--what--
The fans don't want to know.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.317 align:start position:0%
That's--
You want to know!

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.352
- I just want to clarify--
- You want to know.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.687 size:78% position:39%
You ain't want to clari--
You want clarification?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.222 align:end position:100%
I want to hear your side
of the story.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you
my side of the story.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:58.791 align:start position:0%
Interview's over.
How about that?

00:00:58.824 --> 00:00:59.792 align:start position:0%
Interview's over.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.227
- Please, Young Bidness.
- Done.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.795 align:end position:100%
There's no need
for the interview to be over.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.130 align:start position:0%
Interview's over.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.665 align:start position:0%
All y'all
motherfuckers.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.101
Young Bidness, there's no need
for the language or any of this.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
All y'all--
I told y'all motherfuckers

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.736 align:start position:0%
I wasn't gonna talk
about that.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.371 align:end position:100%
Do you want to talk
about the album?

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.440 align:end position:100%
'Cause I'd be more than happy
to talk about the album.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.075
- This is the<i> C-Word.</i>
- Mort.

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.610 align:end position:100%
It looks like it's well
on its way to going platinum.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.146
Fuck--Get the fuck
away from me, nigga.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.082 align:start size:41% position:59%
Louis, Louis.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.383 align:end position:100%
Well on its way
to going platinum.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start size:34% position:66%
We can talk
about this.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.453 align:start position:0%
This shit
is tucked in here.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.454 align:start size:56% position:44%
It's fine with me.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.755 align:start size:50% position:50%
You want to talk
about the album?

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.057 align:end position:100%
We can talk
about the album.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.225 align:start size:78% position:22%
How about<i> Tanks of Truth?</i>

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.227 align:end position:100%
<i> Tanks of Truth--</i>
is that a treatise

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.129 align:end position:100%
on the conflict
with ISIS?

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.197 align:end position:100%
I mean, what--
talk to me about this.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start size:19% position:81%
What--

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.100 align:end position:100%
Young Bidness, please,
I'm begging you.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.602 align:end position:100%
Just sit down,
take a deep breath,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.736 align:start size:56% position:44%
and let's discuss.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.371
- No.
- Let's discuss the album.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
It's done, Mort.
It's done.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.578 align:start size:16% position:84%
So...

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.213 align:start position:0%
You brought this
on yourself, Mort.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.082
- Young Bidness--
- You brought it on yourself.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.416 align:start size:44% position:56%
Young Bidness,
Young Bidness,

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.751 align:end position:100%
I would really love it
if you had a seat,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.119 align:end position:100%
and we could just
talk together

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:01.787 align:end position:100%
about anything--
anything you want.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.123 align:end position:100%
We don't--I won't mention
Tina's name again.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.258 align:start size:44% position:56%
Young Bidness.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.126 align:start position:0%
How the fuck--

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.528 align:start size:31% position:69%
Youthful--

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.729 align:start position:0%
How does--
where does it go to?

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.464 align:start size:50% position:50%
Louis, help him.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:14.167
No, get the fuck--
get the fuck off me, Louis.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.501 align:start size:31% position:69%
Louis, go.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start size:38% position:63%
Leave it be.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.271 align:end position:100%
You're exacerbating
the situation.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.273 align:end position:100%
(Young Bidness)
This shit
attached to?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.375
- It's probably--
- It's just a lot of slack.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.477 align:start position:0%
The cord is blending in
with the color of the carpet.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.245
- So what--what--
- Okay, I just think that--

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.781 align:end position:100%
Young Bidness, why don't
you drop the mic cable

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.383 align:start size:50% position:50%
and have a seat?

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.685
This is what we used to call
back in the Army a FUBAR.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.287 align:start position:0%
Let me just--okay,
let me just tell you--

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.389 align:end position:100%
No, get--
don't get involved.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.456 align:start position:0%
We have to get you
out of here.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.525 align:start position:0%
Amy, please,
can we just get--

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.595 align:start position:0%
Listen--
Here, If you let go of it...

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:43.596 align:start position:0%
Let me get in there.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.331 align:end position:100%
Don't get in it.
Don't--See?

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:46.399
I'm trying
to get around--

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.568 align:start position:0%
Don't step
on my jacket!

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.303 align:start size:66% position:34%
$1,500 jacket, bitch.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.737 align:start size:16% position:84%
Get--

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
Why do we have black cords
and a black carpet?

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.075 align:end position:100%
All right, well,
you motherfuckers--

00:02:56.108 --> 00:03:00.479
I told y'all I wasn't gonna--
Louis, I swear to fucking God!

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.215
We're gonna
take care of it.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.516
Just stay put.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.617 align:start position:0%
Now you got--

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.353 align:end position:100%
Now I seemed to have gotten
myself tangled in it.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.121 align:start size:56% position:44%
Don't--you ain't--

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.357 align:start size:50% position:50%
Get off me, man.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.325 align:start size:53% position:47%
Now it's just me.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start position:0%
Can I--may I help you?

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.460 align:start size:72% position:28%
Don't touch the jacket.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.528
I'm sorry.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.063 align:start size:63% position:38%
Look, okay, here's--

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.065
- Raise you knee.
- There's one end right here.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.267
- You got to get--Now--
- Hold on. I got bursitis.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.335 align:start position:0%
You know what?
Here.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.269 align:start position:0%
Here's what
we're gonna do.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.137 align:start position:0%
Have a seat here.
Put your fanny right here.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.139
- Don't say "fanny."
- There.

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:28.474
- There you go.
- All right.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.676 align:end size:66% position:66%
How you--You do it--
What, you do this--

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.677 align:start position:0%
Don't.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.112 align:end position:100%
You ain't taking
the pants off.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.480 align:end position:100%
Nicole, God damn it.
Where is Jerry?

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.349
This is some shit
right here.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.517 align:end position:100%
Same sound guy
for 27 years,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.619 align:start size:47% position:53%
and he vanishes
into thin air.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
All right,
all right, no.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.721 align:end position:100%
Nicole,
for God's sake.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:44.457 align:start position:0%
All right,
Louis, Louis.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.524
Hold that.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.194 align:end position:100%
Don't do anything
but hold that.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.528 align:start position:0%
Okay, no, no.
You got to put--

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start position:0%
No, nigga,

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.065 align:start position:0%
No, you can't take
the pants off over the shoes!

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.567 align:start position:0%
You can't take
the pants off over the shoes!

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.369 align:start position:0%
Louis, Louis,
get your white ass

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.370 align:start position:0%
out the motherfucker.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.272 align:start position:0%
You ain't
helping nobody.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.207
- All right, all right.
- I'm taking the shoes off.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.310 align:start position:0%
Okay, left one first.
All right, well...

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.345 align:end position:100%
do whatever the fuck you want,
then, nigga, fine.

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:09.081 align:start position:0%
Thank you.
One, two...

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.549 align:start position:0%
Thank you!

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start position:0%
I told y'all I wasn't
gonna talk about that shit!

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.924
We'll be right back
