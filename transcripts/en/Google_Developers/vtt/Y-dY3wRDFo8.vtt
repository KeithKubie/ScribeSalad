00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:10.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.960
My name is Jarek Wiliewicz.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.860
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.390
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.890
Let me first introduce
our hosts and guests.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.760
In the studio, I have
Jeremy Walker.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.150
JEREMY WALKER: All right.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.060
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.510
JEREMY WALKER: I'm
doing great.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.930
I'm doing good.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.355
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I hear you've
been traveling lately.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:26.130
JEREMY WALKER: Yep.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.880
I've been gone in Brazil for the
last seven to eight days.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What were
you doing in Brazil?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.130
JEREMY WALKER: I was
going around

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.510
promoting the YouTube APIs.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000
So I went to a bunch
of cities--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.420
Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.950
And I talked to a lot of
developer groups about using

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.490
the YouTube APIs.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are you going
to show us any samba

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.053
moves later on in this
broadcast that you

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:44.240
picked up in Brazil?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.205
JEREMY WALKER: I left those with
the drinking in Brazil.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:47.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, I see.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.105
Well, I am disappointed.

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:49.200
JEREMY WALKER: [CHUCKLING]

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.865
Then we have Jeff Posnick
joining us live from New York.

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.812
How are you doing, Jeff?

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:57.070
JEFFREY POSNICK: I'm
doing very well.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.880
Hopefully looking higher
quality today

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.955
than in previous weeks--

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.180
like full 720p right now.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.035
And I hope it comes across.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:07.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Indeed.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.100
I am told you are looking
fantastic today.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.565
JEFFREY POSNICK: [CHUCKLING]

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:12.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.880
And then let me introduce our
guests who have joined us from

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.940
Florida and Chicago,
I understand.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.640
PHIL HARRIS: Yes.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.392
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Phil.

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:21.190
PHIL HARRIS: Hi.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.590
I'm Phil Harris, CEO
of Geofeedia.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And Scott.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.885
SCOTT MITCHELL: And Scott
Mitchell, CTO of Geofeedia.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:28.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right--
and then, Scott,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.185
you are based in--

00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:30.430
SCOTT MITCHELL: Naples,
Florida--

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.705
sunny Naples, Florida.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:33.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Unlike the
rainy northern California?

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.010
SCOTT MITCHELL: Unlike
it is here.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.730
We were hoping for some sunny
weather but instead got some

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.210
rain, but not so bad.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I like the
rain here in the winter.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.400
I think otherwise the downside
is drought in the summer.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.230
And then, Phil, you
live in Chicago?

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.200
PHIL HARRIS: In Chicago.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.370
And our business team
is gearing up for

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.470
a pretty cold winter.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.330
So let's chat a little bit
about your product.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.160
I wanted to start off with
a simple question.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.590
What is the problem you're
trying to solve?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.110
And then maybe get into how did
you come up with the idea.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.010
PHIL HARRIS: Great.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.490
Thanks, Jarek.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.180
First of all, thank you
very much, Google,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.420
for having us today.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.800
Google's a wonderful partner,
and especially the YouTube

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.600
team-- so appreciate, Jeremy,
all the support.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.130
Geofeedia provides social media
search and location

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.380
monitoring by physical
location.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.310
We aggregate social media across
multiple different

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.000
social data sets to provide
businesses--

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.920
we're a business tool-- to
provide businesses insights

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.090
about what's happening at their
physical locations.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.900
So any business, government
agency, or other group that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.340
has a physical location would
find value in the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.590
Geofeedia data set.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880
We aggregate data from many
different sources, YouTube

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.030
being one of them.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.980
And unlike traditional social
media listening tools, which

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.450
are text-based--

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.190
keyword and hashtag based--

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.140
we incorporate lots of video,
imagery, to give businesses

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.870
not only a text-based repository
of data to mine,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.950
but also imagery, imagery about
what's happening at

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.820
their restaurant, what's
happening at their store,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.830
what's happening
at their event.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.110
There's a saying, a picture
tells a thousand words.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.330
Well, with Geofeedia,
you can quickly

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.420
assess what's happening.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.770
So we provide a very different
way of looking at that social

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.720
media data set compared to the
traditional social media

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.520
listening tools, which are
keyword and hashtag-based.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Very
interesting.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.520
So a picture is worth
a thousand words.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.000
So how much is a video worth?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.250
PHIL HARRIS: 10 times as much.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.050
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What about
video at 60 frames per second?

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.210
PHIL HARRIS: It's
worth way more.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.030
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.830
So very interesting.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.170
So how did you come
up with the idea?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.400
PHIL HARRIS: Well, we are
technology executives on the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.830
technical side and the
business side.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.330
And one of the complaints we
kept hearing from brand

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.450
managers and other purchasers
and users of social media

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.820
listening tools was that they
didn't find the data relevant

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.050
and actionable.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.450
These tools aggregate
lots of data.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.930
So the goal is to incorporate
as much data as possible.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.829
And then the business would
get graphs and charts on

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.360
different things happening--

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.850
on aggregate volume.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.630
When you really ask them
candidly if it's of use, they

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.980
say, well, we need to know
what's happening.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.670
But very little of it is
actionable, meaning there's

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.340
things that, really, we
can take action on

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.570
and make use of.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.790
What we're trying to do is
filter out the vast majority

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.190
of data and only collect
information happening at a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.920
customer's physical location.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.350
So that person has experienced
a retail experience, a brand

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.230
experience.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.000
And we only collect

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.400
information from that location.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.590
So it's much more contextual.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.820
And what we're hearing is that
when a consumer visits a

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.720
store, for example, and
experiences it and then gives

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.920
feedback, the brand manager
is saying that's much more

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.250
valuable than someone who
never visited the store

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.960
commenting on the store.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.825
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:12.110
PHIL HARRIS: It's
very contextual.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So should we
take a look at a demo before

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.830
we drill into more of others?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.900
PHIL HARRIS: I think
we should jump in.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.010
And I'll turn it over to Scott
Mitchell, Geofeedia's CTO.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.940
JEREMY WALKER: Scott,
you have the floor.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.340
SCOTT MITCHELL: Let's
jump right in.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.300
All right, so as Phil described,
Geofeedia is a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.480
search by location tool.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.430
So we allow you to locate a
position on a map and find

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.630
different tweets, pictures,
and videos that are within

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.240
that location.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.420
Before I start the demo, I'll
preface it by saying we're

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.250
querying live real
public data.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.710
So anything that we see
and the results.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.316
It may get a little
goosy at times.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:57.840
So this could get interesting.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.970
Right here we can see on the
map view Geofeedia's main

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.960
interface for starting
a query.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.670
So just like Google starts you
on their home page with a

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.550
search box to type in a keyword,
with Geofeedia, since

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.350
our searches are not
keyword-based, they're

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.620
location-based, we start
you with a map.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.940
And in the most simple
form, users search

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.970
the map with a circle.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.960
And the circle can be expanded,
contracted, and

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.290
shifted around the map.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.790
And then the blue button there
in the middle of the circle

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.480
runs the query.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.980
As this query's running, the
system is going out and

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.620
finding pictures from Instagram,
videos from

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.060
YouTube, photos from
Flickr, and tweets.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.930
And it's only looking for
posts that are geotagged

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.280
within this area.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.040
So we're filtering out, as Phil
said, a lot of the noise

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.410
that comes in regular searches
that users might do with

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.550
standard keyword or hashtag
queries for items that might

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.600
be in, say, Midtown Manhattan.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I see
the query completed.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.940
And then items that were found
are shown as those little

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.310
thumbnails on the map?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.860
SCOTT MITCHELL: That's
correct.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.890
There are pins located on the
map with their exact geotagged

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.705
location of where they were
posted by the user.

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:17.640
JEREMY WALKER: You can filter
sources, right?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.270
SCOTT MITCHELL: Yep.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.540
And right now we're showing by
default the first 100 or the

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.250
most recent 100 posts
in this area.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.310
So you see a lot of tweets and
Instagram photos as the

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.060
primary activity.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.200
But let's turn those off
and get down to--

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.790
maybe we're interested in just
looking at YouTube videos.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.830
So I can easily turn off those
other sources and immediately

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.070
get to just the YouTube
videos that are within

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.780
this region as well.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.980
And again, these are videos that
are geotagged at these

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.220
locations, some of which may
have been taken by users on

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.370
their mobile phone and uploaded
directly to YouTube

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.860
through their mobile phone.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.410
Others may have been uploaded to
YouTube and then geotagged

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.656
through the YouTube.com
interface.

00:07:58.656 --> 00:07:59.900
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is
there a temporal

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.310
dimension to this as well?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.890
Can people request only recent
tweets or videos?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.210
Or how does that work?

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.120
SCOTT MITCHELL: Yep.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.670
There's also different ways to
filter the content and drill

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.240
down further than just
the sources.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.610
And if we look at the date
filters here, we can query for

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.360
items that were posted between
a date range, before a

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.960
particular date range, or
after a particular date.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.400
So we can get very granular
in terms of

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.010
date and source filtering.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.360
And then also we have
the ability to

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.610
break the content down.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.799
We can fine-tune it even more
by applying some x query

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.080
filters to the raw data.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.500
That's an advanced feature.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.790
But it lets users query on any
of the metadata that's tied to

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.400
these videos--

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.890
title, author, more on the
dates, descriptions.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.360
Or any of the data that we get
back from the YouTube Atom

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.580
result, we can apply an x query
to the result and filter

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.780
the videos based on that.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.090
JEREMY WALKER: And obviously,
when you click on one of

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.390
these, you can watch
the video.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.490
Or with the other social
products, you can look at

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.370
pictures or whatever
that was posted.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.030
SCOTT MITCHELL: So a couple
different ways to do that.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.760
One is in this map view, we
can hover over the pins.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.680
And we can see a description of
each item and a play button

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.810
that will play the video
right in line.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.540
The other option to view this
data is to look at our collage

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.810
view, which is a
Pinterest-inspired view of the

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.870
data, if you will.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.940
And let's just turn on some
Picasa photos here, too, so we

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.750
can see what it looks like
with photos and videos

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.080
interspersed together.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.660
And in this view, is it's
a different way

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.400
to look at the data.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.670
Instead of hovering around the
pins on the map, you can

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.890
consume it all at once
and scroll down.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.560
You can see as we get to the
bottom of the page, it will

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.080
load more items in an infinite
scrolling manner.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.900
So like I said, we're looking
at the most recent 100 in

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.060
reverse chronological order.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.930
And it continues to
load farther and

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.220
farther back in time.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.250
The nice thing about YouTube
and Picasa is that they've

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.690
been around for years
and years and years.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.880
So we've seen data from both
these sources going back to

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.700
2006 that people are able
to find with our tool.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.460
And that's useful for our
customers that are interested

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.580
in doing research at particular
areas, journalists

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.890
that are looking for information
from locations,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.570
and also just any sort of
business intelligence that you

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.890
might need to apply.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you
mentioned that the way you

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.040
present the data makes
it actionable.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.090
So what are the typical actions
that the people take?

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.410
I mean, when I see this
Pinterest-like view, what are

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.890
the use cases?

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.550
And are you helping with
any of these to kind of

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.720
get to the next step?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.610
PHIL HARRIS: Sure.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.940
It depends on the
organization.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.100
But it could be a customer
service related issue.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.220
It could be in the area
of law enforcement.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.040
There could be some criminal
activity that happens in a

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.780
certain location.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.530
It could be some other
level of crisis,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.820
like Hurricane Sandy.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:22.170
We saw an extraordinary amount
of usage to help save people

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.800
that were stranded
in their houses.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.190
So emergency responders
used it quite heavily.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.930
So when something happens
at a place, this

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.100
is real-time activity--

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.620
real-time intelligence.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.730
And because much of it is in
picture form, it does require

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.700
some level of judgment and
decision-making from an

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.600
individual.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.570
But there are trends that we
look at to trigger people to

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.860
look at geographies depending
on activity-- depending on

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.390
certain things happening within
that geography as well

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.350
to alert them that there is
actually something that they

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.640
should look at right now.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.240
You could look at some aggregate
metrics-- for

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.120
example, high number of videos
or tweets posted from a

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.170
specific area.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.630
PHIL HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But with
respect to their content, this

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.210
is where the human comes into
the picture and they have

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:13.620
better judgment.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.300
PHIL HARRIS: I think so.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.800
And an example would be for
Hurricane Sandy, there was a

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.350
Picasa picture, I think, that
surfaced that said that the

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.750
86th Street subway terminal
had flooded.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.700
There was only one image.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.930
Nobody else was talking
about it.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.870
With our tool, we drew a
geo-fence around that area.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.390
There was nothing else.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.810
If the 86th Street subway
terminal had flooded in

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.520
Manhattan, I think more than
one person would be

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.300
commenting on it.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.190
So it ended up being false.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.350
Someone had Photoshopped
something or

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.230
mocked up an imagery.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.990
On the flip side, there was a
lot of activity from Point

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.440
Pleasant, New Jersey, claiming
on homes getting bombarded

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440
with waves and whatnot.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.740
And when you drew a geofeed,
which is what we call this

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.520
virtual perimeter around
a physical location.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.120
Around Point Pleasant, New
Jersey, you could clearly see

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.880
that waves were literally
crashing into beachside homes

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.830
and destroying them.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.760
And there was not just one.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.230
There were dozens of them.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So it sounds
like this actually greatly

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.470
improves the quality
of the information.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.640
PHIL HARRIS: Yes.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Interesting.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.690
PHIL HARRIS: Because it's
all related to a place.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.330
Sorry I interrupted your train
of thought, Scott.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.010
SCOTT MITCHELL: Great
questions.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.070
When you see the tool in action
and actually start

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.710
using it, I think it conjures
up a whole set of thoughts

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.140
around, all right, I can get
this YouTube data and these

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.710
videos now by location in a way
that I couldn't before.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.730
And it's interesting to search
by keyword and do that on

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.040
YouTube dot com and
through Google.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.420
But it's also very interesting
to look at different places

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.930
that have some sort of intrigue
to you, whether it's

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.900
your alma mater or it's your
hometown or it's your favorite

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.560
vacation spot or if it's part
of your job, like Phil

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.090
mentioned for first responders,
crisis management,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.770
even retail locations looking
to get some intelligence.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.930
So no problem with
the questions.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.670
So we'll flip again back
over to the map.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.590
And the circle search is
one that we showed.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.910
We also have the ability to
narrow down into a very

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.790
specific polygon.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.670
So we can draw these complex
polygons and also search

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.190
within those.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:31.320
There is no limit to the level
of detail you can get down to.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.910
We can search within the
proximity of a phone booth, if

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.930
you need to.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.200
We can also go out as wide
as five kilometers--

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.770
so flexible search
tools there.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.180
And as Phil mentioned, too, we
talk about these as geofeeds.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.880
So you have the area that you're
interested in, whether

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.750
its the circle or the polygon
or the square of the map.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.000
Once you save that, you've
saved the geofeed.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.950
And that geofeed can be viewed
in a few different ways.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.690
One is on this map view,
along with the collage.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.255
And you can see the
search results.

00:15:04.255 --> 00:15:06.610
I can flip back over there.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.130
Suppose that we're
a journalist.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.900
And we're covering a particular
event that's

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.420
happened at this location.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.940
It might not be reasonable to
expect the journalist to pull

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.600
up this geofeed and continue to
refresh the page to see the

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.940
most recent items that are
coming into this area.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.360
So to solve that, we've also
built a bit of a different

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.500
view of a geofeed, which is
here that I'm showing.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.890
This is our geo-streamer tool,
which streams the results of a

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.200
geofeed live to your desktop
through the browser.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.820
So you can see now we're looking
at a little bit of a

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.750
different area on the map view
with different pins appearing

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.110
on the map.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.970
And if I just collapse that map
view, since this is a very

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.450
active area, we'll see
new things pop in to

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.730
the top of this feed.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.270
Again, back to that journalist
scenario.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.730
Suppose you're covering a few
months back when it was the

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.390
shooting at the Empire
State Building.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.870
And there were journalists
getting onto the tool and

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.800
searching within that vicinity
to see what live photos and

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.180
tweets were being posted from
people that were actually at

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.590
the location.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.820
This is a very helpful
technology to get at that

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.580
right away.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.115
They're already doing it with
tools like TweetDeck to see

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.830
the live streams
of information.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.305
This complements that so that
they can look at it and pull

00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:30.750
in data also from an area--

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.343
not just by keyword.

00:16:33.343 --> 00:16:34.786
JEREMY WALKER: That's great.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.850
SCOTT MITCHELL: So I'd also like
to get into some of the

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.200
ways that Geofeedia
leverages Google.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.660
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, I noticed
you had a couple extra tabs on

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.950
what you're actually using--

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.550
the YouTube APIs.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.260
So you're using the version 2
of the Data API, correct?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.590
SCOTT MITCHELL: That's right.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.130
We're using YouTube's v2.0.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.390
And particularly related to
that, we're using the location

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.180
search elements.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.560
So you'll find this in the v2.0
documentation for the

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.040
video search.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.849
I'm in that section
on this document.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.940
And you'll see information on
how to use the location

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.730
element, the location
query parameter.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.000
This parameter, we use it to
specify the radius of the

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.700
search area that we're looking
for around the particular

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.079
latitude, longitude that the
customer is looking at.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.200
And then from there, we further
refine the results to

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.200
make sure that they only fit in
the exact polygon that the

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.560
user wants.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.010
And then also, I should
mention--

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.220
I'm not sure if all developers
are even aware of this-- but

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.930
we do use the Google
Hosted Libraries.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.730
You can search for
that on Google.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.870
And you'll end up at this page
that shows the variety of

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.810
JavaScript libraries
that are hosted by

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.340
Google on Google servers.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.430
We use jQuery.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.880
We use the jQuery hosted
libraries.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.750
So that's been great for us to
be able to offload that and

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.520
pull it very quickly.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.190
Speed is something that's super
important to us in terms

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.180
of page-load times
for our users.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.440
So we definitely like to offload
as much of that from

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.900
our servers as possible.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.510
Google provides one way
to do that for us.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.210
And then also, Google-inspired
technology that we've built

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.930
comes in the form of portability
for our geofeeds.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.710
So we talked about being able to
search and see the results

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.720
in the collage on the map,
being able to stream.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.430
We also have APIs around
these geofeeds as well.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.060
And these were, like I said,
inspired by Google's, YouTube,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.210
and Picasa APIs, where we
decided our geofeeds should be

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.720
portable in an RSS
and Atom format.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.670
So we've been able to build
output methods that with the

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:03.010
same URL requests, we can
respond with an Atom response.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.150
And it's formatted as GeoRSS.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.000
So if you take that Atom
response and actually just

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.830
dump it into a Google map
like we've done here--

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.630
all I've done in this Google
Maps screen is put the URL to

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.090
our Atom feed in the
search box there.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.280
And you can see how Google
Maps shows--

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.230
JEREMY WALKER: Just hit back.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.770
I think we hit the microphone,
so it thought--

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.450
SCOTT MITCHELL: Oh.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.730
JEREMY WALKER: Now
just hit forward.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.616
We'll try that again.

00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:33.670
I think the microphone thought
you were trying

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.420
to search on that.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.320
So yeah, there we go.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.710
SCOTT MITCHELL: I'll pull
it back up here.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.930
So Google Maps shows our feeds
just as you would see them in

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.260
the map view on Geofeedia.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:48.890
And then also I know version 3.0
of the YouTube API's out

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.770
there in experimental mode and
looking at things like JSON as

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.060
a response format.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.580
And we've done the same thing
as well with our geofeeds to

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.090
make them accessible through
APIs in JSON format so that

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.706
they can be consumed very easily
on the JavaScript side.

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:07.850
JEREMY WALKER: So I take it you
guys haven't messed around

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.910
yet with the version
3.0 of the APIs.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.740
SCOTT MITCHELL: No.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.370
We would like to
get into that.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.360
There's some things that we've
talked about that are

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.740
attractive to us, especially the
JSON formatting and also

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.200
the ability to specify what
gets returned back in the

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.730
response from Google so that
we can optimize the payload

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.560
and the speed at which
we can process that.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.390
We want to minimize as much as
possible the amount of data

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.130
going across the wire and
the amount of data

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.990
that we need to process.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.760
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.720
SCOTT MITCHELL: So the features
of v3.0 that allow us

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.010
to only get back the elements
in the nodes that we need in

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.490
that payload is something
that's very attractive.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.290
So we'll be looking at that
as soon as you tell me

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:51.930
it's ready to go.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.874
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:20:52.874 --> 00:20:54.290
[CHUCKLING]

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.570
I'm curious, what are you guys
using on the back end to

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.815
handle all of this?

00:20:57.815 --> 00:21:02.500
SCOTT MITCHELL: We are, I'll
say, a 90% Microsoft stack.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.390
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:09.310
SCOTT MITCHELL: So we have a
host of servers in the cloud

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.750
that we run Microsoft
ASP.NET, MVC.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.300
SQL Server is the back
end database.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.500
The other percentage of our
stack that is not Microsoft

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.510
runs on Linux, uses RabbitMQ
for very high speed, high

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.310
throughput, highly available
queuing system.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.460
As you can imagine with the
streamer, getting thousands

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.180
and tens of thousands of people
streaming content at

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.980
one time is a solution that is
very difficult to scale to.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.760
So we needed that
availability.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.540
And we went away from
Microsoft for that.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.340
That's working well.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:51.900
And then we're also looking at
Cassandra as a way to handle

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.420
much bigger data than
we are today.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.000
So that's farther out
in our future.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.890
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.840
So I'm curious.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.181
Was there anything you've ran
into that surprised you when

00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:07.610
you were using our APIs that
you could share with us in

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:08.880
your experiences?

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.130
SCOTT MITCHELL: Yes.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.350
We love Google technologies.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.610
We're fully baked into Google
Apps as a company,

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.970
using that and Gmail.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.090
But it's not just because
we like Google.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.140
We would like the response.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.460
We like the speed.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.720
We like the durability
of it all.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.380
So I couldn't think of a way to
really convey that except

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:42.360
to show the results that we see
between the YouTube and

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.990
the Picasa APIs and the other
APIs that we use our system.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:52.050
So we constantly monitor the
response times on those API

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.190
calls that we make
to retrieve data.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.160
And I've graphed those
out here over time.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.580
And you can see that the YouTube
response times are

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.230
very consistent.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.070
There are some peaks
and valleys there.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.700
But for the most part, those
are very bearable for

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.005
systems like ours.

00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:11.090
And they range around
the 300 to 400

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.090
millisecond range there.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.620
Picasa's a little bit higher
but equally consistent.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:22.350
And you can see the other APIs
in the gray are not nearly as

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.160
consistent and four to
five times slower.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.730
So going into this, we didn't
know what to expect in terms

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:36.290
of building a tool that mashed
up data from different APIs

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.190
and the response time that
we'd get on those.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.900
But we were surprised to see
that YouTube and Picasa were

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.720
so consistent or so stable.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.510
This chart doesn't show the
number of errors that each one

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.620
of these APIs returns.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.950
But I can tell you that YouTube
and Picasa are an

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:58.420
order of magnitude, or more,
better than the other APIs

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.730
even in terms of their errors.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think the
peaks correspond to various

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.480
videos going viral.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.470
In fact, I think the last one
is Psy's "Gangnam Style."

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.180
SCOTT MITCHELL: Really?

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.865
I heard Jeremy knows
that dance.

00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:11.675
Yeah, the mambo.

00:24:11.675 --> 00:24:12.240
But he knows that one.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I just got
back from South Korea, so I

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.200
couldn't resist that comment.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.180
[CHUCKLING]

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.440
JEREMY WALKER: Wow, that's
pretty neat.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.070
I guess, do you have anything
you'd share with the audience

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.390
of people who are
going to start

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.470
integrating with the APIs?

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.810
Like any kernels that you could
throw to them that you

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.330
think they should think about
as they start their

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.970
integration?

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.490
SCOTT MITCHELL: I'd say the
documentation that we are

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:42.450
looking at before for the
YouTube API version 2.0.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:47.280
Definitely spend the time
reading this, researching it,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.590
looking at it, understanding
it.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.950
It's very easy.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.600
Google makes it very easy to
jump into an API, write a URL,

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.420
get your data back and
begin using it.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.910
There's nuances, though, of
those APIs that can really

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.490
help you out, really help you
get to the exact data you

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.510
need, help you filter
your data.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.710
And it seems to also be
something that is--

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.860
at least the documentation, I'm
not so sure about the back

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.940
end-- but it gets better
over time.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.130
So it's not something that is
out there and is static and

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.970
never changes month
after month.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.960
This documentation is this
constantly evolving.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.900
So revisiting it.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.050
Now I'm constantly going back
and looking at the location

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.770
query parameter usage and making
sure that we're doing

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.470
that and using the best
practices that Google

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.030
recommends.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.400
So I think staying current
with the documentation,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.200
reading it, and understanding
it before jumping

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.266
in is key to success.

00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:46.220
JEREMY WALKER: Well, great.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.410
Thanks for the demo and kind
of talking a little

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.790
bit about the API.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.610
This is great stuff.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.800
And it's really interesting
to see that graph.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And we'll
definitely pass our

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.720
documentation feedback to our
documentation guy, Andy.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.695
JEREMY WALKER: He'll be happy to
know somebody's reading it.

00:26:02.695 --> 00:26:03.120
[LAUGHING]

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, we get
a lot of very good feedback

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.940
for the quality of his work.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.340
All right, so should we
transition to Jeff's Stack

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.760
Overflow question
of the week now?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.600
JEREMY WALKER: Sure.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.950
Did you have anything else
you wanted to add?

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.980
I know we were talking
a little bit about

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.940
the technical side.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.470
And we really dove into that.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.980
But I just wanted to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.805
PHIL HARRIS: No, that's great.

00:26:25.805 --> 00:26:27.470
I appreciate that.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.180
What we're seeing is with the
proliferation of smart phones

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.640
that have geolocation services
combined with the app

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.120
developers, like YouTube and
Picasa, promoting geolocation

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.820
services within the application
environment.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.180
We think that this
location-based data set will

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.130
become richer and richer
over time.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:58.660
So we're very excited to work
with Google to make that a

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.970
reality and to provide
that richer

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.680
experience for our customers.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.540
So we couldn't be more excited
about the trends, about the

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.210
power of social media.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.265
Like all new destructive
technology, it's not perfect.

00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:16.600
It requires a certain amount
of education on when to use

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.830
geolocation services and
when not to use it,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.150
especially for children.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.770
So we're just very, very excited
about working together

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.240
to make that data set richer
and richer and letting

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.985
consumers voices be heard
by businesses.

00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:34.550
I think it's important point
here, is that if you're

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:40.500
experiencing something at a
McDonald's real-time, and you

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.450
express yourself either through
a video or through a

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:47.740
picture, wouldn't it be great
if you heard back from a

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.630
McDonald's person addressing
your complaint real-time while

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.480
you had that experience?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:57.200
Even if it was a virtual type
complaint or maybe compliment

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.230
even, that real-time voice, I
think we allow that to be

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.620
amplified through.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.960
Obviously we would be nowhere
if we didn't have the

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.300
underlying data set.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.040
But provided we have the data
set, we can allow those

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.100
consumers' voices to be heard
more broadly by businesses.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And actually,
this reminds me of a

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.700
point that one of our guests
made on this show earlier.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.440
Link TV, they were talking
about the paper that they

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.050
published about how people view
user generated media.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.730
And I think that the key part
that appeals especially to

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.980
certain demographics, like
younger people, is the

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.800
authenticity of it.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.280
PHIL HARRIS: Yes.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I think
with your solution, you can

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:45.390
actually filter out the noise
by overlaying the geo

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.410
information on top of content
that may be coming from

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.370
sources that are not necessarily
authentic.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.480
I mean, there could be bots
tweeting and things like that.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.550
So I think that takes care of
actually filtering it out.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.280
But then in and of itself,
I think the content is

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.160
considered authentic by people
who care about and therefore

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.270
should be more important to the
businesses that use it.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.820
PHIL HARRIS: You bring up
an outstanding point.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.870
There's a broad trend called
citizen journalism.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:18.020
And in unprecedented ways,
YouTube, Picasa users can

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:26.970
express themselves with more
authenticity, with context

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.620
related to a place.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.360
And that power makes it that
much more real for the

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.760
consumer of that information
because it's more authentic.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.390
And it's more real.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.640
And it's real time.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.620
It's real time.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.220
This is unprecedented
in human history.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All
right, great.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.870
So I know Jeff has been getting
a little bored with us

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.360
doing all the talking out
in New York City.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.140
Jeff, are you still there?

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.520
JEFFREY POSNICK: It's
interesting stuff, absolutely.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.890
And very interesting stuff
about Geofeedia.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.650
So I've been listening
intently.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.840
And I'd be happy to talk about
the Stack Overflow question of

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.775
the week now.

00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:06.123
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Let's go for it.

00:30:06.123 --> 00:30:09.270
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:15.020
So kind of one question I've
been engaging with mostly is

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:20.420
something about using what we,
I guess, now refer to as

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.120
legacy YouTube usernames within
version 3.0 of the API.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.030
So folks are familiar with the
older version 1.0 or 2.0 of

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:36.680
the API probably know you can
construct a request URL using

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.930
gdata.youtube.co
m///googledevelopers.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.440
And you can put the
Google Developers

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.890
username in the URL.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.950
And you can get the uploads feed
for Google Developers,

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.790
things like that.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.470
You can do that for any
YouTube username.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.470
Version 3.0-- things are
a little different.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:56.000
We don't actually accept legacy
YouTube usernames as

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.300
part of either the request URLs
or as part of the request

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.710
parameters anymore.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.730
Everything is done via
these channel IDs.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.545
Channel IDs work, I suppose, in
version 2.0 of the API, but

00:31:08.545 --> 00:31:11.320
tended not to be used
quite as much.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.550
So the question comes from
Mark Costello, a Stack

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.610
Overflow user.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.020
And he just wanted to know
what's the best way of

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.220
translating from a legacy
YouTube username into a

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.250
channel ID that you can then
use with version 3.0.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.405
This question was actually
answered by Matthias, who's

00:31:31.405 --> 00:31:35.170
kind of one of our Google
Developer experts for YouTube.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.490
So thank you, Matthias for
initially providing the

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.650
response there.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.445
And basically what Matthias
said was doing a search.

00:31:42.445 --> 00:31:45.850
You know, we now have universal
search in the

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.300
YouTube API starting
with version 3.0.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.180
So you can search for channels
via the same

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.830
search dot list method.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.250
And you can pass in that YouTube
username as one of the

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.190
parameters for the
query string.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.800
And you'll get back
one or more--

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.930
like 0 or more--

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.830
channel resources showing
you all the

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.390
channels that match it.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.510
So this kind of works
as you'd expect.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.470
Although there is obviously
some catches.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.640
You might pass in what you think
was a unique YouTube

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.560
username, or at least was a
unique YouTube username in

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.610
version 2.0.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.900
And you might get multiple
results back when you're doing

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.900
this search in version 3.0
because you're not doing an

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.990
exact match, basically.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.880
There could be multiple things
that you'll get.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.790
Or alternatively, maybe you're
passing in a display name to

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.060
the search method.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.740
And you're getting back multiple
results because there

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.690
happens to be a lot of people
who have the John Smith

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.500
display name as part of
their display name for

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.040
their channel now.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.930
So you get back multiple
results

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.680
potentially in this case.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.020
So you just need to be aware of
that potential for getting

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.060
multiple results.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.080
We actually do have a feature
request in with the

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.090
engineering team to instead of
kind of do a search for any

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.680
sort of channel that matches a
string to let you pass in a

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.530
specific legacy username and
get back the one specific

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.400
channel that that corresponds to
in version 3.0 of the API.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.060
I haven't actually heard back
from the engineering team if

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.260
that's going to be
implemented yet.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.690
So I'm afraid we don't have a
better solution right now.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.380
But you can definitely try to
do that search call from

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.010
version 3.0.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.010
And hopefully, you'll get
something that works well

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.590
enough for you.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.810
So that's pretty much what
I want to cover for that.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.930
Definitely let us know about
any questions that you have

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.120
with version 3.0 of the data
API, any of the other YouTube

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.950
APIs on Stack Overflow.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.770
I really like interacting
with folks there.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.800
And just be sure that you're
tagging your question with

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.490
YouTube dash API when you
post on Stack Overflow.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.310
And that way, our team
will see it.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.870
And hopefully, we'll be able
to give you an answer.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:55.860
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
That's great.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.210
JEFFREY POSNICK: That's
it for me.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you
for covering the Stack

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.925
Overflow question of the week.

00:34:01.925 --> 00:34:05.110
As always, Jeff, very
interesting stuff.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.360
And then we just have a couple
of more minutes left.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.540
So let's look at the
moderator to see

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.915
if we have any questions.

00:34:11.915 --> 00:34:18.460
So I see one question that is
relevant from Jeremy Walker--

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.300
sounds familiar.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.179
"Is YouTube Google Developer
relations hiring?" So I will

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.179
take a stab at that.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:29.409
The answer is yes, we are
hiring, both YouTube and

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.800
Developer relations
as well as Google.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.370
To find out more information,
go to

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.000
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.010
And you can see all the
different types of positions

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.969
that we have available.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.170
And we definitely encourage
you to apply.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.449
It's a fun team to work on.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:48.530
Sometimes we get to do even more
stuff that is fun, like

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.429
traveling to Brazil
and dancing samba.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.679
JEREMY WALKER: Yep.

00:34:53.372 --> 00:34:56.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But we're
definitely looking for people

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.060
to join our team.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.730
So I think this is
it for this week.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.450
MALE SPEAKER: Actually, we have
some questions on YouTube

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.700
for the Geofeedia guests.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.280
So there are questions around
Social Media for Good.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.910
People are seeing that Geofeedia
is a process that

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.490
they can use to react to the
type of disasters, to work

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:14.860
with things like that.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.010
How do you guys see Geofeedia
working with

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.230
Social Media for Good?

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.740
And how has that been related
to your story so far?

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.340
PHIL HARRIS: That's an
outstanding question.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:31.600
Geofeedia is being used today
for emergency responders,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.660
volunteer organizations, to help
provide relief, whether

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.090
it's just any humanitarian
effort.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:45.240
So we feel really good about
our providing data to those

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.500
organizations like FEMA, Red
Cross, all across the EU,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.410
third world countries,
et cetera.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:57.050
One of the issues with emergency
responders is where

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.500
do you allocate your
resources?

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.160
What areas are most impacted?

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.720
And minutes, hours, can mean
life or death for some people

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.360
who are impacted.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.920
They might not have
clean water.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.730
They might be stranded
in a house.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:16.300
So anything we can do to get
our tool into the hands of

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.050
humanitarian organizations,
relief organizations, is a big

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.130
win for us.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:27.970
So we were in Washington, DC
recently at the World Bank for

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.680
a presentation on
crisis response.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.650
And we had worldwide
organizations there

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.530
looking on the tool.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.610
And we're happy to say that
it's being utilized in

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.420
real-time events like Hurricane
Sandy and other

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.890
situations around the globe.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.290
Any other questions coming in
from the YouTube audience?

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.530
MALE SPEAKER: We
have feedback.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.522
People love Geofeedia and
what they're doing.

00:36:54.522 --> 00:36:56.110
But beyond that, no additional
questions.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.335
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:36:57.335 --> 00:37:00.940
PHIL HARRIS: I guess I have
one more comment.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.720
If you'd like a Geofeedia trial
account, you can go to

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.880
geofeedia.com and
request a trial.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.840
We are coming up on our
two year anniversary.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.310
But most of that time, frankly,
has been Scott and

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:19.550
his team in a dark cave coding
and working on building what

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.860
you saw today.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:26.250
So we commercially launched the
product earlier this year.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.370
And we've been overwhelmed
by the response.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:33.720
But we realize businesses and
relief organizations can do

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.000
great things to hear
the consumer voice.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.280
So if you have an interest in
our product, we'd be happy to

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.430
issue you a trial account.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.490
And of course, you can access
all that great YouTube

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.780
video-rich content in there and
Picasa imagery in there.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.140
So we're very excited to
have you as a partner.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.110
Thank you very much.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.770
I hope you will give
preference to the

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:55.680
viewers of this show.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.100
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.410
PHIL HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
so let me try that again.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.210
I think this is it.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.521
[LAUGHING]

00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:03.605
PHIL HARRIS: Sorry.

00:38:03.605 --> 00:38:07.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And we'll see
you again next week, same

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.800
place, same time, 10:00
AM Pacific.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.320
Thank you.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.220
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you all.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Bye.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:43.867
