00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:08.167
Narrator: PICTURES ON 3-D CUPS
HAVE DEPTH AND APPEAR TO MOVE,

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.467
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE
YOU VIEW THEM.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.033
IT'S A NEAT TRICK MADE POSSIBLE

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.267
BY A TECHNOLOGY
KNOWN AS LENTICULAR PRINTING.

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:19.434
A SHEET OF TINY PLASTIC LENSES
IS APPLIED TO INTERLACED IMAGES,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:22.767
CREATING A KIND OF GRAPHIC MAGIC
TO ENTERTAIN YOU.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.200
A 3-D CUP FOOLS THE EYE.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.701
VIEWED FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES,

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.267
THE ARTWORK SEEMS
TO COME TO LIFE.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.767
IT'S ALL A CAREFULLY
CRAFTED ILLUSION.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.801
MAKING 3-D CUPS STARTS
WITH CLEAR PLASTIC PELLETS.

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.767
AN EXTRUDER MACHINE MELTS
THE PELLETS

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.334
TO A SEMI-LIQUID CONSISTENCY.

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:52.801
AN ENGRAVING CYLINDER FORMS IT
INTO ROWS OF TINY CONVEX LENSES.

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.267
WATER-CHILLED CYLINDERS
COOL THE SHEET OF LENSES.

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.267
THIS SOLIDIFIES THE PLASTIC,

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.934
THEN A GAUGE MEASURES
THE LENSES' THICKNESS.

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:05.868
A BLOWER DEVICE
DISSIPATES STATIC.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:09.100
AN INK-JET PRINTER PRINTS
INFORMATION ON THE EDGE.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.300
THIS INDICATES THE OPTICAL
RESOLUTION OF THE LENSES,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.834
THE TYPE OF PLASTIC,
AND THE LOT NUMBER.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:20.767
THEN A ROTARY BLADE
CUTS THE PLASTIC INTO SHEETS.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.234
THE SHEETS LAND IN A NEAT STACK.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:28.968
♪♪

00:01:28.968 --> 00:01:31.567
TO CONFIRM THEIR SIZE
AND ALIGNMENT,

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:36.801
AN INSPECTOR VIEWS THEM AGAINST
A PITCH TEST PATTERN.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.667
ANOTHER INSPECTOR MAGNIFIES
A SAMPLE 100 TIMES

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.267
AND MEASURES THE THICKNESS
OF THE LENSES.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.934
TOO THIN OR THICK,

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:47.901
AND THE LENS DISPLAY
WON'T FOCUS.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:50.467
WITH A LENS STRIP CLAMPED
AT BOTH ENDS,

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:53.033
THE MACHINE PULLS IT
FROM THE TOP.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.968
HOW FAR IT STRETCHES
UNTIL IT BREAKS

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:56.667
IS A MEASURE OF ITS STRENGTH.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:05.834
MEANWHILE, A TEAM DESIGNS
AND EDITS SCENES ON A COMPUTER.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.601
DESIGNERS COPY THE SCENE,

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.000
DIVIDE IT INTO
VERY NARROW STRIPS,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.834
AND THEN INTERLACE THE STRIPS.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.601
NEXT, THE STRIPS ARE COMBINED
INTO A 2-DIMENSIONAL,

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.300
DIGITAL FILE.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.200
DESIGNERS NOW RUN TEST COPIES
KNOWN AS PROOFS.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.467
THIS PROCESS TESTS SHEETS
OF COLORED PLASTIC FILM

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.767
WHICH WILL SERVE AS INK.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.801
THE TECHNICIAN LAYERS
THE COLORED FILM

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.200
IN A CARTRIDGE
WITH MUSLIN PAPER.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:38.901
NEXT, THE CARTRIDGE
IS PLACED IN THE PRINTER

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.801
WHICH CREATES THE PROOFS.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:47.734
THE DESIGNER TRANSFERS THEM
TO AN ILLUMINATED WORK SURFACE

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:51.601
AND CONFIRMS THAT THE IMAGES
LINE UP WITH THE PLASTIC LENSES.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:55.634
ONCE THE PRINT PLATES ARE MADE,

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:58.801
AN OPERATOR LOADS THEM
INTO THE PRINTER.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.968
A SUCTIONING ARM FEEDS THE
LENTICULAR PLASTIC SHEETS

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:05.300
INTO THE PRINTER,
REVERSE-SIDE UP.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.734
IN THIS POSITION,
THE IMAGES WILL BE PRINTED

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:11.868
ON THE SMOOTH SIDE
OF THE PLASTIC.

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:15.067
ROTATING CYLINDERS TRANSFER INK
FROM THE PRINTING PLATES

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:19.133
TO THE SHEETS,
ONE COLOR AT A TIME.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.000
THIS SYSTEM PRINTS SEVERAL
DIFFERENT 3-D CUP IMAGES

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.567
ON EACH LENTICULAR
PLASTIC SHEET.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:33.767
THE PRESS EJECTS AND STACKS
THE PRINTED SHEETS.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:37.601
THE 3-D-PRINTED SHEETS
NOW HEAD INTO A LAMINATOR.

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.767
IT APPLIES A WHITE FILM
TO THE ARTWORK.

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:42.934
THIS FILM WILL PROTECT
THE 3-D IMAGES

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:47.067
DURING THE CUP-MOLDING PROCESS.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:50.834
NEXT, THE SHEETS ARE CUT
INTO CUP-SIZED LABELS,

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:52.834
PLACED ON AN ILLUMINATED TABLE

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.601
AND INSPECTED
FOR ANY VISUAL FLAWS.

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:00.701
ONCE APPROVED, THE DESIGNER
CLEARS THE THE LABELS

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.968
TO BE FORMED TO PLASTIC CUPS.

00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:07.367
NEXT, AN OPERATOR LOADS
THE STACKS OF 3-D LABELS

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:10.667
INTO THE CUP-FORMING MACHINE.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.100
THIS MACHINE WILL PROCESS
FOUR DIFFERENT LABELS

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.801
ONTO CUPS AT ONCE.

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.534
EACH WITH A DIFFERENT 3-D IMAGE.

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:21.567
A ROBOT WITH SUCTION GRIPPERS
PICKS UP THE LABELS

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:22.868
ONE AT A TIME

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:27.567
AND TRANSFERS THEM
TO CUP-SHAPED MANDRELS.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.567
THE MANDREL INSERTS THE 3-D
LABEL INTO THE MOLD OF A CUP.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.601
MOLTEN POLYPROPYLENE FLOWS
INTO THE MOLD,

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.234
AND AS IT SOLIDIFIES
AND BECOMES A CUP,

00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:40.667
THE 3-D LABEL
FUSES TO IT TOGETHER.

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.734
ROBOTS RETRIEVE THE 3-D CUPS

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:46.100
AND STACK THEM ON THEIR SIDES
TO AWAIT FINAL INSPECTION.

00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:50.734
THEN THEY'RE PACKAGED
FOR SHIPMENT.

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:57.634
3-D CUPS ARE NO ORDINARY
BEVERAGE CONTAINER.

00:04:57.634 --> 00:05:00.167
RATHER, THEY'RE A FUN
VISUAL EXPERIENCE

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.801
FOR ANY TYPE OF CONSUMER.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.300
