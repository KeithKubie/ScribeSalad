00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.840
Cahill and the work that's gone on here
in New York City and even as we were

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850
in New York City and even as we were
 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.180
in New York City and even as we were
talking over breakfast this morning one

of the things that really began to

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780
of the things that really began to
 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.630
of the things that really began to
change the approach to turn around in

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640
change the approach to turn around in
 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.170

New York City happened back in 2002 in

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180
New York City happened back in 2002 in
 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.140
New York City happened back in 2002 in
2003 when we really began to look at the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150
2003 when we really began to look at the
 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.570
2003 when we really began to look at the
data telling us what our school

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580
data telling us what our school
 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.850
data telling us what our school
populations look like and what were the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860
populations look like and what were the
 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.980
populations look like and what were the
factors that were really contributing to

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990
factors that were really contributing to
 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.289
factors that were really contributing to
school performance and I may get the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299
school performance and I may get the
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.880
school performance and I may get the
numbers a little bit wrong and Michelle

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890
numbers a little bit wrong and Michelle
 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.070
numbers a little bit wrong and Michelle
will certainly correct me but lots of

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080
will certainly correct me but lots of
 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.750
will certainly correct me but lots of
people think that the effort in New York

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760
people think that the effort in New York
 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.150
people think that the effort in New York
City was about going to small schools

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160
City was about going to small schools
 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.040
City was about going to small schools
and it turned out when we looked at

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050
and it turned out when we looked at
 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.020
and it turned out when we looked at
school size as a factor and whether or

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030
school size as a factor and whether or
 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.490
school size as a factor and whether or
not

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
not
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.690
not
those were high performing or low

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
those were high performing or low
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.180
those were high performing or low
performing school size only accounted

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190
performing school size only accounted
 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.120
performing school size only accounted
for about nine percent of the f of the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130
for about nine percent of the f of the
 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.940
for about nine percent of the f of the
impact so it was not sized by itself

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950
impact so it was not sized by itself
 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.490
impact so it was not sized by itself
that made the difference but we also

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500
that made the difference but we also
 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.900
that made the difference but we also
knew is that when you looked at

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910
knew is that when you looked at
 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.610
knew is that when you looked at
concentrations of our lowest performing

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620
concentrations of our lowest performing
 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.600
concentrations of our lowest performing
students that that made up about twenty

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610
students that that made up about twenty
 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.820
students that that made up about twenty
one percent of the reason that schools

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830
one percent of the reason that schools
 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.310
one percent of the reason that schools
weren't performing but when you began to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320
weren't performing but when you began to
 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.680
weren't performing but when you began to
combine together high concentrations of

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690
combine together high concentrations of
 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.170
combine together high concentrations of
our most challenging students at our

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
our most challenging students at our
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.450
our most challenging students at our
largest high schools what you started to

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
largest high schools what you started to
 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340
largest high schools what you started to
see that that accounted for over forty

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350
see that that accounted for over forty
 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.560
see that that accounted for over forty
percent of the challenge of turning

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570
percent of the challenge of turning
 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.659
percent of the challenge of turning
around schools and so we began a

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669
around schools and so we began a
 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.220
around schools and so we began a
deliberative process tied to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230
deliberative process tied to
 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.170
deliberative process tied to
accountability tied to a range of other

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
accountability tied to a range of other
 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.510
accountability tied to a range of other
levers that were available to begin to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
levers that were available to begin to
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.280
levers that were available to begin to
identify schools that would be closed

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
identify schools that would be closed
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.890
identify schools that would be closed

City knows full well the real estate

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320
City knows full well the real estate
 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.860
City knows full well the real estate
like other crowded cities is a valuable

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
like other crowded cities is a valuable
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.230
like other crowded cities is a valuable
commodity and we never really had the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240
commodity and we never really had the
 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.150
commodity and we never really had the
luxury of simply shutting schools down

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160
luxury of simply shutting schools down
 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.040
luxury of simply shutting schools down
and letting them live fellow for a while

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050
and letting them live fellow for a while
 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.260
and letting them live fellow for a while
while we developed other school options

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270
while we developed other school options
 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.110
while we developed other school options
and so in New York City the only option

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120
and so in New York City the only option
 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.820
and so in New York City the only option
that we really had available to us was

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830
that we really had available to us was
 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.340
that we really had available to us was
to begin to face high schools down one

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350
to begin to face high schools down one
 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.800
to begin to face high schools down one
grade at a time we would start by not

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810
grade at a time we would start by not
 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.450
grade at a time we would start by not
accepting a ninth grade in the school

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460
accepting a ninth grade in the school
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.120

that was being phased out but as soon as
 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.100
that was being phased out but as soon as
you begin to do that the concurrent

really what that represents is the
 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.350
really what that represents is the

around second we have our office of

00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:20.309
around second we have our office of
 

00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:23.119
around second we have our office of
enrollment and our system of student

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:23.129
enrollment and our system of student
 

00:26:23.129 --> 00:26:26.239
enrollment and our system of student
choice which allows students to pick the

00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:26.249
choice which allows students to pick the
 

00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:27.349
choice which allows students to pick the
schools that they will attend

this is essential to our strategy of
 

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.700
this is essential to our strategy of
turnaround as it enables us to break the

turnaround as it enables us to break the
 

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.830
turnaround as it enables us to break the
cycle of schools that are not performing

failing schools and then give students

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:43.710
failing schools and then give students
 

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.369
failing schools and then give students
the option to attend the school that

just referenced is the development of

00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679
just referenced is the development of
 

00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:54.909
just referenced is the development of
successful schools a portfolio of

00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919
successful schools a portfolio of
 

00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:57.289
successful schools a portfolio of
strategies that we can put into all of

00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299
strategies that we can put into all of
 

00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:00.590
strategies that we can put into all of
these locations where we really need to

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600
these locations where we really need to
 

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:06.019
these locations where we really need to
improve I think I touched on all of

00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:06.029
improve I think I touched on all of
 

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:07.970
improve I think I touched on all of
these aspects we also have the charter

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980
these aspects we also have the charter
 

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.409
these aspects we also have the charter
school office and of course early

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419
school office and of course early
 

00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:12.169
school office and of course early
childhood so we can take our kids from a

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179
childhood so we can take our kids from a
 

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:14.210
childhood so we can take our kids from a
early childhood beginning all the way

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220
early childhood beginning all the way
 

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.810
early childhood beginning all the way
through to college readiness this really

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820
through to college readiness this really
 

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.090
through to college readiness this really
works in a cycle and I just touched on

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100
works in a cycle and I just touched on
 

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.379
works in a cycle and I just touched on
it but if you look at the diagram I

00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:21.389
it but if you look at the diagram I
 

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.720
it but if you look at the diagram I
think you can see how these components

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:23.730
think you can see how these components
 

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.619
think you can see how these components
interact to form a coherent system so if

00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:27.629
interact to form a coherent system so if
 

00:27:27.629 --> 00:27:29.119
interact to form a coherent system so if
you start in the upper left you see

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:29.129
you start in the upper left you see
 

00:27:29.129 --> 00:27:31.930
you start in the upper left you see
planning that's our division that

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:31.940
planning that's our division that
 

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.539
planning that's our division that
develops and implements the plans for

develops and implements the plans for
 

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:37.279
develops and implements the plans for
structural change so that's the group

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:37.289
structural change so that's the group
 

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:39.080
structural change so that's the group
that identifies where we need new

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:39.090
that identifies where we need new
 

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.599
that identifies where we need new
schools they look at enrollment data

00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:41.609
schools they look at enrollment data
 

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:42.950
schools they look at enrollment data
they look at the performance of the

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960
they look at the performance of the
 

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.039
they look at the performance of the
schools and they diagnose the problem

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:45.049
schools and they diagnose the problem
 

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:46.879

so it's our job to find our best partner

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:51.450
so it's our job to find our best partner
 

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.909
so it's our job to find our best partner
organizations that are going to bring

00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919
organizations that are going to bring
 

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:55.249
organizations that are going to bring
school models that we think are worth

00:27:55.249 --> 00:27:55.259
school models that we think are worth
 

00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:57.139
school models that we think are worth
replicating to our attention and help

looking for our best educators within
 

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.339
looking for our best educators within
the system so that we can put them in

I think it's a it's a key aspect of

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:10.630
I think it's a it's a key aspect of
 

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.930
I think it's a it's a key aspect of
describing our strategy which is we

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:12.940
describing our strategy which is we
 

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.880
describing our strategy which is we
invest space and the best school

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:14.890
invest space and the best school
 

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.580
invest space and the best school
managers so we really consider we have a

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:17.590
managers so we really consider we have a
 

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.279
managers so we really consider we have a
system where we're we're responsible for

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:20.289
system where we're we're responsible for
 

00:28:20.289 --> 00:28:22.440
system where we're we're responsible for
all of the space that we own and we are

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.450
all of the space that we own and we are
 

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.600
all of the space that we own and we are
going to invest in our best ideas by

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:24.610
going to invest in our best ideas by
 

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.840
going to invest in our best ideas by
giving people control of that space to

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:27.850
giving people control of that space to
 

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.870
giving people control of that space to
run their schools and then that rolls

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880
run their schools and then that rolls
 

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.930
run their schools and then that rolls
over to the enrollment office who is

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:33.940
over to the enrollment office who is
 

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.630
over to the enrollment office who is
responsible for helping the kids match

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640
responsible for helping the kids match
 

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.010
responsible for helping the kids match
to the schools that they would be most

to the schools that they would be most
 

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.110
to the schools that they would be most
interested in so it's quite a complex

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.120
interested in so it's quite a complex
 

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.060
interested in so it's quite a complex
process where each of these pieces must

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.070
process where each of these pieces must
 

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.180
process where each of these pieces must
be in place and and integrated in as a

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.190
be in place and and integrated in as a
 

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.200
be in place and and integrated in as a
whole in order for the system to work

whole in order for the system to work
we've been using this strategy

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039
we've been using this strategy
 

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:53.399
we've been using this strategy
successfully since 2002 to phase out our

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:53.409
successfully since 2002 to phase out our
 

00:28:53.409 --> 00:28:55.320
successfully since 2002 to phase out our
lowest performing schools and replace

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:55.330
lowest performing schools and replace
 

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.020
lowest performing schools and replace
them with a small school strategy many

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.030
them with a small school strategy many
 

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.490
them with a small school strategy many
of the schools that we have phased out

00:28:59.490 --> 00:28:59.500
of the schools that we have phased out
 

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.020
of the schools that we have phased out

when they drop out of high school but I

when they drop out of high school but I
 

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.130

that we you know can find the right
 

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.630
that we you know can find the right
compromises but i don't think there's an

compromises but i don't think there's an
 

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.790
compromises but i don't think there's an
easy answer and i should say that

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:00.800
easy answer and i should say that
 

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.490
easy answer and i should say that
teachers unions are strong here in the

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:03.500
teachers unions are strong here in the
 

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.110
teachers unions are strong here in the
US and in New York I think they're

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:05.120
US and in New York I think they're
 

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.270
US and in New York I think they're
strongest in the world in Argentina so

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280
strongest in the world in Argentina so
 

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.790
strongest in the world in Argentina so

that regard Greg wanted to answer this
 

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:17.920
that regard Greg wanted to answer this
question as well more practical I think

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:17.930
question as well more practical I think
 

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.360
question as well more practical I think
it's really important to distinguish

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:19.370
it's really important to distinguish
 

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.220
it's really important to distinguish
between the teachers and the teachers

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:21.230
between the teachers and the teachers
 

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.880

New York City many of them not happy

New York City many of them not happy
about the conditions that they're

about the conditions that they're
 

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.850
about the conditions that they're
working in and I think one of the

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:30.860
working in and I think one of the
 

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.350
working in and I think one of the
important things that I think we could

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:32.360
important things that I think we could
 

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.120
important things that I think we could
have done better and I think Alex and

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.130
have done better and I think Alex and
 

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.880
have done better and I think Alex and
the team of portfolio are working on now

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:35.890
the team of portfolio are working on now
 

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.830
the team of portfolio are working on now
this was never a conversation about the

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:38.840
this was never a conversation about the
 

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.380
this was never a conversation about the
teachers and their failures this was a

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:41.390
teachers and their failures this was a
 

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:43.210
teachers and their failures this was a
conversation about the conditions that

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:43.220
conversation about the conditions that
 

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.360
conversation about the conditions that
existed on these campuses that despite

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:46.370
existed on these campuses that despite
 

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.430
existed on these campuses that despite
how hard people were working the

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440
how hard people were working the
 

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.140
how hard people were working the
trajectory for success was nearly

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:50.150
trajectory for success was nearly
 

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:51.970
trajectory for success was nearly
impossible because of those

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:51.980
impossible because of those
 

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.499
impossible because of those
concentrations we were talking

00:56:53.499 --> 00:56:53.509
concentrations we were talking
 

00:56:53.509 --> 00:56:55.929
concentrations we were talking
about earlier so I think one of the key

00:56:55.929 --> 00:56:55.939
about earlier so I think one of the key
 

00:56:55.939 --> 00:56:57.819
about earlier so I think one of the key
things and we started to see it as we

00:56:57.819 --> 00:56:57.829
things and we started to see it as we
 

00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:59.289
things and we started to see it as we
started to get momentum around the

00:56:59.289 --> 00:56:59.299
started to get momentum around the
 

00:56:59.299 --> 00:57:01.299
started to get momentum around the
effort the issue was how through this

00:57:01.299 --> 00:57:01.309
effort the issue was how through this
 

00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:03.879
effort the issue was how through this
process of phase out and starting new

00:57:03.879 --> 00:57:03.889
process of phase out and starting new
 

00:57:03.889 --> 00:57:05.620
process of phase out and starting new
schools did we create better conditions

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:05.630
schools did we create better conditions
 

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.689
schools did we create better conditions
for teachers to work in that they would

00:57:07.689 --> 00:57:07.699
for teachers to work in that they would
 

00:57:07.699 --> 00:57:10.239
for teachers to work in that they would
begin to value and then I mean the

00:57:10.239 --> 00:57:10.249
begin to value and then I mean the
 

00:57:10.249 --> 00:57:12.459
begin to value and then I mean the
reality is over 300 schools now in the

00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:12.469
reality is over 300 schools now in the
 

00:57:12.469 --> 00:57:15.099
reality is over 300 schools now in the
city are being taught by unionized

00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:15.109
city are being taught by unionized
 

00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:18.039
city are being taught by unionized
teachers working under the same contract

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:18.049
teachers working under the same contract
 

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:20.559
teachers working under the same contract
but with a core belief that this the new

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:20.569
but with a core belief that this the new
 

00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:22.689
but with a core belief that this the new
settings they've created or where they

00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:22.699
settings they've created or where they
 

00:57:22.699 --> 00:57:24.249
settings they've created or where they
want to be and so I think early

00:57:24.249 --> 00:57:24.259
want to be and so I think early
 

00:57:24.259 --> 00:57:26.349
want to be and so I think early
communication is important but it can't

00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359
communication is important but it can't
 

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:28.179
communication is important but it can't
start out as a battle between management

00:57:28.179 --> 00:57:28.189
start out as a battle between management
 

00:57:28.189 --> 00:57:30.370
start out as a battle between management
and the unions it's got to start out

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:30.380
and the unions it's got to start out
 

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.049
and the unions it's got to start out
based on the data with an

00:57:32.049 --> 00:57:32.059
based on the data with an
 

00:57:32.059 --> 00:57:33.459
based on the data with an
acknowledgement that the work we've been

00:57:33.459 --> 00:57:33.469
acknowledgement that the work we've been
 

00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:36.039
acknowledgement that the work we've been
doing together is not serving the

00:57:36.039 --> 00:57:36.049
doing together is not serving the
 

00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:37.269
doing together is not serving the
interests of students and their families

00:57:37.269 --> 00:57:37.279
interests of students and their families
 

00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:39.639
interests of students and their families
well and the question is how do we move

00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:39.649
well and the question is how do we move
 

00:57:39.649 --> 00:57:41.379
well and the question is how do we move
forward from from there and I think we

00:57:41.379 --> 00:57:41.389
forward from from there and I think we
 

00:57:41.389 --> 00:57:43.419
forward from from there and I think we
had some early missed steps to Joel's

00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:43.429
had some early missed steps to Joel's
 

00:57:43.429 --> 00:57:45.519
had some early missed steps to Joel's
point earlier that the boldness of the

00:57:45.519 --> 00:57:45.529
point earlier that the boldness of the
 

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:47.109
point earlier that the boldness of the
effort was making sure that we stayed

00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119
effort was making sure that we stayed
 

00:57:47.119 --> 00:57:49.059
effort was making sure that we stayed
focused on having to do something

00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:49.069
focused on having to do something
 

00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:50.529
focused on having to do something
different but I think the process that

00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:50.539
different but I think the process that
 

00:57:50.539 --> 00:57:52.149
different but I think the process that
we have this year is doing a better job

00:57:52.149 --> 00:57:52.159
we have this year is doing a better job
 

00:57:52.159 --> 00:57:54.429
we have this year is doing a better job
of engaging a broader range of community

00:57:54.429 --> 00:57:54.439
of engaging a broader range of community
 

00:57:54.439 --> 00:57:56.229
of engaging a broader range of community
stakeholders working more closely with

00:57:56.229 --> 00:57:56.239
stakeholders working more closely with
 

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:58.120
stakeholders working more closely with
the unions and one of the important

00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.130
the unions and one of the important
 

00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:59.469
the unions and one of the important
things that happened early on it was in

00:57:59.469 --> 00:57:59.479
things that happened early on it was in
 

00:57:59.479 --> 00:58:01.839
things that happened early on it was in
the contract for schools that we phased

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:01.849
the contract for schools that we phased
 

00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:04.209
the contract for schools that we phased
out the new schools coming in were

00:58:04.209 --> 00:58:04.219
out the new schools coming in were
 

00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:06.909
out the new schools coming in were
required to interview at least fifty

00:58:06.909 --> 00:58:06.919
required to interview at least fifty
 

00:58:06.919 --> 00:58:09.489
required to interview at least fifty
percent of the teachers to see whether

00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:09.499
percent of the teachers to see whether
 

00:58:09.499 --> 00:58:11.109
percent of the teachers to see whether
or not they were good fits for that new

00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119
or not they were good fits for that new
 

00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:13.059
or not they were good fits for that new
school coming in so it wasn't simply

00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:13.069
school coming in so it wasn't simply
 

00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:14.559
school coming in so it wasn't simply
about moving those teachers out of the

00:58:14.559 --> 00:58:14.569
about moving those teachers out of the
 

00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:16.389
about moving those teachers out of the
way and if we treat teachers like

way and if we treat teachers like
 

00:58:16.399 --> 00:58:18.549
way and if we treat teachers like
professionals and work with them in this

professionals and work with them in this
 

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:21.039
professionals and work with them in this
process we go a long way but at the same

00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:21.049
process we go a long way but at the same
 

00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:22.870
process we go a long way but at the same
time we can't compromise to your point

neighborhood schools that were the
lowest performing schools and get really

01:00:58.019 --> 01:00:58.029
lowest performing schools and get really
 

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.990
lowest performing schools and get really
good schools in neighborhoods that have

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000
good schools in neighborhoods that have
 

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.539
good schools in neighborhoods that have

think about it's the legal constraints
 

01:01:35.049 --> 01:01:37.289

the measurable parameters you decided

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:52.990
the measurable parameters you decided
 

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.990
the measurable parameters you decided
when you said low performing schools was

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000
when you said low performing schools was
 

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.210
when you said low performing schools was
it only the dropout rate and you said

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:57.220
it only the dropout rate and you said
 

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.460
it only the dropout rate and you said
the number of graduate students and

01:01:59.460 --> 01:01:59.470
the number of graduate students and
 

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:01.920
the number of graduate students and
anything else what were the measurable

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:01.930
anything else what were the measurable
 

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.620
anything else what were the measurable
parameters my first question so our

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:04.630
parameters my first question so our
 

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.599
parameters my first question so our
accountability system in New York takes

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:06.609
accountability system in New York takes
 

01:02:06.609 --> 01:02:08.430
accountability system in New York takes
a number of things into account I mean

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440
a number of things into account I mean
 

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.589
a number of things into account I mean
it's a relatively complex thing but I'll

01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599
it's a relatively complex thing but I'll
 

01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:12.960
it's a relatively complex thing but I'll
try and summarize it to the best of my

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:12.970
try and summarize it to the best of my
 

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:15.120
try and summarize it to the best of my
ability so I think one really important

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:15.130
ability so I think one really important
 

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.309

that have a similar population to it and
then there's a variety of categories

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:40.750
then there's a variety of categories
 

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.769
then there's a variety of categories
that are looked at to make up the

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:43.779

communicating with them academic rigor
and a variety of other categories then

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:56.740
and a variety of other categories then
 

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.370
and a variety of other categories then
there's graduation rates and

01:02:59.370 --> 01:02:59.380
there's graduation rates and
 

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.980
there's graduation rates and
different measures of graduation there's

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:01.990
different measures of graduation there's
 

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:03.690
different measures of graduation there's
bonus points available for the

01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:03.700
bonus points available for the
 

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.490
bonus points available for the
performance of students in the lowest

performance of students in the lowest
 

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.559
performance of students in the lowest
third and then there's the progress that

01:03:07.559 --> 01:03:07.569
third and then there's the progress that
 

01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:09.480
third and then there's the progress that
students are making in terms of how many

credits they're earning year to year and
 

01:03:11.559 --> 01:03:13.289
credits they're earning year to year and
again bonus points for the performance

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:13.299
again bonus points for the performance
 

01:03:13.299 --> 01:03:15.480
again bonus points for the performance
of students in the lowest third so those

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:15.490
of students in the lowest third so those
 

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.980
of students in the lowest third so those
are the major categories that make up

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:16.990
are the major categories that make up
 

01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:19.589
are the major categories that make up
what we call the school progress report

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599
what we call the school progress report
 

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.690
what we call the school progress report
and that is the first piece of

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:21.700
and that is the first piece of
 

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.849
and that is the first piece of
information we use to determine if

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:23.859
information we use to determine if
 

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:25.680
information we use to determine if
schools should be on our list to

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:25.690
schools should be on our list to
 

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:28.440
schools should be on our list to
investigate foreclosure after that we

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:28.450
investigate foreclosure after that we
 

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.809
investigate foreclosure after that we
have anecdotal reports from the network

01:03:30.809 --> 01:03:30.819
have anecdotal reports from the network
 

01:03:30.819 --> 01:03:32.430
have anecdotal reports from the network
leaders and cluster leaders who are

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440
leaders and cluster leaders who are
 

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.259
leaders and cluster leaders who are
people that work closely with the

01:03:34.259 --> 01:03:34.269
people that work closely with the
 

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:37.440
people that work closely with the
schools and then finally we look at the

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:37.450
schools and then finally we look at the
 

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.029
schools and then finally we look at the
demand for the school based on

01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039
demand for the school based on
 

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:42.749
demand for the school based on
enrollment trends and schools in the

01:03:42.749 --> 01:03:42.759
enrollment trends and schools in the
 

01:03:42.759 --> 01:03:45.089
enrollment trends and schools in the
area and whether we have the capacity to

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:45.099
area and whether we have the capacity to
 

01:03:45.099 --> 01:03:47.400
area and whether we have the capacity to
close a school meaning will we be able

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:47.410
close a school meaning will we be able
 

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:49.410
close a school meaning will we be able
to cite those students elsewhere do we

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:49.420
to cite those students elsewhere do we
 

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.079
to cite those students elsewhere do we
need another school there etc Chris
