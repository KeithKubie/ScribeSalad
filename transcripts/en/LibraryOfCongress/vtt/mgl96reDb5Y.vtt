00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.710
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Good evening.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.840
How nice to see everyone here
despite our subway issues

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.490
in the district today.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.080
I'm Jane McAuliffe.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.470
I'm the Director of National
and International Outreach here

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.570
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.610
National and International
Outreach, or NIO as we call it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.920
because we give acronyms
to absolutely everything

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.930
in the Library of
Congress, is a new division

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.900
of the library dedicated
to making the library

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100
and its resources
ever more available

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.820
to the American people.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.790
And an important part of NIO
is the Center for the Book,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.680
whose director we have
with us tonight, John Cole.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.740
The Center for the Book is
responsible for a number

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.180
of things, but especially some
major programs for the library,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.700
such as the National Book
Festival, which is now

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.560
in its 16th year, and I
hope all of you will be

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.690
with us next September 24th
for this annual celebration

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.120
of our greatest authors,
poets, and illustrators.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.300
The Center for the Book also
prepares the librarian's

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.910
selection of the
U.S. Poet Laureate,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.480
a position currently held
by one Felipe Herrera.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.260
And Mr. Herrera's final event as
Poet Laureate this year will be

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.100
on April 13th in the
Coolidge Auditorium.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.170
And again, we hope many of
you will be able to join us.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.400
And finally, the Center for the
Book has spearheaded the Library

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.750
of Congress Literacy
Awards program.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.290
Through the generosity
of David Rubenstein,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.830
the library has been able to
recognize and to make awards

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.970
to literacy organizations, both
in this country and overseas.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.210
And the Literacy Awards brings
us to this evening's program

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.450
in its focus on how
literacy affects our health

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.520
and well-being.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.370
Being able to read is essential
to our ability to obtain,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.010
to process, and to understand
basic health information

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.110
and services.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.300
If we cannot read, we can't
get the instruction necessary

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.230
to make informed
decisions about medical care

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.730
and after lifestyle adjustments.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.410
And that brings us to our
symposium's cofounder,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.620
the Nemours Foundation, which
is an integrated children's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.920
health system.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.580
It has hospitals in the
Delaware Valley and in Florida

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.900
and operates 45 primary,
specialty,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.520
and urgent care clinics.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.460
Nemours is responsible for
the website KidsHealth,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.400
the most visited internet site
for information about health,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.350
behavior, and development
for children right

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.720
through the teen
years, KidsHealth.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.500
And it's become a very prominent
voice for children's health care

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.730
under the leadership
of its president

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.860
and CEO, Dr. David Bailey.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.370
Dr. David Bailey, a pediatric
gastroenterologist, has been CEO

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.240
of Nemours for ten years.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.740
He took his undergraduate degree

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.380
at West Virginia University
majoring, not unexpectedly,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.140
in biology and ended
his MD at Penn State.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.100
His residency program took
him here to Washington, DC,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.090
where he was at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center and then

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.360
to service in the
Army Medical Corps

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.950
in Alabama, Florida, and Hawaii.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.830
After leaving the military, Dr.
Bailey established the Division

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.220
of Pediatric Gastroenterology
at the Arnold Palmer Hospital

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.560
for Children in Orlando,
and he also did an MBA

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.540
at the University of Florida.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.680
So he is the perfect
person, I think,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.240
to bring to us some real
information around the topic

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.610
of literacy and health.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.510
Please welcome Dr. David Bailey.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.010
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.310
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Thank
you very much, Jane,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.530
for that very kind introduction.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.570
I just wish my kids
could have heard it.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.940
You know, I also want to welcome
all of you to this symposium,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.560
which explores the
critical linkage

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.740
between literacy and health.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.930
It seems fitting that this event
is held here at the Library

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.170
of Congress, which is one of the
world's foremost repositories

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.530
of knowledge and
accumulated wisdom.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.610
We have a full day
of speakers tomorrow,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.580
and I think you'll find
them both illuminating

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.910
and thought provoking.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.960
Before I begin, I want
to take this opportunity

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.410
to recognize the
foresight and generosity

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.590
of David M. Rubenstein,
founder of the Library

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.400
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.490
This symposium exploring the
connections between literacy

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.290
and health is made possible
through his generous gift

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.550
to the Library of Congress
and reflects his keen interest

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.300
in drawing public attention
to the importance of literacy

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.370
in all segments of society.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.690
Although his schedule would not
allow him to be with us tonight

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.650
or tomorrow, I'm sure
he would be very pleased

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.570
with our commitment to
learn from each other

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.320
and to engage others in
this very important work

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.620
going forward.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.450
Now, tonight, I would
like to tell a story

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.430
that I hope will connect us in a
very real way to why we're here.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.400
This is a story of a boy,
the eldest of three children,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.260
who grew up in Wyco, a southern
West Virginia coal-mining holler

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.840
-- not hollow; that's
holler in West Virginia --

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.390
that was [inaudible] of a narrow
valley, where the railroad track

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.790
and the dirt road roughly
paralleled the creek running

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.750
out of the mountains.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.690
His father had dropped
out of the eighth grade

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.970
to support his own mother
and his six siblings.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.440
The boy's mother was
18 when he was born,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.710
and she did have a
high-school diploma.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.990
In that coal-mining community,
practically every male

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.120
over the age of 16
worked in the coal mines.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.010
Coal dust was constant.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.740
It was on everything
and everybody.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.270
Families lived paycheck
to paycheck.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.370
And after every paycheck,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.920
drinking was the major
recreational activity

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.150
for several days.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.680
Practically all goods
for daily living came

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.730
from the company
store, which was owned,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.030
sure enough, by the
coal company.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.930
At one time or another,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.470
almost everyone received
what were known

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.860
as government commodities,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.400
usually cheese and
peanut butter.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.930
Poverty was pervasive,
but, as there was nothing

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.360
to compare it to, it was just
life for the residents of Wyco.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.060
At the pleading of his
mother, the boy was accepted

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.030
on a trial basis into the
first grade at the age of five.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.790
He was bored because all of his
playmates were then in school.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.840
He joined the other
five students, all male,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.840
who comprised the entire
first-grade school.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.080
The school had two rooms with
three grades in each room,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.930
each grade composed
of one row of desks.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.330
To the casual observer,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.310
the boy's family was
indistinguishable

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.000
from any other in Wyco.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.680
However, there were three
very important differences:

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.330
his father did not drink, his
mother had a high-school diploma

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.870
and loved to read,
primarily romance novels,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:46.360
and both parents placed a
high importance on education.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.560
Unlike all of his friends,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.060
there were reading materials
appropriate for age in his home.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.510
In fact, the only time he ever
saw books or magazines outside

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.880
of his home was at school.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.600
His family once fell prey
to a door-to-door salesman

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.300
and bought a full set of
Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.250
Remember this was a
long time before Google.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.360
These encyclopedias
became a prized possession

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.570
and were proudly
displayed in the front room.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.190
For Christmas, just
before his eighth birthday,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.470
the boy received a children's
book about Edward Jenner,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.100
the 18th-century
British physician

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.710
who pioneered smallpox
vaccination.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.280
This book ignited his desire
to pursue a medical career.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.010
At age 16, he entered
college, the first person

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.110
from both his extended family
and from Wyco to do so.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.620
He went on to medical
school at age 19

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.360
and stands before
you this evening.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.370
I am that boy.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.820
What happened to the other five
boys who made up the first class

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.690
in Wyco, West Virginia?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:08.710
Tom graduated from high
school, worked in the mines,

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.610
and died of coal miners' black
lung about ten years ago.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.190
Bill dropped out of
school, worked a while

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.120
in the coal mines, and
then became a hermit

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.780
in the hills around Wyco.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.700
Mark dropped out of school
and was in and out of prison,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.400
largely for theft-related
offenses.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.100
Jim graduated from high school
but was severely injured

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.510
in a coal-mining
accident and lives

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.920
on Social Security disability.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.590
And I've lost track
of my fifth classmate.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:45.300
Based on empirical data, it's
now widely accepted that access

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.030
to printed materials is the
critical variable affecting

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.800
reading acquisition.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.810
The complete lack of available
reading materials almost assured

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.420
that the five of the six
boys would not be reading

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.700
at grade level when they
reached the fourth grade.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:09.570
That alone vastly increased
the likelihood that one of them

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:15.150
or many of them would drop out
of high school, which, in turn,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.740
increased the likelihood
of unemployment by over 70%

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.630
when compared to
high-school graduates.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.840
In retrospect, Mark and Bill's
lives, the ones who dropped out,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.520
were sadly both a statistical
and a cultural norm.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.560
My other two friends
hardly fared better.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.690
Jim's accident and Tom's
premature death cannot be

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.040
surprises given the
difficult environment

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.740
in which they lived and worked.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.810
People who are illiterate
or poor --

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.450
and they are very
closely linked --

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.000
are more likely to work
under hazardous conditions

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.400
or be exposed to
environmental toxins.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.250
Most of you here
could have predicted

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.230
in general terms what would
have happened to those boys

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.950
in the first-grade class.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:14.090
Unfortunately, more than 50
years later, in countless places

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.410
but with different faces, this
story is still playing out.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.130
It's like a perverse
real-life version

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.700
of the movie Groundhog Day,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.600
in which the same day gets
repeated over, and over,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.800
and over until the
protagonist gets it right.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.010
What does this story have to
do with literacy and health?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.210
Everything.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.250
Literacy dramatically affects
the outcomes in medical care.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:53.210
However, literacy may be even
more impactful in those areas

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.500
that are now recognized as
having a much larger role

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.260
in shaping the health
of populations

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.080
than medical care alone.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.670
A large and compelling body
of evidence accumulated

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.780
over the past 25 years
leaves little room for doubt

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.000
about the powerful role of
social factors in health.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.480
The phrase "social determinants
of health" has been coined

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.390
to reflect this, and is
defined as the conditions

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.310
in which people are born,
grow, live, work, and age,

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.230
and includes the fundamental
drivers of those conditions.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.300
These social determinants
have been categorized

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:43.560
into four separate dimensions:
social circumstances, behaviors,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.060
the environment, and genetics.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.440
Education, poverty, and housing
powerfully influence health.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.300
For instance, for the
population as a whole,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.500
the most consistent predictor
of the likelihood of death

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.610
in any given year is
the level of education.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.330
And the close links of poverty

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.970
to health have been
known for centuries.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.650
However, behavior patterns
-- diet, physical activity,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.270
sexual activity,
addiction, and the like --

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:25.340
behavior is the single
greatest influence

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.570
over health in the
United States.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:34.200
All told multiple studies using
different methodologies show

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.100
that the social determinants
shape about 85% of the health

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.640
of populations, with medical
care making up the other 15%.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.540
Let me repeat that: Social
determinants shape 85%

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.430
of the health of populations,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.810
with medical care
making up the other 15%.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.170
Another way to look at this
is through a study released

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.190
by the Department of
Health and Human Services,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.460
in which they estimate
that the 30 years

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.820
of increased life expectancy
attained in the 20th century,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.900
only about five of those
years can be attributed

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.200
to better medical care.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.630
The direct impact
of low literacy

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.820
on health outcomes is
broad and significant

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.250
for both children and adults.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.550
The weight of evidence shows

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.970
that lower literacy is directly
correlated with greater number

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.590
of hospitalizations;
more outpatient visits;

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:42.840
less tight diabetes
control; more complications

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.810
from diabetes, including
blindness,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.330
cardiovascular disease,
and neuropathy;

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.290
more emergency room visits; more
hospitalizations for asthma;

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.570
and I could go on and on.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.620
Patients with lower literacy
are also much less likely

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.150
to participate in
screening and prevention.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.650
These include childhood
immunizations,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.710
smoking cessation
programs, Pap smears,

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.180
mammograms, colonoscopies.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.020
The Center for Health Care
Strategies also indicates nearly

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.010
half of Americans have
difficulty understanding

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.840
and using health information.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.320
This impedes their ability

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.330
to make appropriate health
decisions for themselves

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.710
and for their children.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:35.250
An example of this is
one study in which 43%

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.130
of the participants were found

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.050
to have reading levels
below the sixth-grade level.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.610
These patients were
3.4 times more likely

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.260
to not take their prescription
medications correctly.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.220
Overall, people who read

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.740
at lower literacy levels
are three times more likely

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.020
to have adverse medical outcomes
than people who can read

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.350
at higher literacy levels.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.910
There are very few high-quality
studies assessing a direct

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.380
impact of literacy
on costs related

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.640
to specific disease entities.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.950
A problem is that the
confounding factors have been

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.980
very difficult to control.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.350
But one study of non-pregnant
Medicaid recipients found

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.780
that those adult patients
with a reading level at

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.560
or below the third grade had
Medicaid charges over three

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.490
and a half times those
patients whose reading level was

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.780
above the third grade.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.910
In aggregate, low literacy
is estimated to add

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.190
about $230 billion

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.110
to the country's
health-care costs each year.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.980
I believe that the next great
leap in improving the health

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.720
of the nation will not
come out of the laboratory,

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.020
the operating room,
with new medication,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.680
or with new processes,
but rather,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.550
through systematically
addressing the social

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.590
determinants of health, or, to
use the current terminology,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.880
moving health care upstream.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.290
I also believe that the key

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.030
to enabling this leap is
improving the literacy rate

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.660
in the United States.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.080
If you consider the direct
links of literacy or the lack

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.670
of literacy to education,
risky behaviors,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:41.450
high-school dropout rates,
incarceration, and welfare,

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.990
it does not require any
suspension of belief

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.720
to understand that
literacy is the tool

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.730
to not just improve
overall health

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.110
but to break the
intergenerational cycle

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.490
of poverty and its
associated morbidities.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:03.120
As I've touched on briefly,
literacy has profound effects

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.260
on medical care and the
social determinants of health.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.040
Turning the question
around, can medical care

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.180
and health-care systems
affect literacy?

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.720
At Nemours, our core
operating principle is

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.290
that our responsibility
to children is more

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.530
than the diagnosis and
treatment of disease.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.440
We believe that we
are shared guardians

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.070
of children's health and joy.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.380
We believe reading and
literacy are essential

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.710
for both health and joy.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.360
Nemours established our
BrightStart program in 2005,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.450
which is aimed at
improving reading readiness.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.240
We had the great fortune
to have Dr. Laura Bailet,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.480
here with us tonight,
lead BrightStart.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.500
In view of the tremendous
efforts by so many parties,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.930
Laura believed that identifying
children at an early age

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:09.330
with reading vulnerabilities
would provide greater value,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.380
giving a chance for intervention
before brain developmental

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.570
patterns are set.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.290
We'll have a chance to hear more
from Dr. Bailet tomorrow, but,

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.030
in brief, she and her team
developed and validated the tool

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.960
for early screening, and
the screening has identified

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.380
that 20% or more

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.130
of prekindergarten children
have reading vulnerabilities.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.120
The BrightStart team has
also developed a nine-

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.970
to 12-hour intervention
delivered over several weeks

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.530
that brings about two-thirds

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.790
of these children back
to the normal range.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.020
And in hopes of enabling
universal screening,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.630
the team has recently
refined and validated a tool

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.570
that can be used by parents.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.420
In addition to our dedicated
reading readiness efforts,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:04.140
we know that education and
literacy are negatively impacted

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.600
by chronic disease and
the absenteeism frequently

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.140
associated with it.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.860
For that reason, we've piloted
a community health effort

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.660
for chronic disease
using asthma as a model.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.820
We have involved
community health workers

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:25.850
as health navigators, community
liaisons as health integrators,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:31.590
and these assess the patient's
home, provide ongoing education,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.910
and connect the family
to community resources.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.430
The community liaisons
also interface

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.460
and influence both governmental
and nongovernmental agencies,

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.260
such as housing, pest
control, transportation,

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.990
and health specialty resources.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.320
Furthermore, with
parental permission,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.870
we've piloted providing
school nurses full access

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.500
to the child's electronic
health record in order

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.640
to close any gaps in
communication or in hand offs.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.630
Because of these efforts,
outcomes are better,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.380
much better, and school
absences have decreased.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.850
Nemours and health systems
nationwide are searching

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.240
to find concrete ways to improve
the health of populations.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.870
This has become a primary
goal of health reform.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.730
After generations of
treating patients one by one,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.500
changing mind-set is
a very real obstacle.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.800
Impacting the health

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800
of populations requires
a deep understanding

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.760
of the social determinants
of health as well as working

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.820
with community resources
in new and unfamiliar ways.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.680
It requires moving from a
command and control mode

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.880
to true collaboration.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.650
For significant change,
it also requires a move

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.370
from a fee-for-service
model of reimbursement

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.170
to a value-based model of
care, where outcomes instead

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.380
of volume are reimbursed,

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:09.890
and those outcomes must include
some population health measures.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.000
As a note, reimbursement
models are not unilaterally set

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.880
by health systems, and both
payers and providers need

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.890
to have the infrastructure
and systems in place

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.770
to successfully transition to
a new model of reimbursement.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.720
And value-based health
care is 180 degrees apart

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.930
from fee-for-service-based
health care,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.810
so it requires a
complete systems change.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.200
Despite all the policy
discussions, money allocated,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.420
and the multitude of programs,
both private and public,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.220
the nation's literacy rate
has only slightly improved

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.590
over the last decade.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.460
The responsibility for a child's
care, including literacy,

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.430
will always fall
principally to the parents.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:03.630
It is they who, with
knowledge, understanding,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.990
and the right tools, can do
the most for their child,

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:13.680
particularly in those critical
first 1000 days after birth,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.980
when brain development is
rapid and the potential

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.890
for positive influence
is at its greatest.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.190
The American Academy

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.960
of Pediatrics Books Build
Connections Literacy Toolkit is

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.290
a wonderful example of
empowering parents for success.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:41.150
It also provides a clear
road map for early screening

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.230
and intervention
for care providers,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.140
and it's a remarkable
illustration

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.180
of great collaboration and
alignment among organizations.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.080
You'll likely hear more about
this from Dr. Hasinck [phonetic]

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.450
in her keynote address
tomorrow morning.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:02.800
We in health care must pay a
larger and more proactive role

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.700
than we traditionally have.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.680
For children, this means
aggressively addressing those

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.070
health determinants
that interfere

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.270
with skill acquisition,
both at a very early age

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.820
and during the school years.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.700
We at Nemours believe
that child health

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.440
and reading skills
are closely linked

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.100
and that reading failure is
a major child health issue.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.770
For that reason,
we will continue

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.730
to promote reading success
through innovative programs,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.820
research, advocacy, and
partnerships focusing

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.310
on birth to age eight.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:46.170
In conclusion, the challenge
for us all is how to intervene

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.270
in the lives of the
nation's children

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.870
so that their future
is one of choice rather

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.720
than being dictated
by circumstance.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.320
Literacy is that enabled of
individual choice and it is

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.730
at the heart of it all.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.460
When I reflect on
my personal story,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:13.560
multiple adverse circumstances
were overcome by being lucky,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.650
lucky enough to have a mother

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.080
who created an environment
conducive to reading.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.920
With the expertise
and commitment of all

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.510
of you here tonight
and your colleagues

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.670
in the symposium tomorrow, the
fate of the next generation

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.200
of children and, thus,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.390
of our nation's future
will not be left to chance.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.510
Thank you very much.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:55.340
[ Applause ]

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.010
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Dr. Bailey has agreed

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.220
to take a few questions,
so if there are.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.670
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Did
you see her twist my arm?

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.080
[laughter] Yeah, she's tough.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.530
I'd be happy to take
any questions.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:38.210
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:39.510
I appreciate that.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.810
Thank you.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.110
Yes?

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:51.380
That was just, that was
one of the best speeches

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.400
on literacy I've ever heard,
so thank you very much.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.880
[laughs] It felt to me
like, it really felt

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.700
like that was a call to action.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.990
And I'm curious,
how, what are some

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.910
of the policy [inaudible] policy
things we need to do to take

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:11.340
that call to action
moving forward?

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.890
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: You know,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.160
I think [inaudible
speaker] great question.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.460
I wish I had all the answers.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.060
I think that the, there's been
a tremendous amount of work

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.720
over the past ten years,
and it's accelerated

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.220
over the past five years.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:30.360
You know, we now have a
national agenda around literacy.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:39.070
Because there is a much more
dedicated approach to using data

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.940
in order to make decisions,
it gets people on board.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.760
It gets people from both
political parties on board.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.030
And the mayors of the nation
have actually been driving this

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.580
I think more than anyone else.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.870
It really falls to
the local communities.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.270
But when I think about
it, what can we do more?

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.880
And I think that, you know, you
have these two great efforts --

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.870
health care, which consumes
three trillion dollars a year,

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.690
and you have the
education budget,

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.190
and you have this
giant literacy effort.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:17.040
In some ways, they're kind of in
silos, and, you know, certainly,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.760
the literacy data and the
health data have both landed

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.200
on the social determinants
of health, that that is

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.960
where we can make a difference.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.040
And I think even greater
emphasis on attempting

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.310
to intervene early in
that first 1000 days.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.030
I think that is the
critical learning period

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.820
at which developmental pathways
can be positively altered,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.120
and it requires far less
money and effort to do that.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.720
So what does that mean?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.270
I think we need to start
on the OB side, actually.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.500
I think that with prenatal
visits, mothers need

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.370
to be informed how
critical reading, talking,

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.040
and singing are to
their newborn baby.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.010
I don't know if to the fetus is
where we need to go, but maybe.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.050
But beyond that, you know,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:21.230
having literacy be a primary
point on which medical,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.530
the entire medical team --

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.240
OB, pediatrics, family
practice -- gets on board.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.540
You know, the American Academy

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.820
of Pediatrics has a
fabulous policy statement

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.120
and developed fabulous
materials.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.740
A minority of pediatricians
actually do it.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.840
And the reasons are
many, you know --

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.470
time, potentially reimbursement.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.730
Other factors include
not knowing,

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.720
not being comfortable
with the tools.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.900
Are the tools really validated?

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.120
And not being comfortable about,
are there folks in the community

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.750
who are, who can truly intervene
once we've identified potential

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.700
reading vulnerabilities?

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.720
I think the new tool kit
that the AAP has come

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.780
up with helps them
with that if, you know,

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.300
once it gets massively
distributed.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:17.070
So I believe alignment,
not just within silos,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.650
because I think the
literacy world seems

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.660
to be pretty well aligned,
but aligning the effort

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.020
with health care, with
policy, with education,

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.780
then I think we can
really make a difference.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.450
For instance, with education,
it is very difficult to break

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.000
into the school system,
for someone in health care

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.300
to run a study longitudinally
over several grades

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.600
to understand

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.790
if an intervention's really
having a long-term effect.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.900
And I think that if we can
find ways to break those silos

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:56.490
such that the large, different
pieces can then come together,

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.310
I think we'll make
much faster progress.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.070
I think there's, you know,
in effect, there's a lot

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.680
of money out there, you know.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.250
There's probably 30 to 40% of
health care is probably wasted.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:14.700
You know, if we can reduce that
waste and apply it to this type

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.030
of effort into education,
I think over the long haul,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.370
you'll see a healthier
population.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.550
The problem is the will
to do it, you know.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.850
It's difficult to make that
type of massive change.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.810
But if we could just
gain some alignment

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.090
between all the different,
large constituencies,

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.500
I think we'd make
bigger progress.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.510
Jane?

00:32:44.510 --> 00:33:07.160
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.840
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Looking
at it from another angle,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.170
what are some of the signs that
you look for [inaudible] look

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.970
for in a three year old
that might alert you

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.590
to potential problems?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.560
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: I think,
you know, well-child care tends

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.960
to focus, as it should, on all
of the developmental milestones.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.780
You know, walking, talking,

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.720
when can they roll
over, and the like.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.210
I think having a more
comprehensive or refined set

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.560
of tools that are
simple, easy to deliver

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:51.530
to evaluate a language and
a potential reading ability.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.970
And, you know, the
physician doesn't need

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.570
to be the one doing it.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.520
There could be community
resources that, you know,

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.840
could be, could come to the
office and be responsible

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.910
for that type of screening.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:06.460
What would prevent that from
happening is the physician

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.980
believing that it's
reliable, you know,

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.820
that it's providing good data,
and having the ability to refer

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:19.800
to a, someone that is known
to intervene appropriately.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.110
So I think a better,
a more refined,

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.530
more comprehensive
screening of speech, language,

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.390
and pre-reading abilities
would be,

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:34.340
would put us forward
a great deal.

and [inaudible] are
so important.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.960
[inaudible] we know that,
in addition to the things

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.510
that Dr. Bailey talked
about, we know that--

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.530
We can argue whether that's
cause or correlational,

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.410
but not having them read
children's book [inaudible] is

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:14.470
highly associated with
delays in vocabulary,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.510
which is then associated
with delays in--

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:24.270
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.270
Fallen from everyone's focus,

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:33.510
but that's a major health
risk factor for all kinds of--

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.180
We do know how to do this.

&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Right.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.850
&gt;&gt; Are. It's partly a matter
of getting them out there

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.510
and having people, have that
shared [inaudible] that we all--

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.260
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.560
&gt;&gt; I guess as a [inaudible]
which is

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:13.120
where I find myself
most of the time,

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.380
I'm aware that finding the right
focus can be very difficult

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.170
because there are so many
different factors [inaudible].

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:34.370
And so my strategy is to try,
at the same time being aware

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.450
of all the risk factors,
to identify [inaudible].

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:46.100
Sometimes that's a lever
that allows us to move things

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:52.530
in the right direction
more effectively,

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.410
and it certainly leads to
a less hopeless outlook.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:03.700
[inaudible] So I love the story
you told because the source

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:09.790
of resilience is so clearly
identified and the outcome was

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.090
so clearly [inaudible].

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:16.560
And my experience with
it in a clinic population

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.780
that is largely low
income, there's a lot

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.080
of [inaudible] that's in there.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:32.270
I'm not saying that this is the
answer, but it's certainly part

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:36.510
of it that [inaudible]
we can bring to the--

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:45.800
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughs]

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:52.450
&gt;&gt; Well, the critical
dramatic turn of that story is

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:56.850
when they dig the foundation
[inaudible] town hall

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:01.800
in [inaudible], and they have
to do it in one day, right.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.820
And a little boy comes in
and watches, and the comment

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.510
that he made: all of them
dug harder and faster when--

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:17.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.860
As a pediatrician, I think part

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.570
of my goal is to
[inaudible] right.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:26.510
If I can notice a
parent who has that--

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:34.250
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.550
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Yes?

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.350
&gt;&gt; I just have a question.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:39:13.130
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.430
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey:
You know, there's,

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:17.690
there are several studies
that show that families

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.210
who were originally
middle class in terms

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:27.050
of socioeconomic status, but
through some traumatic event,

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:33.780
they are in poverty that, the
income has dropped so much,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.230
and they live in poverty.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.460
And even if they are able
to lift themselves up out

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.120
of poverty after 15
months, the one year spent

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:51.550
in poverty leads to, on average,
a delay in reading level that,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:57.260
for a slight majority of those
children, they don't catch up,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.520
even though the family is now
back into middle-class status.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.940
And I don't know
if they don't catch

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.400
up because there's no
added intervention.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.040
It's not recognized.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:14.150
But relatively brief, if you can
call a year in poverty brief,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.350
adverse circumstances, traumas

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.130
like that can have a
significant effect on literacy.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:26.090
And so as a society and as
Robert mentioned, you know,

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:30.690
if a pediatric practice is
the primary medical home

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.810
for that child, the physician,
the caregiver, those people

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.010
in the office know
and understand

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.660
when those traumatic occurrences
happen and can then begin

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:48.080
to alert the family as to what
resources they may be able

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.410
to avail themselves in the
community in order to, you know,

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.230
prevent that reading
level being stunted

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.090
or perhaps intervening
to bring it back up.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:02.240
I think it requires --
you know, that old cliche,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.440
it requires a village -- it does
require all of the access points

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.020
at the children and
family to ensure

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.500
that that child reaches
their optimal development.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.070
And so I think in terms
of pediatricians' offices,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.770
that's a primary place, but it's
up to all of us in the community

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:29.230
in order to understand the
significant effect that traumas

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.000
or other delays can have
on reading level and, thus,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.300
the future for that child and
even the future for society.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.510
Yes?

00:41:42.510 --> 00:42:00.710
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.540
&gt;&gt; And I just wondered
what you thought

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.870
about the potential
change in behavior

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:12.680
in those well-child visits.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.790
And I know a lot of it
has to do with, you know,

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.120
the time that physicians are
allowed to have this visit,

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:26.040
but to really promote good
use of a book as a tool

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.550
to really determine a
child's [inaudible].

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.850
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey:
Can you clone him?

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.150
&gt;&gt; Pardon me?

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.450
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey:
Can you clone him?

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.750
[ Laughter ]

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.050
I think it's a wonderful idea.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.350
I wouldn't have thought
of it myself,

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.650
but I think it is
a wonderful idea.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.520
I think it may be very
difficult to change the behavior

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.700
of pediatricians who've
been out in practice,

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.710
and there are about
64,000 of them.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.350
I think the chances
would be great, however,

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.380
if that were presented
as an option

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.480
or as an approach
during training programs,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.850
that it would be
very easy to do that.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:03.600
And I think that it would be, it
wouldn't take very long in order

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.960
to build a data set to show how
positive it is and, in fact,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.260
how it may shorten the
time spent necessary

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.810
in a well-child exam.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.550
So I think it's a fabulous idea.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.010
Yes?

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.610
&gt;&gt; I'm Brian Gallagher
with Reach Out and Read,

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:32.990
and I have the pleasure
of working

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.590
with Dr. [inaudible]
and Dr. [inaudible].

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.090
And also, [inaudible], who
started at the Reach Out

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.100
and Reach program with Dr.
Atkinson [phonetic] many,

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.400
many years ago.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.700
So two points.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.230
One, to your point earlier about
[inaudible] with the policy.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.850
We were thrilled to see that the
Every Student Succeeds Act bill

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.150
that was passed into
law and signed into law

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.450
in December does
include language

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.750
around literacy promotion--

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.050
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Yes.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.350
&gt;&gt; Starting in--

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.650
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:00.350
And to the point where residency
program too, we are seeing more

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:06.730
and more physicians come to
class with Reach Out and Read

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:14.690
to say, I was trained
in Reach Out and Read.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.770
I got to my clinic.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:20.760
There are no books.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.110
Second thing I did was
[inaudible] was [inaudible] so--

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:26.410
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Good.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:31.090
&gt;&gt; It does take time to change
that culture and that behavior,

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.970
but we're starting
to slowly see it.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.270
&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Good.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.570
Thank you.

like to say we have folks here

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.800
from the Department
of Education,

Steven Hicks and [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; David J. Bailey: Hi.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.700
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: So at least
we could have health care

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.000
and education be in the same
room [inaudible &amp; laughter].
