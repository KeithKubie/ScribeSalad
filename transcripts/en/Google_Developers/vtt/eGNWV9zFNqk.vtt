LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.970
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.940
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.230
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.830
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.260
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.420
and why they do it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.460
And today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:24.450
Welcome to "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.325
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.490
And I'm here today
chatting with Sunil, who's

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.020
from our Voice Actions team.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.500
And he's going to be talking
a lot about Voice Actions

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.550
and how they work in Android
and some of the great things

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.258
that you can do as a
developer with them.

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:36.430
So welcome, Sunil.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.570
And thanks, for joining us.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.440
SUNIL VEMURI: Thanks,
for having me.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell
us all about what you do.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.790
SUNIL VEMURI: So I am a product
manager on the Voice Actions

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.290
team.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.190
And the main thing
that I do is enable

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.460
Voice Actions for developers.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.550
But let me first say,
what is a voice action?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.895
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
can we have a demo?

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:52.380
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.626
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:54.292
SUNIL VEMURI: This
is the part in Google

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:55.640
where you can say, OK Google.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.404
Navigate to San Francisco.

00:00:57.404 --> 00:00:59.320
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Navigating to San Francisco.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.810
SUNIL VEMURI: And then--

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.790
SUNIL VEMURI: --you can
get directions and things

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.590
like that.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.006
But there are other
things you can

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.076
do, like I can say, call
Laurence or start my run.

00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:08.950
All of these things are
various voice actions

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.260
that Google supports right now.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.750
Nice.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.360
Now I know you've done
a DevByte recently

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.630
explaining some of this, right?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.400
SUNIL VEMURI: Yes, we have.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.704
Let's run a clip from
that DevByte now.

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:17.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.340
-I love listening to
the radio on my commute.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.730
And the TuneIn app
gives me great choices.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.220
OK Google.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.960
Play music on TuneIn.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.890
-Which genre would
you like to listen to?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.750
-Classical.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.083
-Playing classical.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:32.870
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.760
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Pretty neat stuff.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.360
SUNIL VEMURI: Thank you.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, one
of the things I've always

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.771
been curious about was-- because
I remember in the past, when

00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.500
I've been doing voice
interaction stuff,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
I used to have to
train the machine.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.260
And I'd sit with a
microphone close my mouth,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.790
and I'd read weird
sentences, so it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.581
could understand all
the different things

00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:47.330
that I was saying.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.960
But now, I can just pick up
my phone and say, OK Google,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.240
navigate to San Francisco.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.051
What's happened?

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:53.050
How has that come about?

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.841
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:57.800
That's been a really awesome
progress in the speech field.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.350
What really has changed is the
amount of data that we've had.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.860
So in the early days, when we
only had a little bit of data,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.690
it only worked for
a few circumstances.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.440
But later on, as we
got more and more data,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.360
it got better and
better and better.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.040
So take, for example, in 2013,
we had about a 23% word error

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.620
rate.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.080
And that's how we measure
the quality of speech.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.060
So 23% of the words were wrong.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.182
And that's not very good.

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:27.140
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.931
SUNIL VEMURI: At I/O,
we recently announced

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:29.640
it's down to 8%.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.290
SUNIL VEMURI: And that
makes a big difference,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.789
especially when you're talking
about applications like this.

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.570
And in many ways, it has shown
that voice is really possible

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.345
and is a viable candidate for
a lot of different interactions

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.470
right now, because the
error rates have gotten down

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.490
so significantly.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.860
And even like earlier,
you said, San Francisco,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.000
which are technically
Spanish words, right?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.972
But it recognized
them as the place.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.430
And I thought that
was really cool.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.780
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.830
I mean, there's a
lot of treatment that

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.910
goes into it that
tries to understand,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.700
what is the actual right
interpretation of this sentence

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.020
in this context, as well?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.520
So that's a lot of the work
that goes on in this team that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.770
helped to really make it a
better experience for users

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.782
and now developers.

00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:10.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.199
And I have a foreign accent,
and it recognizes me.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.990
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160
And it's like, how
is it that you're

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.640
able to come up with--
to be able to recognize

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.210
different voices, not
just the classic monotone,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.370
straight English
voice type of thing?

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.079
What type of work has
been done for that?

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:27.869
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.250
You know, back in
the early days,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.092
you had to be a white male
between the ages of 25 and 40

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:35.050
for this thing to work.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.350
And you had to be
in a quiet room.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.225
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:38.780
SUNIL VEMURI: So
what really changed

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.630
is we started to include a much
more diverse set of samples

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.320
in here, so a broader
set of accents, a broader

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.920
set of speakers, older,
younger speakers.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.570
Even nowadays, it
works really well

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.230
with children, which has long
since been a difficult problem.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.750
So as we included more
and more of these samples

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.590
and a diverse set, it
created this virtual cycle

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.804
where more people
started to use it.

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:04.470
And we can improve
the system with that.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.429
Cool.

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:07.837
Now developers-- we have
a DevByte that we just

00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:09.670
showed a moment ago--
now, how do developers

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.640
get started with doing this?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.170
What kind of things can they do?

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.540
SUNIL VEMURI: So believe it
or not, a lot of developers

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.170
are already voice-enabled.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.959
And the way this has happened
is we've leveraged the Android

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.459
intent system here.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.590
So first thing we do is
we analyze or we look at,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.130
what did the user say?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.790
And if they say a
number of things

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.780
that we already recognize,
like start a run, set an alarm,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.620
play some music,
Google has already

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.710
developed the language to
recognize these things,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.440
and we fire an intent.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.231
Now, lots of
applications out there

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:41.480
already support these intents.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.070
SUNIL VEMURI: So we're
already firing these things

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.111
to these applications that
support these intents.

00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.690
So many applications
are already supported.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.500
And this is what we
call system actions.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.003
SUNIL VEMURI: Google
recognizes the language

00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:55.400
and fires an intent
over to an application.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.480
And then the
application is the one

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.050
that can give the
response to the user.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.495
And this, in many ways, is
how we are driving traffic

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:05.255
to applications.

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.880
OK.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.720
Now, the system
intent-- system actions.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.220
Sorry.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.830
There's other types of actions?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.621
SUNIL VEMURI: Yeah.

00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:15.240
So Google has created
a bunch of these things

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.470
to handle the common
situations that we

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.630
see users use on phones,
watches, and other devices.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.410
But what if it's something
that Google hasn't created?

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.125
That's where we
introduce custom actions.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:27.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.915
SUNIL VEMURI: This is where
a developer can tell us

00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:33.400
the language that they would
like us to trigger on and then

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.270
send to their applications.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.730
Take, for example,
turn on the lights.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.150
We don't do that right now.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.571
Or Shazam, this song.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.820
This isn't something that
we would build by ourselves.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.220
But developers have asked
us for grammars like this.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.200
And then, when they do
that, we trigger the intent

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.080
that they asked for
for their application.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.564
So the custom actions
APIs are the ones that

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:56.730
allow developers to do this.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.010
Cool.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.960
Now, there's also the ability
to interact over voice, right?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.940
So follow up questions,
that type of thing.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.310
SUNIL VEMURI: Yes, exactly.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.970
LAURENCE MORONEY:
How does that work?

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.800
SUNIL VEMURI: So
we talked about two

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.452
of these things,
system and custom.

00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:07.910
And this has to do
with triggering.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.730
Now, just imagine you're
on the Google home screen,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.540
and you say, OK Google,
turn on the lights,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.450
or whatever it might be.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.330
But let's take that
one query for example.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.380
That can be ambiguous.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.188
SUNIL VEMURI: Because the
home automation application

00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:22.730
might wonder, what lights?

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.410
Which room?

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.285
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:26.510
SUNIL VEMURI: Or if I
said, unlock the door,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.279
it might want to
say, are you sure?

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.570
Because I wouldn't want you
to unlock my door, would I?

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.130
SUNIL VEMURI: Well, no.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.171
You seem like a nice guy.

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:34.220
But, yeah.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.290
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Appearances can be deceptive.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.372
SUNIL VEMURI: They can.

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:37.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.160
So what we have is another API,
called Voice Interaction API.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.780
And this is a new
API in Android M that

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.840
allows for the follow-on
questions that are very

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.156
typical in a voice dialogue.

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:51.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.190
SUNIL VEMURI: So
in this case here,

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.180
a developer would still
implement the custom action

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.500
to do something like
turn on the lights.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.880
But in their
application, they would

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.310
ask the follow-up question.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.280
And what happens here is,
at the bottom of the screen,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.710
we will maintain all
the challenge and UI

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.030
for a voice interaction.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.780
And at the top of the screen
is the developer's UI.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.120
So we split the screen
with the developer.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.530
So the developer only needs
to care about the question

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.400
and what are the
possible answers.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.040
We'll take care of
all the challenges

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.030
that go along with
voice, including

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.590
managing the microphone,
what if the user didn't say

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.190
exactly what was on the list.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.590
All of these things are
Google's responsibility.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.660
So we've made it much
simpler for a developer

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.750
to implement these types
of voice interactions.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.790
And for voice, it's
particularly important,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.290
because there's
always ambiguity,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.532
and there's always
a lack of clarity.

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:49.490
Well, I shouldn't say
always, but there's often

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.590
lack of clarity.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.400
And we want to give
developers the chance

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.340
to build very interesting
and neat applications,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.632
by dialoguing with their users.

00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:58.631
LAURENCE MORONEY: So help
me to understand that.

00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:01.350
So if I did something like,
OK Google, turn on the lights,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.504
and so then this API
would say, do you

00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:04.920
want the bedroom
lights turned on?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.330
Or do you want the
kitchen lights turned on?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.122
That type of thing?

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:09.205
SUNIL VEMURI: Well, it's
the application developer

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:10.450
who would ask that question.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.535
They know what's the best
way to respond to that.

00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:13.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.120
SUNIL VEMURI: So I mean, in a
home automation application,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.700
you might label your lights
as Laurence's Lights,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.220
or Laurence's Office,
or something like that.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.350
So that's where the application
can ask the question,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.550
which room would you like?

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.490
Or it could say
something like, would you

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.770
like Laurence's Office?

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.773
Or Laurence's Room?

00:08:31.773 --> 00:08:32.814
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:33.299
Got it.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.399
SUNIL VEMURI: It's totally
up to the developer.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.880
You know, we want
the developer to have

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.171
the control of that dialogue,
to ask the questions that

00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:40.120
make sense for them,
and also put up

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.010
the nice UI that they might want
to put up with that, as well.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.570
Like they might
have an animation

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.980
or a beautiful display of
different rooms on the screen.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.930
You know, we really
want our developers

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.220
to unleash their
imagination with this.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.870
And so that's why we wanted
to take the burden of handling

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.470
the voice, and let them put
their creativity on the device

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.210
at the same time.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
are there any examples

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.469
of this that are out there
that are working right now?

00:09:05.469 --> 00:09:08.399
SUNIL VEMURI: So right now,
at I/O, we showed the TuneIn

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.690
to an implementation like this.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.350
So they did the following.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.395
OK Google, play some
music on TuneIn.

00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:15.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.686
SUNIL VEMURI: And
then what TuneIn

00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:18.520
would ask is, what genre?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.772
SUNIL VEMURI: Because
the music wasn't clear,

00:09:21.772 --> 00:09:23.230
or what kind of
music wasn't clear.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.540
So they ask, which genre?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.517
They present a list of
the TuneIn channels.

00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:28.475
User can select that,
and then the music plays.

00:09:28.475 --> 00:09:28.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.510
SUNIL VEMURI: So
that's one example

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.490
that we've already seen.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.180
SUNIL VEMURI: And we
have more coming, too.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:32.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.080
And I assume the conversation
can take multiple steps, right?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.310
It's not just a single question.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.760
There can be further
clarifying ones?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.460
SUNIL VEMURI: Absolutely.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.060
And we're looking
forward to the day

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.810
when we can order a
pizza with this thing,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.330
with toppings, and sizes,
and things like that.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:44.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.840
I'm sure it's not too far off.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
SUNIL VEMURI: I hope so.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.600
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So thanks, Sunil.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.400
That was awesome.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.530
And thanks, everybody,
