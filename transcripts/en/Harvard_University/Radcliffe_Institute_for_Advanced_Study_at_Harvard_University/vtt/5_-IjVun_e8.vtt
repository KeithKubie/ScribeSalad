00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:03.610
- Good evening, everyone.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.350
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.690
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
and it's my pleasure to
welcome you to tonight's show

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.840
and tell exploration of
citizenship, gender, and film.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.140
This program kicks off our
Annual Gender Conference,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.280
which is focused this year
on the topic, "Who belongs?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.340
Global Citizenship and
Gender in the 21st Century."

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.970
Before we dive in, I'd like
to thank all of our speakers

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.800
for joining us tonight.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.770
And, again, tomorrow
they'll be another crew.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.460
I'm also grateful to Rebecca
Wassarman, Executive Director

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.860
of Academic Ventures,
Jessica Viklund,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.810
the Director of
Radcliffe Events,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.150
and their fantastic teams.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.310
Thanks as well to
Dan Carpenter, who

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.880
chaired the Faculty Organizing
Committee for the conference,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.210
and to committee members,
Professors Sara Bleich,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.660
Melanie Cammett, Jane
Kamensky, Michele Lemont,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.980
and Mark Tushnet.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.750
And, finally,
thanks to all of you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.500
for joining us here tonight.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.410
Every spring, we
organize this conference

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.160
to address an issue of
broad public concern

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.380
through the lens of gender.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.720
In recent years we
have examined topics

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.740
such as sports, language,
violence, and public health,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.200
to name just a few.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.810
This annual conference
is one manifestation

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.760
of Radcliffe's
founding commitment

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.310
to the study of
gender and society,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.590
which we trace
back to our legacy

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.390
as the institutional descendant
of Radcliffe College.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.910
Today, as Harvard's
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.390
Radcliffe provides a vibrant
interdisciplinary forum,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.730
and convenes leading
thinkers working

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.880
at the forefront of all fields.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.610
Each year we open
our gender conference

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.020
with an evening
dedicated to the arts.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.900
And we do this to fulfill
another core commitment, which

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.710
is the integration of the
creative arts with other forms

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.720
of scholarly inquiry.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.620
We begin with the arts because
artistic expression compels

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.520
us to consider challenging
issues, like citizenship,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.040
from a unique vantage point.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.070
Tonight we are joined by
three talented filmmakers,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.530
and a distinguished
critic, who will engage

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.870
in a discussion about
the power of film

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.900
to shape our understanding
of citizenship and gender

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.010
in important ways.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.090
Film portrayals, both
fictional and documentary,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.540
can bring to life the
complexity of citizenship,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.350
and can show us its relationship
to belonging and exclusion.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.400
These issues inform our
everyday experiences.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.470
So what better medium than
film to capture and elucidate

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.930
how individuals navigate
this lived reality?

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.310
Whether films are shown on
the big screen of a theater,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.220
viewed on a college
campus, or watched

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.450
on a television in our homes,
they offer us a unique entry

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.770
point into how our society
understands citizenship

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.720
and national identity.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.900
And films also shape that
societal understanding.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
One infamous example
is the 1915 film

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.380
The Birth of a Nation, a silent
film directed by D.W. Griffith.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.160
Premiering under the
original title, The Clansman,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.580
this film presented a
three-hour dramatization

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.550
of white supremacist
ideology told

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.430
through the lives of two
intertwined families, one

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.520
Northern and one Southern,
during the Civil War

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.550
and into Reconstruction.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.310
The film romanticized the Ku
Klux Klan as a healing force

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.220
for the South, and it
depicted black people

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.890
in overtly racist
caricatures that became

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.800
widespread and deeply harmful.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800
The Birth of a Nation
also had a profound impact

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.710
on the nascent film
industry largely because

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.860
of its immense popularity
among white audiences.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.130
In reaction to the film in 1915,
the Boston branch of the NAACP

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.240
published a 47-page booklet
condemning the film,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.269
and showing a keen
awareness of the threat it

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.950
posed to black citizenship.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.370
They wrote, and I
quote, "We believe

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.050
this film teaches a propaganda
for the purpose of so stirring

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.010
up the people of the East
and the West and the North,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.990
that they would
consent to allowing

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.840
the Southern program
of disenfranchisement,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.810
segregation, and
lynching of the Negro.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.810
And finally to the repeal of
the 14th and 15th Amendments."

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.910
In the 100-plus years
since that first screening

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.090
of The Birth of a
Nation, mainstream films

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.590
have continued to reinforce
ahistorical storylines and

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.150
damaging stereotypes,
whether intentionally or not.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.060
Still today, widely
distributed films

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.100
tend to reflect a narrow
white and male experience.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.590
According to research
out of the University

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.330
of Southern
California's Annenberg

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.910
School for Communication
and Journalism,

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.500
in the top 100 highest-grossing
films of 2016, less than a 1/3

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.230
of all speaking
characters were women.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.910
That's pretty stunning.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.930
Some 70% of all
characters were white.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.640
Even more stunning.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.750
And a 1/4 of these same films
featured no black speaking

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.320
characters, while over
1/2 lacked Latino speaking

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.230
characters.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.190
Representation is important
both in front of the camera,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.020
and behind it.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.040
I doubt it will surprise anyone
in this room that increasing

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.070
diversity among
directors and producers

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.780
also remains difficult. The
people in those roles shape

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.140
which stories are
told, what we learn,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.740
and how we collectively
think about important issues.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.170
Felix Contreras, who is the
host of the weekly NPR program

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.660
Alt.Latino, lamented
in the run-up

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.650
to the recent Academy Awards,
and I quote, "Very often we

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.400
have to leave the studios
of the Hollywood ecosystem,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.950
and enter the world
of independent film

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.540
to find the diverse communities
that we actually live in."

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.810
Issues of representation
and portrayal in film

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.080
are closely connected to
the question, who belongs,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.420
that animates our conference.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.290
The litany of challenges
is clear, but so too is

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.920
the potential for
storytelling through film

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.770
to serve as a positive force.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.370
I'm delighted that we have such
an outstanding group of experts

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.190
with us tonight to
explore these issues,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.390
and to consider whose
stories get told, by whom,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.040
and for whom.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.720
Gender is our particular
concern over the next 24 hours,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.220
but I'm sure it will come quite
clear that sexual identity is

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.010
deeply intertwined with
race, ethnicity, and class.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.340
Claudia Puig will moderate
tonight's discussion between

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.360
filmmakers Maria Agui
Carter, Heather Courtney,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.440
and Cynthia López.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.650
Claudia is a nationally
recognized film journalist,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.370
the president of the Los Angeles
Film Critics Association,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.550
and a movie critic
for NPR'S FilmWeek.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.720
She's also the former lead
film critic for USA Today.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.000
Claudia will introduce
the panelists,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.460
and you can read full
biographies of everyone

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.340
in your printed program.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.150
Before Claudia and our
panel come up to the stage,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.070
I just want to give you a
quick note about logistics.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.200
We'll hear and see presentations
from all the panelists,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.090
and then Claudia
will engage them

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.280
in conversation as a group.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.260
And following that
discussion, we

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.800
will open up the floor
to your questions.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.180
We'll place a microphone
in the center aisle.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.370
You're invited to
join the conversation,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.180
but please identify yourself
before you ask your question.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.790
I also hope to see many
of you again tomorrow

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.190
morning when the
conference continues

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.680
in this room at 9:00 AM.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.000
So now please join me in giving
a warm welcome to our speakers

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.346
as they come up to the stage.

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:38.806
[CLAPPING]

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.390
- Hi, everybody.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.410
I'll begin with just
a couple of remarks,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.590
and then we will go through
with each of us speaking.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.600
And then we'll have
a joint conversation,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.700
and then we'll
open it up to you.

00:08:55.684 --> 00:08:57.350
I want to talk about,
just for a moment,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:03.134
about the power of film to
broaden us, and to educate.

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.550
How many of you've
watched a movie

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.200
that opened your
eyes to something

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.475
you knew very little about?

00:09:07.475 --> 00:09:09.350
Raise your hand if you've
seen the movie that

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.460
broadened your knowledge
in the past six months.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.050
OK, good.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.210
People often talk about
escaping into films,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.780
but films also escape into us.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.950
They open our eyes, and they
help us understand ourselves.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.020
They help us understand
our fellow human beings.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.650
They reveal us to
ourselves, and reveal

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.960
the experiences of others.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.510
The best films connect us
to our shared humanity.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.920
Films are all about revelation.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.540
They illustrate the
human experience

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.484
in all its glory, messiness,
complexity, and fullness.

00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:44.650
Movies provide a window
into the magnificent breadth

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.940
of who we are, often
exploring the lives of people

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.400
we might otherwise never know.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.650
Films can lay bare the deepest
emotions, and innermost

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.430
thoughts of others, providing a
uniquely revelatory experience.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.950
Films work on our hearts
and minds on so many levels,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.070
engaging and moving us in
conscious and subconscious

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.425
ways.

00:10:03.425 --> 00:10:05.050
Their images make a
powerful impression

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.130
and stay with us, sometimes
throughout our lives.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.130
If I were to go around the
room and asked you to come up

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.680
with an iconic
image from a film,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.510
you'd have no trouble
coming up with it.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.879
What makes it even
better is that the

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:18.920
what made those deep
impressions will probably be

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.570
different for everybody here.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.160
I immediately thought
of the little girl

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.590
in the red coat in
Schindler's List,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.990
and all the black
and white around her.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.450
The chess game between
the knight and death

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.190
in Seventh Seal.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.149
Howard Beale screaming,
I'm mad as hell

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:37.940
and I'm not going to
take it anymore, which

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.240
seems appropriate these days.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.060
So images on screen
seep into our pores,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.500
they burrow under our skin,
they live on in our minds.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.380
Films engage us orally,
emotionally, intellectually.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.750
The combined effects of
cinematography, score,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.770
dialogue, sound
design, and of course,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.130
the characters themselves,
provide lasting images

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.200
that we often
compare to real life.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.420
Sometimes real life
feels like a movie.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.874
The best movies
feel like real life.

00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:06.290
The three filmmakers
whose work we

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.840
are so fortunate to be
exploring here tonight

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.462
offer just that kind
of deep revelation.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:12.920
The process of
watching their films

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.960
is almost like excavation.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.660
They mine their own experiences,
and those of others,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.580
grappling with
adapting to society.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.830
Their work digs deeply
into the fraught process

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.881
of emigrating and acclimating
to a new environment.

00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:26.630
Watching films like
those of our panelists

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.340
can help us understand
one another.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.750
They can help us keep
from seeing those who

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.470
are not like us as the "other."

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.475
They remind us that we are
all citizens of the world,

00:11:39.475 --> 00:11:41.600
and as such, we have more
in common with each other

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.060
than we have differences.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.560
By delving into portrayals like
the ones we're about to see,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.170
we can better understand,
empathize with, and ideally,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.160
help one another in our
common global citizenship.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.470
And as we recognize our
commonalities as human beings,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.870
we get a clearer sense of
what others experience,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.100
the barriers they face--

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.490
whether literal walls, or
psychological and cultural

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.140
obstacles.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.080
I was thinking that the word
"citizenship"-- and citizenship

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.940
means so much more than
living within certain borders.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.400
When we were all in grade school
it meant behaving responsibly.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.340
You get a citizenship
grade, and that

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.280
pertained to our behavior,
our human decency,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.140
even as children.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.312
So good citizens are human
beings who behave well.

00:12:22.312 --> 00:12:24.020
They care for their
brothers and sisters,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.900
and they make the
world a better place.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.840
Films can offer us that portal
to being better citizens,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.610
more exemplary humans.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.380
The best films go
beyond the obvious

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.110
and deepen our understanding,
challenge our expectations,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.150
and reshape our preconceptions.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.270
They illuminate and
elucidate, and in the process,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.240
encourage essential compassion.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.922
In the best cases,
they can transform us.

00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:47.630
I'm very grateful to
be here in this room

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.600
as we ask today and
tomorrow, who belongs?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.080
The answer as I see
it is, we all do.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.640
And films powerfully
and passionately

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.820
make our global sense of
community abundantly clear.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.460
So I'm happy to be hosting this
opening panel on citizenship

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.860
and gender as viewed
through the lens

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.340
of masterful cinematic
storytellers.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.980
I'm delighted to introduce
you to Cynthia López,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.560
Heather Courtney,
Maria Agui Carter,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.981
and they will each show clips
from their impressive body

00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:15.480
of work.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.604
So I'll start with Cynthia.

00:13:16.604 --> 00:13:17.900
- Hi, good evening.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.130
I think I'm going to stand at
the podium a couple of minutes.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.830
And I'd first like to say
that I'm thrilled to be here

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.910
this evening to be part of
this conversation, citizenship,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.650
gender, and film.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:36.050
I'd like to thank you, Dean
Elizabeth Cohen, Rebecca

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.600
Wassarman, and Maria Agui
Carter for inviting me

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.050
this evening to share some
insights and some experiences.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.290
During my past 25 years,
I've had the privilege

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.280
to be a library advocate raising
money for the nation's poorest

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.450
libraries.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.760
Then I turned, and I
was executive producer

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.220
of the award-winning
series, POV.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.440
And, most recently, I
was film commissioner

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.680
of New York City, where I
was the steward of the media

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.170
and entertainment
business industry.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.310
To begin, I'd like to share with
you a transformational moment

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.760
in my life, and tell you
a little bit about myself.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.900
I call it "Rosary
Beads and Sundance."

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.490
In 2005, it had snowed
more than 20 inches,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.300
and I had anxiously arrived
at the Salt Lake City airport.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.920
I was going to New York City.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.570
I was making it home.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.560
I had just attended the
Sundance Film Festival.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.570
I had one of those
rare moments that you

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.600
have in your career, where
you feel accomplished.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.400
And I kept on
thinking, this is what

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.120
it feels like to be
a star quarterback,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.670
running that last stretch right
before you have that touchdown.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.080
I felt just like that.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.780
I had met with all the
filmmakers I wanted to meet.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.210
I had all the business
meetings I wanted to do.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.840
I successfully completed, and
I actually saw some films,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.120
at Sundance, too.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.580
And now, even though I
was thoroughly exhausted,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.900
I had to get on this flight,
and get to the Reuters studio

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.510
at 6:00 AM the next day.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.390
I was meeting Gloria Steinem.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.850
I had reached out
to her and asked

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.380
her, could she help us promote
a film directed by Shola Lynch,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.190
called Chisholm '72, which
was about Shirley Chisholm,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.730
the first black woman to run for
President of the United States.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.580
My cell phone rang, and
it was my colleague.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.860
And all I could hear her say,
flights are being canceled,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.650
I'm very concerned.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.610
Maybe you won't
be in the studio.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.230
Maybe we'll lose this string
of interviews that you set up.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.380
Before my cell
phone died, I heard

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.460
Cynthia, I canceled flight,
was able to purchase a business

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.480
class ticket.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.540
Get to counter immediately.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.930
I ran frantically with my
carry-ons, and my Sundance

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.150
bags, and my heavy snow boots.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.410
I was a wreck.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.050
An absolute wreck.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.610
All of the sudden,
I thought, how

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.480
can I go from being
that quarterback,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.200
to totally feeling
demoralized and absolutely

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.850
with nothing left?

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.550
But, oh my god, I have
to get on this plane.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.040
And all I kept on
thinking was, nothing

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.090
will change and diminish
this moment, because I will

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.070
meet Gloria Steinem tomorrow.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.210
No matter what.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.910
When I was a kid, I went
to all these marches.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.100
My mother and I-- she
wanted to teach me.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.110
You have to fight for equality.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.060
You have to fight for justice.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.840
These things won't come
to you, unless you work.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.420
I was looking down in
a haze of exhaustion,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.490
when two US patrol
officers started

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.310
walking up and down the aisles.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.150
And people were lined up to do
the final security checkpoints.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.710
And then, as if I was the
central character of a Lifetime

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:03.160
movie special, I heard, Cynthia
López, please step out of line.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.130
You were wanted for inspection.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:13.119
Cynthia López, step out of line,
you were wanted for inspection.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:18.010
And as I saw the patrol officers
walk near, I kept thinking,

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.540
this can't be happening.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.609
This just cannot be happening.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:26.520
I was terrorized, and for a
quick second, I said to myself,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.460
did I have a jelly
donut in my backpack?

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.650
Did I have extra sugar?

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.380
Was it my Chinese
herbs that somehow

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.510
look weird to the inspectors?

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.680
What had I done to
engender an inspection?

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.210
Frantically, I started
saying, why are you taking me?

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.240
I'm an American.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.490
I'm a citizen.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.860
I was born in this country.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.330
Sit down, ma'am.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.690
Please be quiet,
and do not move.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:00.940
Sit here, and someone will come
and ask you a few questions.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.710
I have to get on this flight.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.630
Can you please call PBS?

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.860
Call my superior.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.260
Call the Sundance Festival.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.060
They'll vouch for me, really.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.890
I'm an American.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.300
They opened my luggage and took
everything out, piece by piece

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.680
by piece.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.960
And I have to say,
if anyone could

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.890
have an internal nervous
breakdown, I had one that day.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.690
For sure.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.170
Please call the main office
at Sundance, I pleaded.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.400
Please.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.130
You can even see the
program in my luggage.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.330
Ma'am, do not get excitable.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.860
There is nothing to
get excited about.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.310
You don't need to get anxious.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.310
I was having an
out-of-body experience,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.190
and I understood that
everything that we

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.700
had to contend with at the
time was the extra security

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.540
measures.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:57.100
If you remember I
said this was 2005.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.770
My stepsister works in
the financial industry.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.770
Hell, I understand
that we all have

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.830
to deal with extra security.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.980
Thankfully, her office
was on the 68th floor

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.450
of the World Trade Center.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.210
Thankfully, she was
not there that day.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.720
But I understand,
as an American,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.090
we have to take precautions.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.000
When I heard the
woman inspectors say,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.890
she looks Syrian, we have
to take all precautions.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.420
I died inside.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.620
And I said, I'm from Brooklyn.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.960
I am from Brooklyn.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.380
I am an American.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.820
As she looked
through my luggage,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.450
she found rosary beads that
I had purchased in Italy,

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.050
and I had joked with my brother,
these will protect my luggage

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.210
from ever being stolen.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.140
The agent then asked,
are you Catholic?

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.460
And for a second I said, I'm
actually Episcopalian now.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.980
And then I caught
myself and said,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.115
absolutely I'm a
registered Catholic.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:05.540
Joe, call Sundance and see
if they can vouch for her.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.460
My hands were shaking,
and I kept thinking,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.890
I'm not from another country.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.160
But when they asked me where I
was from, and I said Brooklyn,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.010
they didn't really like that.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.010
But where are your
parents from, they said.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:25.030
I snapped back, well my
father is from Puerto Rico,

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.190
and my mother is
from Long Island.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.490
All your family is
from another country.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.240
I was terrorized again,
but I tried to explain,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.320
well actually Puerto Rico is a
territory of the United States.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.990
It's like Guam or
the Virgin Islands,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.930
and a few other islands
that the US owns,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.000
that they usually get
from wars that they have,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.490
and Puerto Rico specifically
came from Spain.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.250
And then I caught myself,
and I remembered my oh

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.720
my mother always saying,
just answer the question.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.480
And I became quiet.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.140
The male patrol guard
came back and he said,

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.270
the Sundance office
vouched for her.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.100
She's legit.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.160
Ma'am, do you understand
why we brought you

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.230
to the security check?

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.350
Do you understand,
ma'am, why you're here?

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.330
And I was shaking
because I thought,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.680
I didn't bring my passport.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.900
I just had my driver's ID.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.080
But I always used my
driver's ID to travel.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.860
Well let me explain.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.090
You canceled your flight,
purchased another ticket,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.240
and it was all through a
third party in New York.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.060
And your luggage is on the
other plane, and truth be told,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.280
you don't look like
you're an American.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.490
Plus our cameras picked up
that you look pretty frantic

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.750
in the lobby.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.680
What were you doing?

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.840
What were you looking for?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.030
And I tried not to engage.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.880
I kept my head down,
and I just thought,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.950
I have to get on the plane.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.490
I am meeting Gloria
Steinem, I said in my head.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.880
I was looking for an
outlet to plug my phone.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.220
That's what I was doing, I said.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.930
Well, no problem.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.570
We'll run you over to the plane.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.640
When I ran through the
terminal with the two

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.180
agents and the dogs--

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.700
they escorted me to my
business class ticket--

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.950
I felt devastated.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.620
Ms. López, on behalf
of the US government,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.890
we deeply apologize for any
inconvenience this may have

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.660
caused.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.300
When they said that, all
the other passengers looked

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.010
at me like, what had I done?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:33.760
And if you know me, I'm a very
actually quiet, shy person.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.430
Please have a good day, he said.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.930
I nodded out of compliance.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.310
I just put my head
down, and I was shaking.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.640
And I finally cried
uncontrollably

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.100
when the airplane doors closed.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.590
And all I could
think of was lots

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:56.050
of people get trapped like
this every single day.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.450
And I just felt
like it wasn't over.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.810
And now every time
I go to the airport,

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.790
my heart flutters until I
pass the final security points

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:11.380
because I never want my
citizenship, or my identity,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.440
to ever be confused.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.530
So I will not take the
remaining couple of minutes

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.960
that I have to give you a
Puerto Rican history lesson,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.430
but there are a couple of
things I do want to say.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.070
Puerto Rico was acquired by
the United States in 1898.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.730
Puerto Ricans are US citizens
since the Jones Act in 1917.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.090
And the US wanted to ensure that
Puerto Rican men participate

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.490
in all US wars.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.070
Puerto Rico is a commonwealth
of the United States,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.600
which means that Puerto
Ricans are US citizens,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.970
but we cannot vote for the
President of the United States

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.820
unless you live on the mainland.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.220
Currently, the Puerto
Rican government, not

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.590
the Puerto Rican people,
owe $72 billion in debt.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.630
And the US federal
government is currently

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.270
deciding how that
debt should be paid.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.470
And due to Hurricane Maria,
the Puerto Rican debt crisis,

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.170
Puerto Ricans on the
island are facing

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:19.433
the worst humanitarian
crisis in its history.

00:24:19.433 --> 00:24:22.390
450 Puerto Rican people
have left the island

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.580
over the last year and a half.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.770
And recently-- I have to say,
in doing research for this panel

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.980
and also for a project
I'm working on--

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.920
I learned that the Harvard
Student Labor Movement,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.520
along with activists from
Hedge Clippers, and others,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.480
marched here at Harvard
Yard, protesting

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.640
in support of divestment.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.240
Because the Harvard endowment,
which currently totals

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.490
$36 billion, has $2 billion
invested in a company

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.070
called Buy Post Investment.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.710
And they, in turn, have $911
million invested in COFINA

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.440
in Puerto Rico.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.720
As an American, I
ask, shouldn't we

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.530
learn more about how daily
decisions impact other US

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.760
citizens?

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.770
Shouldn't we think about solar,
water, and renewable energies,

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.670
and how that investment
could maybe yield

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.980
long-term and higher results?

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.560
So I thank you for listening
to me, and for me sharing

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.420
"Rosary Beads and Sundance."

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.840
But I also want to
show you a little clip.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.730
For 14 years, I was part of
an incredible team at POV--

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.860
point of view
documentaries-- and this

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.100
shows you a little clip
of, a little taste,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.310
of what some of the most
powerful Latino filmmakers

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.700
are doing today.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.770
Thank you very much.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.243

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:53.644 --> 00:25:56.790
- This is going to happen
to any institution,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.536
and any oppressed community,
that does not respond

00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:00.660
to the needs of the people.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.310
- Part of my role as a
documentary filmmaker

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.340
is to work for human rights.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.129
And I feel that my
work is not done yet.

00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:11.394
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:11.394 --> 00:26:15.250
- In this situation,
somebody in the place

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.640
has got to have courage
to risk everything.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.092
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:26:22.092 --> 00:26:24.380
- Let go of my camera.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.160
Let go of my camera.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.596
- I felt that the documentary
could be the most immediate way

00:26:30.596 --> 00:26:32.345
to get to people, to
make them understand,

00:26:32.345 --> 00:26:35.980
to see and actually
feel what was going on.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.940
- Workers started coming in
to the garment workers' center

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.180
with complaints about owed
wages, injuries on the job.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.180
- I was trying to get very
close with the characters,

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.764
that you could
almost smell them.

00:26:48.764 --> 00:26:51.420
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.840
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.030
- I think a documentary
has the unique power

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.820
to let you experience
someone else's life.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.100
- I knew something big
was going to happen.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.690
I knew I was going to get
some type of awakening.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.550
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.780
- In many countries
in the world,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.491
governments do things that their
people wish they didn't do.

00:27:27.491 --> 00:27:31.140
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.030
- Who are we, as Latinos?

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.649
Do we matter?

00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:34.940
What's our role as an American?

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.750
- Both my parents,
they came here

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.200
to work, and to better the
lives of their children, of us.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.960
- What I really wanted to do
was capture the sense of humor

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.136
and the culture behind
the economic crisis.

00:27:46.136 --> 00:27:56.489
[SINGING]

00:27:56.489 --> 00:27:58.640
- I love making
documentaries, and I

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.845
want to keep making films,
and telling stories.

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:03.920
- The camera illuminates
so many things.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.020
- On a personal level,
this film has changed me.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.150
- Without documentaries,
if we don't have that,

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.862
if we can't look at
ourselves and see

00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:12.320
what's going on right now, how
do we know what's out there?

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.403
- We don't need cover-ups.

00:28:13.403 --> 00:28:15.500
We don't need interference,
we need the truth.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.434
- Dear Selena, I
give you this letter

00:28:18.434 --> 00:28:22.346
so you would know that
lots of people love you.

00:28:22.346 --> 00:28:25.840
- We're showing the
power that we have.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.770
We're not a minority,
we're the majority.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.046
[CHEERING]

00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:33.960
- We are making films.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.910
We are talking
about our stories.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.770
People can now say, I
can make a documentary.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.240
And they can be a
part of my experience,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.402
and part of my culture,
and a part of me.

00:28:44.402 --> 00:28:45.866
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:48.794

00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:57.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.100
- Let me introduce you.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.660
Sorry about that.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.410
This is Heather
Courtney, and she

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.010
is an independent filmmaker--
documentary filmmaker.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.710
She was a 2014
Guggenheim Fellow,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.800
and won an Emmy and an
Independent Spirit Award

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.620
for her film Where
Soldiers Come From.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.770
It was broadcast on
the PBS series POV.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.110
She is currently co-directing
and producing the feature

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.890
documentary The Unafraid about
undocumented immigrant students

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.418

00:29:28.418 --> 00:29:29.396
Welcome.

00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:34.775
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:36.900
- Yeah, I have the
actual privilege

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.979
of having worked
with Cynthia for--

00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:42.270
while I was making Where
Soldiers Come From, because it

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.700
was broadcast on POV.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.990
And she really is
that powerhouse,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.730
she's running
through the airport,

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.970
and she's an amazing person.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.110
And I just wanna thank
the Radcliffe Institute

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.220
for inviting me to
be on this panel.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.390
I think when you first
e-mailed me I was, like--

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.806
I think I emailed you back--
and I was, like, are you sure

00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:05.380
you want-- am i the
person you meant to email?

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.030
No.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.440
But anyway, so here I am.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.090
And thank you very much
for inviting me to this.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.800
So I want to talk about
a couple of documentaries

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.720
that I made in, not my
past life, but a while ago.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.910
Before Where Soldiers
Come From on POV,

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.940
I made a couple of
films about immigration.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.430
And I was interested in
the topic of immigration

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.480
for a lot of reasons, but I
worked for about eight years

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:40.260
for various NGOs that worked
on immigrant refugee rights.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.370
Including, I worked in
the Rwandan refugee camps

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.290
after the Rwandan genocide.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.720
And that was when
I decided I needed

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.650
to be better able to tell
a story because of all

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.970
the stories I had heard there.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.727
And that's when I came
back, and I did a film--

00:30:57.727 --> 00:30:58.560
well and I went to--

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.490
I applied to film school.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:06.010
And that's what led
me down this path now.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.680
So the first documentary
I actually made

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.070
was called Los Trabajadores,
and that was my thesis film

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.614
at the University of Texas.

00:31:13.614 --> 00:31:15.780
And shortly after that, I
made a film called Letters

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.250
From the Other Side.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.840
And they're both films
about Mexican migration--

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.810
migration to the US from Mexico.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.580
One is from the
male point of view,

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.170
and Letters From
the Other Side is

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.130
from the woman's point of view.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.970
So, the two sides of
the immigration story.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.180
One is the husbands, the
fathers, the sons, and brothers

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.230
who leave their families and
communities behind in Mexico

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.990
to find work in the US, to
provide for the families

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.280
they leave behind.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.857
And the other side, which
was often less talked about,

00:31:50.857 --> 00:31:52.440
is that of the women
and children left

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:58.260
behind when their husbands
and fathers migrate,

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.230
and how their lives,
their responsibilities,

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.610
and their roles change.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.100
They're all being
affected by these forces

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.810
beyond their control.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.220
And it's not just
here in the US,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.490
it's back home in
their home villages.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.520
So I want to start with a
clip from Los Trabajadores--

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.430
The Workers.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.695
It was my first documentary,
as I said, my thesis film

00:32:22.695 --> 00:32:23.820
at The University of Texas.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.640
It came out in
2001, so I apologize

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.440
for the 4:3 format
and the low quality,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.490
but that's what
it was back then.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:41.700
So just to give you a brief
background to the clip

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.797
you're going to see.

00:32:43.797 --> 00:32:45.630
In Austin, where I was
going to grad school,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.230
there was a day laborer site
where immigrant day laborers

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.230
would wait for work every day.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:56.610
And there was a lot of
grumbling from the people

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.520
in that neighborhood about how
they didn't want this day labor

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.920
site there.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.490
They didn't understand,
or know any of these men.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:09.500
And I thought, well, they
had a lot of misperceptions,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.890
and maybe one way that I could
fight these misperceptions

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.130
is if I got to know
some of these men,

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.190
and humanize the issue, and
told a story about them.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.910
So that's how I met Ramon,
who is the man you're

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.760
going to see in this clip.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.640
I met him at the day labor site.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.980
He had come from Mexico.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.980
He was a husband to
Virginia, and the father

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.090
of 19-year-old [INAUDIBLE],,
and 12-year-old [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.530
And this is just a short clip
that gives you a sense of him,

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.726
and why he came to the US.

00:33:46.726 --> 00:33:49.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.080
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:07.066 --> 00:35:09.010
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:14.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.500
- I feel like that clip
kind of speaks for itself.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.620
I mean, especially when
we think about the theme

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.530
of this conference,
citizenship and who belongs.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.150
And for Ramon, and for
most of the men like him,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.950
who have migrated
to the US to work,

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.460
to support their
families back in Mexico,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.830
it's not really about--

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.600
they don't consider
crossing the border

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.910
as doing something illegal.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.310
It's like the thing they have to
do to provide for their family.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.570
Like he says it's not
against the law of me

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.730
as a husband and me as a father.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.710
And I feel like a lot today--

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:53.070
I hear this a lot because in the
current film that I'm working

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.920
on-- which actually I just
finished with my co-director,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.730
Anayansi Prado--

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.260
is a film called The Unafraid.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.940
It's premiering on Saturday.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.980
It's about DACA
students, actually.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.460
And a lot of times you'll
hear in the news, people say,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.130
oh, well, you know those kids
didn't do anything wrong.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.520
As if their parents, who
sacrificed everything

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.990
to cross the border, and
who work 18 hours a day,

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.490
two or three different jobs so
their kids will have a better

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.040
life-- as if they did
something wrong, right?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.009
So anyway, sorry.

00:36:22.009 --> 00:36:23.550
I'm just getting on
my soapbox there.

00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:28.505
It always really angers
me when people insinuate

00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:30.630
that their parents, who
have sacrificed everything,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.720
have done something wrong.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.220
OK.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.490
Anyway, so what I'm--

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.051
sorry I just, like, really
got off on a tangent there.

00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:41.550
OK.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.300
So while I was making Los
Trabajadores, I went to Mexico,

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.150
and I met Virginia and--

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.180
Ramon's wife, Virginia,
and his two daughters.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.500
And it was--

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.910
I wish I could
show clips of them

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.950
but we don't have enough time.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.140
But it was through
them that I got

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.400
the idea for my next
film, which is about women

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.770
and children in Mexico
who have been left behind

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.800
by the men who come to the US.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.550
Because I was really
struck by that.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.450
That it was something
that I, even,

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.770
hadn't thought a lot about
until I met his family.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.980
And I feel like it wasn't
really a story that

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.140
was talked about that much.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.670
So I started to do a lot of
research, and I was reading--

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.982
and this was, like, 2003-ish.

00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:30.690
And I was reading a
lot about how there's

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.270
whole villages in Mexico
where there's only women,

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:34.650
and children, and old men left.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.040
There's no men, or
young men, left there.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.410
So that's when I decided
to go down to Mexico.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.400
And I met some--

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.480
I met various women through
some different programs

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.160
that work with women
in the villages there.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.100
And I followed--
well unlike Ramon,

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.420
who was sending money
home all the time,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.250
the women I met there were--

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:05.590
several of them were forced
to be, like, the breadwinner

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.070
for their family.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.010
And it was, for
various reasons, I

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.960
met two widows
whose husbands died

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.050
in the biggest immigrant
smuggling case at the time.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.700
It was the truck that
had 100 men-- or, 100

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.620
people in the back of it that
was stopped in Victoria, Texas.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.640
And so I met two widows of two
men who died in that truck.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.950
And even though they were
just grieving they still now

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.200
were forced to think
about how they were going

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.690
to provide for their children.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.350
And then I also met a
woman named Eugenia.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.150
And her situation was
much more complex.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.390
I mean, her husband
went to the US,

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.180
and initially he was
sending money back,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.260
and keeping in touch.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.060
But it's very difficult for a
lot of people who come here,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.720
obviously.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.810
And I'm sure you
know why, and can--

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.190
and so he kind of lost
his way, started drinking,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.190
and went down a bad
path, and sort of

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.050
lost touch with his family.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.360
And so Eugenia was then--

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.820
kind of had to step up,
and try and figure out

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.400
how to provide for her family.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.670
So I'm going to show
a clip of Eugenia.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.749
And, just to set up the
clip, it's a video letter.

00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:22.540
That's what the Letters
From the Other Side

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.220
is, which happened organically
when I was making the film.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.550
I was going back to Texas
to visit some friends,

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.160
and Eugenia said, well, can
you visit my son in Arizona?

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.460
And can you show him the
videos that I've been-

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.930
that you've been making of me?

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.596
And that's when I
realized how messed up

00:39:39.596 --> 00:39:42.430
it was that I could go visit
her son, a complete stranger,

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.250
and she can't visit her son
because she lives in Mexico,

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.900
and she can't cross the border.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.230
So it became a part of the film
where I would go back and forth

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.370
with these video letters.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.030
So this is one clip
I'm going to show--

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.670
it's actually one scene that
I broke into two small clips

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.990
because it's too long
to play the whole scene.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.670
So we'll just show the first
part of the scene, and then

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.494
the second part.

00:42:16.275 --> 00:42:18.570
- And then there's just
this little second part

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:24.360
where they are reacting after
they see a video from their--

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.470
from her husband, and
they're reacting to it.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.820
He talks about how he wants to--

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.486
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:51.435 --> 00:43:58.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:03.370
- So, it's very complex,
their situation.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.960
It's not that, like,
oh he's a jerk,

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.310
you didn't send any money back.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:11.430
It's a very difficult thing
that a lot of these families

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.420
go through.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.740
And even if he had been
sending money back,

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.790
the women's roles are changing
because they're there alone

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.770
with the kids, as well.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:28.300
So I definitely-- I wish
you could see the whole film

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.580
because I don't want it to
seem like I'm demonizing

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.420
her husband-- because he's
been through a lot as well,

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.620
and he left with
all good intentions

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.350
because he wasn't able
to survive financially

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.850
there, and support
his family there.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.450
And he thought he could
do that in the US.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.570
I'm running out of time.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:51.220
But I just wanted to say
one other thing about--

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.800
migration from Mexico has
actually changed a lot

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.720
since I made those two films.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.830
It's definitely gone down
since the recession of 2008,

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.470
and even more so
in the last year,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.650
or so, because of the
current administration.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.500
Trump.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.300
So anyway, it's changed a lot.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.460
And a lot of--

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.080
talking about gender
and citizenship,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.420
a lot of people
coming to the US now

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.400
are women and children
from Central America.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.220
And the women are fleeing
domestic violence,

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.210
or they're fleeing just
violence in their countries

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:30.250
of Honduras, and
Guatemala, and I'm sorry--

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.590
in El Salvador, right?

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.880
Yeah, and so there's a lot
of-- and I sat with the asylum

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.280
attorney and listened
to some women's stories

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.270
a couple of months ago.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:43.630
And it's really awful
what's going on there.

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:47.380
And so I know Trump is all
about sending National Guard

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.490
troops to the border now.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.572
But I mean, these are women and
children fleeing gang violence.

00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:53.530
Where they're getting
murdered, their daughters

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.930
are getting raped, and the
kids are forced to join gangs,

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.410
and if they don't join gangs,
they'll also be killed.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.050
So I just wanted
to bring that up.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.440
And I have a new
film out that I've

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.780
made with my colleague and
friend, Anayansi Prado,

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.680
called The Unafraid.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.680
It premieres on Saturday,
but you can check it out

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.100
on Facebook.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.200
You can see the trailer.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.170
It's called The Unafraid
documentary, if you search it,

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.424
and it's about DACA
students and who belongs.

00:46:19.424 --> 00:46:29.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:29.798 --> 00:46:33.910
- And next up, we have
María Agui Carter.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.670
She's a writer, director,
and filmmaker, as well as

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.980
an assistant professor
of visual and media

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.690
arts at Emerson College.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.270
She'll soon be directing her
new script, The Secret Life

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:47.350
of La Mariposa a fable
about an undocumented girl,

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.420
immigrant rights, and
the environment, which

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.054
is based on her own experiences
growing up undocumented.

00:46:53.054 --> 00:46:54.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.500
- Hello.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.260
Latinos make up the largest
ethnic minority in the US,

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.470
but have been erased from
the American narrative.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.810
We're framed as
eternal immigrants who

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.560
just swam across the
border, and therefore, have

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:17.130
no right to the American
present or the American future.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:21.120
I was drawn to the story of a
19th century Cuban immigrant,

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.590
Loreta Velazquez.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.340
Because for over a century,
she's been dismissed as a hoax,

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.040
even though contemporary
researchers have

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.020
found her records in
the National Archives,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.490
in newspapers, and personal
papers of the time.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:39.900
And I'll share a short three
minute clip of my film.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.150
It's a feature
documentary called Rebel.

Although it is not certain
this is her picture.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.690
We really don't know
what she looked like.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.170
Loreta was not the only woman
soldier in the American Civil

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:44.730
War, but few left a record
of their experience.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:51.672
She published a memoir,
The Woman in Battle.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:50:58.068 --> 00:51:03.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.730
- Loreta struggled to prove
she was a true American.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:10.640
She was an immigrant,
grew up in New Orleans.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.980
And when the Civil
War broke out,

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.580
she joined the Confederacy,
disguised as a man.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.100
By the end of the
war, records show,

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.890
she had become a union spy.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.200
Her memoir criticized
the Confederacy

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.330
and the corruption of war.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.490
I was interested in
the complex interplay

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:32.270
between the woman, the myth,
and, really, the politics

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.160
of national memory.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.040
In today's America,
post-Charlottesville,

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.680
my film about her has
become a political target

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.890
for its feminist and Latino
historical perspective,

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:46.520
with one contemporary historian
dismissing her as a prostitute.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.700
Just as her 19th
century attackers did.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.940
So she continues to be
considered, by some, as a hoax,

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.290
even though there are so
many records about her.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:59.740
Loreta arrived in the
US as a 7-year-old.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.200
As did I. And in
the 19th century,

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.630
prior to the Civil War,
you didn't need permission

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.060
to come to this country.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.430
But in the 20th
century, my mother

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.250
waited years for
permission to immigrate.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.370
You could only get
US tourist visas.

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.460
In New York City, on
the day they expired,

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.907
we became criminals.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:28.880
Patrick, would you mind
putting up the PowerPoint?

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.550
My newest film, The Secret
Life of La Mariposa,

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.820
is set in a dystopia
where the government hunts

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.280
the undocumented,
and climate change

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.260
has reached a tipping point.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.630
It's a theatrical
fiction film based

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.860
on my personal experience,
told as a coming-of-age fable

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:50.140
about the struggles of
an undocumented girl.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.120
When my mother was
fired from jobs

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.140
without pay, when the roaches
crawled our walls like a horror

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.410
film scene, we bore it quietly.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:02.470
Complaining to any authority
was out of the question.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.750
We understood that
nobody, such as we,

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:08.150
were not considered human
beings, with human rights.

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:10.810
We were considered
illegal aliens.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.220
We had no safety net.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.870
Received no welfare.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.120
Reflected in the eyes
of the dollar shop

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.850
clerks, of my teachers,
of my neighbors,

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.770
I could see we were nobodies.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:25.870
I learned not to ask for help,
not to imagine I deserved any.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.310
We hid our status.

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.650
Never spoke up against
injustice or those

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.840
who took advantage of us.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.950
Afraid to unleash a hurricane,
afraid it might destroy us,

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:39.490
and that tenuous world we
had built up around us.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.770
As a child, I
internalized we had

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:43.870
done something terribly wrong.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.230
And I wasn't sure why, but
I accepted we didn't belong.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.330
That we were criminals.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.940
I knew fear, not facts.

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:56.270
And there was no one to ask,
lest we reveal ourselves.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.000
I was 10 when my mother
met an American who

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.600
promised to marry her
and sponsor our papers.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.650
I was 18 when we
became legal residents.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:07.880
It came at a price.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.640
You see, being
undocumented isn't just

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.720
about being denied a
driver's license, or college.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.550
Those kinds of obstacles
are prohibitive enough.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.280
Lack of citizenship
often waterfalls

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.460
into being denied
civil and human rights.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.710
As an undocumented immigrant
mother such as mine,

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.350
she had to consider,
what would happen

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:35.740
if she reported her citizen
husband for molesting

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.020
her undocumented daughter?

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.200
What if her husband had
deported her instead?

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.140
What if her daughter
was taken away?

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.380
And if she successfully
defended herself, and myself,

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:52.390
against him, how would she take
care of her new infant boys

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.210
if she sent their
father to jail?

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:58.990
What would become of them when
her chronic asthma sent her

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:02.590
to emergency rooms
and lost her, her job?

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.870
My mother was forced to
choose between the needs

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.900
of a teen daughter
and two infant boys.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.190
She chose the boys.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.730
Akira Kurosawa, the
great film director,

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:18.560
once said, the role of the
artist is never to look away.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.350
My role as an artist
is not to recount,

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:24.320
but to find shape
and meaning in a way

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.710
that argument and
reason can never do.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:30.590
Here's the story behind my film.

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.010
After I turned 18, I never
lived with her again.

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.770
I would call once in a blue
moon, always drawn to her--

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.420
my first love--

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.550
even after her betrayal.

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:45.190
Given our troubled past,
many subjects were taboo.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.710
One of the few safe
ones being gardening.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:50.720
And so we would
communicate in the language

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.060
of flowers and plants.

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.760
She especially liked to
tell me about her garden.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.780
Whether the papaya
tree had fruited yet.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.250
That her hibiscus was blooming.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.490
If I veered into other
territory, emotions, politics,

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.250
my film, she
changed the subject.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.560
I figured she wasn't
really listening.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.150
That she didn't care.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.550
Now I think she didn't
know what to say.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:17.040
She wasn't really educated
beyond sixth grade.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.310
She spoke English
with a thick accent,

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:22.850
and covered her mouth when
she smiled or laughed.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.240
She had a chipped front tooth.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.800
But also as if any
happiness seeping out

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.540
was unseemly for
the likes of her.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.890
She is one of those
generous Latina women.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.950
The kind that fed you and gave
you the shirt off her back.

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:43.220
The kind that desperately
wanted to be a good mother.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.970
The kind whose choices
in life were never fair.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.970
The kind that believed
in decency and morality,

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.640
and never, ever cursed.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.330
When I had my own daughter,
I became even more enraged

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.350
at her.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.930
I would walk through
fire to save my daughter.

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:06.090
How could she have allowed my
stepfather to do what he did?

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.820
What kind of narcissistic
monster was she?

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.480
I judged her, with my
good job, and my options

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.300
spread out before me.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.720
And so passed 20 years, as
my children grew and did not

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.460
know their grandmother.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.830
My stepfather left
her for another woman.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.020
She called me after she
was about to be thrown out

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.030
of her house in foreclosure.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.010
And I took over her payments.

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:31.449
After that we spoke
every few months.

00:57:31.449 --> 00:57:33.990
When the air conditioner broke,
or the washing machine needed

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.970
fixing, I would send a check.

00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:38.670
But I had long ago
stopped visiting.

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:40.720
Until I learned she was dying.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.970
She had cancer, and they
operated on her immediately.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.210
I went to see her.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:49.950
Her cancer had been cut out,
but dementia had set in.

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:54.140
Perhaps the forgetting would
finally bring her some peace.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.380
She had always taken
care of her appearance.

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.110
And I was shocked by
the thin frail woman

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.650
with the lined, unadorned
face in front of me.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.450
She had always made
it a point never

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:07.750
to be seen in public
without her lipstick.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.040
I hardly recognized her.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.230
She looked at me blankly.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.760
Do you know who I am, I said.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.240
Si, she said.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.190
You're my mother.

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:21.630
And my hands immediately
flew up to my few gray hairs,

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:25.290
and I vowed to dye
them immediately.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:30.930
And I also remembered that her
mother had died very young.

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:33.060
I stroked her
hand, and I nodded.

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.350
I'm whoever you want
me to be, I thought.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.170
How are you,
beloved, I whispered.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.650
And that word just slipped
out of me unbidden.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.050
I hadn't professed my
love for her in decades.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:51.110
My mother tilted her head
and thought a minute.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.450
On top of everything,
at the hospital

00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:58.540
she had fallen in the
bathroom and broken her femur.

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.480
[SPANISH], she said.

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.446
In English that
means, I'm F-U-C-K'd.

00:59:04.446 --> 00:59:06.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.150
Before I left, I laid out one
of her favorite dresses, a plum

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:15.670
silk, and lace, and rhinestone
dress that she loved.

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.440
And she was one of
those seamstresses

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.520
who had no buttons or zippers
in any of her clothes.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.090
Everything was put
together with safety pins.

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:27.100
And I pulled out
a diaphanous scarf

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.100
and a lovely, sort of
flirty, pair of shoes--

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.550
just in case I didn't get back
in time, I said to my brothers.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:37.830
But I knew I couldn't return.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.750
When I got home, I
knew it was time.

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:47.720
I stayed awake for
weeks after that.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.990
And I wrote a
script about a girl

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.330
who can hear the songs
of the butterflies.

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:04.110
Who tries to escape her
abuse by poisoning herself

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:09.090
with their milkweed, but
learns to fly instead.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.690
These are a few images from
my director's notebook.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:23.549
I'm keeping my visual ideas
for the film that's coming.

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:24.590
We're in development now.

01:00:24.590 --> 01:01:01.940
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.450
[END PLAYBACK]

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:05.760
I've made many films.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.370
Why had I remained silent
about my own story for so long?

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.470
First, I remained
silent out of love

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:14.600
for my mother and brothers.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.540
It was my choice not to
denounce my stepfather,

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.740
to agreeing to my
mother's silence

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.950
so our family could
stay together.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.780
Later, I was waiting
until my children could

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.000
bear the weight of this story.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.100
And finally, I was
waiting for my mother

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.730
to pass, so that I wouldn't
out her during her lifetime.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.390
My mother died just as her
favorite crimson hibiscus

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.920
burst into flower.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.400
And the hummingbirds
arrived to sip their nectar.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.630
I cleaned her house out.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.960
So many things she had
valued I easily threw away.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.870
Her life reduced to
60 black plastic bags

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.120
melting in the hot
asphalt driveway,

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.690
waiting for goodwill trucks.

01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:59.720
On her bureau, my mother had
a shrine with many saints,

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.160
and candles, and rosaries.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.220
And in the center
was a broken bust

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.240
of the Virgin Mary with a
nose that had fallen off,

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.470
and she'd taped it back on.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.690
That was her altar.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.140
And in front of the Virgin,
a little cheap candy tin.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.290
Inside, scraps of paper in
mom's handwriting in Spanish

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.760
because she'd never really
picked up English very well.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.160
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.050
Little Virgin, please
help Carlitos get a job.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.340
My brother, Carlos, over
6 feet tall, is very ill

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:34.150
and has not held a
job in over a decade.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.800
[SPANISH],, please make
Vicente's tumor disappear.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.950
My brother, Vince,
has a brain tumor

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:41.330
and intestinal obstructions.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:45.200
He's also over 6 feet
tall and 150 pounds.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.810
I found one prayer for me.

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:50.281
[SPANISH] help my girl get money
for that film about that woman

01:02:50.281 --> 01:02:50.780
soldier.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.250
It's been forever.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.200
She'd been listening.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.250
A lottery ticket for a million
dollars had no note attached.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:00.020
I think she expected the
Virgin to figure that one out

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.460
for herself.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.990
And one final note, written
in very large shaky letters,

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.580
perhaps closer to
the end of life.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.070
[SPANISH]

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.950
World peace.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.780
She asked nothing for herself,
even in her secret prayers.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.060
My mother was afraid of
breaking her silence,

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.830
of releasing hurricanes.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:23.270
She quietly scribbled her
"please" on paper scraps.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.680
She did not expect
anyone in this world

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.310
to hear, shutting them
tightly in a cheap tin box,

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:32.800
in front of a
broken Virgin Mary.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.580
Perhaps when you see my
mother, you see a monster.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.180
I see a woman who made terrible
choices based on options

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.470
that I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy.

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:47.760
Subject to a broken immigration
system that brings people

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.490
to their knees every day.

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:54.570
I've carried the pain of
my childhood all my life.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.920
But my mother carried
that pain, too.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.330
Her pain and mine.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.180
If my mother had
spoken, if I had spoken,

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:04.090
perhaps my stepfather
would not have

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.780
targeted my two brothers,
his own sons, next.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.020
As a child, I believed
silence and secrecy

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.730
were my mantle of safety.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.160
As an adult, I am
committed to telling

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.610
the stories of those beautiful
souls that have been programmed

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.140
to believe they were nobodies.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.140
History gives our
present perspective.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:28.100
In this country once, there
were no visas, no passports.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:31.730
Only vast lands that Europeans
decided were full of nobodies.

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:34.140
There for the taking.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.730
US citizenship is a
birthright in this country,

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.690
but too many Americans
mistake it for a virtue.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.970
The undocumented are
criminals according

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.520
to our judicial system.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.490
And our democracy stands
under the rule of law.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:52.220
But let us not mistake
law for justice.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.790
Remember, slavery
once was legal here.

01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:02.580
And loving a person of the wrong
race, or gender, was illegal.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.700
My family's experience was
not just our personal failure.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.020
It was destined in a
broken immigration system.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.140
Keeping the system broken
benefits the American economy,

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.180
and a social order
that privileges

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.530
some at a steep
price for others.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:19.620
In fact, around the
world, governments

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:23.760
determine human worth according
to lines drawn on maps,

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.480
before people are even born.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.240
My mother was afraid
to unleash a hurricane,

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.040
but sometimes they
are the only thing

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.790
that will do when we know
our systems are rotten.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:38.490
You see, it's true
hurricanes destroy.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.260
But they are nature's
way of restoring

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.150
needed ecological balance.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:45.030
They destroy and
they also renew.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:47.130
Because sometimes you
need a new ecosystem.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.609
Thank you.

01:05:48.609 --> 01:06:20.654
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:20.654 --> 01:06:23.390
- Those were all so powerful.

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:26.590
All your words moved
us all, I know.

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.330
They moved me very much.

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:29.320
And I went wanted--

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.590
the through-line here is the
broken immigration system.

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:36.855
And I want to ask you, how--

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.520
you make films about the
broken immigration system--

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.925
Do you see those as helpful in--

01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:49.300
Do you think that
those will help

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.840
transform our problem
with this, the way people

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.600
perceive this issue?

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.020
And do you have examples of
people coming up and speaking

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:03.928
to you afterwards about
their changed perceptions?

01:07:03.928 --> 01:07:07.840
And any of you can jump in.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.900
- I actually do have some--

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:15.590
an anecdote from when I
made Los Trabajadores,

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:20.420
my neighbor at the time was--

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.200
I didn't know it but I found
out after-- anyway, she

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.420
is a very conservative person.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.360
We were in a duplex.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.152
And she knew I'd been
making this film,

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:33.110
so she asked to see it.

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.450
So I gave her a DVD.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:39.290
And I saw her the
next week, and she

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:46.110
said, oh, I don't think I'll
ever look at a day laborer

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.780
again the way I used to.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:55.670
She's, like, I just assumed
they were not good people.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:08:02.815
And your film has shown
me that that's not true.

01:08:02.815 --> 01:08:03.810
- Wow.

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:07.260
- But whether she went
out and talked about it

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.069
to other people?

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.610
I don't know.

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:11.960
I mean, I feel like
on a big grand scale

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.820
that's what you wanna do.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:20.076
You want to have it not
just be one person, but--

01:08:20.076 --> 01:08:24.684
- We live in such polarized
times that I wonder if people--

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.100
I'm glad to hear
stories like that

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.810
because I wonder
if people just get

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:29.680
entrenched in their positions.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.789
But I hope not.

01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:32.010
- Sure.

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:34.260
I think I have one example.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.160
When I was at PBS,
at POV, I always

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.140
used to say documentaries--

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.859
great documentaries-- take you
to a place you've never been,

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:46.090
capture you there for a while.

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:49.050
And when you come back,
you should learn something

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:50.880
and feel changed.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.939
And there was one film that's
called My American Girls--

01:08:53.939 --> 01:08:57.060
and it is about a Dominican
family in Brooklyn--

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:03.029
and the parents-- the mom
works in custodial services

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.710
in a hospital.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:07.529
And the father
also is a janitor.

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:11.520
And I cannot tell you how many
phone calls we've received from

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:17.130
people who said, I had no
idea how hard Dominicans work.

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:21.899
To send, to make sure, when I
walk into that hospital room,

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:25.200
when I walk into various
public institutions,

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.750
you never think about
who was there before

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.470
to make that place a
special place for you.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.540
And I have to say,
even myself, who

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.430
understands Dominican
immigration very,

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:40.380
very well, I learned
a lesson in that film.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.790
Because I have a perception
on who is a philanthropist,

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.890
and what that
philanthropist looks like,

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.140
and how much money
they contribute.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.950
And this family, even
though probably combined

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:56.490
they made $65,000,
every year they

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.370
would send back to the
Dominican Republic $5,000,

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:04.830
$6,000 to help the local
government do certain things.

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.170
And to give back clothing,
and to give back--

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:10.380
and it really taught me a lesson
on what local and community

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.580
philanthropy is all about.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.950
And so I do think
many of these films--

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:18.090
I have to say, María
is a very close friend,

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:21.150
and Heather I've had the
pleasure of working with--

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:26.040
these filmmakers are our
change agents for the future.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.860
When we see these
films, I can read--

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.360
and I'm not saying
anything negative

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.300
about the academics
in the room--

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:36.780
but I can read
volumes about abuse.

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.854
I can read volumes even
about my own experience.

01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:41.520
There was a whole
series in The New York

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.720
Times on how people were
being mistaken in terms

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.340
of illegals at airports.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.040
But there's nothing
like seeing a film.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.380
Seeing a visual expression of
that experience to understand.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.030
When I see even just the visual
experience that María shows

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:03.660
of the wings being trapped,
it just does something

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.100
to my spirit.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.740
Because I think
again, as Americans,

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.760
we need to do
things differently.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.330
My parents came to this
country because, not only

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:15.930
did they-- they weren't all
about, what can I get here,

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:17.340
but what can I give?

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.500
And I think most
immigrants in this country

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.050
want to be part of
that experience.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:25.650
And I have to say, I know
I shared a little bit

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:29.700
about my frantic experience
at the Salt Lake City airport.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.060
But for me, I think, I want to
make America a better place.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.850
I want to contribute.

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:40.410
And it shouldn't be at the
detriment of other people,

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:44.100
in other places, for us
to make this place better.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.980
I have to say, and
Maria knows this--

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.820
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.630
María knows this.

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:53.880
In the fall, I was
very distressed.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.920
I was very distraught.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.166
And I went to a party, and
Gloria Steinem was speaking.

01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:01.290
And there were many of us--

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:02.123
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:12:02.123 --> 01:12:03.517
- She's a theme in your life.

01:12:03.517 --> 01:12:05.980
- She is because she's--

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:09.600
There's many women
who they don't falter

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.970
in their political beliefs.

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.430
Who they stand up, and no
matter how many times they get

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.480
knocked down--

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.420
When you think of María's
mother as an example,

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.150
that kind of strength,
no matter what,

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:24.655
is what propelled
María and her family.

01:12:24.655 --> 01:12:27.030
And when you think about it,
I don't know how many of you

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:29.020
know, but María
ended up at Harvard.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.210
She's a Harvard graduate.

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:32.780
She teaches now at Emerson.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.220
Some women, and
also men-- but you

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.380
have to have an
unwavering spirit

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.790
to survive in these times.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:44.040
And I was at Gloria Steinem's
80th birthday party,

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.250
fast-forward, in November.

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:51.390
And I was distraught about what
was happening in this country.

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:54.390
And she began her
toast by saying,

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.640
look what's happening today.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.760
More women have marched
in the United States

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.830
than in the history
of the United States.

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:07.200
Two, more women are running
for public office in the United

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.500
States than in the history
of the United States.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.330
So women don't look so down.

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.380
We're supposed to be
celebrating my birthday.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.664
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:15.664 --> 01:13:20.160
And then she said, third
thing, the women of Hollywood

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.680
are finally speaking out.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.620
So, if in November, you
can't see these three

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.490
major accomplishments,
regardless

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:30.240
to who we have in
the White House,

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.590
women are moving forward.

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.830
And so I have to
hold on to that.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.510
And I have to believe--

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.880
I have to say I didn't go to
your reception, I'm sorry.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.432
I'm not a party person.

01:13:40.432 --> 01:13:41.640
I didn't go to the reception.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.889
I didn't go to the green room.

01:13:42.889 --> 01:13:45.270
I kind of hunkered
down, and I'm quiet.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.450
But I was in the
courtyard sitting down.

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:52.560
And I kept on saying, wow, how
lucky am I. I am at Radcliffe.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.240
I'm going to speak at Radcliffe.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.060
And I'm sitting in the
courtyard, in the cold.

01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:00.470
How many women it passed
that courtyard who've

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.210
done such substantial things.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.740
And I'm only a little piece.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.140
I'm a little piece of a
wing of a butterfly, right?

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:11.310
But together, wow,
what can we do?

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:14.730
So for me, when I think of
filmmakers like these, I just--

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:15.990
I'm privileged.

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.830
And I'm very lucky.

01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:18.520
And thank you so
much for having me.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.710
And I hope by not going to the
party you'll invite me back.

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:24.300
- Have another party.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.250
- I think she needs
to go to a party.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:27.750
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:29.130
- I don't do parties well.

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:30.780
- I want to pick up on that.

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:35.010
I think one of the
issues for me is the fact

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:38.880
that media is voice, right?

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.360
And it is such a public voice.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.030
And when you look
at the statistics

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:50.080
of our lack of having had
access to that voice--

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.900
I'm talking about women, I'm
talking about people of color--

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:58.500
it is our 21st century
communication medium.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:03.660
And the more of us that are
able to tell these stories--

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:07.620
we can touch hearts
in a way that

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.470
is almost impossible
through the art form.

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.800
It's both a
communication but also

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.000
a visceral lived experience.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.210
It's a time-based art medium.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:22.230
And I would say I've become
frustrated by documentaries.

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.610
I'm making a narrative
film right now.

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.900
And part of it is
that I also want

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.857
to reach the person who
is already convinced.

01:15:30.857 --> 01:15:32.190
They don't want to hear from me.

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:34.440
They don't want to
hear from immigrants.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.070
Yuck.

01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:40.350
Those criminals coming
and ruining our country.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:45.840
And I think about the fact that
if I tell a universal story

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:52.580
about a young girl, a fable,
it is like Harry Potter.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.980
It is like all of
these other things that

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:59.060
have entered into our culture.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.070
And you can learn
a little something.

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:03.060
Hide it in there.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:05.720
But people are coming to
the entertainment, right?

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.880
People are coming
for a good story.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.820
And then you catch them.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.500
And so what I love
about documentary

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.710
is that you can move
the needle from people

01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:19.540
who are ready and willing to
listen, and perhaps activate.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:22.730
And then what I love
about entertainment is

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:25.350
all those people that don't
want to hear from you,

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:27.870
you can talk to them anyway.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:28.750
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.750
And captivate them.

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.760
And captivate their
hearts, right?

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.810
People used to say--

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:38.030
I did a film about jazz
music and restrictions

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:39.060
against early jazz.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.830
It's kind of like how people
first thought about hip hop,

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.330
right?

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:47.690
There was dangerous-- and
what happened with jazz music

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:51.410
is, it grew up right around
the time the recording industry

01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:53.300
and radio grew.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.440
And it could enter in
homes where those musicians

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.170
could never enter.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.910
Right?

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:02.980
So you could have
an experience--

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.650
and actually there were
things like injunctions

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:08.170
against jazz palaces.

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.640
There was one in Cincinnati.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.350
There was a jazz palace
next to a YWCA home

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:15.370
for pregnant mothers.

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:17.440
And they had an injunction
for the jazz palace

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.040
because they felt that music
could enter into the fetus

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.240
and corrupt it.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:22.950
Right?

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.820
But I think that's
media today, right?

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.760
We can enter deeply
into your blood.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.440
And you can have feelings about
people who you would otherwise

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.630
dismiss or not care
about, because you

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:36.985
can enter into their shoes,
and enter into their hearts.

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:40.000
- I think someone said that
in the POV documentary.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.830
They said that films
offered unique power

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:46.420
to let you experience
someone else's life.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.450
And I thought that really
distilled it really well.

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:54.190
I also-- it made me
think about all of you

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.320
as documentary filmmakers.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.350
I was thinking of you,
Heather, because your life

01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:02.180
is very different from that
of a day laborer from Mexico.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.200
So it lets you, as a
filmmaker, experience

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.460
someone else's life, and
sort of dig into their life.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:15.640
And how does that change
you, in doing that?

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.199
- Well, yeah.

01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:20.740
Well before I go
into that, I do want

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.470
to say that I do think
documentaries can

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:25.480
be entertaining, too.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.360
Probably not as much as a
Harry Potter kind of movie.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.980
But I think that
what I try to do,

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.200
and especially what my
co-director and I, Anayansi,

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.560
tried to do with the DACA film--
that's all about the Dreamers

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.100
that's coming out
in a few days--

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.510
is to really show their lives
as sort of normal teenagers.

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.670
Because they are
normal teenagers.

01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:51.010
And to really sort of
show their daily life.

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:55.840
And I think that's the key
to get maybe somebody who

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.190
would not necessarily be really
pro-immigrant to maybe react

01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:04.440
to this film in a
more positive way.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.270
To sort of just
see the daily life,

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:08.550
and not just hammer
them over the head

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:12.570
with issues, and stats,
and things like that.

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.280
So it's very much--

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.260
I think that's kind of key to--

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.160
I think it's key for a
lot of documentaries,

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.140
if you want to reach people,
is to tell a very human story

01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:25.890
in a vérité way.

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:28.680
But that said, I do think
narratives-- obviously

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.140
fiction films are a
lot more entertaining

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.460
than documentaries.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:34.200
So, I'm sorry.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:34.890
Change.

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:40.200
Well yeah, I mean, my life
is very changed in many ways

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.730
from--

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:47.400
I mean, I'm still in touch
with, well, Ramon's family,

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.170
I'm still in touch with.

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:52.830
Juan-- who was also
in Los Trabajadores--

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:56.640
he still lives in Austin with
a wife, and they have two kids.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.941
And his wife actually
has permanent residency,

01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:03.440
one of his kids has permanent
residency, and one of his kids

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.102
is a citizen.

01:20:04.102 --> 01:20:05.310
And he still is undocumented.

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.800
But I'm still very much
a part of their life.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.390
So I think my life
is changed by staying

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:16.220
connected with the people
that I've met through filming.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.040
But I do think it's really
important, in this day

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:31.140
and age that there are other
voices telling the stories,

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.200
and not myself as
a white person.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.930
And I am so thankful that I
collaborated with a Latina

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:43.770
on this project, because
I feel like the film is

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:46.940
so much better for that reason.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:52.080
And I feel that she and I bring
different perspectives that

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.890
both inform the
story in a way that,

01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.630
if we were making
it alone, hadn't.

01:21:00.436 --> 01:21:01.560
But yeah, I'm very changed.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.650
I mean, very much changed by the
film I made about the soldiers,

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:07.230
who are actually kids
from my hometown.

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.520
Very changed by that.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.020
Even though I'm
from that same town,

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.330
and I grew up in
that area, and I

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:14.610
know all about this little
town in Northern Michigan,

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:17.740
I still am very changed by the
people I met through that film.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.380
- And you bring up
a really good point.

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:23.850
I wanted to ask the two Latina
filmmakers on this panel--

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.450
I'm a first generation American.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.060
My parents were born in Mexico.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.430
And it bothers me
as a film critic

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.090
to see so few films about
the Latino experience,

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:35.070
especially living in
Los Angeles, where

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:38.280
we are such a huge
proportion of the population.

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.450
I'm the lone member of the
L.A. Film Critics who's Latina.

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:42.480
I mean, you just--

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.240
it's awful, in this day and
age, to be the lone anything,

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.670
especially when we have--

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:51.340
the minority is almost a
majority in some places.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.074
What-- and I realize
we're talking

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.740
about documentary
filmmaking, but I also

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.484
am concerned about
Hollywood, because you

01:21:57.484 --> 01:21:58.900
know we see the
strides being made

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.970
by Black Panther, and other
minority groups, particularly

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:05.950
African-Americans, but so
little being done by Latinos.

01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.314
And even the three
guys, the three

01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:09.730
amigos, that
everybody points to--

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:14.170
Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del
Toro, and Alejandro Iñárritu--

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:16.270
they don't hire other Latinos.

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:17.410
What is going wrong?

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:22.568
What is going on
among our people?

01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:24.676
- Do you want to take it?

01:22:24.676 --> 01:22:26.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:28.720
You know that's a big--

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.450
obviously that's
a big issue, and I

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:34.240
don't want to not give
it the appropriate time

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.380
to answer that question.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:38.830
But one of the things both María
and I have been engaged in is

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.200
an organization that's called
the National Association

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:49.530
of Latino Independent Producers,
NALIP, and it's www.nalip.org.

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:50.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:51.430
Oh, OK.

01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:53.050
Well, I was one of
the founding chair

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:54.890
people of that organization.

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.430
And later on María
was the chairperson.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:23:00.100
And the goal of the
organization-- and it's

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.101
more than 18, 20 years
old at this point.

01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:02.600
- 20.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.517
- 20 years old.

01:23:04.517 --> 01:23:06.850
And I can't believe it's 20
because it dates me in terms

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.160
of the group that started it.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.340
But our whole goal with
starting that organization

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.460
was to bring community
filmmakers, and Hollywood

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:19.030
filmmakers, and public
television filmmakers together.

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.860
And have a conversation
and share resources.

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.420
So that we knew
what, potentially, we

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.280
could potentially do together.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.790
Now, the organization grew from,
I want to say, 400 members to--

01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:33.961
I don't know how many
members there are now.

01:23:33.961 --> 01:23:34.460
- 10,000.

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.210
- 10,000.

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:39.170
And it's going strong.

01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:41.050
But I do think
what you're raising

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:46.690
is a real critical issue
as to who gets hired.

01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:49.930
Why they get hired on
certain larger productions.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:54.310
That is something that needs
a very specific approach

01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:58.210
at variety of levels, not just--

01:23:58.210 --> 01:24:01.090
if you want-- not just
looking at public television

01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:02.320
or documentaries.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.720
Or, as in the case of
Hollywood, I have to say,

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.110
when I was commissioner of media
and entertainment in New York.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.990
On average, there's about 150
films that shoot in New York.

01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:13.060
And I was always
looking at the credits

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:17.230
to try to find the diverse
people who were working.

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:21.342
So it is a serious, serious
issue that needs attention.

01:24:21.342 --> 01:24:23.440
- Yeah, I would just
add very briefly

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.990
that, if you look at the last
1,000 films that have come out

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:31.900
in the top box
office in Hollywood,

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.940
there's been one Latina woman.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.780
The woman who did 33.

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.860
And before that, she did
Real Women Have Curves,

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.075
like a decade--

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.521
- Josephine.

01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:44.770
- Well, Josefina was the writer.

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.510
It's Patricia.

01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:47.198
- Patricia?

01:24:47.198 --> 01:24:53.810
- And so, the problem is
particularly an issue.

01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.350
I'm a member of the
Writers Guild of America.

01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.805
I'm on their diversity alliance.

01:24:57.805 --> 01:25:01.600
I do a lot of work around trying
to bring in more inclusive

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.901
voices, but unions are unions.

01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:03.400
Right?

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.470
To be working for a
signatory-- in order

01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:09.560
to get into that union, and in
order to work for a signatory,

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.590
you have to have made a script.

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:13.090
You have to have worked for--

01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:16.630
so it's this catch-22.

01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:23.320
And as a Latina woman, writer,
director, I'm less than 0.02%

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.840
of the screenwriter,
directors in the country.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.980
So it's not like there's
this huge pipeline.

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.320
That said, there's a lot more--

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.790
a new generation growing
up making digital media.

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:38.920
There are incredible
opportunities

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.840
because now we have streaming.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.940
We have more
programming than ever.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.520
And so they're coming.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.995
They just haven't been
given the green light yet.

01:25:47.995 --> 01:25:49.620
- And are there
greater opportunities--

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.786
and we were talking about
this a little bit before--

01:25:51.786 --> 01:25:53.380
in documentary
filmmaking than there

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.341
is in the Hollywood system?

01:25:56.341 --> 01:25:58.330
- I would say not--

01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:00.070
no, I would say not.

01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:04.300
I think we have
the same problems

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.460
in terms of documentary.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:09.130
A lot of documentary
is grants-based.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:12.205
And we know that
foundation dollars, less

01:26:12.205 --> 01:26:13.330
than-- what is it, Cynthia?

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:15.760
Maybe 2% of all
foundation dollars

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.610
go to Latinos in every field.

01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:19.110
OK?

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:21.730
If you think about the
fact that documentaries

01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:25.610
are working in that little
space, it's really problematic.

01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:28.220
So, no, I would say
it's not any easier.

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.190
It's equally segregated.

01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:34.380
- Equally challenging.

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:37.790
- Switching back a little bit
to what you were talking about.

01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.350
You were both of you--

01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:44.940
all three of you were talking
about very nuanced situations,

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.170
complex situations.

01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:48.717
You were talking about a
very personal experience

01:26:48.717 --> 01:26:49.800
that you had to deal with.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.490
And you were talking about,
Heather, women's roles,

01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:56.160
and how people
don't look that much

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.310
at the person who's left behind
in the case of immigration.

01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:04.915
And I'm curious about both of
your new films in that regard.

01:27:04.915 --> 01:27:06.540
I know you're doing
The Unafraid, which

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.010
is about undocumented.

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:12.430
And you're doing this
very personal film.

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:15.040
I guess my first question
is for you, María,

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.340
if it's been difficult because
you have to deal with this very

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.860
emotional--

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.320
all the sort of
trauma, and the pain,

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.345
of what you personally
went through?

01:27:25.345 --> 01:27:30.190
- Essentially, being
able to move it--

01:27:30.190 --> 01:27:31.960
the story that I
told you is personal.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.840
The film itself is
a fictional piece.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.970
So I was able to get much
more authentic, and real,

01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:44.200
and raw because I removed
myself and created

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.040
a fictional set of characters,
its scenes, et cetera.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.670
So I think I could get closer
to the truth in an odd way

01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:55.120
with this fictional
piece, partly because what

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.210
I'm expressing is a
psychological world,

01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:01.420
and a set of systemic
circumstances, not necessarily

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:04.360
characters themselves.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.160
- Makes sense.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:05.660
- Yeah.

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:06.160
- Yeah.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.390
- And for me, I didn't
mention this before,

01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:10.570
but I'm developing a project
called The Puerto Rico

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:11.710
Initiative.

01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:14.860
And I have to say, if you would
have asked me 10 years ago,

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.920
would I be making a film called
The Puerto Rico Initiative?

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.400
I probably would have said
no, because all of my work

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.160
has been not about
Puerto Ricans.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:27.940
But given the
current complexities,

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.820
and what people understand
about Puerto Rico,

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.530
I feel like it's
very important to do

01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:36.100
a film about the
current debt crisis,

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:42.590
and the current humanitarian
crisis that we face.

01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:45.340
And so it is very personal.

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:47.740
But at the same token, I
do think-- and, for me,

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.800
it will be a documentary
because we're--

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.590
but it goes back to
what María was saying.

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:58.150
This year, I've been on eight
juries, the Overseas Press

01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.280
Club, various juries.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.720
And I'm always astounded
when I'm sent via email 600,

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.180
200 applications for funding,
and there is probably--

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.330
that made the cut to be
seriously considered--

01:29:13.330 --> 01:29:17.410
and there's probably, if
any, maybe one Latino story

01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:18.610
among them.

01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:22.720
Or one black or Asian
story among them.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.050
And in many instances,
I hate to say this but,

01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:28.590
even in terms of
women filmmakers,

01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:32.020
the diversity in
terms of women to men.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:34.390
And this, as I said,
we are in April,

01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:38.350
and I've probably been on
seven panels this year.

01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:41.110
That a problem exists even
on the documentary side?

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:44.050
Absolutely.

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:46.940
- Well I want to open
it up to the audience

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.720
because I know that--

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.720
there's a microphone there
for you to all go to.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.570
Please, when you step up
to ask your questions,

01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:58.075
if you could identify
yourself, and make sure that

01:29:58.075 --> 01:30:00.200
you are asking a question
and not making a comment.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.640
Yes, we have-- we
have our first.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.120
- Thank you so much.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:10.310
This was just an amazing
panel and so moving.

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:15.440
And all of your film clips
were just incredible.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:21.560
My question is about a
tension between telling

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:28.020
immigrant stories that focus on
the positive and the wonderful,

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.090
and focus on the dysfunction
and the difficulty.

01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:34.260
And both of those are true.

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.800
And I often feel like I
have to move to one pole.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.880
And I'm curious how you manage
that tension in your work.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.720
Thank you.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.747
- Sure.

01:30:44.747 --> 01:30:45.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.800
- In terms of PBS,
and POV, specifically.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.530
I used to call it, films that
were for a PBS audience that

01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:59.390
tended to be, I want to say,
90% an American audience,

01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:03.200
of a certain education,
of a certain demographic.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.850
And films that were made
for an internal conversation

01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:10.380
within a particular community.

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:13.730
And so, often, what we did
to deal with that chasm,

01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:16.880
was hold community
events with churches,

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.820
with universities, with
nonprofit organizations.

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:24.170
And have the difficult
conversations about incest,

01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:25.760
and all the
difficult things that

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:31.580
happen in these communities,
but in more secure settings,

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.640
if you will.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.330
And also, always
having the facts.

01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.360
I have to say, coming
from PBS, I would always--

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.090
and Heather and María
can attest to this--

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:43.880
I would always want
all of the facts

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.540
about a particular
community before analyzing

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.500
what was actually going
on in that specific story.

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:55.440
So I think one way to do
it is community engagement.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.980
And being very careful about
who sets up those community

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.450
engagement events, et cetera.

01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:02.896
I don't know if other
people would have--

01:32:02.896 --> 01:32:07.160
- I just want to say
that, as an artist,

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.730
I'm frustrated by the
very few stories that

01:32:10.730 --> 01:32:12.380
are told about my community.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.010
And yet, I'm not interested
in making plaster saints.

01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:18.470
I'm only interested
in complex characters.

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:21.140
If there were enough
stories about us,

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.800
it wouldn't matter if I'm
showing a villain, or whatever.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.620
And I feel that it's my
responsibility to get deep,

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.390
and to get complicated.

01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:32.535
And that's the only way I
truly serve my community.

01:32:32.535 --> 01:32:37.100
- Well, I can say
my collaborator

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:43.200
on The Unafraid, the new
film about the DACA students,

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:49.290
that we worked hard to find
those kids who were not

01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:51.660
getting a 4.0 and
going to Harvard

01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:56.865
because we wanted to tell a
story about regular teenagers

01:32:56.865 --> 01:33:01.950
who aren't necessarily off the
charts successful, or whatever,

01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:06.105
because they also
deserve a chance as well.

01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:10.410
So yeah, I agree.

01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:16.440
It's not all about making
everyone a saint, although I

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.660
love these kids.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.150
But they're complex too,
and it's not a good story

01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:23.780
unless they are complex.

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.460
- Next question.

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:28.150
- Well our immigration
system is broken, all right.

01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:31.700
But fortunately our president
is setting about repairing it.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:34.180
And the American public
supports him in that.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.180
The latest Harvard-Harris
poll this year

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:39.730
shows that 81% of
the American public

01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:41.870
want the border reinforced.

01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:45.490
80% want to see lower
immigration numbers, including

01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:46.480
legal immigration.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.350
65% of the population
supports his call

01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:53.800
for an end to chain
migration, and lottery visas,

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.480
and so forth.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.250
So how can we even
have a society at all

01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:00.070
if we don't have
the rule of law?

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:03.310
And everyone in this society
respecting that rule of law,

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:05.510
instead of acting
on their own law,

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:07.670
and believing that
they are above the law?

01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:11.080
This kind of idea that
you're your own law,

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.325
where does that come from?

01:34:12.325 --> 01:34:13.900
- OK sir, what is--

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.679
your question is--

01:34:15.679 --> 01:34:17.220
- Do you believe in
the rule of law--

01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:18.820
do you believe that everyone
should be their own law?

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.570
That they should believe
in the law of me,

01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:22.285
and act upon the law
of me rather than

01:34:22.285 --> 01:34:24.320
on the laws of the
societies that they're in.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.792
That's the question.

01:34:25.792 --> 01:34:27.850
- Like Trump does, right?

01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:31.670
- [INAUDIBLE] this panel.

01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:32.715
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:34:32.715 --> 01:34:34.090
- I think we're
going to move on.

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:35.339
We have a lot of other people.

01:34:35.339 --> 01:34:38.105
- Yes.

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:41.942
- Hi.

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:44.740
Some films and documentaries--

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.660
and documentaries
and fiction films

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.930
as well-- can help
influence the future,

01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:52.150
as well as act as warnings.

01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:54.860
For example, a film that
comes top of my head

01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:57.780
is Children of Men,
which is based in the UK,

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:02.320
and has two-- it has
subplots, and it's amazing,

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.700
personally I think.

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:07.840
What advice would you
have for future filmmakers

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:10.930
who want to go make a change,
and make the world better,

01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:16.060
and who would want to, well,
make a difference in the world

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.095
and try to--

01:35:17.095 --> 01:35:18.778
- Are you one of those?

01:35:18.778 --> 01:35:19.714
I hope.

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:20.900
- OK, good for you.

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.400
Yes.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.270
- Well, I would
say, for starters,

01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:29.010
to tell a story
in your community,

01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:30.490
in your neighborhood.

01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:35.540
You don't have to go
across the world to do it.

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.850
Just really get to know the
place where you're living

01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:39.290
and the people there.

01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:41.302
And tell a story
there, for starters.

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.010
If there's an issue
you care about that's

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:46.970
happening in your neighborhood--

01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:49.700
The thing that's great now is
that you can get cameras pretty

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.560
easily, and software to edit.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.310
And get out there.

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:54.893
And I don't know if you want to
do documentaries or narratives

01:35:54.893 --> 01:35:58.110
but, either way, telling a
story about where you are now

01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.750
in your daily--

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:01.730
the people in your community.

01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:04.546
I think it's a
good way to start.

01:36:04.546 --> 01:36:07.066
- Any other advice?

01:36:07.066 --> 01:36:11.150
- You can make wonderful
films on your iPhone, Witness,

01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:12.410
Tangerine.

01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:15.140
Many schools are
now actually trying

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:20.100
to divest themselves from all
the fancy buttons and lenses.

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.220
And I have friends,
who are professors,

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.950
who teach how to make
films on the iPhone

01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:28.500
so that you think about story,
because that comes first,

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.000
right?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.550
Have something to
say, and that usually

01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:35.135
comes from here, and
from your own experience.

01:36:35.135 --> 01:36:36.300
- Absolutely.

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.130
I have to say,
for myself, my 8--

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:42.390
my 11-year-old niece has
a little pack of girls,

01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:44.680
the friends--

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.710
really good kids,
really good kids.

01:36:46.710 --> 01:36:47.570
I say "pack."

01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.270
That implies something bad.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.950
And they came to me one
afternoon, and they said,

01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:53.690
we made a movie.

01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:55.340
And it was with their iPad.

01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:58.160
And they had actually
spent all afternoon

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.160
recording these incredible
local community--

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.510
They went to the owners of
certain local restaurants.

01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:06.210
They went to old people.

01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:08.900
They went to this man that
was on oxygen. How did he

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.680
carry around his oxygen tank?

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.847
Well they-- and they ask
the unaskable questions.

01:37:14.847 --> 01:37:16.430
And then they wanted
to show it to me,

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.320
but they didn't want my advice.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.380
They just wanted me to
enjoy the film because this

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.530
was about the community.

01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:25.490
So I think, if 11-year-old
girls can go and figure out who

01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:28.520
their community is, I think
we have a responsibility

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.940
to, as filmmakers, and as people
in the future thinking about

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.900
media--

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.005
going locally, I think,
is the way to go.

01:37:35.005 --> 01:37:36.460
- And we encourage you.

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.770
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.850
- Yes?

01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:41.020
- Hi, my name's [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.470
I am one of the students of
Michael Sheridan of Community

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:45.390
Supported Film.

01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:49.940
I recently finished a short
film called Another World.

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:52.600
It's about the
sociocultural difference

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.750
between some of the parent
and the American children.

01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:57.665
A lot like you guys.

01:37:57.665 --> 01:38:00.627
Some immigrants and [INAUDIBLE]
tell stories about immigration.

01:38:00.627 --> 01:38:02.710
Now I think, like you guys
have already mentioned,

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:05.360
documentary is to
educate the public.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.320
In my opinion, is to start
that from a young age.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.400
So how do we get young people
to be interested in watching

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.510
documentaries?

01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:15.250
Because mostly, I
think, that documentary

01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:17.623
is mostly targeted
to older generation.

01:38:17.623 --> 01:38:19.066
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:19.066 --> 01:38:20.920
- Even though we
have reality TV.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.528
- Yes.

01:38:22.528 --> 01:38:24.910
- So what's your
opinion and that,

01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:29.530
in terms of getting young people
to view this because I think

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:31.655
starting from a young
age teaching people

01:38:31.655 --> 01:38:33.613
about different cultures,
different ethnicities

01:38:33.613 --> 01:38:34.654
is the best way to start.

01:38:34.654 --> 01:38:37.750
- See, I think it does
go back to education.

01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:41.860
And that if young
people are in schools

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:45.040
where documentaries are shown--

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.210
again, an example I can give is
that my niece's charter school,

01:38:49.210 --> 01:38:51.040
every time there's
a good NOVA program,

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.710
I make sure to send it
to her science teachers.

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:56.590
And so that she's aware of
what's out there in terms

01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:57.920
of documentaries.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.746
And I do think it starts
with the educational system.

01:39:00.746 --> 01:39:02.620
It also starts with the
Boys and Girls Clubs.

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:06.490
And there are many nonprofits
across the country that are

01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:08.560
doing really innovative things.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.050
Training young people to
be documentary makers,

01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:16.090
and also training folks
to be critics of media.

01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:18.620
But, I think, in people
of color communities,

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.370
we need to see more
of her to understand

01:39:21.370 --> 01:39:24.886
that you can make a living
doing this kind of career.

01:39:24.886 --> 01:39:27.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.640
So I do think that it exists,
but definitely more needs

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.270
to happen.

01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:35.920
- Yeah I think also with
the whole online world now,

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.292
short documentaries
have a real platform.

01:39:41.292 --> 01:39:43.000
Well, I mean, I'm cant
really make money,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.160
but at least you can
get it out there.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.160
I feel like short
documentaries, online docs,

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.900
are a thing that a
younger generation is

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.870
very much about
watching and tuning

01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:55.500
into through social
media, or otherwise.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.770
Don't Netflix and Amazon
buy those sometimes too?

01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:58.270
HBO?

01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:59.270
- Absolutely.

01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:03.910
And also, remember that we have
YouTube, and YouTube is global.

01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:06.910
And YouTube now, even
if you are making--

01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:09.490
there are ways to
monetize this work.

01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:13.300
And that the number
of clickthroughs--

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.820
You can get millions
and millions of views.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:18.260
And actually people
are making a living.

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:21.160
There's a whole world,
actually, of weblebrities

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.700
that are actually bigger than
the movie stars that we know,

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.140
that our generation knows.

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.810
Actually the biggest
stars are now

01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:31.470
weblebrities for the
younger generations.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:34.220
So they don't even need
to be taught by us.

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:36.320
We're like way past their prime.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.620
And their new
generation is already

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.060
picking it up and doing it.

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.370
And they don't need our rules.

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:44.320
And that's wonderful
because it also

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.560
means there's a flourishing of
creativity with new languages,

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.060
right?

01:40:51.610 --> 01:40:54.010
The stuff that my kids are on--

01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.920
Snapchat, stuff
that disappears--

01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.760
there's this whole nother world,
and every social media platform

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.260
now has video as well.

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:04.960
And every brand has video.

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.420
And every-- so you can
do it commercially.

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.980
You can do it for
social justice issues.

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:10.970
Everybody needs it.

01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:13.826
So it's actually a
flourishing field.

01:41:13.826 --> 01:41:14.702
- Thank you.

01:41:14.702 --> 01:41:15.990
- Yes, next question.

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:20.230
- Well, first of all,
that was my niece.

01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:21.840
- You have to
invest in her film.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.517
- Uncle investment.

01:41:24.517 --> 01:41:25.350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:28.160
- She needs an uncle investment.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.240
- Awesome.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.390
So my question is,
how do you get this

01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:37.580
into curriculum in the schools
because they need to be

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:40.140
talked about on specifics--

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:42.770
This is the Catcher
in the Rye stuff,

01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:44.090
this is the Hamlet stuff.

01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:47.870
This is stuff that you
learn in grade school.

01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:53.487
And that's for now, because
they did it for then.

01:41:53.487 --> 01:41:54.820
And it needs to be talked about.

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.736
There needs to be a
conversation, because when

01:41:56.736 --> 01:41:58.430
you go into communities--

01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:02.770
First of all, my name's Ian,
and I was a city manager

01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:05.230
in very small towns.

01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:06.800
One was a Hispanic town.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.610
One was Afro-American
town, one was a white town.

01:42:10.610 --> 01:42:14.510
So a very [INAUDIBLE]
experience.

01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:17.540
But the conversation was little.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.760
And even amongst the kids.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.490
So you have to create
a culture where

01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:24.040
you talk about this stuff.

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.840
And it needs to be, I
think, if there is a way--

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.810
is there a way to put it
within the educational system

01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:33.086
as a curriculum?

01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:36.780
- I can speak to that
because Rebel, for instance,

01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:40.370
is in many curriculums
throughout the nation on PBS

01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:41.900
LearningMedia.

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.330
Hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of teachers

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:46.790
have been using
educational modules

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:49.880
that we created,
along with teachers

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:53.990
who did lesson plans, that are
integrated with curriculums,

01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:56.240
available for free.

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.730
And so used extensively.

01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:01.010
The National Parks and
the Department of Interior

01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:02.930
asked to use Rebel,
and brought it

01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:06.590
to places around the country.

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:08.360
So it's been seen.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:12.380
It's begun to enter into
that national narrative.

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:15.690
And I think that is
a fantastic question.

01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:21.770
I think the sense of, how do
we enter into the conversation

01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:23.090
in the first place, right?

01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:25.800
And you guys both have had
that experience as well.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.600
- Yeah, I have-- several of my
films are with an educational

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.200
distribution co-operative
called New Day Films.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.670
If you-- I mean you can
just look it up online.

01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:39.000
And a lot of what we do
is target universities.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.540
And they're used in
university classes.

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.940
We try to get them into
high schools as well,

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.450
but it's a little
bit harder because

01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:51.870
of curriculum requirements
that the state has.

01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:55.100
So I think, if you're a
parent who wants this--

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.960
or an uncle-- who wants these
films to be shown in your local

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.830
school, you should go to,
like, the local PTA meetings

01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:05.090
and stuff, and say--

01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:08.000
and, kind of, demand that that
be part of the curriculum,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.650
because it is a little
more tricky in that regard.

01:44:10.650 --> 01:44:12.650
There's definitely schools
that are open to it.

01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:16.160
And there's definitely films
that have had a huge influence

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.670
like Bully, for instance--

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:21.589
Lee Hirsch's film about
bullying is in every school

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:22.880
around in the country, I think.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.670
So there's definitely
examples of it happening.

01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:29.750
But I think it starts with
a demand from the parents

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:31.370
of the students as well.

01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:36.410
- PBS.org, they have a whole
educator section that has

01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:39.740
lesson plans, clips.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.780
I can't remember
the last statistic,

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.840
but they have thousands and
thousands of teachers a year--

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.520
a month-- get educational
materials for free on the site.

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.310
So it's PBS.org, and
it's under for teachers--

01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:54.630
and for educators, excuse me.

01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:59.300
- And also, there is also
community-based screenings that

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.320
are not necessarily in a school,
but that your local church

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.690
might have, or a library,
or a community center.

01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:10.190
And if there's anyone here
that is interested in showing

01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:14.630
a film-- a documentary
about DACA students--

01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:17.630
we're going to embark
on community outreach

01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:22.430
and engagement over the
next 6 to 12 months.

01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:24.590
So let me know, and
we'd love to come

01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:26.150
to your church or your town.

01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:28.300
Maybe the place where
you worked we can show it

01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:30.320
to city council, or something.

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.870
- And I strongly
encourage Heather's film,

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:35.840
Where Soldiers Come From.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.670
It is a portrait, for
people who've seen it,

01:45:38.670 --> 01:45:41.840
it is a portrait about
our American boys

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.400
fighting in the Middle East.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.510
And where they're from.

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:46.370
And what they are fighting for.

01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:47.690
And it is poignant.

01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:48.710
And it was on POV.

01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:50.900
Please look up Where
Soldiers Come From.

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:54.260
And in terms of María's
film, it is coming.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:58.070
And like every good
filmmaker, these filmmakers

01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:00.800
need investments and contacts.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.850
And maybe, if you don't want to
give cash to that initiative,

01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:07.790
but you can connect filmmakers
to someone who's a critic,

01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:11.150
to someone in your local
community to do a screening,

01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:12.500
there's always--

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.340
again, when we think
about philanthropy,

01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.277
we cannot just think about the
people who have loads of money.

01:46:17.277 --> 01:46:18.860
My parents didn't
have loads of money,

01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:20.450
but they were so connected.

01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:22.294
So every time someone
had a problem,

01:46:22.294 --> 01:46:23.960
my mother could figure
out who was going

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.060
to solve that for that person.

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:27.990
And it didn't have
to do with money.

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:30.420
So if we could all just
think about-- not me,

01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:32.990
I'm not making
something that's pivotal

01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:36.600
right now to this conversation--
but these two ladies are.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.790
So we have to support them.

01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:40.320
- Well speaking of
this conversation,

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.970
I want to thank you,
Cynthia, Heather, and María.

01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:45.050
I can't wait to see your films.

01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:47.270
And I want to thank
you for your artistry,

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:50.990
your commitment to your passion,
and for taking the time.

01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:54.120
And thank you, here, for letting
us have this conversation.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.075
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:58.575 --> 01:47:02.650
- And I just want to add
my thanks, and the thanks

01:47:02.650 --> 01:47:04.150
of the Radcliffe
Institute, for what

01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:06.320
was, really, a fabulous panel.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:08.822
And a great way to
start the discussion

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.030
we're going to have tomorrow.

01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:14.290
So it's late, but I hope we'll
see you back again tomorrow

01:47:14.290 --> 01:47:16.330
to keep the conversation going.

01:47:16.330 --> 01:47:18.480
Thanks for coming.
