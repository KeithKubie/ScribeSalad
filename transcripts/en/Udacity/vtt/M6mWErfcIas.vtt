00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, to solve this, we convert 5000 stadia

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
using our normal method.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We convert it to 925 km.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Then we look at tangent of this angle,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because this would be the opposite side, and this would be the adjacent side.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Actually, what's interesting is we could also have used the sine for this problem

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
instead of the tangent.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The reason being that for very, very small angles

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
sine and tangent give you identical answers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, we say that the tangent of α--well, that must be the opposite over the adjacent.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Tangent always is.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
925--opposite, over adjacent--150 million. That's quite a large number.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Ah! But that's right. I don't know α.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, I actually need to do the arctangent of this number.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
When I do the arctangent of 920/150,000,000,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I find that α is 0.00035 degrees.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That is a very, very small angle, so these rays really are parallel.
