00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.320
RETO MEIER: Hello everyone.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.870
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.435
Today on the app clinic, we'll
be reviewing the App Clinic.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.180
RETO MEIER: We're turning the
microscope and ourselves to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.550
take a look at what we do what
we do and we want to take this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.810
runaway freight train
of app awesomeness.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: We'll also be
giving a shout out to some of

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.590
our favorite apps and mourning
the absence of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.710
the giant fake phone.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710
This is the App Clinic.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.140
RETO MEIER: Each week, on the
App Clinic, Ian and I review a

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.420
series of apps in a particular
category.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.260
IAN NI-LEWIS: Lately we've been
digging a little deeper,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470
highlighting some of this
technical challenges involved

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.970
for people trying to
build apps that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.330
fit into that category.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.830
RETO MEIER: And at the end
of each episode, we offer

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.900
patients a set of prescriptions
that we believe

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.240
will help them take their
app to the next level.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Then, the
following Tuesday, in this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.040
sort of circle of awesomeness
we have going, Roman, Nick,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.600
and Adam take another pass from
a design perspective.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.570
They'll offer some insights into
how to make the apps more

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.400
consistent with the design
aesthetic of Android and even

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.410
create some screen mocks for
apps that offer some practical

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.430
ideas for how to make your
apps more intuitive.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.100
RETO MEIER: The idea behind
both shows is to take the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.320
conversations we on the Android
Developer Relations

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.490
team have every day
and hold them in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.870
more of a public forum.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: And with
less swear words.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.530
Our team's mission is to help
developers create magical

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.750
experiences.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.480
We want to make Android a better
platform for users and,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.670
of course, make a better
platform for developers, make

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010
it more successful.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.930
RETO MEIER: And to that end,
we'll be shifting our focus to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.250
be a little more technical.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.770
We'll be looking not just at
the features that the apps

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.070
that we look at it but also
how they're implemented.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're
not just going to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.000
look at features either.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.080
We're going to be looking at
things like efficiency, and

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.180
how to make your UI buttery
smooth, and best practices in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.890
general that exist for apps in
whatever category we happen to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.966
be reviewing.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.010
RETO MEIER: Each episode is
going to have a strong

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.990
technical focus.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.040
There will be plenty of code
snippets that are going to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.200
show you how to do the things
that we've been talking about

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.330
all episode.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: We also wanted
a way to reward the app

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.270
developers, the ones we love
like Tasks, Hipmunk, IM, and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.000
Camera FX Pro.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.870
These guys followed
our advice.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.730
They implemented the
improvements that we talked

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.920
about, and they took their
apps to the next level.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.700
RETO MEIER: And so, to that end,
we're creating the App

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.560
Clinic's Pure Android
collections.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.620
This is going to be a collection
of apps that Ian

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220
and I are going to handpick, and
each of which, we believe,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.620
offers the users a magical
experience in some way.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now any of the
apps that we review on the App

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.740
Clinic will be eligible for
consideration to include in

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.440
this collection.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.140
So I think the big question
is, how do you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.270
get your app nominated?

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.960
RETO MEIER: It is indeed.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.070
So if you have any questions
about the details that we're

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.320
discussing here, let us know
on the the G+ event, or on

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.330
YouTube, or however you're
watching the event now and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.880
we'll try and to get back to
them at the end of the show.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.660
Engineer Dan is busy checking
out the old--

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.973
that wasn't supposed
to happen, OK.

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:00.820
RETO MEIER: [LAUGH]

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.920
That's all right.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.440
Switch that to the background,
if you would, Daniel.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: There
you go, OK.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.070
RETO MEIER: So why
don't I jump back

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.910
and then jump forward.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.612
RETO MEIER: [LAUGH]

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:13.700
Perfect, well, not
quite as perfect.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.210
That's not quite the
right one, Daniel.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.840
There isn't one for us behind?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.620
Interesting.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.000
DAN: Let me--

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.400
Woohoo!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.360
All right, OK, now play
that thing, and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
it's going to be awesome.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.690
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.520
Boom.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.555
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah!

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:31.000
So how do you go about

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.780
RETO MEIER: Nominating?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.490
DAN: Sorry, guys.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's OK.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.050
RETO MEIER: It's all good.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.240
So we've created a Trello
board on which we take

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.707
nominations for both
the categories

00:03:38.707 --> 00:03:40.250
you'd like us to review.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.380
And you can login with your
Google account, so it's pretty

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.950
straightforward.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.140
And then anyone can add a
comment to the nominations

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.280
card on the proposed
categories list.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now just in case
you didn't see that URL as it

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.040
was flying by, the URL is
bit.ly/AppClinicTrello,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.780
capital A, capital C, capital
T. So we're going to go

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.990
through and create new cards
for each nomination.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.650
You can vote for them.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.910
And once a new category has got
sufficient votes that we

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.560
can make an interesting show
out of it, we're going to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.500
create a new list and--

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.940
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.829
And so then, for each list, so
what you are going to end up

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.230
with is one list which is all
categories which you vote on

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.970
and add your comments for the
categories you'd like.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.820
And then we're going to go
through and create a new list

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.030
for each of those categories.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.790
And that's why we're looking
for nominations for apps.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.050
So the top card on each of those
category lists is going

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.690
to be a place where you can
comment and say, hey, please

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.650
nominate my app.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right,
so we can just see over

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.790
here would be the--

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.740
so this is where you are going
to nominate categories that

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.560
you want to talk about.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.120
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: And then once
we've got a category that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.060
everybody wants to talk about,
like Halloween apps, our most

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.660
successful category ever, then
you put cards in there.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.010
And it works a lot like
Moderator except there's no

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.670
down votes, and you can see
a lot more on one screen.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.630
RETO MEIER: Exactly, and so this
gives us a chance to see,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.820
you know, what are the
categories that people really

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.780
want us to look at.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.300
And gives you a chance to see
ahead of time what's coming.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
So rather than just having to
keep track of what's happening

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.410
next week, you can see that,
hey, we're social apps as well

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.400
in a few weeks' time.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.450
So I want to make sure that my
social app gets nominated.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.070
And then you can help get people
to put vote them up,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.140
and so on, and so forth.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.180
So we're going to create
the cards.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.650
At the moment, you guys
can only create

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.560
comments and votes.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.070
And then, a week before each App
Clinic, we're going like

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.000
three or four of the apps that
we want to take a look at.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: And we'll
generally try and select the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.450
apps with the highest
number of votes.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.900
But we want to increase the
chances that the apps that we

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.810
look out will make it into our
Pure Android collection.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.420
So we are going to do a little
bit of editorial work.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.630
We're going to look favorably
on apps that are

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.820
self-nominated as well as those
that pass some of our

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.380
most basic tests.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.760
Now I'm actually going to break
in here and say that,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.230
based on some the feedback
we've gotten from our

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.630
partners, we will probably
move to an entirely

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.780
self-nominated system.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.680
So you will need to make sure
that the app developer is

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.160
involved with the app that
you're nominating if you're

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.115
not the developer yourself.

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:19.470
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.740
And the reason why we want to
do that is, well, for two

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.290
reasons, and, mainly, it's
because we want to work with

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.720
developers who are
really interested

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.250
in hearing our feedback.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.280
We're going to be
pretty candid.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.360
I think anyone who's watched
the show before knows that.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.670
It's always, hopefully,
constructive criticism, but we

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.980
want to make sure that, if we're
putting this advice out

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.280
there that the people who we're
giving it to want to

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.688
hear it and want to be able to
take advantages of what we're

00:06:40.688 --> 00:06:41.620
telling them.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.820
So speaking of tests.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.540
Let's talk about how you go from
App Clinic patient to a

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.040
Pure Android member.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: So we'll start
by putting each app through

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.720
our basic QA checklist, which
you may recognize as the

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.400
recently finished Android core
app quality guidelines.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.720
Now this is the low bar.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.010
It basically just demonstrates
that your app runs, and

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.600
doesn't crash, and follows the
most basic set of quality

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.960
guidelines we can think of.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.050
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.660
We'd like to think that you've
already run your apps through

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.910
this checklist before you
publish it on Google Play, let

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.060
alone submit it to us
to have a look at.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.230
So we might use this as a way to
filter out some of the apps

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.190
which aren't quite ready
for us for review yet.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.540
Now after we do the basic
checklist, we'll look at how

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.430
your app runs on
tablet devices.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.020
You know that this is the year
of the Android tablet.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.130
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Not to be confused
with 10 years from

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.470
now, which is the year
of Linux desktop.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.362
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:41.780
I've been waiting for
that for so long.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.980
Now we're going to use the
tablet app quality guidelines

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.310
as a guide there.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.440
RETO MEIER: And it's important
that your app not only work

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.330
but it works well on all devices
so that means phones

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.120
and tablets.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.342
So we'll be giving it a good
going over on a phone, on a

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:58.570
7-inch, and a 10-inch tablet
before we consider it for part

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.345
of the Pure Android
collection.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:00.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Are we're
going to do

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.870
12-inch, 15-inch tablets?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.090
RETO MEIER: We may do it.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.120
We'll play it by ear.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now the last deal
breaker is going to be

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.650
your feature graphic.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.530
Every app in a category needs
to have a feature graphic in

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.800
order to be included.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.430
RETO MEIER: And that's not just
us being difficult, it's

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.565
actually a technical
requirement.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:18.040
So if you're nominating your app
for review and you want it

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.890
to be considered for entry to
the Pure Android collection,

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.970
you need to have a
feature graphic.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: In fact, we're
actually going to take a look

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.140
at all of your assets--

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.590
feature graphics, icons, and
even your app descriptions.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.250
RETO MEIER: Yeah, and then Nick
and Roman and Adam will

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.630
go through each of the apps
through the prism of the

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.265
Android Design Guide on
Tuesday's Android Design in

00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:39.520
Action, offering some
suggestions for how to improve

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.120
your user experience of each
of the apps from a design

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.590
perspective as well as the
category in general and the

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.640
usual user experience
tips that these guys

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.770
are happy to provide.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now remember,
we're not expecting every app

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.945
that we look out to be perfect
from the first time we see it.

00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.750
RETO MEIER: No, and the point
of the App Clinic isn't to

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.230
find the very best, most popular
app in each category.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.160
There are other featured lists
that do exactly that.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.600
We're developer advocates, so
what makes it a good day for

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.110
us is when we find a way to help
a developer take their

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.150
good app and make
it a better app.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: So don't worry if
we review your app and give

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.500
you a bunch of constructive
criticism.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.870
The very fact we reviewed your
app means that it has some

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.980
interesting functionality that
we think needs to be

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.050
represented on Google Play.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.420
Giving you constructive
criticism gives you an

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.740
opportunity to take that great
functionality and turn it into

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.990
a wonderful app.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.570
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.970
What we're really hoping to
create is a knowledge base of

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.740
information that helps not just
the apps that we review

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.480
but everyone who watches and all
the Android app developers

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.160
to create really magical
experiences for their users.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which is awesome
because you are a magician,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.880
and you will be showing us
how to make things magic.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.770
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.360
And I may get into a little
bit of trouble from the

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.150
magician's trade union for
giving away some of the

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.890
secrets, but ultimately
I think it's worth it.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what?

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.630
What's really magic?

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.793
I can wave my hands and make
the office turn green.

00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:03.310
RETO MEIER: Oh, no,
I can though.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh
yeah, you can.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.660
Whatever.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.970
Wow, the one time we do want
the lights to screw up.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.750
RETO MEIER: I can't
make it go weird.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Darn.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.980
Oh well.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.360
Good job Dan, engineer Dan.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.980
OK, so what we're really trying
to do is we want to

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.870
hear back from you.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.490
We want to hear back from the
developers whose apps we're

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.380
reviewing, and we want to hear
back throughout the entire

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.110
cycle of going through and
applying it the ideas we've

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.330
had, rejecting some, accepting
others, going through

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.960
technical challenges.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.940
That entire process of improving
the apps, we'd

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.380
really like to work with you
closely and hopefully record

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.130
that process.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.680
RETO MEIER: Absolutely, I mean,
a lot of what we're

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.550
doing here-- it's really easy
for us to stand here, flick

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.260
through your app and tell you
what you should be doing

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.630
differently.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.600
But we're really interested to
hear what happens when you try

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.560
to take that advice.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.550
And it's a case of hey, we
thought about that, and we

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.650
chose not to do it
for a reason.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.040
Or we took your advice, we tried
to do it, and we ran

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.850
into these roadblocks.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.540
That's really important and
useful information.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.970
So we're going to continue to
regularly broadcast Developers

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.750
Strike Back.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.650
And that's your opportunity, for
the developers whose apps

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.190
that we've reviewed,
to respond to us.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, rather than
following up the week after

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.770
the App Clinic, we're asking you
to let us know when you've

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.150
got something you'd
like to share.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.830
RETO MEIER: And we're really
looking forward to hearing

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.470
some real war stories around the
implementation suggestions

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.935
or implementation of
the suggestions

00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:28.910
that we've given you.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.500
So both tales of success like,
yeah, we tried to do this

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.970
thing and now our list views
are buttery smooth, or

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.640
frustration like, yeah, we try
to implement this skeuomorphic

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.920
design alternative and it
really didn't work out.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.820
And our users in our AB testing,
and our beta releases

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.010
just showed that it
wasn't working.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.090
So we want to hear both ends.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.810
What are we getting right?

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.910
What are we getting wrong?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.860
What are you finding easy?

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.060
What are you finding
difficult?

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.170
So we can then feed that back
into our system as well and

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.310
try to come up with ways to make
the things that we think

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.290
are good easier for
you guys to do.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.250
So that is hopefully going to
save other developers pains as

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.280
they try and improve
their apps.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now once you've
been reviewed, let us know

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.880
whenever you think you're one
step closer to Pure Android

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.960
and we'll take another look.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.740
If we notice something that's
particularly cool or

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.460
particularly challenging, we'll
invite you to Developers

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.370
Strike Back to talk about
what you've done.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.090
RETO MEIER: And they once your
apps is Pure Android magic,

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.690
we'll induct you into the Pure
Android collection, which will

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.030
hopefully offer you some extra
downloads but, more

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.320
importantly, will give
you an opportunity to

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.260
brag to your friends.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.395
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of course.

00:12:26.395 --> 00:12:28.130
Now we're really looking forward
to the new format.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.020
And we hope that it helps
provide some recognition, and

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.010
motivation, and hopefully some
income to the developers who

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.460
are brave enough to offer up
your apps for public scrutiny.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.750
So with that I think we're
going to open it up to

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.270
questions from the internet.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.460
RETO MEIER: Yeah,
so is there--

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.210
do you know, Dan?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.700
Is there any questions from any
of the people who may have

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.660
tuned in to let us know
what they need to do?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.770
DAN: No, but we do have one
comment that says, "You guys

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.630
are incredibly lucky to be
employed the way you and your

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.350
job is basically just criticize
someone else's work.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.915
And they do all the work.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.360
So good for you guys."

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.840
RETO MEIER: There is
an aspect to that.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.530
I won't lie.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.580
But I mean, in truth, it's not
really about the criticism.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.550
What we're really trying to do
is find out more ways to be

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.690
able to help you guys
to build great apps.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.520
We're really trying to make it
easier for developers to build

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.410
the sorts of apps that we
want to use and that

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.970
people want to use.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you've got
to remember that this is only

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.750
a small part of our jobs.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.450
Most of the time, what we're
doing is writing all the

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.360
documentation on
developer.android.com,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.260
creating the tutorials, writing
sample code, and

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.150
writing things like the app
compatibility library.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.170
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: So if there are
specific technical issues or

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.950
problems with the operating
system, or with the framework

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.960
that are preventing you from
creating a great app, it's our

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.820
job to help you surmount
those obstacles.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.170
And whether that's by creating
a compatibility library, by

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.610
writing a better tutorial,
by documenting things

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.370
differently, or by going in
and fixing issues with the

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.820
operating system itself,
that's our job.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.380
So we want to hear from you so
that we can do our job better.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:06.850
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.740
I mean, that's a key
part of what we do.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.270
It's like, we do stand here.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.000
And in this show in particular,
it's all about

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.800
trying to help developers build
something better and, in

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.180
doing so, criticizing those who
haven't done the best that

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.050
they can do.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.460
But really, the reverse part
of our job is taking all of

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.790
that feedback from you guys.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.650
And that's why we really mean
it when you say, we tried to

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.690
do what you said, and we
couldn't for whatever reason.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.320
We want to hear that, not just
because it changes the message

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.640
that we can tell other people,
but so that we can go back to

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.660
the framework team, so that we
can go back to our sample

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.150
code, to the support library,
to the developer tools and

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.580
figure out ways to really
make that process

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.830
easier for you guys.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.310
A lot of companies would call
the role that we have tech

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.200
evangelists.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.980
And at Google we call
ourselves advocates.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.230
And the reason for that is
because we really care about

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.320
having that reverse lens.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.640
We want to be able to take
the suggestions and the

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.240
experiences that you guys have
and feed it back into the

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.340
system to trying and
improve that.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I mean, we
sit right in the middle of the

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.140
framework team.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.170
On one side we've got the video
and media guys, and

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.380
graphics, and then we've got
all the windowing, and

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.320
support, and USB, and just,
basically, in a

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.180
horseshoe around us.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.270
And you will often find us going
around to those people

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.960
to either ask what it
is they intended.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.240
So I'll say, Dianne Hackborn,
for instance--

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.230
there is this perfectly
legitimate request that I just

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.900
got from a developer, and I
really think that we can't

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.260
satisfy it correctly.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.010
And then, because Dianne is
smarter than me, she'll

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.050
usually say, well, actually,
they've sort of

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.910
approached it wrong.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.250
Here's the way the system
is supposed to work.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.570
And here's the way that
makes more sense.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.780
Or one of the video guys will
be like, wow, we don't have

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.180
that's that feature right, so
here's what you're going have

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.650
to do to work around it.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.520
Or here's when we think we're
going to have it.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.110
Can you collect some
more information?

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.530
Can you find more partners
that need this?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.760
We have these interactions
all the time.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.650
So yes, our job is incredibly
awesome.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.450
RETO MEIER: Yes, there is no
debate about that aspect.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: And yes, we do
criticize lots and lots of

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.310
things all the time, which I
think, if you've ever worked

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.200
in or near a developer relations
team, you'll know

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.090
it's pretty much par
for the course.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.700
But--

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.310
RETO MEIER: If you like to
complain, it's a pretty good

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.960
career path to take.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: The criticism
isn't part of our job.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.950
It's usually what we just do
over beers on Friday night.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:33.430
The real task that's before us
and the most difficult and

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.900
complicated, but satisfying,
thing that we need to do is to

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.710
make this a better platform
for developers.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.730
And part of that is making it a
better platform, and part of

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.760
that is making sure that you,
as developers, know how good

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.940
the platform is already.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.210
RETO MEIER: Yeah, exactly, I
mean, I think that's what has

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.550
driven a lot of what we're doing
on the App Clinic is a

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.170
frustration of saying, look,
here's an app that is really,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.180
really good, but it's not as
successful as it could be.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.490
And some of the reasons for
that is that the developer

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.620
just may not know what they
could be taking advantage of.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.990
And so that's really what we're
talking about with the

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.310
new direction for the App Clinic
is to try and drive it

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.839
more and more into that
technical realm.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.910
So that we're not really going
to be that focused on a

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.290
feature by feature
breakdown and

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.859
comparison between the apps.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.440
We're really looking at, OK, so
for all of the apps in the

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.030
category, here are the key
things that you need to know.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.820
And for these specific apps,
here are a bunch of new things

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.440
that you could do to make this
app even more compelling, to

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.920
increasing engagement, increase
downloads, and

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.260
hopefully lead to increased
monetization however you

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.630
choose to monetize your apps.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: The other thing to
say we really need to bring

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.400
up is what motivates us to
change the show in this way.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.685
And it's because it is very easy
for us to point out, you

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.530
know, oh look, there's the
menu button of shame.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.920
Here's an action bar
that doesn't work

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.560
the way you'd think.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.670
I mean, that stuff is
incredibly trivial.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.470
But we realized that most of the
problems that people are

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.480
having, if they are truly
interested in making great

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.500
Android apps, don't have
anything to do with that.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.350
They've already read the
design guidelines.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.510
They've already sort of decided
what they're going to

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.480
follow and what they're
going to change.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.800
But they may be doing something
like we brought up

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.550
last week, where you're
requiring the user to type in

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.820
a long username and password in
order to even use the app,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.240
which, as we know, reduces
engagement.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.510
So we want to make sure that
we're showing the best

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:27.480
practices for things like that
and also trying to solve

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.240
common problems that affect many
different applications.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.690
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.280
I think another important part
of what we're trying to do,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.480
particularly with this show, but
I think across developer

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.180
relations--

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.780
the Android platform iterates
pretty frequently.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.660
So there's a lot of new features
that come out at a

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.840
rate of, it seems like
at least every six

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.420
months these days.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.450
And so we know that, obviously,
it's our job to

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.550
know what all those
things are.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.520
And so we keep track of that.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.300
It always seems like, wow, all
of this stuff is so obvious.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.360
We've seen it for so long.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.020
Why isn't everyone doing it?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.700
Unsurprisingly, not every
developer spends every minute

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.660
of their day hitting
F5, refreshing the

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.620
developer.android.com site to
find out what new API--

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: Although some
of you do, and we

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.740
know who you are.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.830
RETO MEIER: And thank you.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.740
Those page views are
paying our bills.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.780
RETO MEIER: So a big part of
this is, for apps like one of

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.960
the apps that we looked at just
last week, Grocery IQ.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.270
Great app, wonderful design,
a lot of thought and

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.350
effort went into it.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.110
But I think the developers
of that app just haven't

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.640
necessarily been able to keep
track of all the fancy new

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.780
features that are available,
which can make that app even

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.860
more compelling, even
more exciting.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.980
And so a big part, I think of
what we're going to be telling

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.500
our developers and our audience
is some of the cool

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.560
new functions, the new features,
the new APIs that

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.550
you can use to help improve your
apps and make them even

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.120
better for the newest
Android device.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.880
And they're kind of a

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.690
particularly important audience.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.540
That may not be the biggest
number, but they are people

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.190
who tend to drive engagement,
and more importantly, the ones

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.010
which tend to set trends
amongst their friends.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.750
So if you get those early
adopters and get them to love

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.490
your app, they're the ones who
are going to tell their

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.190
friends, their family, about
this cool new app that they

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.190
should be using.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.090
So there's an opportunity there
and hopefully that's

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.750
something that we can help
you guys drive towards.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.250
The other thing to keep in mind
is that, last year, when

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.160
we started talking about action
bars and buttons of

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.600
shame, it was all sort of new.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.980
And if you were approaching your
app from a market share

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.970
position, looking at devices and
OS versions and trying to

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.450
hit the largest sweet spot, it
probably wasn't a particularly

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.340
compelling story.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.890
That has pretty much changed.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.720
The tide has turned, and we're
now going from the old

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.190
gingerbread world, which was
heavily focused on varying UI

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.150
patterns, per-device UI,
per-manufacturer UI, lots of

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.670
different buttons, lots of
different assets that you

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.370
either had to use or ignore
at your peril.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.640
Now we're in the ICS and Jelly
Bean world, where things are

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.950
considerably better designed
from the OS standpoint.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.420
There are design patterns that
affect every device on the

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:14.910
market and the OS itself has
gotten significantly faster.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.340
So any poorly performing
application or poorly designed

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.170
application sticks out
like sore thumb.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.610
RETO MEIER: Yeah, and you never
want to stick out for

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.360
the wrong reasons.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.170
You want to be an app which
sticks out for being the

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.030
shiniest, the fanciest,
the newest--

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.620
not the one which looks
like it was designed

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.540
several years ago.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.375
And so that's a big part,
particularly of what the

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.200
Android Design in Action team
are going to be looking at on

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.490
Tuesdays, is really trying to
figure out ways that apps,

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.020
particularly apps which have
a unique look and feel, can

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.280
maintain that uniqueness while
still being consistent with

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.320
the platform overall.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.640
And I think that's a really
important part of what we're

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.890
all trying to focus on, is,
we don't want to create

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.510
homogeneity across all apps.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.450
We don't want everything
to look the

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.260
same and act the same.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.080
But we do want to make it easy
for users to understand how to

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.460
explore the features,
how to get started.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.490
So hopefully what we'll end up
with in this collection, what

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.580
we really envisage, is something
that we can point to

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.100
to say, hey, if you want to
build something awesome on

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.610
Android that users are going
to love, that fits into the

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.140
platform while still having its
own uniqueness and rich

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.930
features, check out
these apps.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.230
And so that's really the guiding
principle behind the

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.470
apps that we're going to choose,
not necessarily the

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.800
one which has the most downloads
but the one which,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.740
we think, sort of highlights
what's possible on Android.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.460
So users and developers alike
have something to aim for in

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.850
terms of what they should
be aspiring towards.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now that's a very
long answer to a comment

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.040
that wasn't actually
a question.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.510
RETO MEIER: Very true.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.005
That could have been a dig, but
we'll take a dig and turn

00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:41.370
it into a 15-minute answer.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.260
And next week, we're going
to answer all our YouTube

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.400
comments from last week.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.240
RETO MEIER: [LAUGH]

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm kidding.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.670
RETO MEIER: Did we get any other
questions, or any actual

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.410
questions or comments which we
can similarly comment on?

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: On G+
or on YouTube?

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.080
DAN: Yeah, so we've got a lot of
thank yous in the comments

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.340
on YouTube today just
for having these

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.390
lives shows ever week.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.060
People really appreciate the
fact that they can interact

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.140
with you guys for even a
short amount of time.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.340
And they know that you're
actually really busy, and that

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.290
dig earlier about not really
doing anything but criticizing

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.702
other people's work is just
a one off comment.

00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:19.040
RETO MEIER: Well, you know,
that's the thing.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.850
It would be pretty ironic if
we did spend any amount of

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.870
time criticizing other apps
and were unable to take

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.340
criticism ourselves.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.120
So we definitely want to
hear that feedback.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.930
And if things like--

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.450
a good example, we heard a lot
of people talking about the

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.840
fact that they really loved
the action bar.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.650
And they wanted to use a pattern
like that in their app

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.380
but that it was non-trivial
to implement.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.220
And if we're going to complain
about people not doing it the

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.730
right way, shouldn't
we make it easier?

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.530
And so that's something which
leads back into teams within

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.050
our team, in fact, going out
and trying to build some of

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.740
those things, put them in
the support library

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.730
for you guys to use.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Although oddly
enough, in this weird

00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:00.450
coincidence, yesterday we got
two separate emails asking,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:04.960
why did the menu go away
in API level 11?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.160
RETO MEIER: Yeah, and
it's interesting.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.950
I think a lot of the times
what we see is this clash

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.950
almost, where we have an
internal team deciding that

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.280
this is the way that the
platform is going to go and

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.600
external developers going, well

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.790
actually, I kind of disagree.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.700
And sometimes it can
go both ways.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.610
We saw with the dashboard
patent, something which we

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.210
were promoting back in the
Gingerbread days, it didn't

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.190
really work.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.010
Particularly once you put it
onto a tablet, it's like, well

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.590
actually, this isn't so great.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.630
So that back and forth is a
big part of what ends up

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.910
driving future directions for
things like Android design.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, and you'll
see too that the Android

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.520
designers have taken feedback
from elsewhere.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.310
For instance, there is now a
design pattern for the drawer

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.960
pattern where there
wasn't before.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.600
The nice thing is, once it's
codified as a design standard,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.550
you know, basically, they
didn't create the drawer

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.570
pattern, but they did look
at the way everybody had

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.160
implemented it and tried to pick
the particular type of

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.270
implementation that fit the best
with the platform, and

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.770
with user friendliness, and
usability in general.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.260
And so now there's a pattern.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.615
And it's not the way that, for
instance, the original Google+

00:25:08.615 --> 00:25:09.280
app did it.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:09.520
RETO MEIER: No

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's closer to the
way the original YouTube

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.230
app did it.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.490
RETO MEIER: Yeah, i think it's
pretty close to the way

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.090
YouTube shows.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: The Google+ app
is now updated, actually.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.290
And yeah, it's actually
a little more usable.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.620
So that sort of thing is
actually extremely valuable to

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.510
us, when we hear that there's a
particular UI pattern that's

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.920
either absent or getting
in the way of

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.010
making your app great.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:34.430
Now obviously, if you're the
type of designer, and I know

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.910
that this exists--

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.790
if your boss is carrying some
other type of phone, and they

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.670
come in they say, we hate
your design because it

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.840
doesn't look right.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.730
And you say, no, it's a perfect
Android design.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.880
And they're like, well, it
doesn't look like my

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.640
smartphone, we know
that can be tough.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.350
But in general, if you're trying
to make an Android

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.870
design and it doesn't work for
whatever reason, we want to

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.880
hear about it because
we want to fix as

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.260
many of those we can.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.010
And anyone who's willing to work
with us on a continual

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.860
basis and implement our
suggestions and make our

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.356
design better is very likely
to get some help from us.

00:26:10.356 --> 00:26:10.710
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.480
I think that's an important part
of what we're trying to

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:12.990
offer here.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.205
And really, the justification
for why we've sort of rebooted

00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:20.010
our App Clinic series today is
because we want to make it

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.380
clear that the apps that we do
talk about, we're not just

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.420
putting you up there like
a pinata to take hits

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.340
and then move on.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.630
We really want to hear
back from you.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.400
We want to know what are you
doing, what worked, what

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.710
didn't work, what was harder
than it should've been?

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.730
We're really interested to know,
if we say, oh, we think

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.185
you should just change this
button over here slightly, and

00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:39.860
you're like, yeah man, that took
like two days of work.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.830
And we had to hire a designer
for a half a day.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.580
We need to know.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.360
That's the sort of thing which
we can really do actions on.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.390
So it needs to be a two-way
street here.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.180
This is an opportunity that I
think some of you guys will

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.370
find quite useful, and,
certainly, I would've back in

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:57.550
the days when I was writing
code every day instead of

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.870
doing developer relations is
hearing that advice and being

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.130
able to really speak to people
who are providing it, and get

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.620
that input as to well how can
I do this, and these are the

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.560
struggles that I've had.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.630
And so this is us putting
ourselves out there and giving

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:14.120
you guys the opportunity to have
that back and forth, let

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.290
us know what's working,
what's not

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.790
working, and ask us questions.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.160
And that's really, when we're
talking about taking technical

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.040
deep dives, that's what we
want to spend the time on

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.790
these show doing, is showing you
exactly how to implement

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.863
difficult things and creating
as much content

00:27:25.863 --> 00:27:27.240
around that as we can.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in general,
what we're going to try and do

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:34.180
is keep the show to a half an
hour but have some question

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.010
time afterwards.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.730
So we'll still schedule
an hour from our day.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.070
Now we may actually pre-record
some of the

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.280
segments of the show--

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.010
RETO MEIER: Only those which
don't affect the outcome.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.200
But we will always be here
live for questions at the

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.970
appointed time.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.525
Just go ahead and type
them into YouTube, or

00:27:51.525 --> 00:27:52.840
type them into G+.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.350
It looks like YouTube's
probably the preferred

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.333
scenario right now because
that's what Dan's got up on

00:27:57.333 --> 00:27:57.860
the screen.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.650
RETO MEIER: But we're going to
try and do a lot better as

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.110
well when it comes to
responding to this

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.070
stuff in real time.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh there you go,
Dan's got that one up.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.640
RETO MEIER: He's
got it all up.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.840
He's got it under control.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.710
IAN NI-LEWIS: He is
on top of things.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.050
Well, let us know.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.140
So Dan, is there anything else
that stands out as a question?

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.800
DAN: Yeah, one of our usual
viewers, [? FunnerGoat ?],

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.450
wants to know where the Pure
Android collection is going to

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.430
be posted to.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.930
RETO MEIER: So we'll have more
details on exactly where you

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.130
can find all of this stuff once
we've got a few apps to

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.560
put in there.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.570
So we're going to take a quick
look back across some of the

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.470
apps that we've reviewed--

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.230
don't know what happened
to my tongue there--

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.250
over the last few weeks.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.330
I know Camera ZOOM FX have just
released an exciting new

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.520
update which does a lot of the
things which the Android

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.370
Design in Action
team suggested.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.840
So we're going to probably, this
week, spend a bit of time

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.610
and check out if any of the
apps which we reviewed are

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.250
ready to become part
of the collection.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.290
And as soon as we have a couple
of guys in there, then

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.030
we'll tell you guys all about
where you can find it.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.390
And we'll definitely be making
a big deal of it then.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.890
So right now it's a call for
nominations, basically.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.190
So if you've had your app
reviewed by us and you've

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.500
already made awesome updates,
please let us know so we can

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.720
check it out.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.580
And then anyone who we review
in the future, same thing.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.020
As soon as you're ready for us
to take a look and give it the

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.300
App Clinic stamp of approval,
we'll go through that process.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.150
And we'll let you all know.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:21.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: In general, the
way collections work is we can

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.610
link to them from our
website at any time.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.150
And they have the ability to
be featured on Google Play,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.500
but they're almost never

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.420

that you can point at too.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.180
And I should point as well
the thing about these--
