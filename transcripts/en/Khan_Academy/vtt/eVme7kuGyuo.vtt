00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.990
So I've got this crazy
discontinuous function here,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.800
which we'll call f of x.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.250
And my goal is to try to draw
its derivative right over here.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.170
So what I'm going to
need to think about

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.100
is the slope of
the tangent line,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.210
or the slope at each
point in this curve,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.290
and then try my best
to draw that slope.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.490
So let's try to tackle it.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.680
So right over here at this
point, the slope is positive.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.060
And actually, it's
a good bit positive.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
And then as we get larger
and larger x's, the slope

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.730
is still positive, but it's less
positive-- and all the way up

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.640
to this point right over
here, where it becomes 0.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670
So let's see how I could
draw that over here.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.200
So over here we
know that the slope

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.941
must be equal to
0-- right over here.

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.440
Remember over here,
I'm going to try

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.550
to draw y is equal
to f prime of x.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.380
And I'm going to
assume that this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.300
is some type of a parabola.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.610
And you'll learn shortly why
I had to make that assumption.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.460
But let's say that,
so let's see, here

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070
the slope is quite positive.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.220
So let's say the slope
is right over here.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.520
And then it gets less and
less and less positive.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.510
And I'll assume it does
it in a linear fashion.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.051
That's why I had to assume that
it's some type of a parabola.

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:21.930
So it gets less and
less and less positive.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.980
Notice here, for example,
the slope is still positive.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.270
And so when you look
at the derivative,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.440
the slope is still
a positive value.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.140
But as we get larger and
larger x's up to this point,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.090
the slope is getting
less and less positive,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.420
all the way to 0.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.950
And then the slope is getting
more and more negative.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.020
And at this point, it seems like
the slope is just as negative

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.650
as it was positive there.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.100
So at this point
right over here,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.620
the slope is just
as negative as it

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.660
was positive right over there.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.740
So it seems like this
would be a reasonable view

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.060
of the slope of the tangent
line over this interval.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.130
Now let's think about
as we get to this point.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.330
Here the slope seems constant.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.990
Our slope is a constant
positive value.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.550
So once again, our slope here
is a constant positive line.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.280
Let me be careful here
because at this point,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.290
our slope won't really be
defined, because our slope,

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.860
you could draw
multiple tangent lines

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.950
at this little pointy point.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.070
So let me just draw a
circle right over there.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.910
But then as we get
right over here,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.920
the slope seems to be positive.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.980
So let's draw that.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.820
The slope seems to be
positive, although it's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.650
not as positive as it was there.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.560
So the slope looks like it is--
I'm just trying to eyeball it--

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.660
so the slope is a constant
positive this entire time.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.260
We have a line with a
constant positive slope.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.500
So it might look
something like this.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.850
And let me make it clear what
interval I am talking about.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.120
I want these things to match up.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.110
So let me do my best.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.930
So this matches up to that.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.270
This matches up over here.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.000
And we just said we have
a constant positive slope.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.232
So let's say it looks something
like that over this interval.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:32.190
And then we look at this
point right over here.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.380
So right at this point, our
slope is going to be undefined.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.504
There's no way that you
could find the slope over--

00:03:36.504 --> 00:03:38.372
or this point of discontinuity.

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:39.830
But then when we
go over here, even

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.860
though the value of our
function has gone down,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.540
we still have a
constant positive slope.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.330
In fact, the slope
of this line looks

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.340
identical to the
slope of this line.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.200
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.720
The slope of this
line looks identical.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.932
So we're going to continue
at that same slope.

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.640
It was undefined at
that point, but we're

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.205
going to continue
at that same slope.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.270
And once again,
it's undefined here

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.450
at this point of discontinuity.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.060
So the slope will look
something like that.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.310
And then we go up here.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.720
The value of the
function goes up,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.260
but now the function is flat.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.600
So the slope over
that interval is 0.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.579
The slope over this interval,
right over here, is 0.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.620
So we could say--
let me make it clear

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.210
what interval I'm
talking about-- the slope

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.790
over this interval is 0.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.310
And then finally, in
this last section--

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.450
let me do this in orange--
the slope becomes negative.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.001
But it's a constant negative.

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.000
And it seems actually a
little bit more negative

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.041
than these were positive.

00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:48.270
So I would draw it
right over there.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.046
So it's a weird
looking function.

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:51.420
But the whole
point of this video

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.940
is to give you an intuition
for thinking about what

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.630
the slope of this function
might look like at any point.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.730
And by doing so,
we have essentially

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.541
drawn the derivative
over that interval.
