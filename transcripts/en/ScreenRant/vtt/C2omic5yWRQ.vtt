00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.340
Introduction
When directors tell origin stories derived

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.840
from comics, there’s always a montage showing
how the main character comes to develop their

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.840
super-suit.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.140
That’s because costume is central to any
hero’s identity and how audiences connect

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.140
with them.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.939
Costume designers face an uphill battle right
from the start, as fans can be pretty vocal

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:23.939
about what they expect.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.859
It can also be really hard to engineer an
outfit that will withstand the realities of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:28.859
filming.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
Plus, whatever suit they decide on will forever
be enshrined in the superhero lexicon- for

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.300
better or for worse.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.300
No pressure.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.850
But one thing is understood; the costumes
will not be comfortable.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.000
Every actor lucky enough to wear one knew
exactly what they were getting themselves

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.690
into, but did it anyway.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.199
Because opportunities to be super don’t
come around everyday.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.420
Here are 10 Amazing Actors Who Hated Their
Superhero Costumes.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.879
Ryan Reynolds, The Green Lantern
CGI is a beautiful thing.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.100
It makes new worlds spring to life and bring
people back from the dead.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.710
But when executed poorly, it spoils the whole
experience- regardless of who is in front

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.710
of the camera.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.770
Case in point: Hal Jordan’s suit in the
2011 flop The Green Lantern.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.460
Computer generated from head to toe, fans
lost their minds about how ridiculous it looked.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.009
But nobody hated the outfit more than the
guy wearing it: Ryan Reynolds.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.480
Thankfully, it wasn't the actor’s last time
super-suiting up.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.479
And came back to the big screen in Deadpool.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.100
Which, if you watch closely, takes a few jabs
at his past work.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.110
The actor has also stated that he’s thankful
Deadpool wears a physical suit instead of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.290
a CG one: the kids he visits with the Make
A Wish Foundation are far more excited to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.119
see a real costume than the alternative motion-capture
pajamas he wore for the filming of The Green

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.649
Lantern.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.619
Margot Robbie, Suicide Squad
Fans (and Screen Rant writers!) are all eagerly

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.700
awaiting the release of Suicide Squad later
this summer.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.979
With killer teams both in front of the camera
and behind it, the movie is sure to be a success.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.020
But for actress Margot Robbie, the journey
has been a cold one.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.000
Playing Harley means wearing the clothes that
fit with the iconic character’s personality.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.869
And in this case, that means booty shorts,
a baseball tee, and some bitchin’ stilettos.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.369
The costume is quite striking, especially
beside her heavily-clothed cast-mates, but

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.759
the actress is quick to remind people that
there’s a definitive line between where

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.880
she ends and her character begins.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.440
One scene required her to be soaking wet,
and when the crew broke for lunch, she ate

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470
a burger in her clingy wet costume.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.540
If any of us were in her shoes, we’d feel
self-conscious too.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.780
Jennifer Lawrence and Rebecca Romijn, X-Men,
X-Men 2, X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men: First

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.870
Class, X-Men: Days Of Future Past, X-Men:
Apocalypse

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.180
Fans have been drawn to the X-Men franchise,
in part, because of the diversity of characters.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.510
Each mutant manifests their power in a personalized
way, and bringing those radical characters

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.640
to life takes incredible dedication behind
the scenes.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.420
These transformations aren’t just hard on
the makeup team, they take a toll on the actors

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.420
too.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.760
Both Rebecca Romijn and Jennifer Lawrence
have played Mystique, everyone’s favorite

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.019
shapeshifter and one of the series’ most
visually stunning characters.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.849
The actresses were both covered in prosthetics
and paint applied directly to their skin,

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.129
in a process that usually took about seven
hours every day.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.909
After Lawrence had a medical reaction to the
paint, they finally created a suit for her

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:57.909
to wear instead.

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.530
Mercifully, that cut her time in the makeup
chair down to only 3 hours.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.310
If only Romijn could have been as lucky.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.239
Paul Bettany, Captain America: Civil War
According to Paul Bettany, spending 20 hours

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.680
a day with rubber glued to your face is kind
of an uncomfortable experience.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.250
As Vision, Bettany is decked out in a full
suit from tip to toe, which had a tendency

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.340
to get pretty warm.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.820
But what audiences can’t see are the tubes
underneath, pumping ice water around the actor’s

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.790
body to cool him off- a trick used for most
of the heroes appearing in film.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.810
But that didn’t help him in the nearly four
hours each day it took to get into costume.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.360
A costume that, he says, he can rip off in
under a minute at the end of the day.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.629
As for the rest of his day?

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.940
The stunt team had two pieces of advice for
him and co-star Chadwick Boseman to stay sane

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.269
in their uncomfortable costumes: reading and
meditation.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.019
And when it got really bad, Bettany says he
reflected on how many actors would kill to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.750
be in his position, and his discomfort became
replaced with gratitude.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.830
Andrew Garfield, The Amazing Spider-Man
With all the superhero movies being released

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.879
these days, costume designers have been working
overtime to take some of the most complicated

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.530
designs from the page to the screen.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.870
And they’ve become pretty innovative as
a result.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.701
A good costume makes it easy to forget that
its being worn by a real person, who has real

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:10.990
bodily functions.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.650
And Andrew Garfield’s first spidey suit
from The Amazing Spider-Man is a good example.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.620
While it was full of technology, the only
way the actor could go to the bathroom was

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.390
to take it off completely- no easy feat when
the suit is engineered to be skin-tight.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.080
Thankfully, the designers heard Garfield’s
feedback, and added a zipper to the next generation

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080
of costumes.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.470
Nature’s call wasn’t the only obstacle
in his way, apparently the mask was really

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.610
hard to see out of.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.420
But since Spidey’s mask and eye shape are
basically his trademark, everyone agreed that

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.320
low visibility was a price they were willing
to pay in order to stay true to the character.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.470
Malin Akerman, Watchmen
No matter how literal the adaptation, filmmakers

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.950
take a risk when they decide to take a story
from a graphic novel and turn it into a movie.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.450
Someone always gets hurt.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.470
But regardless of where you stand on Zac Snyder’s
Watchmen, you have to admit that the costumes

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.540
are dead on.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.830
And while that made fans really happy, it
was hard on Malin Akerman.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.330
As Silk Spectre II, Akerman had to wiggle
into a suit made of latex, which she compared

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.760
to wearing a rubber band.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.530
The actress has also said that Spectre’s
suit would magnify the temperature of whatever

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.560
room she was in: making her either freeze
or overheat depending on the conditions.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.540
Add a corset and heels to that equation and
the result is a bad time.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.660
Ben Affleck, Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of
Justice

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.830
When it came time for Christian Bale to pass
the bat-torch to Ben Affleck, he had one piece

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.510
of advice: “make sure you can piss in the
suit.”

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.690
And, as we heard earlier, that’s a sentiment
that Andrew Garfield would agree with.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.800
Going into the filming of Batman v Superman
armed with that advice also led to co-star

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.740
Henry Cavill’s super-suit being modified
to meet the new criteria as well.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.530
But that isn’t the Batsuit charged with
cramping Affleck’s style, it’s the heavily

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.630
armored alternate suit that’s to blame.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.840
It looks unbelievably bad ass in the final
cut of the film, but in reality it was way

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.880
less cool.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.630
The actor wore a baggy motion-capture suit
during these scenes which helped engineers

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.690
later manipulate the scene with CGI.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.020
And, as it turns out, fighting in ill-fitting
pajamas against the Man of Steel can be a

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.850
little embarrassing, especially if you’re
expected to brood at the same time.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.570
Ron Perlman, Hellboy, Hellboy II: The Golden
Army

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.690
Ron Perlman has been in the business for a
long time, but audiences will recognize him

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.620
from his roles in shows like Sons Of Anarchy
or Hand Of God.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.520
And we’ll be seeing more him in the upcoming
Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.500
But one place they might not recognize him
from is his work as the character Hellboy-

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.960
and thats exactly the point.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.900
The makeup process was so extensive that by
the time he was done in the trailer, only

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.900
his eyelids were left exposed.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.060
With everything else either covered by prosthetics,
foam, or several coats of red paint.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.160
The actor admits he grew tired of the process
pretty quickly, but stuck it out because he

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.410
loves the character.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.550
Hopes for a third installment have been swirling
for years, many of them belonging to Perlman

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.550
himself.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.340
But unfortunately, at this point, it doesn’t
seem very likely.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.090
Chadwick Boseman, Captain America: Civil War
Audiences have been waiting a long, long time

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.140
for Black Panther to show up on the big screen.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.380
So when it finally happened earlier this year
in the super-anticipated Captain America:

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.410
Civil War, fans got excited.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.880
Brought to life by Chadwick Boseman, the character’s
suit keeps the actor completely contained

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880
within.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.410
And considering the movie was filmed over
a pretty hot summer, it wasn’t very comfortable.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.680
The outfit is made of many intricately detailed
pieces, and Boseman admits he was pretty concerned

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.770
about accidentally scratching any one of them
and making more work for the costume department.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.780
But that’s something he’s going to have
to get over, and pretty quickly too, since

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.590
a Black Panther solo movie has been greenlit
for a 2018 release.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.160
Plus, now that he’s been introduced to the
Marvel cinematic universe, there’s no telling

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.860
how many movies he’ll show up in.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.580
Despite all this, Boseman has stated time
and time again that he feels honored to be

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.100
part of the team.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.410
Olivia Munn, X-Men: Apocalypse
Olivia Munn has been orbiting the comic scene

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.640
for years, since her days hosting G4’s Attack
Of The Show.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.750
And she’s come a long way since, even landing
herself the role of Psylocke in the latest

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.780
X-Men installment, Apocalypse.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.380
Munn’s passion for the source material and
her love of the character are what she would

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.810
focus on every day while both her and her
costume were being covered in lubricant so

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.810
it wouldn’t rip.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.740
The character’s look has come under attack
recently for being too revealing, while others

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.470
applaud its authenticity.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.990
The actress has mentioned the outfit was uncomfortable
and ripped in some pretty awkward places.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.550
But for her, the character’s appeal lies
in who she is, not what she wears.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.120
And besides, Psylocke didn't even choose that
outfit, Apocalypse did.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.860
Conclusion
So what do you think of our list?

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.720

costumes?
