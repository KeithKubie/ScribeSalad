00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here I've written two partial HTML utterances,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but I've left some blanks.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This makes it entirely reasonable for you to come in and put things right

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
by adding a small number of characters--the smallest you can--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to fill in each blank and make it valid HTML according to previous grammar.

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Remember that mostly means the tags have to match up correctly.
