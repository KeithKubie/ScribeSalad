00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.880
Mary made 15,000 milliliters
of tea for a party,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.420
and she served the tea
divided equally in 8 pitchers.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.370
Her guests drank
6 pitchers of tea.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.760
How much tea did
Mary have leftover?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.600
Write the answer as a
whole number of liters

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.910
and a whole number
of milliliters.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.640
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.260
She's got 8 pitchers.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.710
So let's visualize
these pitchers.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.780
So let me see if I can, so
let me draw a pitcher here.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.840
So this is one pitcher.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.990
I'll do my best to
draw a nice pitcher.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.900
So this is one pitcher.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.790
And she's going to put the same
amount of tea in every pitcher.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.340
So the same amount of
tea in every pitcher.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.864
Let me copy and paste
this, so copy and paste.

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:49.280
So she's going to
have 8 of these.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:02.890
So that's 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.680
So she wants to put the
exact same amount of fluid

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.960
in each of these 8.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.480
So she's going to divide
evenly the 15,000 milliliters

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.230
into 8 pitchers.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.850
So that's straight up division.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.890
She's going to start
with 15,000 milliliters,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.660
And she's going
to divide it by 8.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.840
She's going to divide into
8 equal groupings or 8

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.920
equal pitchers with the same
amount in each of the pitchers.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.441
So 8 goes into, it doesn't go
into 1, it goes into 15 one

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:31.940
time.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.150
1 times 8 is 8, subtract
15 minus 8 is 7.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.960
So bring down a 0.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440
8 goes into 70, 8 times.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.390
8 times 8 is 64.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.820
Subtract, we get a 6,
bring down another zero.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.130
8 goes into 60 seven times.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.620
7 times 8 is 56.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.700
Subtract again, we get a 4 and
then bring down a zero again.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.130
8 goes into 40 exactly 5 times.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.880
5 times 8 is 40.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.860
And we're not left
with a remainder.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.200
So if we divide
15,000 milliliters

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.710
into 8 equal
sections, each pitcher

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.750
is going to have exactly
1,875 milliliters.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.690
So that's 1,875 milliliters.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.480
But that's not what
they're asking us for.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.530
They tell us that her guests
drank 6 pitchers of tea,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.440
and how much tea did
Mary have leftover.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.400
So the guests drank 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, leaving 2 pitchers left.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.230
How much total tea is
going to be in that?

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:44.440
It's going to be 2 times 1,875,
or 1,875 milliliters times 2.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.660
Figure out what that is.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.720
2 times 5 is 10, 2 times
7 is 14 plus 1 is 15.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.575
2 times 8 is 16 plus 1 is 17.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.670
2 times 1 is 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.720
So what she's left
with, what she's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.536
leftover with is
3,750 milliliters.

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:07.910
Now they want our
answer in terms

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.940
of a whole number of liters and
a whole number of milliliters.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.890
And we just have
to remind ourselves

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.460
that 1,000 milliliters
is equal to 1 liter.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.755
So you could rewrite this.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.380
This is the total
number of milliliters

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.620
that she's left with.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.470
We could rewrite this
as 3,000 milliliters

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.744
plus 750 milliliters.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:34.160
Now the reason I
wrote it this way

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.285
is because if 3,000
milliliters-- this is literally

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.730
3,000 one-thousandths
of a milliliter.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.580
We already saw that
1,000 milliliters

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.830
is equal to 1 liter, so this
piece right over here, this

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.870
is equal to 3 liters.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.939
This is equal to 3 liters.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.230
So if we wanted to write it
as a whole number of liters

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.646
and a whole number
of milliliters,

00:03:52.646 --> 00:04:04.160
this would be 3 liters
and 750 milliliters.
