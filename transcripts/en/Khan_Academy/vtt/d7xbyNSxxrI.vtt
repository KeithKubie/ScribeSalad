00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.041
- [Voiceover] You look at a community

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:04.389
that is in a given habitat,
a natural question is to say,

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:06.991
well, has that community
always been that way?

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:08.225
Has it always been there?

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:11.017
Was there a time where maybe
there was no life there?

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:14.244
And the answer is, well, yes,

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:16.498
the communities do change over time,

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:18.542
and there is some initial period

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:22.085
where there might not be
any life in that habitat,

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.848
and then life slowly colonizes it,

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:27.903
and the makeup of that
life will change over time,

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:29.550
the makeup of that community.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.468
And this general idea is
called ecological succession.

00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:35.301
Ecological succession.

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.444
And folks will often talk about

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:42.254
the different types of
ecological succession,

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:46.244
splitting it up into primary
ecological succession,

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:50.077
and so primary is when
you start with no life,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.258
because you really have a new habitat,

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:56.697
and then slowly life colonizes it.

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.088
And the best example of that,

00:00:58.088 --> 00:00:59.426
or one of the best examples of that

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.556
is when new land forms due to lava flows.

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:03.170
There are pictures from Hawaii,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.833
where new land is forming
as this lava hardens.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.956
And, at first, there is,
when it's molten lava,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.638
there's no life there, then it hardens,

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.074
and slowly, basic life,
or life in general,

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.241
will start to colonize that lava rock.

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.984
And some of it you won't be
able to see with your naked eye,

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:23.473
it would be microbes,

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:24.643
and some of it you could see,

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:27.873
it could be simple ferns
and plants like that,

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:30.511
and these are often called
the pioneer species.

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:32.706
But what they often do
is make that environment

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:35.552
more suitable for other types of life.

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.146
So they might slowly break down that rock.

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.999
As they die, along with
the broken down rock

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.894
that also gets eroded from the water

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.971
and the air and the rain,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.696
it starts to make soil and
conditions more suitable

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.589
for other types of species.

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:52.765
And these pioneer species,

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:55.116
they don't even have to
just be plants and microbes.

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:58.109
I was just reading an
article about how in Hawaii,

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.217
humans want to get that land

00:02:00.217 --> 00:02:03.006
because it's beachfront property.

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.803
Or the beach might not
have formally formed

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:08.987
in the traditional sense, but
you have ocean view property.

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:11.351
So humans might be some of
the first pioneer species

00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:14.182
who might wanna be out on that land.

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:17.912
And that new land doesn't
just form from lava flows.

00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:21.957
There are other examples
of new habitats forming.

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:26.124
So right here, we have pictures
of a new habitat forming

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.289
because of the retreat of glaciers.

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.173
When the glaciers were
covering up these rocks,

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:34.562
you didn't have life on them.

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:38.335
But as the glacier
retreats right over here,

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.424
you see things like these mosses

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:44.260
and other types of pioneer
species starting to colonize.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.950
And over time, they're going to make it

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.988
more and more suitable for
other types of species.

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:50.947
So that's primary succession.

00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:53.980
Another situation is when you
have secondary succession.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.360
And there's many different ways

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.734
you could have secondary succession.

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:00.234
One of the most cited examples

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:06.107
is when you have some type of a disaster.

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:09.535
And so this right over here,
this is a picture of a fire,

00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:13.702
so here, we're talking
'bout secondary succession,

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.841
where you had a community,
but then you have a fire,

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.417
and so that fire might wipe
out a lot of the community.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:24.120
And then it creates space
for other things to form.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.504
So after you have a fire,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.504
the forest might look something like this,

00:03:27.504 --> 00:03:31.730
and then, notice, you have
species that start to colonize

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.168
where a lot of other
species might have died

00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.109
or died during the fire.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.109
And sometimes, after this
disaster of some kind,

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.236
you might get back to the
same type of community

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:46.870
that you had before the disaster,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.989
but sometimes, it could be
a completely different one,

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.072
that the communities don't come about

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.712
in exactly the same way.

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:59.109
So the general idea is
communities change over time,

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.986
we have ecological succession.

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:02.474
There are times where
there's no community,

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.862
and then they come in,
that's primary succession.

00:04:04.862 --> 00:04:06.554
And then, you have times where you have

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:07.895
disasters of some kind

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.159
that could change the
environment in some ways,

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.477
and it could change the
makeup of that community.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:14.088
And things don't have to be as dramatic

00:04:14.088 --> 00:04:16.823
as new land formation because of lava

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:20.947
or because of forest fires
or even glaciers retreating.

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:22.772
It could because of a disease,

00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:24.474
or it could just be because

00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:27.557
a new species gets introduced somehow

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:31.367
that changes the makeup,
changes the competition,

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:34.884
the predatory, the various,
the symbiotic dynamics

00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:36.801
within that community.
