00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.660
The Russian novelist, Leo Tolstoy was a believer in the novel not as a source of entertainment

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.260
but as a tool for psychological
education and reform.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.540
It was in his eyes, the supreme medium by which we can get to know others

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040
especially those who might from the outside seem unappealing

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.400
and thereby expand our humanity and tolerance.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.880
Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 at Yasnaya Polyana,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
a huge family estate, a hundred miles south of Moscow.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.860
It was to be his home on and off for the rest of his life.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.800
His parents died when he was young

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.500
and he was brought up their
relatives.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.040
He flopped at university.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.720
One lecturer described him as being unable
and unwilling to learn.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.480
He spent a few years gambling and
drinking and chasing gypsy women before

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.400
signing on as an artillery officer in
the Crimean War.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.540
He got married in his early thirties.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.960
His wife Sophia, who came from a sophisticated high-cultured background was only 18.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
They had 13 children, 9 of whom
survived infancy.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.800
It was a difficult marriage.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.440
There were huge arguments about sex and bitterness on both sides.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.940
Leo grew a very long beard,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.480
became a fitness fanatic and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.460
spent most of his time in his study.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
What he did there was to write several
hugely successful books among them

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.040
"War and Pace",  "Anna Karenina" and "The Death of Ivan Ilyich".

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.860
Tolstoy didn't believe in the idea of art for art's sake.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
He was deeply invested in the belief that good art should make us less moralistic and judgmental

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.540
and should be a supplement to religion

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.700
in terms of developing our
reserves of kindness and morality.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.520
This crusading moralistic side of Tolstoy has often been ignored by modern critics

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.860
who don't wish to dirty art with a
mission,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.640
but it is in fact the most important side of Tolstoy,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.680
and none of his efforts can properly be appreciated without keeping it in mind.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.840
Tolstoy's first great novel was "War and Peace" published in 1869, when he was 41.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.740
In it, we meet Natasha Rostova, a delightful free-spirited young woman.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.160
At the start she's engaged to Andrei, a kind and sincere man who loved her
deeply,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.200
But is also rather emotionally remote
and avoidant.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.520
While Andrey is away travelling in Italy,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.440
Natasha meets a handsome cynical waster called Anatole and falls under his spell.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000
He almost manages to seduce her and persuades her to run away with him.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.040
Though her family managed to stop her at the very last minute.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.400
Everyone is appalled and furious with
Tasha.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780
This sort of madness wrecks her own prospects and deeply shames her family.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.300
By the world standards, Natasha has failed terribly.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.960
If we encountered a news clip about such a person,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.920
we might rapidly come to the conclusion that she lies beyond the range of normal sympathy.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.120
She had so much; she thought only of herself, she got what she deserved.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.160
And yet Tolstoy’s view is that if we grasp what things are like for Natasha inside her mind,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.520
we can’t and won’t withdraw our sympathy.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.880
She isn’t in truth self-indulgent, frivolous or totally lacking in devotion.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.740
She’s just a sexually inexperienced young woman who feels abandoned by her preoccupied boyfriend.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.700
She is someone who has a deeply impulsive and warm nature

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.500
and is easily carried away by joy and happiness.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.180
She is also acutely worried about letting other people down,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.900
which is what leads her into trouble with the scheming and manipulative Anatole.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.120
Tolstoy keeps us on Natasha’s side

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.940
and by doing so, he is getting us to rehearse a move he believes is fundamental to an ethical life:

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.960
if we more accurately saw the inner lives of others,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.860
they couldn’t appear to us in the normal cold and one-dimensional way,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.680
and we would treat them with the kindness which they truly need and deserve.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.300
No one should be outside the circle of sympathy and forgiveness.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.380
For Tolstoy, a particular task of the novel is to help us to understand the so-called ‘dislikeable’ characters.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.200
One of the most initially repellant characters in his fiction is the husband of Anna Karenina,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.540
the heroine of his great novel of the same name,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.740
the pompous and stiff Karenin.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.840
The novel, a tragedy, tells the story of the beautiful, clever, lively and generous hearted married Anna,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.720
whose life falls apart when she falls in love with Vronsky,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.720
a splendid young cavalry officer.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.040
Anna’s husband – Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.720
is a fussy, status conscious, mannered high-ranking government official

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.240
who is often callous towards Anna and  unable to answer any of her emotional yearnings.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.060
As Anna’s affair with Vronsky develops, her husband’s main worry is that

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.440
it might lead to social gossip which could undermine his public standing.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.450
He appears to have no sincere feelings at all about the marriage itself.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.100
He comes across as simply cold and brutish.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.900
But then Anna gives birth to her lover’s child,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.260
she is ill, and in a highly touching scene Karenin is deeply moved,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
weeps for the infant, for the mother, and forgives Anna:

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.520
No, you can’t forgive me, says Anna.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.860
And yet he suddenly felt a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known:

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.320
a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.860
He knelt down, and laying his head in the curve of Anna’s arm; he sobbed like a little child.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.620
Thanks to the judicious Tolstoy, we see entirely unexpected aspects of the man.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.660
His inner life is not at all what we would expect, judging from the outside.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.760
But Tolstoy’s point is that Karenin is not really an exceptional character.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.760
He is just the normal mixture of bad and good.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.660
It is highly usual for rather off-putting people to have huge reserves of buried tenderness,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.660
to have dimensions to their characters very different from

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.980
and often much nicer than those that their forbidding appearance suggests.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.600
We are invited on a comparable journey in relation to another character in Tolstoy’s fiction,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.540
the hero of the The Death of Ivan Illych,  published in 1886.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.700
At the start of the novel, we meet Ivan, a high court judge at the pinnacle of society

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.800
who appears selfish, vain and cynical.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.340
But one day, while helping hang some curtains,

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.320
Ivan falls from a ladder and becomes aware of an inner pain

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.400
which is the first sign of a disease which is soon diagnosed as fatal.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.480
He will have just a few months left to live.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.500
As his health declines, Ivan spends a lot of time sitting on the sofa at home.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.600
His family, aware at just how inconvenient his death will be to their social and financial standing,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.860
begin to resent him and his illness.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.740
He’s short and ill-tempered back.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.200
And yet inside, Ivan is going through a range of epiphanies.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.120
He looks back over his life and atones for its shallowness.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.140
He becomes newly sensitive to nature

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.740
and to the ordinary kindness of his manservant,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.180
a humble uneducated man of peasant stock.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.340
He grows furious at the stupid way

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.760
in which everyone avoids paying attention to the one really crucial fact about life:

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.060
that we all die.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.760
He realises that our mortality should be constantly before our minds

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.540
and should inspire continual kindness and sympathy.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.640
As he dies, Tolstoy imagines Ivan finally feeling pity and forgiveness for all those around him.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.460
As is typical in his writing,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.760
Tolstoy recounts in detail the vast philosophical and psychological dramas going on inside his hero’s head.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.840
All that those around him – the doctors and his family

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.600
get to see is a sullen man who spends a lot of time with his face to the wall

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.140
and yet we can see a visionary, a prophet and a man of outstanding moral courage and generosity.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.680
In writing about Ivan,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.380
Tolstoy wanted us to see his life as representative of all human potential,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.020
if only we could wake up to it before it is too late.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.360
When he was about seventy, Tolstoy pulled together his thinking about being a writer in a long essay,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.280
What is art?

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.140
It is one of his most important books.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.860
In it, Tolstoy proposes that art has a great mission.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.520
Through great art, he tells, us ‘Lower feelings – less kind and less needed for the good of humanity

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.480
are forced out and replaced by kinder feelings which better serve us individually and collectively.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.260
This is the purpose of art.’

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.580
As a supremely skilled and seductive writer,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.240
Tolstoy knew that novels need to be entertaining,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.860
or we simply won’t bother to read them.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.760
But he was also convinced that they have to aspire to be something else as well:

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.120
key supports for our own stumbling path to maturity and kindness.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.260
And they can do this because they are able to get into a place we need  but rarely have access to:

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.360
the inner lives of other people.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.500
In What is art?, Tolstoy was mostly writing about the works of other authors,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.920
but it is really his own achievement that he is, indirectly and modestly, summing up.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.760
Great writers shouldn’t ever be just helping their readers pass the time.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.940
Their writing must be a form of therapy,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.300
an attempt to educate us towards emotional health and ethical good sense.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.220
As they aged, the tensions between Leo and and his wife Sophia grew.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.460
He complained that they had “totally opposite ideas of the meaning of existence”.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.600
Ye he insisted that even as Sophia  “grew more and more irritable, despotic and uncontrollable”

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.940
he continued to love her,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.120
though he admitted that he had given up trying to express his feelings.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.160
“There is no greater tragedy than the tragedy of the marital bed”, he wrote.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.940
Finally, when he was past eighty, Tolstoy couldn’t take it any more,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.940
and deserted his wife and family.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.160
He ran away in the middle of a freezing November night,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.300
caught pneumonia and died at the nearby railway station,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.860
where he was waiting for a train.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.920
Tolstoy’s funeral was a major public occasion.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.620
Thousands showed up from across Russia and the world.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.080
This was fitting, for his central proposal has enormous social implications.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.900
Tolstoy realised that our picture of what other people are like

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.800
is a great driving force of relationships, economics and politics.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.680
He held up the tantalising idea that art could be the major vehicle for getting more accurate

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.200
and often much kinder – ideas about what is going on in the minds and lives of other people.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.860
His body was taken back to his house and buried in the garden,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.320
under some trees where he liked to play as a child.
