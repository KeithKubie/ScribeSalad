hello dr. mother we're students from st.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190
hello dr. mother we're students from st.
 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.309
hello dr. mother we're students from st.
your high school in New Jersey we're in

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319
your high school in New Jersey we're in
 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.869
your high school in New Jersey we're in
an advanced physics class and we would

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879
an advanced physics class and we would
 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.639
an advanced physics class and we would
like to know where do you as an

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
like to know where do you as an
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.830
like to know where do you as an
astrophysicist believe course originated

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
astrophysicist believe course originated
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660
astrophysicist believe course originated
from and what scientific findings have

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
from and what scientific findings have
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.669
from and what scientific findings have
you tied to this position thank you for

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
you tied to this position thank you for
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.900
you tied to this position thank you for
your time and we hope you answer

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
your time and we hope you answer
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.560
your time and we hope you answer
question

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
question
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930
question
so students from the Rose school you

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940
so students from the Rose school you
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.400
so students from the Rose school you
want to know where did the quarks come

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
want to know where did the quarks come
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.470
want to know where did the quarks come
from well let me describe what a quark

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
from well let me describe what a quark
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.320
from well let me describe what a quark
seems to be if you take two protons and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
seems to be if you take two protons and
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240
seems to be if you take two protons and
you crash them into each other you can

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
you crash them into each other you can
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130
you crash them into each other you can
find out that there seem to be made up

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
find out that there seem to be made up
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.460
find out that there seem to be made up
of smaller particles called quarks that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
of smaller particles called quarks that
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.850
of smaller particles called quarks that
are held together by a force that seems

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
are held together by a force that seems
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.530
are held together by a force that seems
to be carried by other particles called

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
to be carried by other particles called
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280
to be carried by other particles called
gluons now these particles can be made

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
gluons now these particles can be made
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260
gluons now these particles can be made
in the in the collision so though we can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
in the in the collision so though we can
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660
in the in the collision so though we can
never get us a quark separated from

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
never get us a quark separated from
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389
never get us a quark separated from
other quarks very far so these things

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
other quarks very far so these things
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670
other quarks very far so these things
seem to be the building blocks of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
seem to be the building blocks of
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770
seem to be the building blocks of
ordinary matter particles that we see

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
ordinary matter particles that we see
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650
ordinary matter particles that we see
today so theoretically if we imagine

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
today so theoretically if we imagine
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240
today so theoretically if we imagine
what conditions might have been like in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
what conditions might have been like in
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130
what conditions might have been like in
the early universe where the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
the early universe where the
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869
the early universe where the
temperatures were extremely high and the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
temperatures were extremely high and the
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880
temperatures were extremely high and the
densities were extraordinary we could

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
densities were extraordinary we could
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560
densities were extraordinary we could
imagine that the early universe was

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
imagine that the early universe was
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.289
imagine that the early universe was
composed of a kind of soup just made out

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
composed of a kind of soup just made out
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000
composed of a kind of soup just made out
of quarks and gluons and any other

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
of quarks and gluons and any other
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910
of quarks and gluons and any other
particles that might exist electrons and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
particles that might exist electrons and
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.210
particles that might exist electrons and
other particles in that family so this

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
other particles in that family so this
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.910
other particles in that family so this
might be what the early universe is like

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
might be what the early universe is like
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.190
might be what the early universe is like
if so then the it was the extreme

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
if so then the it was the extreme
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719
if so then the it was the extreme
temperatures and densities that made it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
temperatures and densities that made it
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030
temperatures and densities that made it
possible for quarks to exist along with

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
possible for quarks to exist along with
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399
possible for quarks to exist along with
anti quarks and all of the other amazing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
anti quarks and all of the other amazing
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.990
anti quarks and all of the other amazing
families of particles that might be

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
families of particles that might be
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.350
families of particles that might be
predicted then the universe expanded and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
predicted then the universe expanded and
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.069
predicted then the universe expanded and
cooled off and the quarks came to group

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
cooled off and the quarks came to group
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289
cooled off and the quarks came to group
together into ordinary particles like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
together into ordinary particles like
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.080
together into ordinary particles like
protons and neutrons and eventually we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
protons and neutrons and eventually we
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.999
protons and neutrons and eventually we
now have to make an accelerator to pry

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
now have to make an accelerator to pry
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.610
now have to make an accelerator to pry
them apart again
