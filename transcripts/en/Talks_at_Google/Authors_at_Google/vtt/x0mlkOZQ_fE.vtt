00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.425
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:06.900
SPEAKER 1: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.080
It is with pleasure I
introduce Dr. Lawrence Krauss.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.850
Dr. Krauss is the
Foundation Professor

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.470
of the School of Earth and Space
Exploration at Arizona State

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.720
University.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.370
He has made significant
contributions

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.890
in cosmology, where he was
one of the first physicists

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.800
to suggest the existence of
dark energy, a substance which

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600
may be responsible for 63--

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.020
sorry 68.3% of all
the total energy

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.000
in the observable universe.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040
Dr. Krauss is also
a tireless advocate

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.992
for public understanding
of science.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.700
He served on the
Science Policy Committee

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.227
for Barack Obama's 2008
presidential campaign,

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:40.560
contributed articles to "The
Atlantic", "The New Yorker"

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.870
and "Newsweek", and written
several "New York Times"

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.630
best-selling books on science,
including his previous book,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.020
the well-noted and well regarded
"Universe from Nothing".

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.520
My first exposure
to Dr. Krauss was

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.110
working with one
of his early books,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.640
"The Physics of
Star Trek", which

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.140
I found enthralling
for its thorough

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.330
and altogether serious
look at the physics,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.412
plausible and otherwise, of
one of my favorite series.

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:02.370
As a brief aside, Dr.
Krauss, I feel like there

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.140
was a missed opportunity.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440
You wrote a follow-up
called "Beyond Star Trek".

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.815
And I feel it should have been
named "The Physics of Star

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.582
Trek 2: The Wrath of Krauss".

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:13.540
LAWRENCE KRAUSS: You're
taking that out of my--

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.800
I put that in my appendix.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.250
SPEAKER 1: Oh, you did.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.900
LAWRENCE KRAUSS:
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.380
SPEAKER 1: Oh, you did now.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.890
Today, Dr. Krauss is here to
talk about his latest book,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.962
documenting our current
understanding of nature,

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.670
the history of one of
humanity's greatest

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.250
scientific achievements, the
standard model of particle

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.920
physics, and its implications
for our existence,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.440
and what promises to be the
greatest story ever told

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.430
so far.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.410
Join me in giving a warm
welcome to Dr. Krauss.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
LAWRENCE KRAUSS: Thanks.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.290
Well, it's a pleasure to
be here and see all of you.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.310
And I understand it's lunchtime.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.590
So I shouldn't go overtime.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.100
So I'll make a shorter
version than normal,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.266
because I know you have
really important work to do.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:59.110
So in any case, the quote that
I had here along with the music

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.797
comes from a book
that actually a friend

00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:03.880
of mine-- who is a filmmaker
named Werner Herzog--

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.980
recommended to me.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.812
And you might have seen his most
recent-- well not most recent

00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:13.270
movie, but second-most recent
movie, "Lo and Behold", which

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.620
is about the internet,
which is nice.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.120
There's another one
that just came out,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.870
which is a fiction,
called "Salt and Fire"

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.600
that I'm also in as a villain.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.950
But it's a weirder movie.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.060
But anyway, this book, which
is called "The Peregrine"

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.890
is about a peregrine.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.144
And but it is a
wonderful naturalist book

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:33.310
if you ever want to read it.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.170
But the quote is what's
particularly important, which

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.810
is, "The hardest thing of all
to see is what is really there."

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.150
And that's really the
thrust of the content

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.640
of my book, which is
that the world we live in

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.110
is an illusion.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.280
And it's been an amazing story
for particle physics and--

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610
oh, look at that.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.500
OK, is there a
reason that went off?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.790
Auto-power Off engaged.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.490
Auto-power Off was engaged.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.340
So waiting for
projectors to start.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.556
Good.

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:07.180
I'm very impressed
with the technology.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.111
So anyway, the standard
model of particle physics--

00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.860
and in fact, particle
physics in general--

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.390
has been about
trying to understand

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.320
the fundamental structure
of matter and energy.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.620
And it is really an amazing
story of how different

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.500
the universe is at fundamental
scales than the scale we see.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.875
And one of the
real implications--

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.250
and one of the reasons the
subtitle of the book is called

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.540
"Why are we Here"--

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.380
is that universe that we
exist in is an accident.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.145
In a well-defined way,
which I will-- well,

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:46.720
I'll talk about until
the projector gets there.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.710
I'll get-- let me just get
to the slide I want to do,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.500
so when the projector
actually turns on,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.990
which is certainly not now.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.490
Oh, a light just came on.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.866
That's good.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:00.490
We can get to the
image I want to show,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.480
which is of a window in
the wintertime with ice

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.000
crystals on it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.020
I was actually just in
Phoenix where I teach.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.340
And I gave a lecture on this.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.160
And I had to explain to people
those were ice crystals.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.240
But here we go.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.784
And so these are beautiful.

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:17.200
But what I want
you to do is think

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.741
for a second of what
it would be like

00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:20.881
if you lived on one of them.

00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.180
So let's say this one.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.980
OK, if you evolved on-- and we
can use that word in the US--

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.150
if you evolved on that
crystal, what would happen?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.819
Well, the physicists--

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.360
I don't know where
it is in that one.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.020
But anyway, let's
say with this one.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.519
Oh, no.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.980
There it is.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.900
The physicists
working in this world

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.910
would say, well, OK, I
can work out the forces.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.909
The forces along the
spine of the crystal

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.200
are very different than the
force that's perpendicular.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.720
So they come up with laws of
physics, which would explain

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.209
and predict how things moved.

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:53.500
And there would be one set
of forces in this direction,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.430
and forces in the
other direction.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.640
And that would seem natural.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.600
There'd be theologians
who'd explain

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.450
why God ordained
that direction to be

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.270
the proper direction for life.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.419
And there'd be wars
fought over whether that

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.710
was the right direction or
that was the right direction

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.180
to pray to.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.020
And all of that would have
significance, which of course

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.200
is completely illusory.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.670
It is just an accident.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.722
The crystal can point
in any given direction.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:25.180
But it wouldn't seem that way
if you lived on that crystal.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.270
And that's essentially
the world we live in.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.250
All of the facets
of the world that

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.410
make it look like the universe
is designed for our existence

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.980
are pure accidents
in a fundamental way,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.840
which I'll try and describe.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.390
And we, of, course--

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.290
the world looks like
it's designed for us.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.320
But at a fundamental
level, it's actually

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.080
antithetical to our existence,
as I'll describe to you.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.640
Now, the story is
long and winding.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.020
And obviously, I said, I want
to give an abridged version

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.350
so you can get back to work.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.350
So I want to start
fairly late into this.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.380
But the story actually begins
2000 years ago with Plato

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.544
and then works through
Maxwell and Einstein,

00:06:02.544 --> 00:06:04.210
talking about the
major revolutions that

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.470
have changed our perspective
of our place in the universe.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.860
And one of the things
that describes pretty well

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.960
the progress of science--
certainly in physics,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.100
in any case--

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.010
is when-- we know
we made progress

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.590
when two things that seem
very different on the surface

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.089
seem to be different
reflections of the same thing.

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.630
And then we know
we've made progress.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.046
And that pretty
well characterizes

00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:29.650
almost all the progress
in physics over the ages,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.237
from, for example,
in recent times,

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.070
the recognition of
electricity to magnetism,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.890
which seemed so different, are
really exactly the same thing.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.040
One person's electricity is
another person's magnetism.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.410
That led to the realization
of space and time,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.664
which seemed different,
are really the same thing.

00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.080
And what one person
sees as space,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.840
another person will
measure as time.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.190
We live in a four-dimensional
universe, not

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.540
a three-dimensional universe.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.390
And those kind of developments
have progressively

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.340
told us that the
universe that we see

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.170
is kind of myopic
because we perceive

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.860
these three-dimensional slices
of a four-dimensional universe,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.870
which is why seem so
non-intuitive to us

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.670
that the universe
is four-dimensional.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.050
And when I'm running
with respect to you,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.760
I'm seeing a different
three-dimensional slice

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.301
of a four-dimensional
universe, which

00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.650
is why things seem strange and
relativity does what it does.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.490
And I talk about those things
at great length in the book.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.930
So up to that point,
we had we developed

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.800
the theory of electromagnetism
and a theory of gravity.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.557
And all seemed well until
we got to a later stage.

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:26.890
And I wanted to begin the
later stage with this guy, who

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.820
all of you know, I assume.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.302
It's Richard Feynman,
who was probably--

00:07:34.302 --> 00:07:36.760
well, was one of the greatest
physicists of the second half

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.300
the 20th century.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.640
And what he won the Nobel
Prize for-- with others--

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.040
was the recognition that, of
course, at a fundamental level,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.800
the world is quantum mechanical.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.020
And if we want to have a
theory of electromagnetism,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.540
we need to put it in accord
with quantum mechanics.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.054
And the theory they developed
called quantum electrodynamics

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:57.220
is a theory that merges
electromagnetism and quantum

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.480
mechanics.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.650
And he presented a way
of thinking about this

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.950
to understand the electric
force between two charges which

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.740
had been understood
by Faraday and Maxwell

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.360
in a slightly
different way-- a way

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.600
we talk of by Feynman
diagrams, as we call them.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.690
But it's particularly
interesting.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.060
So this is an electron.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.860
And it repels another electron.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.670
And it does so by the exchange
of a particle-- a photon--

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.560
the quantum of the
electromagnetic field.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.730
Electromagnetic waves come
in particles and photons

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.240
of the individual [? quanta. ?]

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.690
Now, what Feynman used
in developing this

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.750
is a key aspect of
quantum mechanics, which

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.299
is central to quantum
mechanics, which is really

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.120
the same thing that's
used in Washington

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.960
in corporate America, which
are now the same thing.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.960
If you can't see
it, anything goes.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.319
OK, that's basically it.

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:54.610
And we'll learn more about
that with the investigations

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.151
over the next year,
I certainly hope.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.856
So the idea is that this
electron emits this particle--

00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:03.730
this photon of light.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.600
But that's impossible.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.660
It's not allowed.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.490
The electron just sitting
there cannot emit a particle

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.800
of light, because where
did the energy come from?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.610
If the photon carries energy,
where did the energy come from?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.200
The electron is still there
if it's an isolated electron.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.920
It can't emit a photon, because
that doesn't conserve energy.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.820
But that's OK.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.490
That's allowed by the
Heisenberg uncertainty

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.450
principle, which is
responsible for that Washington

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.360
rule I gave you.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.860
The Heisenberg
uncertainty principle

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.990
says, if I measure a
system for a short time,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.650
then I can't know
its energy exactly.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.550
There's some uncertainty
in the energy.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.830
So if I emit this photon, and
it violates energy conservation

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.550
that's allowed in
quantum mechanics,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.620
as long as the photon
disappears in such a short time

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.620
that I can't measure it.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.180
It's just exactly
like embezzlement.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.820
OK?

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.060
And I'm sure Google does
this every day at some level,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.250
because if you get the
money, and as you put it back

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.590
before anyone notices, you can
do whatever you want with it.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.090
Right?

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.890
And you know, there's
a lot of trading

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.490
that goes on in that regard.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.840
So it's exactly the same.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.800
So the photon can violate
energy conservation here.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.170
As long as it disappears
before you can measure it,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.680
you're fine.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.440
And so the photons exchange,
and it produces that repulsion.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.620
Now the key point is the
photon has zero mass.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.610
It's massless.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.960
And that's essential to
make electromagnetism

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.130
a long-range force.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.110
The electron here repels an
electron in Alpha Centauri.--

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.470
OK-- or anywhere
in another galaxy.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.410
And the reason is, because
the photon is massless,

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.452
it can carry an arbitrarily
small amount of energy.

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:38.410
And if it can carry an
arbitrarily small amount

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.380
of energy, then it can exist
for an arbitrarily long time

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.709
before it has to disappear
without violating

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.250
the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.230
And if it can exist for
an arbitrary long time,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.230
it can travel from here to Alpha
Centauri before it's absorbed.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.660
So the fact that
electromagnetism

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.040
is a long-range force is
uniquely related to the fact

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.300
that the photon is
massless, in this picture.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:10:59.800
OK?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.650
And this photon, because
you can't see it,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.760
it's called a virtual photon
because it doesn't really

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.280
exist.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.780
It just-- you can't
ever measure it.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.480
If you look for
it, it's not there.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.280
OK?

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.480
And great.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480
And so this picture--

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.420
this is a complete
picture of the quantum

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.800
theory of electromagnetism.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.380
You absorb and emit
these virtual photons

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.770
that can do anything they want
as long as you can't see them.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.250
And this theory is the
best theory in science.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.890
It's the best theory
in any area of science.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.150
Based on this theory,
you can make predictions

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.120
and compare them
with observations

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.070
to 14 decimal places,
which you can't

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.800
do in any other area of science
where fundamental predictions

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.100
compare to observations.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.160
So this is as good as
it gets in science.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.460
And in the 1940s, when this
was developed, this was great.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.370
We now have a complete theory
called quantum electrodynamics,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.100
which explains and
predicts perfectly,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.950
every measurement you can
make in atoms and other things

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.810
where electric
fields are relevant.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.910
So that's great.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.545
OK?

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:56.920
And that looked
great for nature.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.130
But then nature intervened.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:11:59.830
OK?

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.140
Nature intervened with
the fact that the neutron

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.860
is radioactive.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.114
Now this should
disturb you because--

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:08.530
I remember I first learned
about when I was in high school

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.230
from a guy named Tommy Gold,
who was a wonderful astronomer.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.520
But it should disturb you,
because most of the particles

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.630
in your body are neutrons.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.129
Right?

00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:19.660
Neutrons and protons
make up atomic nuclei.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.520
And for a heavy nuclei,
certainly there--

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.860
average more neutrons
there are protons.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.560
So the number one dominant
particle in your body

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.360
is a neutron, OK?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.030
If I take a neutron
here and hold it up,

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.020
it will decay in 10 minutes.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.902
And you will notice,
maybe to your chagrin,

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:37.860
that you've been here
for more than 10 minutes.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.110
And they're still here.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.950
You may be praying for
your neutrons to decay.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.360
But they're not.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.230
And why is that?

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.540
An accident of our existence.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.740
So what's neutron decay?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.224
Well, neutron decays into
three particles-- a proton,

00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:55.140
it's just a fancy way
of writing an electron--

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.470
a proton, electron, and a
neutrino, another particle.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.800
The key point, however, is that
the neutron and proton weigh

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.350
almost exactly the same amount.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.660
The difference between these
two masses is one part in 1,000.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.970
And so the neutron has barely
enough energy to decay.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.660
If its mass was less than the
sum of these three masses,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.900
it couldn't decay.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.000
Well, again, it would
violate energy conservation.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.570
So it's just barely more than
the mass of these particles,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.760
which is why it lasts so
long, because 10 minutes is

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.280
a hell of a long time in
particle physics units.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.780
OK?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.400
I mean, so it seems
like an eternity.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.400
So this is a very
long-lived particle,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.360
but short-lived
by our standards.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.690
So how come you're
still here, which

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.960
you may be asking yourself?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.950
So it's an accident, OK?

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.830
What happens when I put
a neutron in a nucleus?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.280
Well, it follows the nucleus.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.061
And it gets bound.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.310
What does it mean to be bound?

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.840
Well, some of you know.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.590
But otherwise, it means that
takes energy to get out.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.096
You lose energy
when you get bound.

00:13:57.096 --> 00:13:58.720
And so the neutron
follows the nucleus.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.550
Loses energy, but E
equals mc squared.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.280
So the neutron gets lighter.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.100
And when the neutrons gets in
a nucleus, it no longer as--

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.650
its mass is too small to
decay into these particles.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.650
So neutrons are only
stable in nuclei

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.490
by that accident that the fact
that the neutron-proton mass

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.060
difference is so small, that
when it falls into a nucleus,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.946
it no longer has
enough energy to decay.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.070
And that's why you're here.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.210
That's why there
are heavy elements.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.680
If it weren't for that,
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.760
and all the things that on
which our lives are based

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.150
would not exist, just because
of that fortuitous fact

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.610
that these particles have
almost the same mass.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.020
OK, that's interesting.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.217
But more interesting
for physicists was--

00:14:41.217 --> 00:14:42.800
well, this was a
little disconcerting,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.507
because suddenly,
this implied there

00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:45.590
was a new force in nature.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.710
The neutron was
discovered in 1932.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.720
Suddenly, a new force had--

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.330
because electromagnetism
can't cause this decay.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.100
And gravity can't
cause this decay.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.414
So there had to be some
new force in nature

00:14:57.414 --> 00:14:58.580
that would cause that decay.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.070
And, of course, the question
is, what kind of force is it

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.930
and how can we understand it?

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.460
The first person to write
down a theory for that--

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.730
any kind of theory-- was one
of my favorite physicists

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.010
from the 20th
century, Enrico Fermi,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.940
who was the last particle
slash nuclear physicist, who

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.700
was equally good at that
theory and experiment.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.246
The two fields have become
sufficiently complicated

00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:21.370
that you can't do both now.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.130
OK?

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.310
He was the last one who was
able to do both really well.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.579
He also, historically,
in the Manhattan Project,

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.620
was the one who was assigned
the task of building

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.460
the first nuclear reactor, the
first sustained chain reaction.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.810
And so they built in the
University of Chicago

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.169
underneath the football
field, which I've always

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:42.710
viewed as an inspired choice,
because if anything went wrong,

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.745
you'd just kill
football players.

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:44.900
And there's no loss.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.430
And so Fermi built
that successfully.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.800
But he also wrote down
this first model of this.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.870
And he submitted it to
the journal "Nature".

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.270
And it got rejected,
which heartens

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.890
many of us who submit to
"Nature" and get rejected.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.170
But he didn't take it well.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.990
And he, in fact, just said,
I'm not going to do theory.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.060
Now, I'm going to just
go do experiments, which

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.560
was good for him, it turned
out, because the next experiment

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.420
he did won him the
Nobel Prize in physics.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.540
So it worked for him.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:19.267
But his theory was
built upon by others.

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:20.850
Now the really
important thing-- there

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.250
are many important
aspects of science

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.660
that I want to
try and emphasize,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.076
and I try to
emphasize in the book

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:27.800
because they have relevance
well beyond the esoteric physics

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.300
I'm talking about,
relevance as I'll

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.760
describe in some
sense to the quagmire

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.359
where we find ourselves
living in right now.

00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:36.650
But the one thing that's
really important about science

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.130
is that it's like Hollywood.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.600
And maybe like Google, actually,
probably in that regard.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.670
If it works, copy it.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.170
OK?

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.000
And keep copying it until
it doesn't work anymore.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.400
It's like Halloween 56 or
whatever it's going to--

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.180
as long as you can sell
tickets, keep copying it.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.970
And so if we have a theory
that works, copy it.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.490
So here's the best
theory in nature.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.502
So the idea was, if
you have a new force,

00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:01.960
let's make it look
like this force.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.099
So we can draw a
picture [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.319
And it looks the same--

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.220
sort of.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.680
A neutron-- OK, so
protons, made of quarks.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.780
But that's a little
added complication.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.780
Doesn't really matter.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.820
And then electron and
neutrino come out.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.819
And if this works by the
exchange of a particle,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.440
then why not imagine
this force works

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.880
by the exchange of a particle?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.950
But this force is very
different than this force.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.920
This force works
across the universe.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.720
This force, the weak
force, operates only

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.339
on the scale of nuclei.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.530
That's why we don't
see it on human scales.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.870
It only works for-- on
the scale of nuclei.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.990
So it's very short-range.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.830
This is very long-range,
so weak, this is strong.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.530
How can you relate
those two things?

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.490
Well, if you make this particle
massive, then what happens?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.420
If this is very, very
massive then emitting

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.730
it always produces a lot of
energy, because E equals mc

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.230
squared.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.880
So if it's massive,
you can't help

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.770
but have a lot of
energy produced here.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.960
And that means you violate
energy conservation

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.810
by a huge amount, which means
the particle has to disappear

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.286
very quickly by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle,

00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:07.160
because otherwise, that
huge amount of energy

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.510
would be noticed.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.570
So if you emit a particle
that's very massive,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.390
it can travel only a very
short time, and therefore,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.402
only a very short distance
before it has to disappear,

00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:20.360
like the [? massless ?]
[? case. ?] So you want

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.242
a short-range force, just
exchange a massive particle--

00:18:23.242 --> 00:18:24.950
a long-reach force--
a massless particle.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.570
Everything works fine.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.840
But it doesn't, because
this theory gives

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.700
the best predictions in nature.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.100
This theory gives
nonsense, because when

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.045
you do the mathematics,
you get infinities.

00:18:37.045 --> 00:18:38.420
Physicists don't
like infinities,

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.390
computer scientists don't like
infinities, mathematicians love

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.500
infinities.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.050
But we don't.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.570
So the idea is how
to get around them

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.670
And this was a fascinating
and severe problem.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.120
It's so severe, that
actually, in the 1960s, when

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.640
it was kind of first
recognized, many physicists

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.190
were willing to give
up the pretty picture.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.690
They said, maybe
this unification

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.280
of relativity and
quantum mechanics

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.290
just doesn't work on
the scale of nuclei.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.650
And it was kind of
amazing how easily

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.400
they were willing to
give up this picture.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.622
And one of the things
about the book--

00:19:12.622 --> 00:19:14.830
which is one of the reasons
this is the great story--

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.880
wasn't easy.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.510
In particular, there are lots
of red herrings and dead ends.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.420
And physicists are people.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.660
And that means they're
pigheaded, and prejudiced,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.010
and biased.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.080
And they often want to
go in a direction, even

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.450
when that direction is futile.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.010
But the great
thing about science

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.680
is it drags the physicists
or the scientists,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.710
kicking and screaming,
in the right direction.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.730
So the individual scientists
may be prejudiced.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.130
But eventually, because
of nature, they're

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.690
forced in the right direction.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.240
In this case, these people, you
know, especially-- actually,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.800
it was interesting.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.400
In Berkeley was the
main place that people

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.358
wanted to give this up.

00:19:48.358 --> 00:19:50.190
And they created a
kind of zen version

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.090
of physics, which is appropriate
for Berkeley in the 60s.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.520
And it was the sound of one
particle clapping, basically.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.390
But it actually, was the
basis of string theory

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.870
got generated there, as a way,
an alternative to this picture.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.180
And it failed
miserably there, too.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.660
But that's a different book.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.480
The point is that these people
were looking at the problem.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.090
And you want to shake them,
because, in fact, they

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.810
had the answer.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.580
The answer was right
there for people

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.705
if they hadn't been looking
in the wrong direction.

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:22.080
With hindsight, it's so
much easier to see things--

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.950
to see that the answer
was right there.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.460
And the answer came from a very
different area of physics--

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.420
superconductivity.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.110
So 1911, Kamerlingh
Onnes discovered--

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.280
a Dutch physicist discovered--
that if you cooled mercury down

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.100
to four degrees above
absolute zero, then

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.140
the resistance went to zero.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.400
Then just become small.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.930
It went to zero.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.610
And that means if I
have a mercury wire,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.068
and I hook it up to a battery,
and I start a current going,

00:20:48.068 --> 00:20:49.810
and then I cool it
to four degrees,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.110
I take away the battery, then
the current continues to flow.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.690
And it doesn't just flow
for an hour or a day.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.070
It flows forever.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.660
It never ever stops, because
resistance is precisely zero.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.550
It seems like it
shouldn't be possible.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.541
But it is.

00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:06.040
It's a remarkable
phenomenon that he

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.270
named superconductivity.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.580
And it's so weird
that it took maybe

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.520
50 years to be able to
have a theory of this.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.220
And it has to do with the
rather complicated interactions

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.770
of electrons and materials,
which is nice, OK.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.334
So what's this got to do
with what I just discussed?

00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:22.000
Well, nowadays, we
have high-temperature

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.330
superconductors so we can do
need experiments in high school

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.940
physics classes, because we
can put a superconductor now

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.080
in dry ice.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.420
And there's some materials
that become superconducting

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.620
at those temperatures.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.100
And then we can play with
them in high school classes.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.600
And, for example, if you have
a superconductor in dry ice,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.890
and you put a magnet above
it, the magnet will levitate.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:42.430
Why?

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.940
Because it turns out
magnetic fields cannot pierce

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.782
the superconductor.

00:21:46.782 --> 00:21:48.740
They die off the surface
of the superconductor.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.870
So do electric fields.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.150
But that means the magnetic
field lines basically get

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.040
repelled by the superconductor.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.890
And that's enough to
levitate the magnet.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.710
It's a fun little
game to play in class.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.342
OK, again, what's this
got to do with anything?

00:22:03.342 --> 00:22:05.050
Well, now, I want you
to imagine that you

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.440
live in this superconductor.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.660
And now, you I ask you,
what are the laws of physics

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.618
in that superconductor?

00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:14.170
Well, for you, if you live
in that superconductor,

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.110
electromagnetism is
a short-range force,

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.240
because electric fields
and magnetic fields,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.920
when they enter the
superconductor, die off--

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.237
exponentially
fast, it turns out.

00:22:24.237 --> 00:22:26.570
So if you have a quantum
theory-- if you develop quantum

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.220
mechanics in that
superconductor--

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.980
you'll describe electromagnetism
as a short-range force.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.200
And that will mean that the
particle that's exchanged

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.060
is massive.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:40.450
And indeed, in a superconductor,
photons are massive.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.530
They have mass.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.754
Their mass is out here.

00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:44.170
They travel at the
speed of light.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.711
In a superconductor,
they're massive.

00:22:45.711 --> 00:22:47.410
They travel much slower.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.620
It's just the way it is.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.660
Now, again, this should start
bells ringing in your head.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.330
But it didn't for the
physicists of the time

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.760
until finally, someone
began to think about,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.080
well, what if what if we live
in a cosmic superconductor?

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.900
And what if it's like
swimming in water?

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.440
OK?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.952
You swim in water, you
feel you're really fast.

00:23:07.952 --> 00:23:09.160
Maybe Google has a pool here.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.760
Probably does.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.670
I don't know.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.540
And but what if you
fill it up with--

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.344
oops, sorry.

00:23:14.344 --> 00:23:15.760
What if you what
if you fill it up

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.879
with molasses instead of water?

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:20.170
Well, then you won't want to
go swimming, first of all.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.640
But if you did go swimming,
you'd swim a lot slower.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.850
Be a lot harder, you'd
feel a lot more massive.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.800
So what if we live in a
cosmic superconductor?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.630
And everywhere through space--

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.120
can't resist this--
everywhere through space,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.970
there's an invisible field
permeating all of space.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:45.120
And some particles interact with
that field, and get resistance,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.560
and appear as if
they're massive,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.300
and other particles don't.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.650
What if that were the case?

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.280
Well, then you could draw these
pictures-- these [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.780
diagrams.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.260
This is the one I showed you
before, but turned sideways.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.050
And these are the ones for
the weak force, the one that

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.650
produces that electron neutrino,
in terms of three particles

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.390
involved, but that
doesn't matter.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.570
But now what if these
particles are massless, just

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.970
like the photon,
but they interact

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.970
with this invisible background
field it's everywhere

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.150
and they act like they're
massive in our superconducting

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.570
world?

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.630
And that means that
the force they mediate

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.895
looks like it's short-range.

00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:23.020
Well, that would explain
how it can be short-range.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.240
But the neat thing is,
if they're massless,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.510
then the mathematics of
the calculations involved

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.580
by the exchange of
these massless particles

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.294
is the same as
that for a photon.

00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:34.210
And, in fact, instead
of producing infinities,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.390
it produces correct results.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.130
Moreover, in fact, the
mathematics is identical.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.490
So not only do these forces
appear similar, in fact,

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.580
they could be the same force.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.130
And nowadays, the
picture is that these

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.470
two forces, which are so
different in the world in which

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.130
we live, each of which is
responsible for our existence--

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.380
the electromagnetic
interactions responsible

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.960
for all the interactions in
the biology of your body--

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.050
the weak force is actually
responsible for the processes

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.740
that power the sun, as well as
the existence of heavy nuclei.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.500
And both of them are
essential for our existence.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.442
But although they're
very different,

00:25:12.442 --> 00:25:14.400
they're really the same
at a fundamental level.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.710
And at a fundamental level,
they wouldn't look at all

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.040
like the forces we see in
the world in which we live.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.080
We were dragged to this
picture unwillingly, as I say.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.670
And for a long time,
a lot of people

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.050
went in other directions.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.670
And it's amazing
to think that we

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.500
were willing to
picture a universe that

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.170
is so distinct from the
universe in which we

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.940
live-- so uninhabitable, if you
wish, so foreign and so alien.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.620
It's one of the wondrous--
one of the great aspects

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.920
of science, and art, and
music, and literature,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.640
because it forces us to view
our own perspective of our place

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.590
in the cosmos
differently-- in a way that

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.600
may not be the way we wanted.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.700
So it's an amazing
intellectual triumph

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.260
to propose that it
apparently works.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.520
But at this point, it's
kind of religious, right?

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.940
Just think what I just said.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.450
Imagine there's an
invisible background field

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.240
everywhere throughout nature
that determines why you exist,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.740
OK?

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.450
It sounds a lot like
things you would

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.590
have heard in the Bible or Star
Wars or something like that.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.506
So and it would be.

00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:19.130
It would be just an
extraordinary claim

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.190
without evidence, which
is it which is religion.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.141
And it isn't, though,
because it's physics.

00:26:26.141 --> 00:26:27.140
And what does that mean?

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.540
That means if it's,
there we have to find it.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.120
So if this invisible background
field-- it's this weird,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.830
ridiculous picture is true--

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.390
and it is a ridiculous picture.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.250
It's one we should be
highly skeptical of.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.750
If it's true, we better find it.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.790
How do you find it?

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.290
Cosmic sadomasochism.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.140
We spank the vacuum.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.660
We spank it hard.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.420
What do I mean?

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.730
Well, all fields in quantum
physics-- all fields are

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.660
related to particles.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.470
So if I dump enough energy
at a single point in space--

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.850
and let's call this
field the Higgs field--

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.850
if I dump enough energy
at a single point space,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.784
maybe I'll kick out real
particles associated

00:27:03.784 --> 00:27:04.700
with that Higgs field.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.500
I'll call them Higgs particles.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.870
How can you do that,
where you build

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.210
the most complicated machine
humans have ever built?

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.310
In this case, the
Large Hadron Collider

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.870
in Geneva, Switzerland, which
is a particle accelerator.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.105
It's located in Geneva.

00:27:18.105 --> 00:27:19.730
And in fact, if you
go to the airport--

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.310
and Google probably
has offices there--

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.980
if you go there, and you'll
see the lake and then

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.420
the little water spout there.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.920
But underneath the
farmland, right

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.545
outside the airport,
which is beautiful

00:27:29.545 --> 00:27:33.830
pastoral farmland, 100
meters below the surface,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.430
is a tunnel that's
26 kilometers around.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:43.640
And what we do is we accelerate
protons at 99.9999998%

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.590
the speed of light
in one direction,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.280
and then protons at
99.99999998% the speed of light

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.380
in the other direction.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.720
And we try and collide
them at certain points--

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.880
three different
points in this circle.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.550
They will run thousands
of times every second.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.560
Here's the French-Swiss
border, by the way.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.210
So they cross the
border with passports

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.091
and all that thousands of
times each second, which Trump

00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:07.340
will want to change, no doubt.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.740
And this machine was
built to be able to see

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.800
if we could kick particles
out of empty space

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.750
and produce these
Higgs particles.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.090
This ridiculous picture
actually worked.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.760
Now, in this
country, we have sort

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.800
of anachronistic day we
celebrate called July 4th,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.780
which doesn't mean
anything to anyone else.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.480
But now, it has a
cosmic significance,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.685
because on July 4, 2012, we
reported 50 events produced

00:28:36.685 --> 00:28:38.060
in the Large Hadron
Collider that

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.610
looked like Higgs', that
walked like Higgs's, that

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.610
quacked like Higgs's, and
we thought were Higgs's, OK?

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.970
And in the intervening five
years now-- almost five years--

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.060
all of the experiments have
fine-tuned those results.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.670
And they have exactly
the properties

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.550
that were predicted
of the Higgs particle.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.420
Exactly.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.670
This is an amazing
triumph, because it

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.850
means that this ridiculous
picture, which we're pushed to,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.530
is real.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.660
It means we live inside of
a cosmic superconductor.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.760
And it means that
we were driven not

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.670
just to propose that picture,
but to build this remarkably

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.190
complex machine to do it.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.880
And to me, this is
humanity at its best--

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.770
the willingness to go where
nature takes us, first of all--

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.290
independent of whether it's
the way that we want to go.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.450
But then to amass the
resources, to look at,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.050
to build this machine just
to determine why we're here--

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.800
and, of course, one of
the benefits of science,

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.130
which many people herald, and is
responsible for all your jobs--

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.000
is technology, which is great.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.220
But you know, it's a little
bit unfortunate, too,

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.340
because that means
when you have science,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.500
and people always say to
me, well, what good is it?

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.440
Does it make a better toaster?

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.731
Does it make a faster computer?

00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:55.260
What is it?

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.690
And if it doesn't
do those things,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.560
it looks like it has no utility.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.380
But, of course, we don't ask
those things about a Mozart

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:07.190
Concerto or a Picasso painting
or a Shakespeare play,

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.360
or you pick your favorite
whatever-- an Eric Clapton

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.020
song, whatever.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.550
And science is exactly the same.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.880
The real virtual science is
exactly what I said earlier--

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.580
not the technology it
produces, which is nice--

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.650
but its cultural
significance, which

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.040
is the fact that it
forces us to get out

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.050
of our myopic
picture of ourselves,

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.700
just like art, music,
and literature--

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.290
to see ourselves
in a broader sense,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.581
to get a better perspective
of our place in the cosmos.

00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.270
In this case, to be willing to
build these amazing machines.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.150
I call the Large Hadron
Collider the Gothic cathedral

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.010
of the 21st century.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.320
The Gothic cathedrals
were beautiful things,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.190
built over centuries by
thousands of artisans,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.160
using the highest
technology of the time--

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.285
they didn't know how to
make these ceilings so they

00:30:50.285 --> 00:30:52.040
wouldn't fall in
for a long time--

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.450
all working together.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.160
Well, the Large Hadron
Collider was built

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.310
by 10,000 PhD physicists--

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.730
and then many more
engineers, in fact--

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.579
from over 100 different
countries, speaking dozens

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:06.620
of different languages,
many different religions,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.560
all working together for
a single purpose, which

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560
is what science can do.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.185
It can unify people
from all cultures--

00:31:12.185 --> 00:31:14.268
it's what Google does here;
look at all the people

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:16.730
from different cultures--
working for a common purpose.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.500
That's what science does.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.120
That's humanity at its best.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.270
And the machines are
unbelievably interesting,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:23.852
complicated.

00:31:23.852 --> 00:31:25.310
This is one of the
smaller detect--

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.480
well, one of the
larger detectors.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.025
Sorry.

00:31:27.025 --> 00:31:27.900
It's not the machine.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.870
It's just a detector
in the machine.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.820
The smaller detector
out here is this

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.010
called the compact
muon solenoid,

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.930
which is not so compact.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.900
It has this same amount of
iron as the Eiffel Tower,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.860
for example.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.130
It's hard to see it.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.274
I have a better picture
of it because I'm there.

00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:45.940
When you go there,
and if you do go to--

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.273
and when the machine's down,
you can, every now and then

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:48.980
go down.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.710
And just amazing to see
the scale of everything

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.860
compared to the
scale we exist at.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.587
But the machine, you can't
have almost enough hyperbola.

00:31:57.587 --> 00:31:59.420
I have a whole chapter
in the book about it.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.820
For example, every second of
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.905
an update is generated
for more than 1,001

00:32:03.905 --> 00:32:07.061
1-terabyte hard drives, which
is relevant to all of you.

00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:09.560
It's every second we have to
process that much information--

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.360
1,000 terabytes of information
in that experiment.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.830
And that means, as
you can imagine,

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.538
that you have to filter
that information.

00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:21.020
And it's incredibly complicated,
but interesting from a computer

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.640
science point of view.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.320
But it more than just
that, for example,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.600
the tunnel that
it's in, has to be

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.030
evacuated-- that
26-kilometer-long tunnel has

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.850
to be evacuated.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.580
So its vacuum is
sparser than the vacuum

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.530
outside the International
Space Station.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.189
Every aspect of the
machine is remarkable.

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:39.730
And the fact that
we're willing to do

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.910
is to just address
this question of why

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.340
we're here, seems to me to be--

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.955
the bravery of the people who
devoted their lives to building

00:32:47.955 --> 00:32:50.330
this, and the people who
devoted their lives to coming up

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.620
with a theory is one thing.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.310
But I think part
of my book that I--

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.320
maybe that part of the
title that's the best--

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.320
is the "so far" part--

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.120
the greatest story
ever told "so far",

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.467
because this story gets
better, unlike that other story

00:33:02.467 --> 00:33:04.050
called "The Greatest
Story Ever Told",

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.414
which was written down
by Iron Age peasants

00:33:06.414 --> 00:33:08.580
who didn't know the earth
orbited the sun, and still

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.450
the same--

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.950
just as boring and untrue.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.094
This one changes.

00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:17.010
And it doesn't change
just because we like it.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.110
It changes because
every time we open

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.730
a new window on the
universe, we're surprised.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.960
And we're forced out
of our comfort zone.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.500
And you know, so
I think of this--

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.140
I happen to like
impressionist art.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.000
And I like art in general.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.310
But what I really like
of an impressionist art

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.590
is that it's beautiful
from a distance.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.100
But when you get close
up, it's really crappy.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.890
OK?

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.610
And that's science,
because great,

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.262
we've developed this
incredible model

00:33:43.262 --> 00:33:44.970
called the "standard
model" that explains

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.120
every experiment we have
ever been able to perform

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.976
in particle physics.

00:33:48.976 --> 00:33:50.850
But then, the minute
you make that discovery,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.390
there are always new questions.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.990
Why did this Higgs field
form in the early universe?

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.220
Why did it freeze in place?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.210
Why did freeze the way it did,
resulting in our existence?

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.470
All of these new questions.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.747
And the point is, this
story will get better,

00:34:03.747 --> 00:34:06.330
because the next generation of
people-- as long as we continue

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.580
to ask questions
and have the courage

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.219
to be able to look out and
try and find the answers,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.980
the story is going
to get better.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.219
And the story will get
better, and more interesting,

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:22.489
and produce a universe
that may seem more strange.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.870
And that story that
we've developed

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.820
and that we've now
validated, as I say.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:33.429
Is a story which is
terrifying at the same time

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:34.679
as it's awesome.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.292
And the consequences are
ones we may or may not like.

00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:39.000
One of the first
consequences, as I said,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.460
is that our existence
is a cosmic accident

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.590
in a real sense, just the same
as that on that windowsill.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.810
Those people who live there--

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.820
OK, that direction
is very special.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.739
And it means a lot
to that civilization,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.090
just as all of the
facets of our universe

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.020
that look like it make the
universe is designed for us,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.980
and therefore, make it seem
special, are accidents.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.800
The underlying universe is
not only not designed for us,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.601
but as I said, antithetical to
our existence, because if the W

00:35:07.601 --> 00:35:09.600
and Z particles and all
the particles and nature

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.300
were massless, as they are
at a fundamental level,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.600
if it weren't for this field
frozen in the universe, then

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.144
we wouldn't exist, because
no bound objects could exist.

00:35:18.144 --> 00:35:19.560
There wouldn't be
any people, any,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.250
stars any galaxies
anything that we could see.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.000
And these physicists on this
window, on this crystal,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.070
might, eventually discover
that you know what?

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.990
This is just an accident
of our existence.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.610
And crystals in different
directions could form.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.730
And there's nothing special
about that direction.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.650
And maybe they'll discover that
at like 4:00 in the morning

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.580
one day.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.640
But then at 6:00 in the
morning, the sun will rise.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.460
In Seattle you may not--
there's this thing called sun.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.791
And then rise, and then
melt all these crystals.

00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:50.540
OK, then their symmetry
would be restored.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.020
There would be no
preferred direction.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.728
But the unfortunate
thing is these people

00:35:53.728 --> 00:35:54.930
wouldn't exist anymore.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.230
And the interesting thing,
and maybe terrifying thing,

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.780
is that if you actually look
that the Higgs field and look

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.900
at the value it has,
then it's just teetering

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.250
on the edge of melting.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.000
OK, the Higgs particle
happens to have

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.770
a mass that's very
close to the mass

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.590
where, if you look at the
model, the field could

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.390
be unstable and
melt. And if that

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.780
were to happen in our
universe, then of course,

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.820
everything we see disappears.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.700
Now don't be don't be worried.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.690
There's still time to
buy books and stuff.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.635
But more than that, if you
actually do the calculations,

00:36:29.635 --> 00:36:30.510
it's probably stable.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.084
But even if it's unstable,
if you work out the frame

00:36:33.084 --> 00:36:35.250
over which it might decay,
it's not a million years,

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.540
not a billion years,
not a trillion years,

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.998
not even a trillion
trillion years.

00:36:37.998 --> 00:36:41.050
So this is a long process
if it's going to end.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.630
But if it does,
the universe will

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.310
revert to this symmetric,
beautiful form.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.310
But there'd be no life.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.810
So even this beautiful
universe that

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.630
looks like it's designed
for us will disappear.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.330
And well, there certainly
would be no life like we see.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.740
And I want to just end up
with some notes about how

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.590
this picture relates to this
sort of history of science

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:09.160
in a real way, because
we are evolutionarily

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.740
evolved to look for design.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.570
We always look for designs.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.350
Our eyes pick it up very well.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.050
And many of you are
talented looking

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.030
for design, which is probably
why you're where you're here.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.860
OK, but that design may
not really be there.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.380
And we have to second-guess
ourselves one of the things

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.505
that Feynman really said,
which is quite important,

00:37:28.505 --> 00:37:31.076
is the easiest person
to fool is yourself,

00:37:31.076 --> 00:37:32.200
because you like something.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.910
Or you want it to be that case.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.960
And we all want design.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.240
We can think of human
things that are developed,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.740
like Christmas ornaments.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.790
They're clearly designed.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.831
But, of course, those
aren't Christmas ornaments.

00:37:41.831 --> 00:37:43.540
Those are snowflakes
that you just

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.080
give me a polar molecule and
laws of chemistry and physics,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.702
and I'll produce these beautiful
things without any design.

00:37:49.702 --> 00:37:51.910
But you might say, well,
what about human structures,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:57.190
like the Googleplex
or this building?

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.080
My favorite is the
Buckminster Fuller domes

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.940
because when I was
growing up, every hippie

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.390
had one and lived in them
and did neat things in them.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.920
And there are evidence of a
very interesting intellect,

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.250
Buckminster Fuller, who
was a really exciting guy--

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.230
crazy but interesting.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.764
Well, just take soot.

00:38:15.764 --> 00:38:17.680
Take soot-- if you take
soot, you'll find out,

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.800
in the soot are molecules
called carbon 60,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.880
we now call
Buckminsterfullerene, which

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.730
are beautiful geodesic-- domes.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.520
And there's nothing
less-designed that soot.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.010
So we have to be careful when
we look for design in nature.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.440
The first real example of
this was from one, of course,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.600
of the greatest scientists
of all time, Charles Darwin.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.150
And if you haven't read
the "Origin of Species"

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.500
the last paragraph of
it is really beautiful,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.955
one of the most beautiful lines
in any science book ever were.

00:38:45.955 --> 00:38:48.580
"There is grandeur in this view
of life with its several powers

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.060
having been originally breathed
into a few forms or into one.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.400
And that whilst this
planet has gone cycling on,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.410
according to the
fixed law of gravity,

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.720
from so simple a
beginning, endless forms

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.580
most beautiful
and most wonderful

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.100
have been and are
being evolved."

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.600
Now, this was a
beautiful discussion

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.120
of how the complexity and
diversity of life on Earth,

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.690
which appears to be designed,
could arise naturally

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.580
from a simple beginnings
by natural selection

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.510
and evolution.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.170
And that design-- like the fact
that bees could find flowers--

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:17.796
was not design.

00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:19.961
It was that they couldn't
see the colors of flowers,

00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:21.050
they wouldn't reproduce.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.550
And it could be understood from
much more simple principles.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.310
And you could get incredible
complexity from simplicity.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.770
This same paragraph
could be used

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.656
to describe the universe that
we physicists are talking about.

00:39:32.656 --> 00:39:34.780
From so simple beginnings
with the forces of nature

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.850
may have been unified
in a simple way,

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.477
we, as the universe
evolved, produce structures,

00:39:40.477 --> 00:39:42.310
like all the stars and
galaxies, and people,

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:46.900
and all the structures we see
today, by a simple process.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.730
And that universe is no more
designed for us than life is.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.360
That, we're carrying on that
Darwinian process, which

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.810
for many people is disturbing,
because they want the universe

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.190
to be designed for them.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.750
It's comforting.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.960
But the universe doesn't
give a damn what we want.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.550
And we have to learn that
you know the universe is

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.540
made terrifying.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.137
But it's also
incredibly awesome,

00:40:12.137 --> 00:40:13.970
and that universe that
isn't designed for us

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.630
can actually be
more interesting.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.650
It can be one in which our
lives are more precious,

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.922
because the only purpose we
have is the purpose we make.

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.380
But you know,
scientists as I said,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.660
individual scientists are
products of their time.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.190
So in a letter to
Joseph Hooker, he

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.514
said it's mere rubbish
thinking at present

00:40:32.514 --> 00:40:34.180
of the origin of life,
one might as well

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.550
think of the origin of matter.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.580
And in 1863, it was rubbish to
think of the origins of matter.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.760
But now I get paid to do
it because the story has

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.110
gotten better.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.480
The story has gotten
better because we continue

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.870
to push the boundaries in our
thinking, but more equally

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.480
important, in our looking out.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.815
We continue to be willing to
build experiments, and look

00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:58.070
out, and be willing to
change our perspective,

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.450
even if it takes us in a
direction we don't want to go.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.640
And I want to end
by, in some sense,

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.360
by saying I'm worried about
the future at the present.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.060
In the current
budget, for example,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.210
proposed by the president, the
entire field I talked about--

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.335
particle physics--

00:41:14.335 --> 00:41:16.720
the support for that is
being reduced by 20%--

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.250
$900 million.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.690
But more importantly,
the, agency

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.540
that supports it which is the
Department of Energy, which

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.270
most people don't realize
is the chief founder

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.000
of all physical
science in our country,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.100
not just energy research
but all physical science

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.232
in our country, is
being cut by 20%.

00:41:33.232 --> 00:41:35.690
At the same time, the National
Endowment for the Humanities

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.190
is being cut completely, the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.290
cut completely, the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.147
cut completely, the Institute
of Museums and Libraries,

00:41:45.147 --> 00:41:47.480
which supports museums and
libraries around the country,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.550
cut completely.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.540
You add all that up, and you
get $1.82 billion savings

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.890
in our budget.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.560
In the same budget,
proposed a $2 billion

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.570
line item, which is
the first installment

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.840
of a wall with Mexico.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.710
OK, so you've got
this wall that's

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.930
going to protect us from
hoards that are unknown,

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.650
at the same time, killing all
of the support for culture,

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.480
and largely the
support for science.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.150
And the way to picture
that was actually, to me,

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.830
expressed best by
Robert Wilson, who

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.260
was the first director of the
Fermi National Accelerator

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.162
Laboratory, the first big--

00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:21.620
not the first big--
but the biggest

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.710
accelerator in the world until
the Large Hadron Collider

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.720
was built.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.520
And in 1960s, he was
called before Congress

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.740
and asked the
question, will it aid

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.330
in the defense of the nation?

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.950
And here was his response.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.209
No sir, I don't believe so.

00:42:35.209 --> 00:42:37.250
It only has to do with
the respect with which you

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.800
regard one another, the degree
of men, our love of culture.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.560
It has to do with,
are we good painters,

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.270
sculptors, great poets?

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.910
I mean, all the things we
really venerate in our country

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.290
and are patriotic about--

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.690
it has nothing to do
directly with defending

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.260
our country except to
make it worth defending.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.960
And that is a
beautiful statement,

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.060
and is particularly
poignant today,

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.820
because we risk getting
rid of everything

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.520
that makes this country
worth defending in an effort

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.030
to apparently defend it.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.640
What makes America
great, if anything does,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.540
is the contributions it will
make, and the people in it

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.110
will make to the legacy the
future of our children--

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.990
the perspectives of the
world, our understanding,

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.675
the new ideas we develop.

00:43:22.675 --> 00:43:24.800
That's why people, as you
can see from here, that's

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.470
why people come here from around
the world, because there's

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.630
some benefit, because
the contributions we

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.530
make for the future--

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.040
if we get rid of all
that infrastructure just

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.770
to defend ourselves,
the greatest story

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.710
ever told will not continue
being great, at least not here.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.564
And so I want to end
with two quotes--

00:43:39.564 --> 00:43:40.980
one from the
beginning of my book,

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.940
which is a famous
quote from Virgil.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.452
"These are the tears of things.

00:43:45.452 --> 00:43:47.660
And the stuff of our mortality
cuts us to the heart."

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.243
It's from the beginning
of the Aeneid.

00:43:49.243 --> 00:43:50.874
I remember learning
that in Latin,

00:43:50.874 --> 00:43:52.040
because I grew up in Canada.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.050
And I was educated.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:59.300
But the next line, which
is not so well-known,

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.490
but I point out at
the end of the book,

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.420
is "Release your fear."

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.970
And that's the point.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.950
Only if we release our
fear of the unknown,

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.365
of others, of a universe
that may or may not

00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:11.990
be the universe we
like-- only if we're

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.180
willing to go into
the unknown will

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.460
this greatest story
continue to get better.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.850
And we may live in a universe
that apparently has no purpose,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.620
apparently isn't
designed for us,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.120
and apparently may be
miserable in the future.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.380
But that's OK, because
we are fortunate--

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.800
more fortunate to have evolved
this consciousness that

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.580
allows us to ask these questions
for the short time we are here.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.781
And so we should enjoy our
brief moment in the sun.

00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:37.280
Thank you.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.600
AUDIENCE: So you made an
analogy with the arts.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.060
I think the obvious
rebuttal there

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.730
is that it's easy
for people-- anybody

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.880
to see the value in the arts.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.730
It's sort of directly
titillating the senses.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.250
You don't have to have to
gone through music school

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.629
to appreciate Bach.

00:45:05.629 --> 00:45:07.670
LAWRENCE KRAUSS: You don't
have to be a scientist

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.545
to look at the Hubble
Space Telescope picture

00:45:09.545 --> 00:45:11.360
and see it's amazing.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.220
I mean, the point is
that, you know what?

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.720
If you do go to
music school, you'll

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.370
appreciate Bach a lot more.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.650
But you can appreciate Bach
just by listening to it.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.680
But the wonders of the
universe are easily

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.500
appreciated by everyone,
especially children.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.375
We beat it out of them.

00:45:26.375 --> 00:45:29.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the Higgs
particle, for instance.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:31.290
That's a lot of
explaining to get to that.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.430
LAWRENCE KRAUSS: Yeah,
that's why I wrote a book.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.279
But the point is, you
know, not everyone

00:45:36.279 --> 00:45:37.820
has to understand
the Higgs particle.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.950
But it's there for those
who want to get there.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.408
Just like it's there for those
who want to pick up a guitar

00:45:42.408 --> 00:45:43.454
and learn how to play it.

00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:45.620
But you don't have to
understand the Higgs particle.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.960
What's really neat is you can--

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.130
anyone can understand the
basic world around them

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.000
if we provide them the
opportunity, and more

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.260
interestingly--

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.910
and this is really important--

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.110
if we teach science as
it's supposed to be taught,

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:00.450
which is not a bunch of facts.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.700
That's why we live in this
world of alternative facts,

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.000
because people in school are
taught that almost all subjects

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.230
are just a bunch of facts.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.080
Science is a process
for discovering facts.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.480
And that's the process
that anyone can learn.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.040
And we and we damn
well better start

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.139
teaching it, because of
Google in particular.

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:19.680
When I was growing up, that was
the place to get information.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:23.310
But because of Google, I can
get more information from this.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.920
But I get also more
misinformation.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.460
And the only way I can tell
the difference is science,

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.480
is skeptical inquiry, reliance
on a empirical evidence,

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.790
testing my ideas,
checking many sources.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:40.410
And so that's the thing that
really is the greatest legacy

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.160
of science, is that process.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.950
And that's the
thing we need most--

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.484
not just for the
enjoyment of looking out

00:46:46.484 --> 00:46:48.900
at a Hubble Space Telescope
picture and getting a kick out

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.590
of it.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.374
I mean, everyone has
had "aha" experiences.

00:46:52.374 --> 00:46:54.790
When I used to work at science
museums when I was younger,

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.727
they're like orgasmic.

00:46:55.727 --> 00:46:57.810
We called them aha
experiences-- when you suddenly

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:58.860
see something in a new way.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.984
And it happens to everyone.

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:02.100
And there's lots of
science that we can do.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.050
But more importantly,
those tools

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.490
are necessary if you want to--

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.400
if we want to have an informed
electorate who can actually

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.640
distinguish policies that are
related to empirical reality

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.050
from policies that aren't.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.890
So there's actually an
imperative as well as a joy.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:21.720
But I agree with you that at
least the perception among

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.880
the public is that you
can enjoy music, art,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.577
literature with a much
lower impedance barrier--

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:27.660
as we call it in physics--

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.620
much lower wall.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.610
It seems to take
a little bit more.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.215
But I do think that's a
product of our school systems.

00:47:33.215 --> 00:47:34.740
AUDIENCE: It is definitely
worth it, trying to--

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.115
LAWRENCE KRAUSS:
Yeah but I mean,

00:47:36.115 --> 00:47:38.430
I think if we teach kids
not answers, but questions--

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.810
how to ask questions--

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.810
we're all wired to want
to discover the answers.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.340
And it's OK to not--

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.795
I mean, the information is
irrelevant in the school.

00:47:46.795 --> 00:47:48.420
Most of what you
learn in high school--

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.294
well, sure reading,
writing, and arithmetic--

00:47:50.294 --> 00:47:53.070
but beyond that, most of
what you learn as an adult

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.470
is going to be way beyond
what you learn in school.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.110
Most of the physics
I do as a scientist,

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.240
I learned after my PhD.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.910
And so those tools
are important.

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.700
But the joy is there for
everyone at different levels.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.330
And I think what we don't do
well enough is tell people,

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.180
it's just amazing how
you can enjoy music

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.770
without being a musician.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.410
You don't have to-- but
the common sense view is,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.170
you cannot enjoy science unless
you're a technical person.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.330
And we have to get over
that, in my opinion.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.579
AUDIENCE: I had a small
question about your discussion

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:24.960
of Berkeley earlier.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.770
I was wondering what you
think about scientists

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.740
kind of believing in the
theories they're working on

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.270
without proof to
drive it forward.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.770
LAWRENCE KRAUSS:
Well, they have to.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:37.722
I mean some-- science
isn't based on faith.

00:48:37.722 --> 00:48:39.930
But if you're going to spend
20 years of life working

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.810
on something, you've got to
have a I-- wouldn't call it

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:44.310
a belief.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.684
But you'd have to
say to yourself

00:48:45.684 --> 00:48:49.230
that there's something tells you
it strongly likely to be true.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.116
And you can be completely wrong.

00:48:51.116 --> 00:48:52.740
But the great thing
that differentiates

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.780
that from religion,
let's say, is

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.270
that if you're a scientist,
in the end, if is shown

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.060
to be wrong, you throw it out
like yesterday's newspaper,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.024
even if you spent 20
years or life on it.

00:49:02.024 --> 00:49:02.940
That's the difference.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.630
But certainly, you cannot work--

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.160
the builders of the Large Hadron
Collider or the developers

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.660
of the standard model couldn't
have done what they've done--

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.202
or even the string
theorists now--

00:49:12.202 --> 00:49:13.660
the people that my
colleagues who--

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.170
I have students of mine who are
well-known string theorists,

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:16.874
you know.

00:49:16.874 --> 00:49:18.790
I just wouldn't want my
daughter to marry one.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.560
But they have a good reason
for doing what they're doing.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.750
And the hope is that
somehow through make contact

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:28.840
with reality.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.890
But if it won't, you
can be darn sure--

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.030
and it's already
happening in some sense--

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:34.860
you saw when the
Higgs was discovered

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.890
that lots of string theorists
went in and just jumped ship,

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:41.100
because suddenly, there was new
particle physics to look at.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.790
So yeah, we all have to
have that kind of faith.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:48.360
But the difference is
that the faith in science

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.310
is eminently shakeable.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.060
The wonderful thing is
that it is not ironclad.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.190
And that's supposed to be
the great virtue of faith

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.210
is that you don't give it up.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.918
But in science, the
great virtue of faith

00:49:58.918 --> 00:50:04.470
is that it has no utility
beyond its utility.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.710
OK, good.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:06.460
OK, I guess I'll.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.270
Thank you.
