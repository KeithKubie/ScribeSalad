00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.910
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.912
And sadly, we’re nearing the end of this
course.

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:10.370
We’ve covered a LOT of topics.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.400
From probability, to t-tests, to Machine Learning
to Bayesian statistics.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.119
Today, we’re going to go more “Real World.”

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.370
We’re going to talk about how statistics
is used in the courtroom to make...pretty

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.370
important...decisions.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.109
In particular, we’re going to look at 3
individuals whose lives changed by the use

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.880
of statistics: Alfred Dreyfus, Sally Clark,
and Jonathan Dorfman.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:40.000
INTRO

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.760
In 1894, a political scandal began in France
that would last until 1906 when Alfred Dreyfus--a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.370
Jewish Officer in the French army--was convicted
of treason.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.600
His conviction hinged on an unsigned letter--referred
to as the bordereau.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.580
The letter offered French military secrets
for sale, and the courts decided that it was

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.370
Dreyfus who had written it.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.860
Dreyfus was convicted, and for a time, sent
to live in a prison cell at Devil’s Island.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.810
Which is about as pleasant as the name suggests.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.899
This story is complicated.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.140
Many books have been written about it.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.030
But we’ll focus in particular on a handwriting
analysis done by Alphonse Bertillon--the founder

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.700
of the first crime laboratory for police in
France.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
Bertillon alleged that Dreyfus purposely made
the bordereau look like a forgery of his own

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.520
handwriting.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.840
That way, if he ever got caught, he could
claim someone had tried to frame him.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.679
Bertillon theorized that Dreyfus created the
bordereau by tracing words and letters from

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.420
various sources, including one in his own
handwriting and his families’ handwriting.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.030
That would make the document look more like
an forgery than something he’d actually

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.030
written.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.979
One of the words Bertillon believed got traced
over and over was “intérêt” in Dreyfus’s

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.179
brother’s handwriting.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.799
He’d found a letter written by the brother
and thought that the word in that letter looked

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.670
similar to some words in the bordereau.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.350
The book Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used
and Abused in the Courtroom breaks down his

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.659
process from here.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.389
“Intérêt” contains five of the most
commonly used letters in the French language

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.200
-- e, n, r, i, and t.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.870
So it would have been a logical one to pick
for repeated tracing.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.010
Bertillon created a key to test his theory.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.090
He traced “intérêt” in the brother’s
handwriting over and over with no spaces on

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.239
a line.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.049
This is how he imagined Dreyfus would have
created a key of his own:

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.000
Conveniently, the bordereau was slightly transparent,
so Bertillon could place his key underneath

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.970
it, then look for places where letters overlapped.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.480
And yes, there was some overlap, but the majority
of letters didn’t.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.250
Then, he moved his key over a bit and saw
some new overlaps.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.860
(And again, a lot of non-overlap).

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.110
But, he got excited by the overlapping letters
that he HAD seen, so he decided to make two

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.160
keys and put them both underneath the bordereau
with a little distance between them.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.440
Then he counted up how many times the letters
e,n,r, and t overlapped.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.840
And Bertillon concluded that the letters lined
up MUCH more than should be expected by chance.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.129
Which...makes some sense.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.239
I mean he had two keys.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.409
Bertillon used the frequencies of these letters
in the bordereau to come up with the expected

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.140
frequencies of the overlaps.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.430
So, the bordereau contained about 800 letters
and there were about 60 r’s.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.700
If his key was just a bunch of R's, then every
r in the bordereau would line up with an r

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700
on the key.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.340
But since only 1 out of 7 letters in the key
were r’s, he expected 1 out of every 7 R's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.680
in the bordereau to overlap with the key by
chance.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.700
So, he expected the letter r to line up 9
times.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.280
But it actually lined up 20 times.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.150
All the other letters--with the exception
of ê--matched up more times than he expected.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.680
But this logic was suspect.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.050
A group of famous French mathematicians was
asked to inspect Bertillon’s “analysis.”

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.540
It didn’t hold up.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.700
They went as far as to call it “completely
unfortunate”...which is about as mean as

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.459
French mathematicians got back then.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.640
The expected probabilities that Bertillon
found may have been relatively accurate--but

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.319
only when he overlapped the key and the bordereau
ONE time.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.099
Bertillon had overlapped them TWICE.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.760
Which means he counted the overlapping letters
BOTH in the regular position (red) AND the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.980
offset position (green).

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.769
And it was the rebuttal by Three French mathematicians
helped finally free Dreyfus.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.299
Our next story starts in England in 1996 when
Sally Clark’s firstborn son Christopher

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.810
had the sniffles.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.660
Doctors told Sally that it was a cold.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.430
But later that month, she found Christopher
in distress and called an ambulance.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.430
He later died.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.690
In 1998, Sally’s second son, Harry, died
in a similar way.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.620
A doctor’s examination of Harry found things
that could be indicative of abuse, such as

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.620
retinal hemorrhaging.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.449
So, an investigation was conducted.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.970
Steve and Sally Clark were arrested for murdering
their sons, but Steve was exonerated.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.210
During the trial, Dr. Roy Meadow, a well respected
pediatrician, said the probability that one

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.780
of Sally’s children would die from Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS, was 1 in 8,543.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.031
He then made an incredibly consequential probability
mistake by declaring that the probability

00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:11.960
of TWO of these deaths happening in the same
family was 1 in 73 million.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.121
Sally’s lawyer confronted Dr. Meadow on
whether the probability of Harry’s death

00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:24.000
was still 1 in 8,543, even though his brother
had earlier died with the same diagnosis.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.610
Essentially, he was asking whether these two
events were independent or if having one SIDS

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.410
related death in a family increases the probability
of having another.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.220
And he was right to ask.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.220
SIDS-related deaths in a family may not be
independent of each other.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.320
We don’t know the cause of SIDS, but if
it’s even in part genetic or environmental,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.680
it could be possible for babies in the same
family to have similar risks.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.110
If Meadow had done the calculation with this
in mind, he would have most likely come to

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.620
a number MUCH lower than 1 in 73 million.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.949
But that is not the only statistics error
that affected the Clark trial.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.950
Whether the lawyers suggested it or the jury
assumed it, the unspoken assumption was that

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.850
there was only one other option: Murder.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.970
And that since SIDS was so unlikely, murder

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.210
MUST be more likely.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.970
The jury sentenced Clark to life in prison
for murdering her sons.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.910
But there was another possibility...the deaths
could have been caused by naturally occurring

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.150
disease or circumstances.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.389
That was found to be the case in Harry’s
death.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.580
In 2003, Clark’s conviction was overturned
by a Court of Appeal because Harry’s medical

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.050
records indicated that he could have been
suffering from a Staph infection, which wasn’t

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.039
disclosed by a pathologist during the original
trial.

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.139
When we do statistics, we often only consider
one, or possibly two different hypotheses.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.460
But it’s important to remember that there
are other OPTIONS out there.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.539
When possible, we should try to consider those
other options.

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.379
Otherwise, we can accidentally commit this
Prosecutor’s fallacy, which incorrectly

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:00.860
claims that since the evidence found is SO
unusual or unlikely, that the jury could assume

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.949
that the accused defendant isn’t innocent.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:09.009
And secondly, the fact that one hypothesis
is unlikely does not mean that another must

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.370
be more likely.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.970
Fast forward to 2011, a student at the University
of California, San Diego, Jonathan Dorfman,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.940
was accused of cheating on a midterm by his
Chemistry professor.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.800
After two Academic Integrity Review Board
hearings, Dorfman was expelled from UCSD,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.169
because he had a previous incident on his
record.

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.720
He then filed a lawsuit against the school.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.190
After the midterm, the professor had noticed
that Dorfman had changed the Test Version

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.669
on his answer sheet.

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.199
There were four versions of the test -- A,
B, C, and D. Students were told that if their

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:46.150
test version wasn’t the same as the letter
on their answer sheet, they should tell their

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.150
test proctor.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.139
Dorfman HAD changed the letter on his answer
sheet from D

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:54.760
to A. But, he said that he arrived late, so
he didn’t hear those instructions.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.740
He just saw that his test booklet had a different
version than his answer sheet, and changed

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.220
the answer sheet to match the test.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.560
After looking at all the exams, the professor
also noticed that Dorfman’s test matched

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.720
another student--they called them Student
X--who had test version A, the same one Dorfman

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.130
claimed to have.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.020
24 of the 26 answers matched between the two
exams.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.439
8 of the 10 incorrectly answered questions,
and all 16 of the correct ones.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:26.080
The professor of the class took this as further
proof that Dorfman was cheating, and even

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.409
went as far as to get a statistician to say
that the probability of those same eight wrong

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:35.539
answers happening by chance was a billion
to one.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.821
Though the court documents do not reveal the
exact math that the statistician used, it

00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:45.220
seems possible that they, like Dr. Meadow
in Sally Clark’s case, probably assumed

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.600
independence when no such assumption should
be made.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.190
The wrong answers that students choose aren’t
always totally random.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.000
On multiple choice tests, many times there’s
one answer that looks good, even if it’s

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.470
slightly inaccurate.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.820
And since these students were all taking the
same course, and reading the same textbook,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.240
their incorrect answers aren’t independent
of each other.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.890
Their misconceptions of the material were
VERY likely to be dependent on their learning

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.000
environment and therefore related.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.930
Dorfman’s lawyer displayed this, during
the second review board hearing, by showing

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:23.630
44 of the 618 students who took this test
(in all its versions) had 23-25 answers matching

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.630
Dorfman’s.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.510
So this one in a billion stat that was presented
to the court can be misleading.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.520
To most people, the stat seems believable
at first glance.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.790
And much of the University’s initial argument
relied on it.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:41.220
So much so, that they refused to identify
Student X--off of whom Dorfman allegedly cheated.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.470
The evidence, they claimed, was so strong
that further information about Student X wasn’t

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.560
required for the case to move forward.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.110
The court determined that by not identifying
Student X, the university had given Dorfman

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.130
an unfair disadvantage in his hearings.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.620
By not showing who Student X was there was
no way to prove that they weren’t cooperating

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.310
or that they weren’t sitting next to each
other.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.130
More information about Student X would allow
us to update our 1 in a billion chance with

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.950
new information, much like we update beliefs
in Bayesian Statistics.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.810
Taken alone, the probabilities can be misleading.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:19.410
The Court ruled in favor of Dorman, saying
that if UCSD ever wanted to bring more charges

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.190
against him, that they’d need to find Student
X.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.030
Many cases are influenced by poor probability
calculations.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:32.029
Understanding basic rules about probability
and statistics, and being skeptical of the

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:36.510
probabilities you may hear can have a huge
impact on whether or not you come to the right

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.660
conclusions.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.100
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time.
