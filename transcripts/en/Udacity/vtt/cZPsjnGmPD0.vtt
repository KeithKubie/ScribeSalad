00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; So far in this lesson we've discussed six different

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.230
professions that use genetic information for their day to day lives.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.810
&gt;&gt; But we've only scratched the surface, there

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.625
are a ton of other fields that use genetic

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.950
information; for example, forensic scientists and police departments use

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.440
it a lot. Even drug researchers like pharmaceutical companies.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.590
&gt;&gt; And even science illustrators or science journalists need to have a firm

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.880
understanding of science and genetics. To write

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.660
and represent this information to the public.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Pretty much any clinical practitioner

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.610
would need to know something about genetics.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.290
&gt;&gt; Now, because we don't have the time to

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.550
cover all these other different kinds of jobs as

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.900
well in this lesson or this course, I'd like

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.360
to direct your attention to a website from the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.500
NHGRI. The National Human Genome Research Institute. That collects

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.710
all kinds of resources and information that you can

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.160
use to find out all the careers out there

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.390
that you can apply your new found genetic knowledge.
