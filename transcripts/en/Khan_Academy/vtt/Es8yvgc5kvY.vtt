00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.980
First, consider the
expression for take

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.515
the quantity of negative
4 times x and add 9.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:09.890
So let's see,
we're going to take

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.980
the quantity of
negative 4 times x.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.764
Well, negative 4 times x is
just going to be negative 4x.

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:18.180
And then they say--
so we're going

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.555
to take that quantity, that's
this thing right over here,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.400
and then they say add 9.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.120
So let's add 9 to it, so
that's this first sentence.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.350
Take the quantity of
negative 4 times x and add 9.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.630
That's this expression
right over here.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.229
Now select the
answer that matches

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.480
the following-- the sum of 4
and the product of negative 9

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.817
and that expression.

00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:38.900
So let's think about this.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.040
The sum of 4, so
we're going to take 4

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.360
and we're going to add it to the
product-- we're going to add it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.820
to-- I'm running out of colors.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.536
Maybe I will do this
in this-- let' see.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:53.970
I've already used blue and
I've already used orange.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.480
I'll use green.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.200
So we're going to take
that 4, the sum of 4

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.020
and the product of negative
9 and that expression.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.050
So we're going to add 4
to the product-- we're

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.450
going to multiply negative 9
times this expression right up

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.250
here.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.490
So it's negative 9
times negative 4x,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.340
negative 4x plus 9.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.230
Now let's see if any
of these actually

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.980
match what I just
wrote right over here.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.879
So let's see, this one is 4.

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:27.670
Here we're taking a 4
and we're multiplying

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300
it times negative
4x minus 9, and then

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.600
we're subtracting that, so
this seems very different,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.410
so I'll scratch that one out.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.970
Let's see.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.910
This has positive 9 times
negative 4x plus 9 plus 4,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.910
so this is very close,
but this says positive 9,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.050
this says negative 9, so
I'll cross out one out.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.510
This one has 4 times 9x plus 4.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.730
Well, no, we have
negative 4x plus 9,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.280
this is different
in multiple ways,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.150
and they're multiplying it
by 4 instead of negative 9.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.570
This one, let's see, we have
a negative 9 being multiplied

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.550
by negative 4x plus 9,
and then we are adding 4.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.560
So all you have to do to
go from this expression

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.050
to this expression, instead
of adding the 4 there,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.630
you just add the 4
here, and then these two

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.740
are identical expressions.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.990
So we will go with this
one right over here.
