00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Your mental health is something that is constantly changing, right?

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.518
I mean, no matter what state you're in - whether that's healthy and calm or anxious and chaotic -  it always passes.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.150
It's always in flux.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.700
And for the most part, my usual state is this very thin ice of contentment concealing an iceberg of anxiety and depression.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.020
Oh! Hey, do you mind if we talk later?
- Oh, yeah, of course!
- Okay, great.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.460
Oh my god, what do they want to talk about?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.840
What could it possibly be?!

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.500
Oh my god, there's so much TIME left in the day until it's later! [screams]

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.240
I've been in therapy for the past decade,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.320
on antidepressants, off antidepressants,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.040
and just fully immersed in the world of mental health for quite some time.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
My highs are super high
- Weeeeee -

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.580
but my lows are awfully low -

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.460
[Sudden piano sounds]
[Creepy voice:] DO IT! 
[Exhales]

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.640
And though I've immersed myself in article after article, and book after book, and session after session,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.640
I always come back to three

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.440
fundamentals of battling mental illness.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.740
And I want to preface this with the fact that though they are very stupidly simple and obvious,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.620
actually implementing them consistently in your real life and finding balance can be one of the hardest things to do.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.160
Probably because taking care of yourself isn't that sexy.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.000
Incorporating healthy habits as a routine is yes, very boring, monotonous, and doesn't really immediately resonate

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.850
cuz there's no way to judge your results,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.580
But! They do work. Trust the process,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.540
make them routine, and you'll find that your emotional and mental well-being are a thousand times better off for when the lows hit.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080
[violin music]

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
[gentle chiming]

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.980
Ugh

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.060
Ah! Glass number six...

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.740
[ding]
[ding]

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Aaaah! [exhausted]

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.980
Wow that script is awful and you're a terrible writer. 
- Um, excuse me. What did you just say to my friend?

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.229
-You heard me. I said THAT script is horrible, and you're a terrible writer, and ya both should give up. 
-Hey girl,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.640
I know that I'm you, and she's you, and you're also technically you, but I'm here to stick up for us because

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.280
everything is a process and I don't want us to give up.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.840
Also, wow, you can be a total bitch and you need to leave you alone.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300
Oh, thank god! That was so boring.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.440
And how does that make you feel?
- Yes

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.640
Uh, what? 
- Feelings, all the feelings. You asked like, how does that make me feel and I'm saying yeah.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.780
All -- all, just all of them. At once.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.870
Huh? 
- And look, of course

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.800
there will be days where you decide to party late, or you have an entire bag of Cool Ranch Doritos to yourself,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.760
or you skip meditation because work got too crazy. That is fine!

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.580
The important thing is that consistently having a routine that involves healthy habits and living a lifestyle in balance and moderation.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.440
Look, I've battled pretty intense depression and anxiety my entire life and it's only in the last few years that I've really been able to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.780
incorporate and do the work of the "simple advice" that professionals have been touting for so long. Because part of you is like, "Wait,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.519
no, it can't be that simple!" and then you try it and you're like, "Okay, yeah,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.860
wow, I guess it's simple, but it's not necessarily easy to maintain by any means."

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.860
And for those of you struggling with mental illness,

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.680
which I'm sure is, like, a lot of us,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.900
I want you to know this is an individual journey. What works for one person is not gonna work for another,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.560
but these very unsexy fundamentals are great guidelines and foundations to build your routine off of.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.940
Some people need meds, some people don't. Some people need to talk shit out with their friends all night, whereas some people need to process internally.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.220
Listen to yourself, take care of yourself, and be well.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.120
I am so honored to be partnering with BetterHelp for today's video. As you guys know,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.440
mental health awareness is one of the advocacies I very strongly believe in because of my history.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.340
So, when I do get the opportunity to work with people who align with my passion for it,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.269
it just feels like such a great fit.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.220
So, BetterHelp's mission is to provide anyone facing life challenges with easy, discreet, professional, convenient

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.900
and affordable access to professional counseling from a licensed therapist.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.300
Since I've been traveling a lot this year,

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.709
I've had the opportunity to receive

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.200
counseling from all over the world,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.828
and I can tell you that it has been so convenient and helpful for the busy

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.839
but sometimes overwhelming lifestyle that I lead.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.440
So when you sign up for BetterHelp,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.220
you first fill out a mental health questionnaire, as well as this comment section where you can talk about

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.920
what issues you want to work on and what's important for you.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.720
And then they take all of this information and they match you with a therapist.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.120
Scheduling is super easy and flexible,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.579
which is awesome for me because production is always in flux,

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.400
and then you work with someone one-on-one, on the phone or through messaging.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.418
You pay one low flat fee for unlimited counseling,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.920
which is awesome because - those of you not in therapy,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.300
traditionally a one-on-one session can cost anywhere between 200 to 250 bucks.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.860
And if you have a ton of anxiety like me and you want to run every possible life situation with your therapist

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.169
before dealing with that confrontation, you can really use the constant professional help.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.300
You can go to betterhelp.com/akana to sign up today.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.900
And I know mental health can be quite the journey, but it is such an important one.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.640
I'm Anna Akana. Stay awesome, Gotham.
