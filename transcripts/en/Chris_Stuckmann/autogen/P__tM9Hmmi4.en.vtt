at the start of this film I'm thinking

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
at the start of this film I'm thinking
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.710
at the start of this film I'm thinking
that Batman is going to be the only

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
that Batman is going to be the only
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.710
that Batman is going to be the only
person in Gotham City who stands up to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
person in Gotham City who stands up to
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.690
person in Gotham City who stands up to
Bane and the whole city is going to be

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
