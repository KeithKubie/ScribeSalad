00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.409
Hi, I’m Emily Graslie and welcome to Crash
Course Big History.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.980
Today we’ll talk about why something as
distant as cosmology and stellar chemistry

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.110
is deeply intertwined with humanity: our past,
present, and future.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.520
When we start the grand narrative of thirteen
point eight billion years, our minds are blown

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.699
by the incomprehensible mysteries of the Big
Bang and the vast size of our Universe.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.109
We then spend some time looking at the birth
of the chemical elements in stars.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.109
It is very tempting, sometimes, to look at
this stellar chemistry and think, “alright,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.009
alright, when do we get to the dinosaurs?”

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.600
Or, “when do we ditch all this science stuff
and get to humanity?”

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.480
But before we get there, to illustrate just
how important chemistry is to the grand narrative

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.400
I’m going to pick just one of the elements
from the periodic table to show you just how

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.330
crucial “star stuff” is.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.220
Get ready for a “little” big history.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:56.050
This is the story of our intrepid hero, Carbon.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.070
The Universe had begun with a bang.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.390
About 3 minutes later, the first protons and
neutrons formed into the nuclei of hydrogen

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.670
and helium, our two lightest elements, effectively
Carbon’s mother and father.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.859
Then, the Universe cooled down too quickly
for new elements, other than slight traces,

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:11.969
to form.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.649
That said, the Universe was still an oppressive,
murky sea of radiation from which not even

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.450
light could escape.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560
Hydrogen and helium nuclei couldn’t even
become fully fledged atoms.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.310
Let’s fast forward about three hundred eighty
thousand years, and go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.460
(1) The universe cooled down enough for the
young hydrogen and helium nuclei to capture

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.619
electrons and become fully fledged atoms.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.740
(2) Hydrogen and helium became the dominant
forms of matter in the Universe.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
(3) But for now they were wispy gases, airheads
without much structure or complexity.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.299
(1) Fast forward again, about 100 million
years.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.770
Slight inequalities in the distribution of
hydrogen and helium allowed them to clump

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.770
together.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.770
Gravity sucked more in.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.749
And more, and more, until there was so much
pressure that the first stars were born.

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:56.259
(2) The hydrogen and helium inside them were
squeezed together so tightly they fused to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.880
create lithium, then beryllium, boron, and,
finally, Carbon was born.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.950
More stars created Carbon, along with heavier
brothers and sisters all the way up to iron.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.689
As the first stars began to run out of fuel,
they exploded.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.849
Carbon and its siblings were scattered out
into the void.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.500
All of the heavier elements, like gold and
uranium, were created.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.260
About six hundred million years after the
Big Bang, Carbon and its siblings, along with

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.189
millions of stars had grouped together into
a very young Milky Way.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.459
Over the next 3 billion years, more stars
joined the party in a series of galactic mergers,

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.930
creating the swirling cosmic island we call
home.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.360
Then about 5 billion years ago, about a light
year or so away, a giant star collapsed into

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.379
yet another supernova, peppering our neighborhood
with more Carbon and other elements and triggering

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.620
the formation of our Sun.0
About 99% of Carbon declared early retirement

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.700
and made its home in the warm embrace of the
Sun,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.519
but a sliver of Carbon wound up on the orbital
track of where our Earth is.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.180
It was rolled up over the next few million
years, with all the other elements, into what

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.130
eventually would become our planet.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.130
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.250
The Hadean era was a real mess.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.079
The Earth was bombarded by asteroids, was
full of volcanoes and the sky was red.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.000
Over time, heavy elements like iron and nickel
sank to the Earth’s core, while lighter

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.769
elements like Carbon floated upward and were
belched out of early sky-scraping volcanoes

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.769
as a gas.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.689
Some carbon combined with oxygen forming carbon
dioxide, and there was so much of it in the

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.709
atmosphere that it turned the skies above
that volcanic landscape red.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.049
More solid forms of carbon can be found in
the Earth’s thin crust.

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.030
Only a small amount of the Earth’s atmosphere
and crust, a fraction of a percentage point,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.660
is made of Carbon, paling in comparison to
the vast masses of oxygen and silicon.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.510
But carbon is stable, and this makes it one
of the most flexible of all the elements when

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.480
it comes to forming molecular combinations
of other elements.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.159
In a way, carbon forms the keystone of most
molecular complexity.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.709
It is estimated that, without carbon, about
95% of all molecular combinations would not

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.709
exist.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.950
Without carbon, complexity probably would
never have increased much further beyond the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.200
most basic chemistry.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.440
We’d have stars, we’d have gases, and
we’d have metals, we’d have a few basic

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
minerals.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.540
And not much else.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.800
No life, no complex chemistry, no “us”.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.630
And because Carbon is so ready to bond with
other elements, it became the prime candidate

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.500
for self-replicating organic chemicals that
would one day, approximately 3.8 to 4 billion

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.069
years ago, become life.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.190
Carbon can bond easily with oxygen, hydrogen,
and nitrogen — all abundant on Earth and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.190
all crucial for life.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.640
Carbon tied them all together.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.669
Because it’s so flexible, carbon can be
used to stick together extremely long molecules,

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.919
a handy thing when you consider how complex
the molecules required to sustain life are.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.250
Carbon-based life began as single celled organisms
in the ocean, evolving into photosynthesizing

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.389
bacteria near the surface of the sea.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.680
This bacteria would evolve into multicellular
plants, at first in the sea starting six hundred

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.930
and thirty five million years ago, and later
with the plant-based conquest of the land

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.780
some two hundred million years later.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.030
The plants in your garden, and those you eat
for dinner are about 45% Carbon.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.470
Given that we eat so much Carbon, you could
argue that without it, you would starve to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.990
death – not that you would have evolved
in the first place.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.970
Plants also need carbon, taking in carbon
dioxide and expelling the oxygen as a waste

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.710
product of photosynthesis.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.470
The process of photosynthesis led to a massive
increase in oxygen in the atmosphere about

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.090
2.5 billion years ago.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.000
The by-product was that other Carbon based
bacteria began to harness oxygen’s energy

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.639
and evolve into more and more complex forms.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.139
This includes fish, frogs, dinosaurs, lions,
tigers, bivalves, and you.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.440
The entire evolutionary epic of nature, multi-celled
organisms, predators, prey, and all the survivors,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.310
owe their existence to carbon.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.080
Your body is 65% oxygen, 10% hydrogen, 3%
nitrogen, and a smattering of calcium, phosphorous,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.500
potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium.-
and all of it is held together by 18% Carbon.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.630
Carbon rich plants played a key role in human
history.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.810
It was in everything from the crops we ate,
to the wood houses that provided shelter,

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.479
to the wood we burned to cook for energy,
to the even more energy dense charcoal which

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.380
we used to build our cities and grow our technology.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.349
If carbon could not be manipulated in this
way, it is likely the past 10,000 years of

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.240
history would have never happened at all and
we would still be a few million foragers with

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.890
stone tools wandering around the Earth.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.890
Without the internet.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.340
Carbon is also responsible for one of the
greatest leaps forward in 13.8 billion years:

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.720
the rise of complexity in the modern era and
the Anthropocene, where we have created systems

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.220
more complex that harness a greater density
of energy than anything else we see in the

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.220
Universe.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.970
From microscopic photosynthesizing bacteria
to the giant forests that existed in the Carboniferous,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.370
all inevitably died, and some were buried
by the soil, protected from rotting, and sank

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.479
over millions upon millions of years as more
soil fell on top of them.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.740
As these plants sank deeper and deeper into
the crust, the pressure made temperatures

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.740
rise.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.900
This pressure and heat converted plants into
coal.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.690
Coal was used by humans as a source for starting
fires as early as 1000 BCE, but the noxious

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.880
smoke it gave off made wood preferable for
a long time.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.960
So, coal was the second choice.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.840
Ancient civilizations definitely knew about
it, though.: the Latin word used by the Romans

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.250
for coal was Carbo.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.250
Then, when the Industrial Revolution was still
in its infancy in Britain, a shortage of wood

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.590
for increasing fuel demands prompted the British
to turn to coal.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.880
In 1709, Abraham Darby enhanced steel production
by using coke derived from coal instead of

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
Charcoal.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.270
In 1781 James Watt produced a commercially
viable steam engine that found its way into

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.770
the engines of all manner of production and
rail transport.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.889
From there, industrialisation spread across
the world, tying all humans together more

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.639
closely in a human network, exchanging and
producing more ideas, accelerating change,

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.980
and skyrocketing the concentration of energy.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.740
All thanks to little Carbon, in the form of
coal.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.270
Even today, approximately 43% of all energy
production is the result of coal.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.819
With the Industrial Revolution, largely ignited
by the spark of carbon, came goods that could

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:41.900
be produced more cheaply - which was great!

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.539
Luxury goods transformed into everyday staples,
the carrying capacity gradually lifted, and

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:48.930
people found more opportunities off of the
farm.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.610
The immense tapestry of ideas, advancement,
and trade of today – the next rise of complexity

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.449
– owes itself to carbon.

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.509
Nowadays, we also make huge use of other fossil
fuels like oil and natural gas.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:04.330
Carbon-based marine life hundreds of millions
of years ago died, sank to the bottom of the

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.190
seas and oceans, and were buried deep in the
silt.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.900
With such intense pressures, the carbon was
transformed into either a black sludge we

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.750
call oil or heated to such high temperatures
that they became natural gas.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.600
This shapes not only global production, and
directly impacts our quality of life – from

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.809
transport, to our everyday goods, to the myriad
of plastic products we use and depend upon

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:27.440
– it also shapes modern day politics, with
the oil-rich nations and oil-dependent nations

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.080
directly influencing the daily tide of events.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.100
Ironically, though, Carbon may also prove
our downfall.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.430
One of the greatest threats to human complexity
today is our dependence on these fossil fuels.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.110
The carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere,
which raises the average surface temperature

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.940
of the Earth and will cause a great deal of
environmental problems and human suffering.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.800
If disaster strikes as a result, Carbon, which
was so crucial to the rise of complexity in

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.020
Big History, may bring complexity down to
a crashing halt.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.921
But some forms of Carbon are a little more
benign- like, in the form of graphite, an

00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:59.829
extremely soft material that you might find
in your pencil.

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:02.370
Sometimes graphite is used to help conduct
electricity.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.790
And at the other end of the spectrum, the
hardest known material is diamond, also a

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.000
gift from Carbon.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.470
Crucial to all sorts of advanced machinery
like electrical insulators and thermal conductors,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.640
diamonds are perhaps best known as a pricey
rock that saw its value skyrocket in the 1930s.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.170
This was thanks to a highly successful advertising
campaign by a diamond company that convinced

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.490
a lot of people to spend a month’s salary
on a shiny rock in order to propose marriage.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:31.160
This led to a tragic exploitation of the environment
and people for the sake of these shiny stones.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.840
So we can think of carbon as both a gift and
at times a curse, depending on the way we

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840
look at it.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.980
Carbon is just 1 out of 92 naturally occurring
elements, a single piece of the puzzle among

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.980
many others.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.209
But, Carbon was absolutely vital to the entire
story of complexity in the Universe.

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:48.510
Without it modernity and the heights of human
complexity wouldn’t exist.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.200
The Industrial Revolution wouldn’t have
happened - along with ancient and medieval

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.140
civilizations, and the evolution of all plants
and animals.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.680
Remove Carbon from the equation and all that
complexity would not have existed.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.620
Misuse carbon and the fate of human complexity
in the Anthropocene may similarly be doomed.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.640
Without Carbon, the tale of rising complexity
would be a short story, involving stars, space

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.530
dust, and barren planets floating in emptiness.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.190
And there would be nobody around to tell it.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.570
In some cases, that story of rising complexity
would not have happened at all.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.700
To quote the great late Carl Sagan: the cosmos
is also within us.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.839
We're made of star-stuff.

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:26.740
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:51.590
Thanks for watching, we’ll see you next
time.
