Push notifications are
coming to web apps,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.410
and one best practice that
just became an anti-pattern.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.370
This is LazyWeb.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.284

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:13.700
Chrome 42 hit
Stable this weekend.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.490
With it comes a number
of new features.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.750
Push notifications let users
opt into timely updates.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.810
Install Banners prompt
users to save pages

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.230
to their home screen.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.280
Permissions let you know
if you can use an API.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.110
Fetch acts as a
replacement for XHR,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.590
and it even includes
support for ES6 classes.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.150
Jacob Kaplan-Moss, keynote
from this year's Pi Con

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.983
breaks some of the
dichotomy that developers

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:36.130
are either 10X badasses
or completely terrible.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.270
Removing these assumptions
helps us better address

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.310
problems like impostor
syndrome and work

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.760
to improve potentially
toxic work environments.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.460
Critical relative URLs
are now an anti-pattern.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.020
Tweeted by Paul Irish this week,
the practice of leaving off

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.811
the protocol from a
URL is now discouraged,

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.630
as it can possibly lead to
man-on-the-side attacks similar

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.929
to the one that hit GitHub.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.720
The new recommendation
is to always request

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.540
an asset over HTTPS if
it is available on SSL.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.430
Check to see if your
site is mobile friendly.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.400
A recent article on the
Google Webmaster's blog

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.899
indicates that
starting immediately,

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.474
Google search will add labels
next to sites that it considers

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:10.140
mobile friendly.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750
The criteria
includes such things

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.730
as making sure that users don't
have to zoom to read the page,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.880
and links that are
spaced far enough apart.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.380
You can use the
mobile friendly test

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.370
to ensure your site meets
the bar and skill up

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.220
over at Web Fundamentals.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.350
Learning Git can be tough.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.850
A look at Stackoverflow
reveals over 53,000 Git

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.780
related questions.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.332
But help is on the way.

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:31.790
First Aid Git is
a searchable index

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.705
of the most commonly
asked Git questions.

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:35.580
Curious how to undo a
change that you've just

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.440
pushed to Master?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.137
You can find that answer and
more, or submit a pull request

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:39.970
to add to the index.

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.490
60 frames per second is
the target for a smooth web

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.865
experience, but it's easy
to fall off the fast path.

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.490
Paul Lewis and Cameron
Pittman show you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300
how to optimize the four major
areas of your app-- Response,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.140
Animate, Idle and Load, a.k.a.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.140

part Udacity course.

Blast Jank Invaders
and master dev tools

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.670
all while learning the
secrets to a faster web app.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.820
That's it for this week.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.720
I'll leave you with a
JavaScript screensaver.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.500
As always, thanks for watching.
