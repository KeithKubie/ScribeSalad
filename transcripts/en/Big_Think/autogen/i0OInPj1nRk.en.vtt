entrepreneurship and I think that one of

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:09.629
entrepreneurship and I think that one of
 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:10.760
entrepreneurship and I think that one of
the things that has made our country

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770
the things that has made our country
 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.640

population where people come here from
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.939
population where people come here from
all over the world and quite often the

all over the world and quite often the
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220
all over the world and quite often the
people who do live their own nation with

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
people who do live their own nation with
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109
people who do live their own nation with

the United States are inherently

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689
the United States are inherently
 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.200
the United States are inherently
adventurous so we've had that

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210
adventurous so we've had that
 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.730
adventurous so we've had that
adventurous spirit that then has

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
adventurous spirit that then has
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.609
adventurous spirit that then has
embedded itself collectively in the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
embedded itself collectively in the
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.130
embedded itself collectively in the
American consciousness I think all of

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
American consciousness I think all of
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.439
American consciousness I think all of
those factors combined have made it

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449
those factors combined have made it
 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.750
those factors combined have made it
possible for us to be in the forefront

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
possible for us to be in the forefront
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.439
possible for us to be in the forefront
of change social change as we had to

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449
of change social change as we had to
 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:43.580
of change social change as we had to
accommodate people from different

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
accommodate people from different
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.889
accommodate people from different
societies and different religions and so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
societies and different religions and so
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.069
societies and different religions and so
forth and also changes that have taken

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
forth and also changes that have taken
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.939
forth and also changes that have taken
place in innovative science because

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
place in innovative science because
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740
place in innovative science because
America has had the best university

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
America has had the best university
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020
America has had the best university
system in the world for a long time and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
system in the world for a long time and
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.079
system in the world for a long time and
so we have been innovators not only in

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089
so we have been innovators not only in
 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.180
so we have been innovators not only in
discoveries that's proven by Nobel

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
discoveries that's proven by Nobel
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009
discoveries that's proven by Nobel
Prizes and chemistry and physics and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
Prizes and chemistry and physics and
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020
Prizes and chemistry and physics and
that sort of thing but we've been able

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
that sort of thing but we've been able
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120
that sort of thing but we've been able
to put that into practical application

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
to put that into practical application
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.730
to put that into practical application
with new gadgets that people admire

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070
we've had a serious problem in our

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
we've had a serious problem in our
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.840
we've had a serious problem in our
country in recent that's a few decades

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
country in recent that's a few decades
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.880
country in recent that's a few decades
in becoming more inclined toward

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
in becoming more inclined toward
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190
in becoming more inclined toward
consumption and gratification oh how

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
consumption and gratification oh how
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520
consumption and gratification oh how
much we own rather than have a spirit of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
much we own rather than have a spirit of
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.910
much we own rather than have a spirit of
innovation and dynamism and producing

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
innovation and dynamism and producing
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.719
innovation and dynamism and producing
new products it was in the 1970s that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
new products it was in the 1970s that
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700
new products it was in the 1970s that
our nation first became a consumer

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
our nation first became a consumer
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.180
our nation first became a consumer
nation that is we bought from foreigners

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190
nation that is we bought from foreigners
 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.260
nation that is we bought from foreigners
more than we sold to foreigners and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
more than we sold to foreigners and
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.330
more than we sold to foreigners and
increasingly that has been a blight on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
increasingly that has been a blight on
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359
increasingly that has been a blight on
our economic system increasingly every

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
our economic system increasingly every
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330
our economic system increasingly every
year and now we have an enormous trade

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
year and now we have an enormous trade
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.430
year and now we have an enormous trade
deficit that is we buy from foreign

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440
deficit that is we buy from foreign
 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.139
deficit that is we buy from foreign
nations particularly China and others a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
nations particularly China and others a
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.490
nations particularly China and others a
lot more than we sell them and it means

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
lot more than we sell them and it means
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080
lot more than we sell them and it means
that they are producing the products

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
that they are producing the products
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.840
that they are producing the products
that we use and we used to be the main

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
that we use and we used to be the main
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.889
that we use and we used to be the main
producer of our goods to be sold to to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
producer of our goods to be sold to to
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930
producer of our goods to be sold to to
our competitive nations that were fairly

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
our competitive nations that were fairly
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.910
our competitive nations that were fairly
well-off and particularly to the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
well-off and particularly to the
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890
well-off and particularly to the
countries that were very poor that's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
countries that were very poor that's
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110
countries that were very poor that's
changed now so I think we've lost the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
changed now so I think we've lost the
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.270
changed now so I think we've lost the
competitive edge that we had a number of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
competitive edge that we had a number of
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.040
competitive edge that we had a number of
years ago

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.620
main subject of my thought was that was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
main subject of my thought was that was
 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.260
main subject of my thought was that was
oil and while I was in office we passed

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
oil and while I was in office we passed
 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.170
oil and while I was in office we passed
some massive legislation that reverse

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
some massive legislation that reverse
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.870
some massive legislation that reverse
that trend we reduced oil imports from

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880
that trend we reduced oil imports from
 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.940
that trend we reduced oil imports from
eight and a half million tons per day

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
eight and a half million tons per day
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.980
eight and a half million tons per day
eight have been in barrels a day to a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990
eight have been in barrels a day to a
 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.140
eight have been in barrels a day to a
less than half that in just five years

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
less than half that in just five years
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.200
less than half that in just five years
but now we've almost doubled what we had

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210
but now we've almost doubled what we had
 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.020
but now we've almost doubled what we had
to begin with so we're still heavily

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
to begin with so we're still heavily
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.450
to begin with so we're still heavily
dependent on other nations for not only

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460
dependent on other nations for not only
 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.290
dependent on other nations for not only
goods but also money now every time we

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300
goods but also money now every time we
 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.660
goods but also money now every time we
spend a dollar that we don't have we

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
spend a dollar that we don't have we
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.340
spend a dollar that we don't have we
have to borrow 40 cents of it for

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350
have to borrow 40 cents of it for
 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.040
have to borrow 40 cents of it for
instance from the Chinese to balance our

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
instance from the Chinese to balance our
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.260
instance from the Chinese to balance our
budget just by going deeper and deeper

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270
budget just by going deeper and deeper
 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.360
budget just by going deeper and deeper
in debt we've become increasingly

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
in debt we've become increasingly
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.360
in debt we've become increasingly
addicted to consumption of goods that we

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
addicted to consumption of goods that we
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.820
addicted to consumption of goods that we
don't produce ourselves and a lot of the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
don't produce ourselves and a lot of the
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.040
don't produce ourselves and a lot of the
manufacturing has gone overseas and this

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050
manufacturing has gone overseas and this
 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.470
manufacturing has gone overseas and this
is so in the last few years it's been

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
is so in the last few years it's been
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.400
is so in the last few years it's been
not just handwork products like shirts

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
not just handwork products like shirts
 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.210
not just handwork products like shirts
and and shoes in clothing but it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
and and shoes in clothing but it's
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.160
and and shoes in clothing but it's
become the advanced cutting-edge

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170
become the advanced cutting-edge
 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.250
become the advanced cutting-edge
technological products for instance when

I was in office we had the preeminent
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.780
I was in office we had the preeminent
position in the production of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020
now that ascendancy has moved to China
 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.510
now that ascendancy has moved to China
China's the number one producer of new

China's the number one producer of new
 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.660
China's the number one producer of new
kinds of advanced photovoltaic cells for

kinds of advanced photovoltaic cells for
 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.400
kinds of advanced photovoltaic cells for
instance and they're the number one

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410
instance and they're the number one

to the wind so we've lost that edge that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360
to the wind so we've lost that edge that
 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.550
to the wind so we've lost that edge that
we used to have in scientific innovation

electronic field almost all of the
 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.050

materials that we use now of an advanced

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
materials that we use now of an advanced

also an iPod both of which are made in
China although we have designed them

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430
China although we have designed them
 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.850
China although we have designed them
here with Apple for instance so they're

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
here with Apple for instance so they're
 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.290
here with Apple for instance so they're
manufactured overseas

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300
 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.110
well I think the entire population of

gays and I would say that the answer is

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900
gays and I would say that the answer is
 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.140
gays and I would say that the answer is
yes I don't know my next election but I

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150
yes I don't know my next election but I
 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.089
yes I don't know my next election but I
think in the near future because

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099
think in the near future because
 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.360
think in the near future because
step-by-step we have realized that this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
step-by-step we have realized that this
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.150
step-by-step we have realized that this
issue of homosexuality has the same

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900
as when we dealt with the race issue 50
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.249
as when we dealt with the race issue 50
years ago 40 years ago so I would say

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259
years ago 40 years ago so I would say
 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.870
years ago 40 years ago so I would say
that the country is getting acclimated

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880
that the country is getting acclimated
 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.460
that the country is getting acclimated

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470
to a president who might be female who
 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.279
to a president who might be female who
might obviously now be black and who

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479
 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.270
well I guess my biggest failure was not

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280
well I guess my biggest failure was not
 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.089
well I guess my biggest failure was not
getting reelected and I learned two

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099
getting reelected and I learned two
 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.249
getting reelected and I learned two
things one is that you ought not to have

extracting them I did the best I could

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819
extracting them I did the best I could
 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.529
extracting them I did the best I could
but I failed and I think another lesson

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539
but I failed and I think another lesson
 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:44.939
but I failed and I think another lesson
I learned is I should have paid more

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949
I learned is I should have paid more
 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.909
I learned is I should have paid more
attention to the organization of the

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919
attention to the organization of the
 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.890
attention to the organization of the
Democratic Party I was not only the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900
Democratic Party I was not only the
 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.469
Democratic Party I was not only the
leader of our nation but I was also the

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479
leader of our nation but I was also the
 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.969
leader of our nation but I was also the
leader of the Democratic Party and I

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979
leader of the Democratic Party and I
 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.029
leader of the Democratic Party and I
think I failed in that respect to keep

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039
think I failed in that respect to keep
 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.839
think I failed in that respect to keep
the party United it was divided in my

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849
the party United it was divided in my
 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.999
the party United it was divided in my
relation campaign between me and the

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009
relation campaign between me and the
 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.159
relation campaign between me and the
people who were loyal to Senator Ted

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
people who were loyal to Senator Ted
 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.890
people who were loyal to Senator Ted
Kennedy and then that cost me a lot of

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900
Kennedy and then that cost me a lot of
 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.709
Kennedy and then that cost me a lot of
votes so those were the two things that

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719
votes so those were the two things that
 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.059
votes so those were the two things that
I believe that could have been done

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069
I believe that could have been done
 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.150
I believe that could have been done
better

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160
 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.520
well I would say quickly that in the

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530
well I would say quickly that in the
 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.320
well I would say quickly that in the
midterm election I had I had great

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330
midterm election I had I had great
 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.260

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.130
success we wound up after the election
in 1978 with a majority of 19 in the

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140
in 1978 with a majority of 19 in the
 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.130
in 1978 with a majority of 19 in the
Senate and a majority of 119 in the

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140
Senate and a majority of 119 in the
 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.430
Senate and a majority of 119 in the
house so we had a very good success with

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440
house so we had a very good success with
 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.220
house so we had a very good success with
that but I think there what it's likely

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230
that but I think there what it's likely
 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.690
that but I think there what it's likely
to happen in the next two years I hope

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700
to happen in the next two years I hope
 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.330
to happen in the next two years I hope
is for President Obama to be much more

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340
