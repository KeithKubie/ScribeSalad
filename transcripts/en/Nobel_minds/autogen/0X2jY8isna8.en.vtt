the worm and the early worm avoids being
eaten by the bird and secondly the clock

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560

manages to to create internal coherence

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
manages to to create internal coherence
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.710
manages to to create internal coherence
so the different reactions different

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
so the different reactions different
 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990
so the different reactions different
steps in metabolism for example happen

oxidative and reduction reactions are

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
oxidative and reduction reactions are

happiest when they're separated in time
 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.589
happiest when they're separated in time
and so circadian rhythms arose a long

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599
and so circadian rhythms arose a long
 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.800
and so circadian rhythms arose a long
time ago in response of course to this

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810

what's currently available on our planet
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.330
what's currently available on our planet
and well before the atmosphere had its

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
and well before the atmosphere had its
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.310
and well before the atmosphere had its
current gaseous constitution and in fact

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320
current gaseous constitution and in fact
 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.490

cyanobacteria really participated in

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860
cyanobacteria really participated in
 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.330
cyanobacteria really participated in
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2
 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.660
oxygenation of the atmosphere so 2
billion years ago we lived in a we lived

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670
billion years ago we lived in a we lived

the planet experienced a reducing

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
the planet experienced a reducing
 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210
the planet experienced a reducing
atmosphere and it was really

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220

cyanobacteria with the aid of its clock
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.020
cyanobacteria with the aid of its clock
that produced the oxygen that enabled

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030
that produced the oxygen that enabled
 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.000

life as we currently know it to arise

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010
life as we currently know it to arise
 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.680
life as we currently know it to arise
and so clocks exist really in different

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690
and so clocks exist really in different
 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.040
and so clocks exist really in different
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just
 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.150
kingdoms not only in bacteria as I just
alluded to but also in plants and in

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
alluded to but also in plants and in
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.790
alluded to but also in plants and in
animals which I will focus on and it's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800
animals which I will focus on and it's
 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.810
animals which I will focus on and it's
likely that these clocks arose

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820
likely that these clocks arose
 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.090
likely that these clocks arose
independently because there's very

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100
independently because there's very
 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.280
independently because there's very
little evidence of a relationship

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
little evidence of a relationship
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.860
little evidence of a relationship
especially between the cyanobacterial

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870
especially between the cyanobacterial
 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.980
especially between the cyanobacterial
clock and animal clocks and probably

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990
clock and animal clocks and probably
 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.020
clock and animal clocks and probably
even the plant clocks arose

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030
even the plant clocks arose
 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.100
even the plant clocks arose
independently so this is such a powerful

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
independently so this is such a powerful
 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.890
independently so this is such a powerful
such a powerful contribution to fitness

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900

is a little bit of a story which I'll

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:08.329
is a little bit of a story which I'll
 

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:09.010
is a little bit of a story which I'll
come to

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:09.020

so this particular gel gave rise to a
 

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.480
so this particular gel gave rise to a
model and and I call it a cautious model

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:16.490

and what I want you to appreciate was
that there was no mention of

that there was no mention of
 

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.019
that there was no mention of

was there was feedback loop but no
 

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.199
was there was feedback loop but no
mention of transcription and the way we

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:37.209
mention of transcription and the way we
 

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:40.690
mention of transcription and the way we
imagined this was that it could work at

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:40.700
imagined this was that it could work at
 

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.790
imagined this was that it could work at
the post transcriptional level for

transcription it could be transcription

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:52.580
transcription it could be transcription
 

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.540
transcription it could be transcription
and moreover it could be indirect in

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:55.550
and moreover it could be indirect in
 

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.610
and moreover it could be indirect in
other words the period protein could

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:57.620
other words the period protein could
 

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.100
other words the period protein could
affect these things directly but perhaps

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.110
affect these things directly but perhaps
 

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.110
affect these things directly but perhaps
the period protein affects another

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120
the period protein affects another
 

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.240
the period protein affects another
protein which is actually the direct

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.250
protein which is actually the direct
 

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.650
protein which is actually the direct
regulator or or most indirect if you

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:08.660
regulator or or most indirect if you
 

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.650
regulator or or most indirect if you
will is that the period protein could

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:11.660
will is that the period protein could
 

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.900
will is that the period protein could
influence behavior which could in fact

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
influence behavior which could in fact
 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.560
influence behavior which could in fact
feed back and affect the molecular

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:17.570
feed back and affect the molecular
 

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.690
feed back and affect the molecular
oscillations in other words behavior

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:19.700
oscillations in other words behavior
 

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.670
oscillations in other words behavior
would actually be upstream as opposed to

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680
would actually be upstream as opposed to
 

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.160
would actually be upstream as opposed to
downstream of the molecular oscillations

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.170
downstream of the molecular oscillations
 

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.199
downstream of the molecular oscillations
so we were very conservative about this

00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:26.209
so we were very conservative about this
 

00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:29.190
so we were very conservative about this
and and it turned out that over the next

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.200
and and it turned out that over the next
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.819
and and it turned out that over the next
two or three years that there were three

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:33.829
two or three years that there were three

interesting and interesting aside as we
 

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.960
interesting and interesting aside as we
really had trouble publishing this paper

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:55.970
really had trouble publishing this paper
 

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.000
really had trouble publishing this paper
because everyone assumed this was

half of my lab and so I was well aware

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839
half of my lab and so I was well aware
 

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.740
half of my lab and so I was well aware
that this was not a slam-dunk this was

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:08.750
that this was not a slam-dunk this was
 

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.650
that this was not a slam-dunk this was
not for sure to be transcriptional and

not for sure to be transcriptional and
 

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.069
not for sure to be transcriptional and
and what this paper showed was the fact

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079
and what this paper showed was the fact
 

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.980
and what this paper showed was the fact
that the pre messenger RNA the intron

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:17.990
that the pre messenger RNA the intron
 

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.040
that the pre messenger RNA the intron
containing RNA also underwent circadian

essentially indistinguishably from the
 

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.940
essentially indistinguishably from the

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:26.950
messenger RNA and also you could take
 

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.130

the upstream region the promoter region
 

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.380
the upstream region the promoter region
of the gene and you could put it in

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:31.390
of the gene and you could put it in
 

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.100

regulatory DNA would would would
oscillate that that that reporter RNA

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:50.380
oscillate that that that reporter RNA
 

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.470
oscillate that that that reporter RNA
would oscillate in exactly the same way

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480
would oscillate in exactly the same way
 

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.360
would oscillate in exactly the same way
as the purr RNA so all you needed was

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.370
as the purr RNA so all you needed was
 

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.780

the upstream DNA really indicating that

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:57.790
the upstream DNA really indicating that
 

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.510
the upstream DNA really indicating that
this was very likely to be transcription

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520
this was very likely to be transcription
 

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.060
this was very likely to be transcription
so the models strongly favored

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.070
so the models strongly favored
 

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.670
so the models strongly favored
transcription and then over the next

in a lengthy genetic screen to try to
find other circadian mutants and we we

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:15.730
find other circadian mutants and we we
 

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.510
find other circadian mutants and we we
knew about the remarkable work in the

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520
knew about the remarkable work in the

for period altered mutations so we

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:24.790
for period altered mutations so we
 

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.900
for period altered mutations so we
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:27.910
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations
 

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.540
actually looked at a rhythmic mutations
and and it turns out that a rhythmic

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:30.550
and and it turns out that a rhythmic
 

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.210

and so we devised the sub screen and the
 

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.930
and so we devised the sub screen and the
sub screen for these mutants was to look

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:45.940

and in fact we only found three three

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.090
and in fact we only found three three
 

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.380

mutant strains which met that criterion
 

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.480
mutant strains which met that criterion
and two of those turned out to be

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.490
and two of those turned out to be
 

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.110

and mammals and one of them turned out
 

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.750
and mammals and one of them turned out
to be an allele of clock so in fact we

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760
to be an allele of clock so in fact we
 

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.710

we had closed the circle if you like and
 

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.560
we had closed the circle if you like and
and managed to identify the positive

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.570

proteins function in the same way in the
same way in in mammals and so this is

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:48.430
same way in in mammals and so this is
 

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.630

this is the association of timeless or a
 

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:37.190
this is the association of timeless or a
period with the upstream region of the

black arrows indicate the time at which

00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659
black arrows indicate the time at which
 

00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:48.680
black arrows indicate the time at which
clock or the positive factor associates

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:48.690
clock or the positive factor associates
 

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.269
clock or the positive factor associates
with these same regions and of course

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279
with these same regions and of course
 

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:53.029
with these same regions and of course
not surprisingly there's a delay between

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039
not surprisingly there's a delay between
 

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:56.810
not surprisingly there's a delay between
the association of the activator and the

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820
the association of the activator and the
 

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.999
the association of the activator and the
subsequent association of the repressors

00:24:58.999 --> 00:24:59.009
subsequent association of the repressors
 

00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:01.070
subsequent association of the repressors
so the repressors build up and then

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080
so the repressors build up and then
 

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.830
so the repressors build up and then
associate the turnoff transcription and

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840
associate the turnoff transcription and
 

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.019
associate the turnoff transcription and
it turns out to be to be quite

00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:06.029
it turns out to be to be quite
 

00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:09.320
it turns out to be to be quite
interesting that the profile if one does

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:09.330
interesting that the profile if one does
 

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.930
interesting that the profile if one does
exactly the same kind of assay but in

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940
exactly the same kind of assay but in
 

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.590
exactly the same kind of assay but in
this case actually tries to identify the

this case actually tries to identify the
 

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.619
this case actually tries to identify the
proteins by mass spectrometry that are

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:18.629
proteins by mass spectrometry that are
 

00:25:18.629 --> 00:25:20.899
proteins by mass spectrometry that are
associated with the clock site complex

00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:20.909
associated with the clock site complex
 

00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:23.600
associated with the clock site complex
on chromatin that there's a much more

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:23.610
on chromatin that there's a much more
 

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.019
on chromatin that there's a much more
discreet Association of period and

seek the proteins associate continuously

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:34.789
seek the proteins associate continuously
 

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:39.009
seek the proteins associate continuously
whereas by mass spec there's a much more

00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:39.019
whereas by mass spec there's a much more
 

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:42.619
whereas by mass spec there's a much more
discrete feature of association and so

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:42.629
discrete feature of association and so
 

00:25:42.629 --> 00:25:45.859
discrete feature of association and so
there's something that's very different

00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:45.869
there's something that's very different
 

00:25:45.869 --> 00:25:47.930
there's something that's very different
that happens at a very particular time

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940
that happens at a very particular time
 

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.450
that happens at a very particular time
on chromatin that's associated with this

on chromatin that's associated with this
 

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.629
on chromatin that's associated with this
repression step and this is only to say

00:25:53.629 --> 00:25:53.639
repression step and this is only to say
 

00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:56.720

a word about this particular kind of a
 

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.080
a word about this particular kind of a
particular kind of assay and so beyond

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.090
particular kind of assay and so beyond
 

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.259
particular kind of assay and so beyond
the feedback loop I just will say a word

00:26:03.259 --> 00:26:03.269
the feedback loop I just will say a word
 

00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:08.029
the feedback loop I just will say a word
about the fact that we and others we and

00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039
about the fact that we and others we and
 

00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:11.359
about the fact that we and others we and
others have have tried to address the

00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:11.369
others have have tried to address the
 

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.909
others have have tried to address the
notion of how much oscillation is there

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919
notion of how much oscillation is there
 

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.950
notion of how much oscillation is there
really and in a paper that we published

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960
really and in a paper that we published
 

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.600
really and in a paper that we published
in 2000

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:17.610
in 2000
 

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.049
in 2000
we made two findings one is that there

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059
we made two findings one is that there
 

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:24.080
we made two findings one is that there
are a large number of cycling rnase in

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.090
are a large number of cycling rnase in
 

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.049
are a large number of cycling rnase in
fly heads much beyond this very

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059
fly heads much beyond this very
 

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:29.649
fly heads much beyond this very
constrained small feedback loop and

00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:29.659
constrained small feedback loop and
 

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:33.259
constrained small feedback loop and
secondly that none of this oscillation

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:33.269
secondly that none of this oscillation
 

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:35.930
secondly that none of this oscillation
none of these cycling RNAs happen

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940
none of these cycling RNAs happen
 

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.220
none of these cycling RNAs happen
without a functional clock psych complex

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:40.230
without a functional clock psych complex
 

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.399
without a functional clock psych complex
so in other words the small feedback

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:43.409
so in other words the small feedback
 

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:45.769
so in other words the small feedback
loop really does sit at the top of a

00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779
loop really does sit at the top of a
 

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:48.200
loop really does sit at the top of a
hierarchy which gives rise to a large

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.210
hierarchy which gives rise to a large
 

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.230
hierarchy which gives rise to a large
number of oscillating transcripts and of

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240
number of oscillating transcripts and of
 

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.039
number of oscillating transcripts and of
course the current view the way to put

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:55.049
course the current view the way to put
 

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:56.869
course the current view the way to put
this together and create a cartoon to

this together and create a cartoon to
 

00:26:56.879 --> 00:26:59.419
this together and create a cartoon to
rationalize this if you like is the fact

00:26:59.419 --> 00:26:59.429
rationalize this if you like is the fact
 

00:26:59.429 --> 00:27:01.639
rationalize this if you like is the fact
that this small feedback loop here which

00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:01.649
that this small feedback loop here which
 

00:27:01.649 --> 00:27:06.080
that this small feedback loop here which

factors lead to the the oscillation of

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.190
factors lead to the the oscillation of
 

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.649
factors lead to the the oscillation of
secondary secondary target genes and and

00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659
secondary secondary target genes and and
 

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:28.989
secondary secondary target genes and and
output functions and it's really this

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320
circadian control so in other words
 

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.170
