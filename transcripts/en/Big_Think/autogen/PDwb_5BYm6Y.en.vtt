00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:14.680
Many people have contended that there is a
paradox of why should we tolerate intolerant

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.830
ideas.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:28.220
And the answer is that we have to engage in
exploration and analysis of all ideas if we

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:37.570
are going to honestly and sincerely reach
our own conclusion as to which ideas we believe

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.649
to be correct and which ideas we believe other
people should adopt.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:51.891
I go back to John Stewart Mills classic essay
called On Liberty in which he says here are

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:59.380
the reasons why we should listen to even ideas
that we believe to be completely wrong.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.210
And as somebody who is advocating tolerance
for freedom even for the ideas that we hate,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.270
I would say an idea that I would hate would
be an intolerance idea.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.299
So here's the reason why I think I should
listen to that idea, paraphrasing Jon Stewart

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.299
Mills.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.869
Number one, I may revise reviews after I listen
to that idea.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.130
And I can give you a concrete example where
that actually happened thanks to the silver

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.540
lining of all of the protests on campus about
free speech.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.579
Many students and faculty members even have
asserted that freedom of speech should not

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.490
be such a special important value in our society;
we should not tolerate freedom for ideas that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.450
they consider to be dangerous ideas.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.479
And quite frankly to me it had always seemed
so indisputably correct that we had to protect

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.859
freedom for all ideas that I never really
had grappled thoroughly with that contention.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:15.280
I recently wrote a book on the subject and
in the process I had to articulate to myself

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.680
why I reached that conclusion and I did so
in a way that I persuaded myself, I hope that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.969
means I was persuasive to my audience, and
I wouldn't of had to do that, I wouldn't have

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:36.450
enriched my own understanding of my long standing
position had I not been forced to grapple

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.790
with the exact opposite contention.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.640
So, one possibility is that we will realize
that our original ideas were wrong or at least

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.609
could be improved, refined.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:58.040
And another possibility is that we will be
reaffirmed in our adherence to our pre-existing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.170
ideas, but we when do so, we will understand
them and appreciate them and articulate them

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.260
with much more depth and vibrancy when they
are the result, not just of unthinking reflexive

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.430
orthodoxy: "Oh that's what I've always believed
and that's what everybody else believes" but

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.359
when we are forced to really examine them.

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:28.879
And that forced examination comes through
contact and conflict with challenges and questions

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.010
and opposite ideas.
