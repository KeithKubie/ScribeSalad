00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.350
Air Miles are awesome, they can be used to
score free flights, hotel stays and if you’re

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.530
really lucky, the scorn and hatred of everyone
you come in contact with who has to pay full

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.160
price when they travel.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.570
The king of all virtually free travelers is
one David Phillips, a civil engineer who teaches

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.240
at the University of California, Davis.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.969
David came to the attention of the wider media
when he managed to convert about 12,150 cups

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.010
of Healthy Choice chocolate pudding into over
a million Air Miles.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.550
Ever since, David and his entire family have
been travelling the world for next to nothing.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.140
So how did he do it?

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.950
Well, first we need to explain the kind of
man David Phillips is; he’s the kind of

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.989
guy who reads every inch of the small print
on things.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.710
The kind of guy who learned to count cards
just so he’d never get ripped off in a casino.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.239
In fact, Phillips stated that he could have
probably been a pro card player if it wasn’t

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.430
for the cigarette smoke.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.200
Yes, this guy- according to him- could have
been a millionaire card player, but he enjoyed

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.640
fresh air more than the musky stink of success.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.340
His most famous endevour was back in 1999
when he saw that Healthy Choice was having

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.380
a promotion on their frozen entrées section.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
The offer was as follows: for every 10 bar
codes of their product a person sent in, they’d

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.500
be awarded 500 Air Miles.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.170
However, the company had an early bird stipulation
that people who redeemed the offer within

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
the first month of the competition would receive
double that, meaning a person could potentially

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.229
receive 1000 Air Miles for buying just 10
of their entrées.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.950
Upon catching wind of the deal, David scoured
his local supermarkets to see which, if any

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.719
products offered the best potential return.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.170
After some legwork, he found what he was looking
for- a discount grocery chain that was selling

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.640
individual chocolate pudding cups for 25 cents
each.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.119
This meant that for a measly $2.50, he could
get 1000 Air Miles.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.420
Realising the amazing return he was potentially
able to receive, David set out to hit every

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.560
store in the chain in one day and buy up every
single Healthy Choice pudding they had.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.990
Now, you’re probably thinking a guy walking
into several stores and asking to purchase

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.550
all the Healthy Choice pudding they possessed,
even in the back of the store, would arouse

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.670
suspicion; and if anyone cottoned on to what
he was doing, they’d try to get in on it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.010
too, because, why wouldn’t they?

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.220
David apparently had the same concern and
while buying the pudding, he told people he

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.070
was doing it because he was stocking up for
Y2K, which was just around the corner.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.270
All in all, David spent just over $3000 on
pudding, which may seem like a lot, until

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.210
you realise the total dollar value of the
miles he was set to receive was in excess

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.750
of $150,000.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.030
However, before that, he actually had to send
off all of the bar codes.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.030
According to David, his wife got blisters
from peeling off hundreds of stickers and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.690
his kids and co-workers grew physically sick
of the sheer amount of chocolate paste he

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.880
was forcing on them.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.960
Further, it began to look doubtful they’d
be able to peel off all the barcodes in time

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.070
to qualify for the early bird part of the
promotion.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.420
This is when David had another idea- why did
he need to have his wife and children suffer

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.180
when he could get others to do the leg work
for him?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.150
David approached the local Salvation Army
with an offer; if they gave him a bunch of

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.290
volunteers to peel off all the bar codes on
his pudding, he’d donate the pudding to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.290
them.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.890
But here’s the beautiful part, doing this
counted as a considerable charitable donation,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.120
which let David claim just over $800 back
in tax deductions at the end of they year.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.080
But the benefits of David’s scheme didn’t
end there.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.540
After sending off the bar codes and getting
back his 1,280,000 miles, (he got a few more

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.490
than just from the pudding because he also
bought some soup at 90 cents a can before

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.160
he realised that was the sucker’s method),
he now officially had over a million miles

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.680
in his frequent flyer accounts, which automatically
gave him lifelong access to something called

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.069
the “American Airlines AAdvantage Gold club”
giving him and his family a number of awesome

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.880
flying related perks for the rest of their
lives.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.760
But we haven’t even got to the best part
yet.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.400
David will likely never run out of Air Miles
because he’s still earning miles at about

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.400
5 times faster than he’s spending them,
despite traveling quite often, thanks to various

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.160
frequent flyer incentive programs he keeps
an eye out for and exploits just like the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
pudding scheme.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.969
Today, he has over 4 million miles in his
various accounts and has flown to over 20

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.520
countries and taken numerous vacations in
the meantime.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.719
In the end, for a one time cost of a little
over $3000 (or less if you subtract the tax

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.349
deduction), and a few other similar deals
he’s taken advantage of to bolster his numbers,

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:53.550
David never has to pay for a flight in his
life ever again.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.030
Genius.
