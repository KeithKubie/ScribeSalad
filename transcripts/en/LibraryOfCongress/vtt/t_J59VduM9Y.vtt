&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.170
If I could ask you
all to take a seat

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.820
at this time, that
would be great.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.780
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.390
I'm the director of the
American Folk Life Center here

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.590
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.920
And on behalf of the staff,
indeed everyone in the library,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.790
I want to welcome you today
to the latest presentation

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.730
in our Benjamin A.
Botkin lecture series.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.050
The series allows us at the
center to highlight the work

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.960
of scholars in a range of areas
in the disciplines of folklore,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.410
ethnomusicology, oral
history and cultural heritage,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.760
while also enhancing
the collections here

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
at the America Folk Life Center.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.910
Every lecture is
videotaped and becomes part

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.650
of the permanent archive.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.650
And also each lecture is
later posted as a webcast

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880
so that people throughout
the world and for generations

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.570
to come can hear the lecture

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.210
that you are going
to be hearing today.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.130
So with all of that said now,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.190
if you do have any electronic
devices, cell phones, et cetera,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.780
on, please turn them
off at this point.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.950
We are very proud to be the
American Folk Life Center,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.250
but sometimes I know the
name gives people the wrong

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.060
impression or that our interests

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410
and our archival
holdings are only limited

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.990
to American materials.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.820
And that is not the case at all.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.630
Of course, we're an
outstanding collection,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.230
I would dare say the outstanding
repository for American music,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.510
dance and traditional culture.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.090
But among the more than 3,000
collections in our archive,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.770
our materials from
hundreds of other cultures,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.580
countries throughout the world
and in fact virtually all

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.770
of the reading rooms here at
the library contain collections

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.250
in multiple languages
from cultures

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.060
and countries throughout
the world.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.820
In the Asian reading
room, for instance,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.370
you can access the library's
South Asian collection

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.190
which relates directly
to our lecture today.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.140
And I would just like to
acknowledge our colleagues

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.090
from the Asian reading
room today.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.040
Welcome and thanks for coming.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.750
The South Asian collection

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.280
in the Asian reading
room contains materials

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.310
from Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.580
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.710
The collection currently has
332,000 monograph volumes,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.970
more than 1,000 active
journals and over 68,000 titles

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.500
on microfesh and provides
broad general research coverage

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.090
in most fields and disciplines,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.700
but especially vernacular
languages in literature,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.370
religion and philosophy,
politics, history and sociology.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.950
And so today we will hear about
an ancient cultural tradition

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.700
that is practiced both in
India and the United States.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.330
This afternoon, I
have the pleasure

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.730
of introducing the
distinguished ethnomusicologist

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.930
and performer Joseph
J. Palackal.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.070
Dr. Palackal who is
originally from the Indian state

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.220
of Karela grew up in
the musical traditions

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.450
of the Siro Malabar Church and
is an Indic musicology singer

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.930
and composer, as well as
one of the foremost experts

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.740
on the musical traditions
of the Indian Christians.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.930
The founder and president of the
Christian Musicological Society

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.790
of India, Dr. Palackal received
his PhD in ethnomusicology

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.060
from the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.880
in 2005 for his research
on the Syriac

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.210
or Aramaic chant
traditions in south India.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.830
His dissertation compared the
contemporary melodic practices

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.220
of the East Syriac, Chaldean
rite of the Siro Malabar Church

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.790
and the West Syriac rite

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.040
of the Oriental Orthodox
churches of south India.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.120
In addition to his
work as a scholar,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.490
Dr. Palackal is a noted
performer, writer,

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.840
composer and CD producer.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.690
He made his New York
debut in 1990

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.920
with a guest appearance singing
a Christian devotional song

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.990
in Hindi in the off-Broadway
show Nonsense.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.320
And he has also performed
at Lincoln Center

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.320
and Princeton University.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.950
We are delighted that he is able
to come to the library today,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.080
and I ask you to join me
in welcoming Dr. Palackal

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.250
for this presentation
on Syriac chants

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.840
and Aramaic Christianity
in India.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.510
Dr. Palackal.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.060
[ Applause ]

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.220
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal: Thank you
for that wonderful introduction.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.650
Let me begin by chanting the
Lord's prayer using almost the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.140
exact words that Jesus
taught his disciples.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:06:46.370
[ Chanting ]

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.540
With your permission, I would
like to dedicate this event

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.160
to the saintly Palackal
Toman Apan, my collateral

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.190
and sister who died in 1841.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.230
He was a great teacher
of the Aramaic language,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.470
and founder of the
seminary in his native town

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.440
and the first seminary
of the Sindar Christians.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.740
And who founded the first Lis
congregation for men in India

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.100
to which I belong, the
Caramelites of Mary Immaculate.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.670
It is a great honor to be here
to talk about the language

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.930
that he was so passionate
and he taught his disciples.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.450
Almost for 1,000 years
the biggest export item

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.580
from India was religion.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.970
And that religion
was not Hinduism.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.120
It was Buddhism.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.710
Ever since Emperor
Ahsoka accepted Buddhism,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.040
he became the biggest promotor,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.460
just like Constantine
did to Christianity.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.840
And he sent missionaries to the
different parts of the world,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.670
including Palestine
and the Middle East.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:07.960
Emperor Ahsoka not only accepted
Buddhism but he also laid

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.240
out foundations for
respectful dialogue

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.320
and respectful other
religious traditions.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.220
So by the time Christianity
came on the scene,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.310
India had already prepared that
mindset to welcome anything

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.960
and everything without
contradicting but respecting.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.980
So it is in this context
we talk about the movement

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.650
of the eastern religion
which became Christianity

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.630
to other parts of Asia,
to south India in Karela.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:49.230
It is amazing that
Christianity we believe,

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.530
that Christianity
moved to south India.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.890
Before the preaching
of Jesus, the charisma

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.930
of Jesus became a religion.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.250
Jesus did not promote
a religion;

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.760
he lived a Jew, died a Jew.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.430
He changed the perception
of his own mother faith

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.520
but eventually it
became a religion.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.190
Before Christianity
became a doctrine religion,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.930
the faith reached Karela.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.350
We believe it came through
St. Thomas the Apostle,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.120
one of the 12 apostles.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.370
Because of the trade
relationship, spice trade,

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.640
the region was known to the
Middle East, so probably he came

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.460
in one of those ships.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.290
In any case, they will
receive the simple faith,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.050
and interestingly,
this is the man

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.100
who made the biggest
profession of faith

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.400
in just two words
in Aramaic language.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.630
[Aramaic phrase],
my Lord and my God.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.460
This was an exuberant outburst
when Jesus appeared especially

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.290
for him and asked him to touch
his hands and touch his side.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.410
He came out with this profession
of faith [Aramaic phrase],

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.760
simple words, my
Lord and my God.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.820
While the disciples
were doubtful, he said,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.360
"You are man and God."

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.920
And it took 325 years and
the rise of a Roman emperor

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.120
to arrive at a simple
consensus on the exegesis

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.050
of these two words which we
have in the Nicaean Creed.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.490
If you look at that creed,
how verbose, how difficult,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.680
how much they have
been struggling to pin

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.860
down what St. Thomas the
Apostle said in two words.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.910
So this faith in its
simplest form came to India.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.640
And it survived there and in
due course they created poetry,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.080
meaning they have connection
with the Middle East

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.130
in the Syriac Aramaic language.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.350
The poetry that they were
singing celebrated the faith,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.650
the simple faith.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.050
I'm going to sing two lines

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.730
which expresses deep
Christological theology.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.430
So this is part of a canonical
prayer literally the hours.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:20.030
This is a couplet from a
long chant sung during Advent

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.720
and Christmas seasons.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.500
But this particular couplet
when it comes to that couplet,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.260
the liturgical book says
sing twice three times

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.110
because of the significance
of the text

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.140
which I will explain soon.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.720
And the Siro Malabar
Christians began to take it

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.440
as a separate chant and sing it

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.680
in three ascending
pitch registers

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.510
and proclaim the faith.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:59.190
[ Foreign language ]

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.370
We worship you, Lord.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.000
[Foreign name] is God,
[foreign name] is divinity.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.200
[Foreign name], you
are divinity.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.800
[Foreign language]
and you are human.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.530
[Foreign word] is man.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.970
[Foreign word] humanity.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.560
[Foreign phrase]
you're humanity.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.360
The next phrase is the crucial.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.940
[Foreign phrase] is
doubt or division.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.690
Very clever play on the word.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.550
[Foreign phrase] without
division, or without doubt.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.950
While Christianity
was struggling,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:41.510
in several ecumenical councils
to define how did humanity

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.420
and divinity in Christ
come together,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.060
they were breaking their heads,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.530
they were expounding
on the stories.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.120
So you can imagine so many
things were happening.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.410
St. Thomas Christians in India
were singing this couplet

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.430
which proclaimed
everything was resolved.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.760
There was no problem.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.510
Let me sing first and then
we will talk a little more.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:45.040
[ Singing ]

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.490
There is another song that
again dissolves the cloud

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.770
of historianism that is hanging

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.570
over the St. Thomas
Christians ever

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.030
since the Portuguese
encountered them.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.130
And that song is another
Grecian melody [foreign name].

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:06.500
Son of Mary, Son of Mary.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.700
Mary gave birth to
the son of God.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.160
So there was no problem.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.600
There is no problem.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.190
There is no need to fight
and kill each other.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.490
It was already certain.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.510
So they sang, "Son of
Mary, son of Mary."

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.960
Mary forgave for the son of God.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.510
There was no confusion.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:44.040
[ Singing ]

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.470
And they will sing
those two stanzas

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.330
and this will be the refrain.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.670
The other stanzas go,
"Son of Mary did this.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.740
Son of Mary promised a pardon.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.620
Son of Mary sanctified
the waters of Jordan."

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.520
So everything is son
of Mary, son of Mary.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.960
But that son of Mary
is the son of God.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.070
So there was no confusion.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.800
This was how they celebrated
faith, through chants.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.800
There was no doctrinal
imposition.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.040
It was part of their faith.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:18.500
And at this moment I'd like to
bring in one Malayalam word,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.430
how the word [foreign word]

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:28.730
which we translate
to English as faith.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:35.120
The Karela people translated
it into Malayalam or maybe

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.340
into Tamur before
Malayalam became a language.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.640
[Foreign word].

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.940
[Foreign word] is
breath, breath.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.440
[Foreign word], that means
it is beautiful breath.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.620
This is how they translated
faith in Malayalam.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.310
It is part of the
breath of the people.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:04.380
It is not just something
that you believe in.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.600
It is not something
that you discuss.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.370
It is not that something that
you arrive at the conclusion,

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.800
but it is your breath,
your own breath.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.200
That idea of breath comes
from another word in Aramaic,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.290
the meaning of which is
breath, which is [foreign word].

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:28.770
Which we translate awkwardly
in English as Holy Spirit.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.030
[Foreign word] the
very breath of God.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.920
The personification is the
third person of the trinity.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.530
So let us leave that aside.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.250
So this faith in India, among
the Christians in India,

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.870
St. Thomas Christians
celebrate it through their songs

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.460
and dances, and then
it continues.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.850
And then every love
story has a villain,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.900
like the Hindi movies
you have seen.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.170
That villain came from Portugal.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.940
So the missionaries came,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.690
they encountered St. Thomas
Christians and they saw

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.690
that they were worshiping
in Syriac.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.780
What kind of -- their idea
of Catholicism was different

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.880
from what they saw in the land.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.180
So that came into conflict.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.020
They said, "We have
to change this.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.390
We have to change it to Latin."

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.760
But the St. Thomas
Christians said, "No.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.000
This is the way of Thomas.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.500
You follow the way of Peter.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.750
And this is the language
of Jesus,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.850
so we want to retain
this language."

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.360
So what happened?

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.840
They introduced Latin elements,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.660
but they translated
them into Syriac.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.030
So in the video we will
see examples of that.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:47.270
Well, the villain went away but
then you know, it is amazing.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.320
They went away, but a little bit

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.280
of that villain resurfaced
in the 1960s.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.520
The people, St. Thomas
Christians,

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.070
the Siro Malabar Christians we
are talking about, they thought

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.280
that the language has
lost its credibility,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.640
nobody knows Syriac.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.550
So they changed, as it
happened, the Latin rite,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:15.180
they changed everything into
Malayalam in the 1960s, 1962.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.690
So this was before
the Vatican too.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.060
It had nothing to do
with the Vatican too.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.670
So the generation that was born

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.120
after that transition did
not know the language.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.790
Slowly the language is
on death bed right now.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.830
So it is in this context
that I come on the scene.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:41.090
So when I came to New York to
do my PhD, I wanted a new topic.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.090
And I grew up in the tradition.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.500
I was an officer reading
Syriac in Malayalam script.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.390
So when it came to the choice
of doctoral dissertation,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.460
I chose Syriac chants
in south India

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.340
at City University of New York.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.240
I had a great eminent
director, Dr. Steven Blount.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.650
And then after doing that,
I also worked on a CD

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.730
of Syriac chants, and interest
came in and it continued.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.350
So after PhD I continued
research on.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.540
Because if someone didn't do
anything, this could die out.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.660
So I started the
Aramaic project.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.920
The result of that project is
what we are going to see now.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.570
And the video has four sections.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.450
It's a 22-and-a-half-minute
video.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.750
It has four sections.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.140
One is, why should we
take the Aramaic tradition

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.640
in India seriously?

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.820
So I talked to eminent people,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.820
people who know better
than I do.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.520
And we listen to their answers.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.070
The second part is
how east meets west,

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.260
how St. Thomas Christians met
the Portuguese missionaries.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.140
And during the interaction,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.810
finally the Portuguese
missionaries succeeded

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.250
in convincing the
St. Thomas Christians

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.440
to accept their rituals
and practices

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.110
and translate the
chants into Syriac.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.730
So that gave birth to a
new brand of Syriac music.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.970
That is exclusively
the patrimony

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.820
of these Siro Malabar Christians
in Karela and nowhere else.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.380
After watching the video, I
would like to have your comments

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.520
if you now something
similar elsewhere.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.530
The third section of the
video is the transmission

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.720
of this tradition from
the older generation

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.830
to the younger generation,
what we are doing

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.200
with the Aramaic project.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.550
And the fourth is our
attempt to reintroduce Syriac

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.920
into the vernacular liturgy.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.120
Interestingly, I am so happy to
stand here and talk about that,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.470
because the first time we did
that in America was not far

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.480
from here at the
Catholic University campus

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.590
at the Natural Shrine.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.860
We had a celebration India
event and we celebrated mass

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.880
in the Siro Malabar tradition.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.030
The cardinal came from India

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.360
and we introduced two Syriac
chants in that liturgy.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.640
You will see examples from that
towards the end of the video.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.160
You will see the
chant from there.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.190
But it caught on.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.680
Young people are catching
on, and I am so happy

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.910
that we have representatives
from Forest Church,

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:27.350
Virginia who just last Saturday
for their first communion,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.220
they sang three Syriac chants
including the one I sang

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.930
in the beginning,
[foreign name].

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.810
I thought, "Wow."

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.330
For the first communion
kids, what else can you say?

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.510
Three years of catechism,
they compress into two lines.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.050
[ Foreign language ]

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.690
We without doubt, we believe
in your divinity and humanity.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.400
It's not just a piece of bread.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.040
You are both man and God.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.820
What a beautiful -- what
else do they need to say?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.350
Looking at that piece of
bread, "You are man and God,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.780
and we believe without doubt."

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.670
So in other words, this is
becoming part of America.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.040
And that's how I'd like to
conclude this presentation,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.250
by talking about some good news.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.860
Complimenting about
two countries:

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:27.390
one my adopted country, America,
second my native country, India.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.500
Once I finished my doctoral
dissertation, then I embarked

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.330
on this Aramaic project.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.880
The first support came
from my own parishioners

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.030
and the local bank Mass
Preferred Savings Bank.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.690
Even though they did not fully
understand what exactly what I

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.500
was embarking on, they
came forward and helped me

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.020
to launch the project.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.340
And then to my surprise,
it caught on.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.580
First example, is
Father Justin here?

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.880
Oh, thank you.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.930
That is his parish,
and I thank you

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.030
for encouraging your
children to sing that.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.120
We couldn't include
that in the video,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.300
because it just happened
recently.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:15.620
And at the priestly ordination
that took place a week ago

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.500
in New Jersey, they
sang Syriac chants.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.340
Next week on June
3rd they are going

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.290
to sing Syriac chants during
a priestly ordination.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.600
So it is catching.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.520
This is becoming the
patrimony of this country.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.800
It is becoming American.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.250
That's a story of America.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.960
It came from everywhere.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.140
It found its own life here.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.150
So that story is continuing.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.680
That Aramaic language and
music is getting an American

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.980
face lift.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.280
So some day it will become part

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.040
of the Christian experience
of the children here.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.920
And finally, my native
country, India.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:04.510
India from the beginning
welcomed ideas, ideologies

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.300
and even contradictory
ideas into its shore.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.050
When we think of India, it's a
slightly different imagination

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.800
of a country from the
contemporary forces that want

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.570
to reduce India into a Hindu
country, a NATO perspective.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.790
But India in my view
is not a country.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:28.160
It is a concept, a
concept of coexistence.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.980
India is like the river in
Herman Hess's Siddhartha.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.870
Everything that flows
into it comes

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.190
into the shore and
becomes Indian.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.730
It is fascinating.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.560
Open to everybody,
welcoming everybody,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.140
but converting it to Indian.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.880
That nation, its philosophy,
let noble thoughts come

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.860

Very rarely do we listen to
this chant in a female voice.

sung by the priest and singers

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.900

to the Gregorian chant.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.360

to make notations,

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.460

And it's amazing, now
that you mention it.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.700
When I was in the service,
before that I have to mention,

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:38.320
acknowledge a very special
person, my director.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.040
When I was in the minor
seminary, my father John Biyani,

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.870
for some reason, he
is here, some miracle.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:51.550
And I mentioned him because
in the seminary work we did,

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.120
during prayers, canonical
prayers, you learn the melody,

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.500
you sing with those who know

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.030
and then gradually
pick up the memory.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:06.100
In fact, our community
sings a 17-verse melody,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.290
a stroph which is 17 versus.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:12.430
And it's a tremendous musical
composition, but we learn it

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.180
by practice and it
becomes natural.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:21.060
&gt;&gt; So there's no symbol that
suggests the up and down?

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.360
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal: No.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.660
It just happens.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.960
Yes?

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.460
&gt;&gt; This came from
Syria of course.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:31.350
What's the story of
this language there now?

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:35.430
Does anybody have
any [inaudible]

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.980
in the Syriac language?

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.530
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal: I'm
glad you asked that question,

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.630
but the answer is a sad one.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.020
The history of the
language is sad.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.910
Because in the seventh century,
because of the Arabic invasion,

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.950
it was not like Karela.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.950
There Arabic was imposed.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.560
So the Syriac that you hear

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.400
from the Middle East now
sounds very different.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:02.570
Even the [chanting], it must
have a different flavor there.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.250
And the memory of the
language is dying out there.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:09.420
Whereas in India, there was no
persecution either for the Jews

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.770
or for Christians,
so it survived.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:16.530
So probably the history of the
language is redefined in India.

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.830
Some of the melodies may
be more intact in India

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.810
than in the Middle East.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:26.930
Now not all the melodies came
from Syria or Middle East.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.230
There are some melodies there,

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.560
especially the Portuguese
melodies were composed

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.860
in Karela.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.970
There are very few
samples of that.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:38.090
So Karela has its
own contribution

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:41.530
to the music history of India.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.830
Yeah.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.130
&gt;&gt; One question.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:45.430
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal: Yes.

[ Inaudible ]

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.030
Oh good. I am glad you
asked that question.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:52.540
Aramaic, Christian
Aramaic, is known as Syriac.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.220
The Aramaic language was
a commercial language

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.520
for a long time.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.490
Remember when Emperor
Ahsoka published the edicts,

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.870
Aramaic was one of
the languages.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.170
Which means there are people

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:05.370
who knew only Aramaic
in the kingdom.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.800
Because if you didn't know
the rules of the kingdom,

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.240
your head could be chopped off.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:14.320
So just the way we do Chinese
in Chinatown in New York,

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.410
there were Aramaic inscriptions.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.570
So that was a story there.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:25.910
And then -- so it was already
in the history of the language.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:30.290
And when Christianity came,
literature in Aramaic came

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.590
to be known as Syriac.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.170
Political situations changed.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.700
One major reason
is the translation

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.690
of the Septuagint in Greek.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.690
So Syria Aram, Aramaic,
became Syriac.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.720
And then it stayed on.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.110
Now there's a move among
St. Thomas Christians

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.380
in many Syriac churches in
Karela to take out the Syrian

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.080
and make it Syriac, because
they don't want association

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.050
with Syria.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:59.830
Rather, Syriac Christians.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.680
Thank you for clarifying
that, yes.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.980
Yes?

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.280
&gt;&gt; How about the Portuguese?

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:10.700
When they came to
India, did they try

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.000
to suppress and destroy history?

There is an element,

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.900
because they challenged us.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.570
Basically they thought,
"This is not real."

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:21.310
So they wanted us to change
the language in the Latin

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.260
and chant and all that.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.580
But we resisted.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:30.820
So in the process, one group
broke away from that tradition

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.340
and said, "No, we don't have to
do anything with this people."

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:38.650
So those are the Akarbites,
the orthodox and all that.

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.490
But we, the Siro
Malabar Christians,

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:45.270
stayed with the Portuguese
but translated into Syriac

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.570
and kept the incantations.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.050
So we adopted benediction
of the blessed sacrament,

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.940
we adopted [inaudible] and
we have songs for the --

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:59.510
the song that the children
sang in [inaudible] is --

[ Chanting ]

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.430
It's a hymn to the
blessed virgin.

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:13.930
Probably that was composed

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.760
when we started [inaudible]
and all that.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.720
So we cannot say they
destroyed everything.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.930
I wouldn't use that
word destroy.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.670
They challenged us.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.620
The Siro Malabar Christians
accepted the challenge

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.870
and translated it into
Syriac and moved on.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.330
So in the history of
music, that became a bone

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.790
because we have a new
branch of music in India.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:40.360
And after the Portuguese
left, we didn't do much

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.070
to revive the tradition,
and then we left it.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.420
We cannot blame anybody
for what we are doing now.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.650
I'm glad some of our
priests are stepping forward

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:53.530
to reclaim the Siro
Malabar Church.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:56.300
Otherwise the next
generation will have zero.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.140
So that Siro B stands
for Syriac language.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.340
So I am glad for priests
like Father Justin

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.800
and his assistant Felix Simon.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.340
They are trying to
bring it back.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.350
And someday we will
study the history

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.130
of the language in America.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.520
Amazing. Yes?

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:21.330
&gt;&gt; Question between the
history of the Catholic

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.330
versus the orthodox Jews.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.630
Are there differences?

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.500
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal: Oh yes.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.830
Yes, yes, yes.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:30.880
The orthodox Christians
used west Syriac.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.600
The Catholics, the
Siro Malabar, we use --

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.550
I cannot say Catholic because
Siro Malingula also use

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:37.850
west Syriac.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.870
So the Siro Malabar Church,
these two churches --

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.520
there are eight churches
among Sindon Christians.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.500
Two churches use
Chaldean Syriac.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.320
So what I am singing, what you
heard here, the whole story

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.170
of Chaldean Syriac, east Syriac.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:55.080
West Syriac, the
pronunciation is different.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.380
The basic difference is

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.010
like British English
and American English.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:05.120
Yes. Completely different
melodic repertoire.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.390
They have a very
complex system of music.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:10.360
It is much more complex
than this.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.020
They have us practice
this singing,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:19.000
one chant in eight different
melodies, octo arcos.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.980
[Inaudible] Gregorian chant.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.690
Same text for different seasons.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.350
They sing in eight
different tunes.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.310
Whereas in the eastern
Syriac tradition,

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:32.940
we sing same melody
with different text.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.780
What a beautiful
complementarity.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.560
That means we --

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.040
[ Chanting ]

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.830
We apply that to different
texts in the same major

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:46.170
for different liturgical
context.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.500
So these are complementary
traditions.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.100
It enriches the world.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.200
But for example, to be specific,

00:54:54.200 --> 00:55:01.030
eastern Syriac will say
[foreign phrase], Holy God.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.330
[Foreign word] is God.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:07.510
West Syriac will say
[foreign phrase].

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:11.040
[ Foreign language ]

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.050
Glory be to the father and
the son and the Holy Spirit.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:16.090
[ Foreign language ]

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.510
Whereas we will say --

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:24.040
[ Foreign language ]

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.390
Such differences, yes.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.040
This world of music,

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.640
Syriac music is more
complex than we think.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.940
Thank you for that question.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.890
Yes, please.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:49.150
&gt;&gt; This really isn't
a musical question,

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.810
so I'm not sure I should ask it.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:56:00.470
But I was struck by the fact
that in the church there seemed

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.020
to be many statues, but I didn't
see anything resembling the

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.390
icons that one sees in
the eastern orthodox

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.380
and of course many
oriental orthodoxies.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.680
&gt;&gt; Joseph J. Palackal:
Good observation.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.980
Because these are from
the Siro Malabar churches,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.280
which was Latinized.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.580
So most of the segments
are from that tradition.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.880
That's why you see that.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.180
Good observation.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.480
Thank you.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.780
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: I want

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.580
to thank Dr. Joseph J.
Palackal again for coming.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.480
[ Applause ]

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.150
