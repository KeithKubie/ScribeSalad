00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.190
So as a quick quiz, what allowed the Slammer worm to spread so quickly? Was

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.950
it that TCPs reliable transport ensured a

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.710
clean copy of the worm payload would spread

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.110
to different vulnerable hosts? Was it that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.090
the worm spread by UDP, thereby enabling itself

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.940
to spread with limited network overhead? Was it

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.520
that it could infect many different types of

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.600
operating systems including Linux and Mac OS? Or, was

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.530
it that it could fit in a single packet?
