00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.934
- Forrest, go away!
- Okay.

00:00:02.034 --> 00:00:04.203 align:end position:100%
I just--I have something
that I need to explain to you

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:07.239
that's gonna change absolutely
everything, okay? Just please.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.112 align:end position:100%
Please, this is the last thing
I will ever ask of you.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.680
- What is all this?
- This is all gonna

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.149 align:end position:100%
help you understand
what's happening, okay?

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.351
- Great. Come on in.
- All right. There's a lot

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.085
to walk you through here,
and all of it is important,

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.554
and it's hard
to know where to start.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.489
The first clue that I had that
something was wrong was this.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.157
This is a list
of every single review

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:26.692
that has ever been
sent in to the show,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.694
and all of the ones
that I've done are circled.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.162
Do you know who circled them?

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:30.997
- Grant?
- Yes, exactly.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.232
He told me it was all random.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.400 align:end position:100%
Keep your voice down,
please.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.001 align:end position:100%
You're gonna wake
up Eric and my mom.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.471
(Forrest voice-over)
I laid out all of my evidence
to Suzanne.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.572
All the pain.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.207 align:start position:0%
My review of having
a perfect body, okay?

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.474 align:start size:41% position:59%
Oh, [bleep].
What is this?

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.076 align:start position:0%
And my penis has never been
the same since then.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.444 align:end position:100%
No. [bleep].
Is it still like that?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.247 align:start position:0%
I had the thing taken out,
but it's still weird.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.149
It's like there's too much skin
now 'cause the implant came out.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.818
Let me just show it to you
so you have a sense of--

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:52.752 align:end position:100%
Move on!
I don't want to see it.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
Fine. All right.
Fine, fine, fine.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.155 size:88% position:56%
I don't think that that was
any normal magic eight ball.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.090 align:end position:100%
I think Grant
was controlling it.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.924
- Okay.
- Why did a pillow fight

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.527
have to become so violent?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.528 align:start position:0%
And it turned into
a [bleep] bloodbath.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.431 align:start position:0%
This was supposed
to be a show about life, okay?

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.035 align:start position:0%
Grant turned it into a show
about death. My death.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.536
That's what's happening here.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.073 size:78% position:39%
And so I'm gonna tell him
I have figured it out.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.139 size:88% position:44%
This is not what I signed on
for, and I am out of here,

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm going back to my wife
and my kid,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.144 align:start position:0%
and I'm going back
to my old life.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.013 align:end position:100%
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forrest,

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.147 size:84% position:58%
I think it's really simple.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.650 align:end position:100%
You signed on to
an insane television show,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.853 align:end position:100%
and then you constantly
put that show above your needs

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.156 align:start size:44% position:56%
and the people
that you love.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.526 align:end position:100%
I'm just not seeing
this evil plan.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:37.530
The only person that you need
to be afraid of is yourself.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.365 align:start position:0%
Oh.
[scoffs]

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.735
I'm gonna prove I'm right,
and then I'll be back!

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.572
(Forrest voice-over)
If I was going to convince
Suzanne of my conspiracy theory,

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.174
there was one more thing
I needed to know.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:52.145
Why? Why was Grant
trying to destroy me?

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.114
What had I ever done to him?

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.817
This question plunged me deeper
into the darkness

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:02.288
where I made a shocking
and upsetting discovery.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:08.094
I've been doing some research
here on HTML, ww.google.com.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.562
There's no trace of Grant
anywhere on the internet

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.798
prior to 1995.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.865
It's like he does not exist.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.668
Now, 1995 happens to be
the same year

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.903
that this woman supposedly
married a Chinese guy

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.807
and disappeared to Hong Kong.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.776
This is Gretchen Edelberg,
and she had a really big crush

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.111
on Suzanne when we
were all in college together.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.046
You see where I'm going
with this?

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:30.049
Gretchen, okay, Grant.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.750
Gretchen, Grant.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.919
Gruh, Gruh, Gruh.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.056
She didn't move to Hong Kong.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.457
She got a sex change.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.127
He loves Suzanne so much,
after all this time,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.129
that he's gone
completely crazy.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.398
Get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.266
(Forrest voice-over)
Now that everything
finally made sense,

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.134
it was time to confront
the monster in his lair.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:51.537
Of course
he's not gonna open that gate

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.406
because he knows
that I know the truth,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.640
and he's too much
of a [bleep] coward.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.810
Hey, you're too much
of a [bleep] coward

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.846
to look me in the eye--
oh, [bleep, bleep]!

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.281
Oh, God.
All right.

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.083
Come on.
Let's go.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.084
- You [bleep] monster.
- Forrest.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.019 align:end position:100%
I know everything now.
[bleep].

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.122
- What a nice surprise.
- No.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.757
- The guy's will bring it in.
- Ah, [bleep].

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.493 align:end position:100%
I've figured it all out,
and I'm quitting the show!

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.461
Again?

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:16.228 align:end position:100%
Everything you've tried
to hide from me

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.298 align:start size:72% position:28%
is out in the open now.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.667
You've ruined my life
for the last time, Gretchen.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.703 align:start size:88% position:13%
You bitch.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.136 align:start size:63% position:38%
This should be good.
