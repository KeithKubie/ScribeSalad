00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.029
I would guess that
you're reasonably

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.615
familiar with linear scales.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:05.490
These are the scales
that you would typically

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.319
see in most of
your math classes.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.110
And so just to make
sure we know what we're

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.318
talking about, and maybe
thinking about in a slightly

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.830
different way, let me
draw a linear number line.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.940
Let me start with 0.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.440
And what we're going
to do is, we're

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.630
going to say, look, if I move
this distance right over here,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.820
and if I move that distance
to the right, that's

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.580
equivalent to adding 10.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.060
So if you start at
0 and you add 10,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.720
that would obviously
get you to 10.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.840
If you move that distance
to the right again,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.249
you're going to add 10 again,
that would get you to 20.

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:34.790
And obviously we
could keep doing it,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.650
and get to 30, 40, 50,
so on and so forth.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.095
And also, just
looking at what we

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:40.720
did here, if we go
the other direction.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.170
If we start here, and move
that same distance to the left,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.560
we're clearly subtracting 10.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.550
10 minus 10 is equal to 0.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.960
So if we move that
distance to the left again,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.050
we would get to negative 10.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.400
And if we did it again, we
would get to negative 20.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.000
So the general idea
is, however many times

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.370
we move that distance, we
are essentially adding--

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.015
or however many times you move
that distance to the right-- we

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.090
are essentially adding
that multiple of 10.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.920
If we do it twice,
we're adding 2 times 10.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.490
And that not only works
for whole numbers,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.150
it would work for
fractions as well.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.450
Where would 5 be?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.710
Well to get to 5, we only
have to multiply 10--

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.170
or I guess one way to think
about it is 5 is half of 10.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.910
And so if we want to
only go half of 10,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.930
we only have to go
half this distance.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.960
So if we go half
this distance, that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.150
will get us to 1/2 times 10.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.830
In this case, that would be 5.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.397
If we go to the left, that
would get us to negative 5.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.730
And there's nothing-- let me
draw that a little bit more

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.580
centered, negative 5-- and
there's nothing really new

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.080
here.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.579
We're just kind of
thinking about it

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.720
in a slightly novel way
that's going to be useful

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.010
when we start thinking
about logarithmic.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.360
But this is just the number
line that you've always known.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.776
If we want to put
1 here, we would

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:55.640
move 1/10 of the distance,
because 1 is 1/10 of 10.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.530
So this would be 1, 2,
3, 4, I could just put,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.090
I could label frankly, any
number right over here.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.770
Now this was a situation where
we add 10 or subtract 10.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.090
But it's completely legitimate
to have an alternate way

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.990
of thinking of what you do
when you move this distance.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.800
And let's think about that.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.710
So let's say I have
another line over here.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.085
And you might
guess this is going

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:16.760
to be the logarithmic
number line.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.660
Let me give
ourselves some space.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.025
And let's start this
logarithmic number line at 1.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.150
And I'll let you think
about, after this video, why

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.670
I didn't start it at 0.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.320
And if you start at 1, and
instead of moving that,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.395
so I'm still going to
define that same distance.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.870
But instead of saying that
that same distance is adding 10

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.350
when I move to the
right, I'm going

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.730
to say when I move
the right that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.410
distance on this new number
line that I have created,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.790
that is the same thing
as multiplying by 10.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.860
And so if I move that distance,
I start at 1, I multiply by 10.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.910
That gets me to 10.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.470
And then if I
multiply by 10 again,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.900
if I move by that
distance again,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.520
I'm multiplying by 10 again.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.210
And so that would get me to 100.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.770
I think you can already see the
difference that's happening.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.302
And what about moving to
the left that distance?

00:03:07.302 --> 00:03:09.260
Well we already have kind
of said what happens.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.610
Because if we start
here, we start at 100

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.130
and move to the left of
that distance, what happens?

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.990
Well I divided by 10.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.900
100 divided by 10 gets me 10.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.180
10 divided by 10 get me 1.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.080
And so if I move that
distance to the left again,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.440
I'll divide by 10 again.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.000
That would get me to 1/10.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.330
And if I move that
distance to the left again,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.700
that would get me to 1/100.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.850
And so the general idea
is, is however many times

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.710
I move that distance
to the right,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.990
I'm multiplying my starting
point by 10 that many times.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.520
And so for example, when I
move that distance twice,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.090
so this whole distance
right over here,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.630
I went that distance twice.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.250
So this is times
10 times 10, which

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.860
is the same thing as times
10 to the second power.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.710
And so really I'm raising 10
to what I'm multiplying it

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.070
times 10 to whatever
power, however

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.980
many times I'm
jumping to the right.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.880
Same thing if I go to the left.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.079
If I go to the left
that distance twice--

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.750
let me do that in
a new color-- this

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.760
will be the same thing
as dividing by 10 twice.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.190
Dividing by 10,
dividing by 10, which

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.470
is the same thing as multiplying
by-- one way to think of it--

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.160
1/10 squared.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.060
Or dividing by 10
squared is another way

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.410
of thinking about it.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.170
And so that might
make a little, that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.500
might be hopefully a
little bit intuitive.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.375
And you can already see
why this is valuable.

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.210
We can already on
this number line

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.887
plot a much broader
spectrum of things

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.220
than we can on this number line.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.960
We can go all the way
up to 100, and then

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.560
we even get some
nice granularity

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.380
if we go down to 1/10 and 1/100.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.150
Here we don't get the
granularity at small scales,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.012
and we also don't get to
go to really large numbers.

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:04.220
And if we go a little distance
more, we get to 1,000,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.420
and then we get to 10,000,
so on and so forth.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.940
So we can really cover
a much broader spectrum

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.250
on this line right over here.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.380
But what's also neat
about this is that when

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.950
you move a fixed
distance, so when

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.740
you move fixed distance on
this linear number line,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.954
you're adding or
subtracting that amount.

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:21.370
So if you move
that fixed distance

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.140
you're adding 2 to the right.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.280
If you go to the left,
you're subtracting 2.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680
When you do the same thing
on a logarithmic number line,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.040
this is true of any
logarithmic number line,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.420
you will be scaling
by a fixed factor.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.170
And one way to think about
what that fixed factor is

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.820
is this idea of exponents.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.140
So if you wanted to say, where
would 2 sit on this number

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.360
line?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.027
Then you would just
think to yourself, well,

00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:48.360
if I ask myself where does
100 sit on that number line--

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.910
actually, that might be
a better place to start.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.110
If I said, if I didn't already
plot it and said where does 100

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.290
sit on that number line?

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.790
I would say, how
many times would we

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.280
have to multiply 10
by itself to get 100?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.310
And that's how many times I
need to move this distance.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.900
And so essentially I'll
be asking 10 to the what

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.450
power is equal to 100?

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.910
And then I would get that
question mark is equal to 2.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.710
And then I would move that
many spaces to plot my 100.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.370
Or another way of stating
this exact same thing

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.900
is log base 10 of 100 is
equal to question mark.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.080
And this question mark
is clearly equal to 2.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.440
And that says, I need to plot
the 100 2 of this distance

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.664
to the right.

00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:27.330
And to figure out
where do I plot the 2,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.290
I would do the exact same thing.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.410
I would say 10 to what
power is equal to 2?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.430
Or log base 10 of
2 is equal to what?

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.660
And we can get the
trusty calculator out,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.100
and we can just say log--
and on most calculators

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.070
if there's a log without
the base specified,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.340
they're assuming
base 10-- so log of 2

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.340
is equal to roughly 0.3.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.890
0.301.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.040
So this is equal to 0.301.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.150
So what this tells
us is we need to move

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.110
this fraction of this
distance to get to 2.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.780
If we move this whole distance,
it's like multiplying times 10

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.250
to the first power.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.760
But since we only want to
get 10 to the 0.301 power,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.520
we only want to do
0.301 of this distance.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.490
So it's going to be
roughly a third of this.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.610
It's going to be roughly--
actually, a little less

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.400
than a third.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.910
0.3, not 0.33.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.870
So 2 is going to sit-- let
me do it a little bit more

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.310
to the right-- so 2 is going
to sit right over here.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.000
Now what's really cool about
it is this distance in general

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.660
on this logarithmic number
line means multiplying by 2.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.080
And so if you go that
same distance again,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.780
you're going to get to 4.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.500
If you multiply that
same distance again,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.980
you're going to multiply by 4.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.510
And you go that
same distance again,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.930
you're going to get to 8.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.290
And so if you said
where would I plot 5?

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.569
Where would I plot 5
on this number line?

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:57.110
Well, there's a
couple ways to do it.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.560
You could literally figure out
what the base 10 logarithm of 5

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.870
is, and figure out where
it goes on the number line.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.120
Or you could say,
look, if I start at 10

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.930
and if I move this
distance to the left,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.220
I'm going to be dividing by 2.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.940
So if I move this
distance to the left

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.920
I will be dividing by 2.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.790
I know it's getting a
little bit messy here.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.820
I'll maybe do
another video where

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.852
we learn how to draw a
clean version of this.

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:22.810
So if I start at 10 and
I go that same distance

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.430
I'm dividing by 2.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.440
And so this right here would
be that right over there

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.868
would be 5.

00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:32.159
Now the next question, you
said well where do I plot 3?

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.534
Well we could do the exact
same thing that we did with 2.

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:37.990
We ask ourselves,
what power do we

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.210
have to raise 10 to to get to 3?

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.640
And to get that, we once
again get our calculator out.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.010
log base 10 of 3
is equal to 0.477.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.000
So it's almost halfway.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.216
So it's almost going to
be half of this distance.

00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:53.590
So half of that
distance is going

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.370
to look something
like right over there.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.789
So 3 is going to
go right over here.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.580
And you could do the
logarithm-- let's see,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.550
we're missing 6, 7, and 8.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.480
Oh, we have 8.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.550
We're missing 9.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.820
So to get 9, we just have
to multiply by 3 again.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.640
So this is 3, and if we
go that same distance,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.520
we multiply by 3
again, 9 is going

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.010
to be squeezed in
right over here.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.200
9 is going to be squeezed
in right over there.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.550
And if we want to get to 6,
we just have to multiply by 2.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.450
And we already know the
distance to multiply by 2,

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.360
it's this thing right over here.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.970
So you multiply that by 2,
you do that same distance,

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.859
and you're going to get to 6.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.400
And if you wanted
to figure out where

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.250
7 is, once again you could take
the log base-- let me do it

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.670
right over here-- so
you'll take the log of 7

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.680
is going to be
0.8, roughly 0.85.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.300
So 7 is just going
to be squeezed

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.759
in roughly right over there.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:53.050
And so a couple of neat things
you already appreciated.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.530
One, we can fit more on
this logarithmic scale.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.337
And, as I did with the
video with Vi Hart,

00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:00.920
where she talked
about how we perceive

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.419
many things with
logarithmic scales.

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:05.150
So it actually is a good
way to even understand

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.324
some of human perception.

00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:07.740
But the other
really cool thing is

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.600
when we move a fixed distance
on this logarithmic scale,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.160
we're multiplying
by a fixed constant.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.204
Now the one kind of
strange thing about this,

00:10:15.204 --> 00:10:16.870
and you might have
already noticed here,

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.990
is that we don't see
the numbers lined up

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.230
the way we normally see them.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.092
There's a big jump
from 1 to 2, then

00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:24.466
a smaller jump from 3 to 4,
then a smaller jump from that

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:27.710
from 3 to 4, then even smaller
from 4 to 5, then even smaller

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.520
5 to 6 it gets.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.525
And then 7, 8, 9, you know 7's
going to be right in there.

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:33.150
They get squeeze,
squeeze, squeezed in,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.960
tighter and tighter and
tighter, and then you get 10.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.376
And then you get
another big jump.

00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.650
Because once again, if
you want to get to 20,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.115
you just have to multiply by 2.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.610
So this distance
again gets us to 20.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.290
If you go this
distance over here

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.630
that will get you to 30,
because you're multiplying by 3.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.450
So this right over here
is a times 3 distance.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.070
So if you do that again,
if you do that distance,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.320
then that gets you to 30.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.810
You're multiplying by 3.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.550
And then you can plot the whole
same thing over here again.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.250
But hopefully this gives you
a little bit more intuition

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.690
of why logarithmic number
lines look the way they do.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.976
Or why logarithmic scale
looks the way it does.

00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:12.100
And also, it gives you a
little bit of appreciation

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.680
for why it might be useful.
