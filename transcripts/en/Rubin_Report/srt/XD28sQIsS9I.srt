1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,370
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,900
joining me today is the editor
of human progress dot Oregon,

3
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:12,520
a senior policy analyst at the Center
for Global Liberty and prosperity.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,370
Marion Tupe. Welcome to the Rubin
report. Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,440
I am very excited to have you on. Uh,
we've met once before, uh, for, uh,

6
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:21,550
dinner.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:26,170
but what you're doing with human
progress I think is just spectacular.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,230
You guys are actually promoting good news.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,260
There is actual good news and good
things happening in the world and it

10
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:38,290
seemingly a is something that
people don't often talk about.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,080
So I think you're doing great work and
we're going to spend an hour talking

12
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:44,370
about a lot of the good
stuff that is happening. Uh,

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,740
but I always like to start with
a little bio on people. So, uh,

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,390
tell me a little bit about yourself. How'd
you end up working for human progress?

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,360
Well, I was bullying, uh,

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,150
behind the iron curtain and what it
was then a communist Czechoslovakia.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,360
And so,
uh,

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,440
from early age I started to understand
the importance of political and economic

19
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,780
freedom. Oh, we hit neither, um,

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,360
in regular and it pretty quick,
Huh? That's right. And then, uh,

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,370
when the wall came down in
1999, uh, me and my parents,

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,350
uh,
went for Christmas in Vienna.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,210
That was the first time that you could
actually leave your country and you could

24
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,900
travel abroad, uh, as a family.
Uh, how old were you at the time?

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,410
I was 13. Um, uh,

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,340
because before then, uh, people
still could travel to the west,

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,150
but they would keep the, the, the, the
children behind as far as stitches.

28
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,820
But now that the wall came
down and comes in, collapsed,

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,270
you could travel anywhere he wanted.
So we decided to go to Vienna.

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,660
And the moment that we crossed the
border into a Western capitalist liberal

31
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,520
democracy,
uh,

32
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,440
it was like stepping out of a
black and white movie into a,

33
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,470
a color film. Uh, everything
was just so much beautiful,

34
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:06,280
so much more beautiful.
Um, the shops were full,

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,410
people were smiling, that was
color everywhere. And, uh,

36
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,930
so I think that even at
that early stage of my life,

37
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,950
I started to think about
what makes countries rich,

38
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:22,620
what makes countries poor. And that's,
I think where my interest in, uh, in,

39
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,980
in all of that started.
Really.

40
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,970
Yeah. Tell me a little bit
about your, your education.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,190
Well, I, uh, went to high school
and a undergraduate in Johannesburg,

42
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,310
South Africa of all
places, uh, because, uh,

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,450
when the wall came down and my
parents emigrated to, to South Africa,

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,400
they are medical doctors. And so with
our expertise was, was needed. Um,

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,430
so as a kid I got to see both the
fall of communism and also the fall of

46
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,290
apartheid, which is kind of
a unique experience. And, um,

47
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,140
I'm very glad I had the kind of
childhood or upbringing I had. Um,

48
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,230
and uh,
so I,

49
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:03,670
so I finished my undergraduate at
the University of Witwatersrand in

50
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:08,530
Johannesburg and then I went to do my
master's and my phd at Saint Andrews in

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,800
Scotland. Um, yeah. Well,

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,860
what's it like being in these places when
something is falling like communism or

53
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:16,930
apartheid?

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,110
Because we seem to live in a time right
now where a lot of people think that

55
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:23,580
we're watching parts of the
west kind of fall. And you,

56
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:27,610
you've seen some stuff fall. Yes,
I think that, uh, for the vast,

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,280
vast majority of the
population in Czechoslovakia,

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,490
clearly the fall of communism
was a tremendous blessing.

59
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:38,260
There was immense amount of optimism,
um,

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,320
about the future and also unavoidable
disappointment with some aspects of the

61
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,820
Utopian future that people
have imagined. Nonetheless. Um,

62
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,900
just about anybody who analyzes economics
and politics in central and eastern

63
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:57,100
Europe over the last 25 years
concludes that people are much,

64
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,110
much better off than they used to be.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,460
And I think the similar thing was
happening for a vast majority of South

66
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,210
Africans, especially black South
Africans who never had a vote,

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,260
who never had political rights or
most political rights and are partied.

68
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,750
And of course, in 1994, um,

69
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,670
so Africa held its first
multiracial democratic
elections. And as a consequence,

70
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,970
there was also a tremendous
amount of optimism, again,

71
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,230
followed by the inevitable
disappointments as reality set in.

72
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,220
And nonetheless,

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,280
it's an extraordinary time of
enthusiasm and optimism and tremendous,

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,210
I think, um, sense of
brotherhood between people. Yeah.

75
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,710
Do you think that's necessary?

76
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,730
That sort of Utopian vision of when things
are changing that everything is going

77
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,550
to be magically fixed and better.
And then as you're saying,

78
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,770
then there's that period
where you go, oh, it didn't,

79
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,230
everything didn't magically
get fixed at once,

80
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,560
but you sort of need
that vision to get there.

81
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,990
You sort of need that to
kind of see in the distance.

82
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
I think you appeal to a Utopian vision
of the future as you consolidate,

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,110
uh, democracy, uh, in,
in, in the case of, um,

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,150
in the case of Eastern Europe and as
you consolidate multiracial democracy in

85
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:15,520
the case of, uh, in the
case of South Africa,

86
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,440
but ultimately utopianism
is the great enemy of, uh,

87
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,430
of, of human progress. Uh,

88
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,140
because I think that human
progress needs to be,

89
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,260
needs to be measured in terms of the
past rather than some sort of a utopian

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,050
future. Human progress is an
incremental, uh, process, um,

91
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,840
where you are trying to decide,
okay, is today better than yesterday?

92
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,650
And if so, that is progress. Um,

93
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,190
but the problems are going to be
with us forever. The question is,

94
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,310
are we actually improving incrementally
in important areas of human wellbeing on

95
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,190
daily basis? Is that
one of the, with how we

96
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,100
ingest news? Because I was
telling you before we started,

97
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:06,080
like I went on human progress this
morning and it feels good to me. I mean,

98
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,990
the layout of the site is great and you
and the images and the colors and all

99
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,111
that,

100
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:14,111
but like seeing so many consistently
good things trending that you don't see

101
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,420
anywhere else. And we're going to,
we're going to get into many of them.

102
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,620
Is that just,

103
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,280
is it hard to get clicks
because people don't like the,

104
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,280
Oh,

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,910
things are a little better than yesterday
and a little and the long trends when

106
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,300
they just want the day to day
craziness and headlines and all that.

107
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,950
Yes. Uh, I,

108
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,880
I wouldn't be the first one to
point to the nature of news. Uh,

109
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,970
the fact that news is about things that
happen as Steven pinker who always likes

110
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,070
to say,
you know,

111
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,290
there is no journalist standing in the
middle of a city that he's at peace

112
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,370
saying, you know, I'm here in
a Luanda the capital of, um,

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,990
whatever it is a on goal, I think. Um,

114
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,230
and there is no civil war. Uh, you know,

115
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:04,500
journalists go to places where terrible
things happen and they report on those

116
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:05,334
things.

117
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,320
And so that gives a secured image
of what is happening in the world.

118
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,870
If it bleeds, it leads. I mean, that is,

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,760
that is a well known phenomenon combined
with the nature of the social media.

120
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:22,050
Certainly I think that, um, uh,

121
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,160
Twitter and uh, and, and smartphones, uh,

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,130
make terrible things immediate
and intimate. So, uh,

123
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,900
you know, we were able to watch
tsunami in Japan in real time.

124
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,330
We saw destruction and death of
thousands of people in real time,

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,510
whereas, you know, a couple
of decades, a few decades ago,

126
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,520
and certainly few centuries ago,

127
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,020
you would never have known that a terrible
thing has happened on the other side

128
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:55,760
of the world.

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,260
Does that complicate your work?

130
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,760
Do you think that that people get
information so quickly that then maybe are

131
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,480
making misjudgments because they're
not looking at the sort of long view of

132
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:05,830
history?

133
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm not sure if it complicates things
because pessimism is part of human nature.

134
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,620
Um, it's, uh, it also enables us to, to,

135
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,960
to respond, uh, to these
stories in a quicker time,

136
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,970
uh, to be able to say, uh,
on our website at least.

137
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,410
Look, it is true that there
was, in this particular case,

138
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,290
um,
tsunami and people have died.

139
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,900
But look at the longterm
trends in terms of, uh,

140
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,030
people dying and property being damaged
due to extreme weather events or natural

141
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,930
catastrophes. And the train
is, the trend is declining.

142
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,820
So we are also able to use the
social media to, to respond to it.

143
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,910
Um, the, the, the problem is that
good news doesn't get picked up,

144
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,870
uh,

145
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,870
as often as the bad news
because the bad news leads,

146
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,740
uh, the, the good news doesn't, yeah. And
there's just a psychological component.

147
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,340
There might be an evolutionary reason
we focus on the bad things maybe for

148
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,060
survival or something to that effect. Yes.
I'm John tooby and [inaudible] cousin.

149
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:20,880
He dies from University of, uh, is it
southern California? At Santa Barbara?

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah. Um, they are, uh,

151
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,890
they are the pioneers of,
uh, of evolutionary biology.

152
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,830
Uh, they believe that our
brains have evolved, um, in, uh,

153
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,870
at a time in tens of thousands of years
ago when the world was just a much more

154
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,990
inhospitable place than what it is today.
Um,

155
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,970
the world where there was
omnipresent danger from, uh,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,740
other tribes from wild
animals, from poisonings, um,

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,050
and, um, um, at a time when
life expectancy was very low.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,430
And,
uh,

159
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,460
they like to say that our modern
skulls house and shunned minds and we,

160
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,850
and,

161
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,850
and the kind of psychological responses
that we have evolved for tens a

162
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,950
thousands of years ago,
um,

163
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,170
are difficult to apply to modernity,

164
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:26,340
which is just so fundamentally different
than what it was until relatively

165
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,310
recently. The, the,

166
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:32,311
the key period here in time history is
the last 200 to 250 years when the world

167
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,700
really has changed beyond all recognition.
So in a weird way, are we almost,

168
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,540
we as humans, are we almost
victims of our own success? I mean,

169
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:47,280
that's sort of what it sounds like.
Like we've, we've done so much good.

170
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,310
We have advanced so far that now were
we mitt picco about little things

171
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,290
constantly and think they're massive
when, yeah, we're not dying of mass.

172
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,590
We're, we're doing a lot with disease,
which we're going to get two and,

173
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:01,740
and a whole bunch of other things.

174
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,820
We've made our lives way
safer and extended our lives
and all of these things.

175
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,810
So we're almost a victim of
all of that. Goodness. Yes.

176
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:13,710
So from an evolutionary perspective,
again, the research of others,

177
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:18,711
not my own overreaction to a
potentially bad thing happening head,

178
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:24,690
a lower cost to the organism,
in this case,

179
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,640
a human being than under reaction.
Um,

180
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,570
if you overreacted, uh, saw something
that may have been potentially harmful,

181
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,270
you all reacted to it,
but, but you survived.

182
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,890
Whereas if you under reacted to something
that was potentially harmful, then,

183
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,270
uh, your gene pool ended
right there and then, yeah.

184
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,460
So those genes that didn't get
passed on, so yeah. So, so yes. Um,

185
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,010
um, the complexity of
the modern economy, um,

186
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,000
the complexity of the social interactions,
um,

187
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,870
global trading system for
example, is, uh, certainly, um,

188
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,020
uh, much greater than what
our ancestors were exposed to.

189
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,040
And so it is, um, perhaps not
surprising that a lot of people are,

190
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,720
um, uh, little be a little bit
uneasy or continue to be uneasy.

191
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,310
Then again,

192
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,400
the website is there to show
people precisely how bad
things were before and how

193
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,840
good things are now. So don't
get depressed, um, too much.

194
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,730
Um, there is a good story to
be told about humanity. Yeah,

195
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,540
it's interesting when
I go speak at colleges,

196
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,950
one of the lines that I think does
actually work with young people who are,

197
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:39,191
you know,

198
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,520
if they're protesting and
they're screaming about
the patriarchy and evils of

199
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,970
capitalism and all of this stuff,
I'll always say to them, you know,

200
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,230
does anyone in this room not have
it better than their grandparents?

201
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,890
And certainly in the United States,
but if you live in the western world,

202
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,300
basically everybody does pretty much.
I've yet to find someone that doesn't.

203
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,580
And I always think that's really
effective way of getting people who,

204
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,970
who are so focused on the negative to go,
oh, something good must have happened.

205
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:11,390
Because, you know, even though I like
to, to scream about my victim hood,

206
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,980
it's a lot better than what my
grandparents had. Yes. I mean take, uh,

207
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,570
something like,
uh,

208
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:21,571
like a women's equality or gay quality
or even caring about the environment and

209
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,880
uh, and um, uh, and animal rights
or animal welfare, I should say.

210
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,920
Um, Jonathan Heit from, uh, um,

211
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,150
New York University says that capitalism
actually fundamentally transforms,

212
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,100
uh, our, uh, sense of values. Um,

213
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,040
um,
because or priorities I should maybe say,

214
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,960
because when we are extremely poor,
uh,

215
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,990
which is to say the first
99.9% of Homo sapiens on earth,

216
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,160
right? Um, uh, the, the,

217
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:04,540
the primary objective of any individual
human being was, was to survive.

218
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,700
You had to somehow get hold of enough
calories to make it to the next day.

219
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,090
You had to somehow avoid being murdered
by somebody who wanted your stuff.

220
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,910
Yeah. Um, uh, you had to
somehow protect your family.

221
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,290
You had to keep away from
cold, from heat, et cetera.

222
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,900
But in the last 200 years or so,
our incomes have skyrocketed. Uh,

223
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,750
the world is roughly speaking,
adjusted for inflation.

224
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:35,140
I can't say this often enough because
we'll always have that, oh God,

225
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,660
you're not adjusting for that course.

226
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,280
We are adjusting for inflation
adjusted for inflation.

227
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,700
The World Everage is roughly 12
times better off than what it was in,

228
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:50,320
uh, in 1820. So we have
become much richer.

229
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,650
And when you no longer have to
worry about things like survival,

230
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,240
you start caring about
things, uh, like, um,

231
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,390
the nature of the society
that you live in. Uh,

232
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,300
the fairness of treatment of
your fellow human beings. Uh,

233
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,720
you start caring about women equality,
as I said,

234
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,310
you'll start caring about gay rights.

235
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:18,050
You start caring about animal protection
and environmental protection. So,

236
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:22,010
um, uh, so in that sense, um, the, the,

237
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,080
the tremendous increase in incomes and,

238
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:30,081
and general wealth of this society has
also contributed to creating and much

239
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,500
fairer and much more egalitarian society.

240
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,830
So capitalism isn't all evil
is now what you're telling me.

241
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,510
People who think Adelson,
Sh, uh, is evil. I,

242
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,860
I highly recommend that they visit Cuba.
They visit Venezuela,

243
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,870
either visited North Korea
in countries which have,

244
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,030
which have taken deliberately a
step in the opposite direction. Um,

245
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,240
capitalism has its problems.
Uh,

246
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,280
liberal democracy has his problems
and it is our task to try to fix these

247
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,200
problems on the margins.
Uh,

248
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,230
but to throw out the economic and
social underpinnings of modernity,

249
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,720
of this, of this extraordinary
age of abundance, uh,

250
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,710
would be a mistake.

251
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,840
Are you shocked at the amount of people
in the West that seemingly want to do

252
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:25,810
just that? Um, no. Uh,

253
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,653
I'm much,

254
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,310
I'm not in a shocked by the fact that
in eastern Europe where I'm from,

255
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,170
um,
uh,

256
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,350
people who are in their early
teens and into the late teens,

257
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,650
p people who have never
experienced communists and
people who are born after the

258
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:46,610
fall of the Berlin Wall are now embracing

259
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,700
socialist ideas,

260
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:53,360
or at least those socialist ideas are
now increasingly popular amongst young

261
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,720
people. Which day, which is certainly
our, and amongst people of my generation.

262
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,040
What do you chalk that up to you?

263
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,110
Cause I don't think it's just that they
didn't experience is it, is it, is it,

264
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,120
is it just that Utopian dream that we
all have or is it just that it all sounds

265
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:07,460
good?
The endless cry of equality,

266
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,310
which of course it never turns out
to be equality. It all is just,

267
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:15,311
if you don't want to really deeply think
about a system or then communism or

268
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:19,700
socialism is, is pretty good.
Well, not to say that, uh,

269
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,450
that every generation needs to be
educated in the benefits of freedom.

270
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,890
And I think that even filing fighters,
we're talking about something about, uh,

271
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,060
you know, uh, we are always one
generation away from, from tyranny.

272
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,310
Now what that meant was to say that

273
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,070
there is something perhaps
in human nature, um,

274
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,930
that drags us back into that,
um,

275
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,110
into that tribal socialistic mindset.
Now,

276
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,730
there are a lot of theories about that.

277
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,750
One possible theory is that
actually as we grow up,

278
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,200
we grow up in a,
uh,

279
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,600
in the only functioning communist,

280
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,820
a communist society or communist
institution, which is the family.

281
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,100
Hmm. Um, in a family,
especially a nuclear family, uh,

282
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,110
people share wildly. Um,
children are not expected to,

283
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,290
uh, earn a, their
breakfast, uh, by, uh, um,

284
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,190
um, I dunno, bringing home the
Bacon or whatever, you know,

285
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:30,630
things get chair very, very equally
and so forth. And, and that can work,

286
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,380
um, on a, on a sort of
nuclear family level,

287
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,400
the further you go, the
less it works. I mean,

288
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,180
what you are prepared to do for
your children is not the same,

289
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,920
which you are prepared
to do for your cousins.

290
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,560
It's not the same what you are
prepared to do for your second cousins,

291
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,810
for your fellow citizens
and for that matter,

292
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,640
for people on the opposite side of
the world. And so, uh, the, the,

293
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,900
the fact that we are able
to conduct our affairs,

294
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,040
um, uh, on, on a, uh, along these,

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,950
along these socialist lines,
uh, in, in nuclear family, um,

296
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,230
doesn't then translate into,
into the society as a whole.

297
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:14,970
So that may be one reason. Another
reason may be that, that, um,

298
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,860
um, there is some within human
beings within human psychology,

299
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,180
a tendency to want to bring down
people who have gotten too far up.

300
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,810
If you're thinking about
tribal society, uh, or,

301
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,530
or these roaming groups of
hunter gatherers of say,
between 50 and 150 people,

302
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,980
um, where everybody, uh,

303
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,090
you didn't want all the women and all
the food to be monopolized by the one

304
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:50,220
alpha male. So the, usually there
was some sort of a combination of,

305
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,450
of an alliance made by other males
to bring this up on the hill down.

306
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,150
So there would be a greater sharing.
And,

307
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,670
and that was good for the
Alpha male too, right? I mean,

308
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:03,030
he wanted to survive himself and if he
survived it, it's all right. I mean,

309
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:07,970
I mean in, in, uh, amongst the
chimps and, uh, uh, so forth. The,

310
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,480
the Alpha male that's
usually and very poorly.

311
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,310
Um, so that may be another reason
and other reasons maybe that, uh,

312
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,080
in the hunter gathering society,

313
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,000
some of the food would be shared equally.
There was,

314
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,470
for example, if you killed an animal,
uh, there was no refrigeration.

315
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:33,220
You couldn't store it. There wasn't no
accumulation of wealth in that sense. Uh,

316
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,990
and so things did get shared amongst
the members of the group. Uh,

317
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,060
plus there wasn't no accumulation
of wealth because, um,

318
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,300
because you are constantly moving,

319
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:46,920
so whatever your acquired was limited to
whatever you were able to carry on the

320
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,920
back, on your back. Yeah. Um, so yes,

321
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,760
the differences between people,
um,

322
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,980
at least to the extent that
we are experiencing now, uh,

323
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,080
is something that is probably quite
new from an evolutionary standpoint.

324
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:06,230
So all of these reasons,
um, ensure that, um, and,

325
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:11,231
and many more ensure that young people
or rather every generation needs to be

326
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,650
explicitly educated in why,
uh,

327
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,440
the economy that we have today,

328
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,400
which is so different from
what our ancestors have
experienced is actually good

329
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:25,360
for us. Free trade is a
very good example. Um, uh,

330
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,070
free trade contributes to
economic growth, and yet, uh, um,

331
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,530
every generation you have a new
push for protectionism. Again,

332
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,620
the complexity of the economy has outpaced
our ability to understand it without

333
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,970
explicit learning. Yeah. All right.

334
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:44,380
So let's talk about a whole bunch of
these trends that are happening right in

335
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,530
front of our eyes, but as you said,
they're happening incrementally,

336
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:51,120
so people don't necessarily
focus on them enough. Uh, well,

337
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,510
I'll let you kick off the person.
What do you,

338
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,560
what do you think is the most encouraging
worldwide trend at the moment?

339
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,130
Or what's exciting you the most proud?
Well,

340
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,370
so the human progress is
unabashedly unabashedly about, uh,

341
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,810
it's a huge human centric,
uh,

342
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,970
which is to say that would be considered
the welfare and the flourishing of a

343
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:14,170
human being. All human
beings, uh, to be, uh,

344
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,540
to be a really important
of primary importance.

345
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,140
That's an interesting distinction because
you didn't call it earth progress dot

346
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,981
or a great,
I mean,

347
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:24,670
the idea was that this is so that
humans can figure out the best place,

348
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,600
the best way to live here, and
hopefully that's good for the earth too.

349
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:33,060
But that humans actually our number one
here, yes, we can certainly talk, um,

350
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,930
late and to show about,
uh,

351
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:40,110
is it possible for humans to coexist
with the earth and the animals and,

352
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,220
and what can we do to make sure
that that actually happens?

353
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,610
But human progress is a
humanistic project and, um,

354
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,063
uh,

355
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,600
clearly there is no more fundamental
aspect of human flourishing than staying

356
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:59,290
alive. And, uh, here, uh,

357
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:03,130
we have seen tremendous improvement.
Um,

358
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,660
prior to 18 hundreds,
uh,

359
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,850
life expectancy around the world was
anywhere between 25 and 30 years.

360
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,980
Since time in memorial,
uh, as late as 1950, sorry,

361
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,940
as late as 1900 in the richest
countries of the world,

362
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,440
life expectancy was only 50 years.
Today,

363
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,930
globally, it's 70 years in
do United States is 78 years.

364
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,480
And in places like Japan, it's 88 years.
So wait, let's, let's not gloss over that.

365
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,810
Cause those were some powerful numbers.

366
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,860
So in 1900 the average life
expectancy was 50 years.

367
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,850
So been in rich countries,
in rich countries enrich galleries,

368
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,000
that's even more impressive, so to
speak. How we've advanced it. So you're,

369
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,350
you're saying basically in the hundred
20 years since then or so we've extended

370
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:56,330
it by 20 years of being slain
by, so two years in, in the west,

371
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,070
in rich countries, and
by about, and, and, and,

372
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,470
and every person today say somebody
living in Malaysia lives 20 years longer

373
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,800
than rich people did in 1900.
Yeah, that's incredible.

374
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:13,130
So in 120 years in,
in rich western countries,

375
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:17,000
we extended life 30 years in 120
days. I mean, that's, that's,

376
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,080
that's almost unfathomable actually.
Uh, it's, it's, it's wonderful.

377
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,470
And so that's the first thing is
that people want to stay alive. Um,

378
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,910
because they, they, they enjoy it. Yeah.

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,540
Can you give me some of the markers
of how we actually did that? Well, uh,

380
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,230
one thing is decline in violence,
which again, Steven pinker has.

381
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,360
I switched on the whole book
about, um, um, uh, you know,

382
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,290
um,
rates of people dying in wars.

383
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,430
I have a have declined certainly since
the end of the Second World War. Um,

384
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,160
today for the first time in human history,
uh,

385
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,190
there is no hot conflict between two
states that have declared war on each

386
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:00,980
other.

387
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,420
So we still have a frozen conflict
between North Korea and the United States.

388
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,670
Uh, we have, uh, we have the Russian
invasion of the eastern Ukraine,

389
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,890
but even then, Russia and Ukraine
are not officially at war.

390
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,100
So there's this old concept
of two countries, you know,

391
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,670
declaring war on each other and then
going towards this actually has actually,

392
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,390
well at this stage it has
disappeared. Yeah. Um,

393
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,900
but almost be unfathomable these days
were two warring countries with full on

394
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:34,400
wars were invading each other
in the traditional sense.

395
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,790
It would almost be hard to imagine
what that would look like. Now.

396
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,060
That is very awkward cause that,
yeah. Um, hopefully it stays that way.

397
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,300
One thing to remember about,
about,

398
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,720
about human progress is that there
is nothing predetermined about it.

399
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,640
It is not linear. There are obviously
things which can go terribly wrong.

400
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,650
Uh,
the 20th century,

401
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:59,000
you have the first world war and possibly
the most unnecessary major conflict,

402
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,310
uh, in, in recent centuries,
uh, followed by, uh,

403
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,310
the Second World War and the Holocaust,
the Gulag and what have you.

404
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
But the remarkable thing about human
progress and humanity as a whole,

405
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:17,000
it's, is that at this quite robust,
at the end of the 20th century,

406
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:20,600
life expectancy are still longer than
what it was at the beginning of the 20th

407
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,820
century.
We are still consuming more calories,

408
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:25,040
more people went to school
and so on and so forth.

409
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,060
In spite of the 20th century of being
actually quite violent anyhow, since the,

410
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:30,590
since the end of the Second World War,

411
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,580
a world has gotten progressively
more peaceful. Then of course,

412
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,010
you have medical breakthroughs.
Um,

413
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,890
let's pause on the violence part for
just a second because I think it's one of

414
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:43,800
those things where you can say that to
people and you can talk all about the

415
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,390
wars that don't exist anymore
and that there are, you know,

416
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,960
genocides the way they were
in on all of those things.

417
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,170
It thus though admitting that some
bad things are still happening,

418
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,280
I think people just don't buy it.
They,

419
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,560
they see school shootings or they see,
you know,

420
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,860
a riot here or something happening
all over the place and they just

421
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,500
automatically believe
things are getting worse.

422
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,430
That sort of gets us to where we started
about how technology is a part of this.

423
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,230
But how difficult is that for you just
to get the truth across to people and

424
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,710
have them actually accept it while
at the same time they are looking at,

425
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,580
you know, a shooting or this or that, that
they can just quickly see online. Yeah.

426
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:24,990
You've got to look at the longterm trends
and try to figure out whether things

427
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:29,130
in fact are getting worse
or whether this is a blip.

428
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,360
Um, you know, the line of
progress, again, it's not linear,

429
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,830
it his jacket and um,
and there is no, uh, uh,

430
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,330
once again, there's no
guarantee that, uh, that,

431
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,230
that things will continue to improve.
So you have to look at long term trends.

432
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:51,231
I think the Atlantic around a story a
few months ago after the latest a school

433
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:55,950
shooting showing that actually the number
of kids dying at schools horrible as

434
00:27:55,951 --> 00:28:00,840
it is. Yeah. Um, have
been on a decline. Um,

435
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,870
so yeah, so longterm trends. Um,

436
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,070
and then having journalists actually
reported those long term trends that,

437
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,930
that that would be key. Yeah. So,

438
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:13,680
so violence is one thing we'll
live in less violent times.

439
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:17,280
The second thing is that the medical
breakthroughs were absolutely fundamental.

440
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,140
Uh, and here I would point simply to
two things. One was vaccination. Um,

441
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,410
a guy called Jenner and Mitt,

442
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,950
I believe mid 18th century England
north that milkmaids didn't get,

443
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,960
uh, didn't get a small box of smallpox
was absolutely horrifying disease.

444
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,140
I mean your body would be
covered with these, um,

445
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,210
with these youth hostels and,
and you know,

446
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:50,130
80% of kids who got it dyed a up to
60% of adults who got it, who died,

447
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,120
you know, died, uh, in, in
the 18th century, France,

448
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:59,121
it was estimated 95% of the population
got smallpox at one point of their lives

449
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:04,920
or another, and gender notice that
milkmaids didn't get smallpox.

450
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,370
That's because they got a milder
version of the POCs from cars.

451
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,290
And so he started inoculating
people with the POCs from the cow.

452
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,010
And because the Latin
word for cow is a vodka,

453
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,990
our word vaccination come some from that.
And that was a major improvement.

454
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,850
The other thing that happened was, um, uh,

455
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,540
was at humanity discovered
the germ theory of disease.

456
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,093
Um,

457
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,780
we didn't know that disease
will spread via germs.

458
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,200
People had all sorts of weird ideas
about humors in the body and mia somatic

459
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,110
theories and what have you.
And it was all nonsense. Uh,

460
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:55,170
but the upshot of as being so ignorant
about how disease spreads or is that

461
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:59,460
people, for example, didn't
wash their hands. Uh,

462
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,990
you can imagine,
right?

463
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,780
Farmer is using human
excrement in order to Fel,

464
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,240
fertilize his fields and comes
home and sits down to dinner.

465
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,160
And you can imagine what sort
of diseases literally now, um,

466
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,320
Jews, funny enough who
washed their hands, uh,

467
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,610
as part of their religious
rituals at penny to fall, uh,

468
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,240
less sick and die at a lower
rate than the rest of the,

469
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,670
of the European population.
But once again,

470
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:33,100
because people are so ignorant
about how these easy spread,

471
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:34,480
they assumed it wasn't magic,

472
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,760
which again led to pogroms and
discrimination against the Jews. But,

473
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,470
um, even doctors, uh, didn't, um,

474
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,200
doctors also didn't change their clothes,
uh,

475
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,060
because the more blood and Gore
you head on your clothes, uh,

476
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,630
the more it's signified to the potential
patient that you are a doctor in great

477
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:59,350
demand. Right? So, so, so doctorates,

478
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:00,970
we're actually a massive,

479
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,440
a reason or on one of the major
reasons why disease spread.

480
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,970
They went from their second
corpses to delivering babies,

481
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,490
introducing pathogen into,
into, into the body of a, uh,

482
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,080
of a mother and a,

483
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,800
and all that stopped basically after,
uh,

484
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,110
a discovery of the germ theory
of disease. Uh, and, and, uh, uh,

485
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,160
child mortality,

486
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,910
maternal mortality started to decline and
life expectancy showed up as a result.

487
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,080
Yeah. What else is going on with
the diseases of today that we're,

488
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,770
we're getting close to eradicating some
things that still exist, right. Well,

489
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,460
we are very close to eradicating polio.
Uh,

490
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,830
there are some what's called wild
cases of polio in, uh, in, uh,

491
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,750
places like the Congo. Um, uh,

492
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,050
of course we have, we have, uh,

493
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,580
made HIV aids, uh, or
rather we have, we have, uh,

494
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,790
created drugs that no longer
make HIV AIDS death sentence.

495
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,760
Um, which, you know,

496
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,670
considering it only took a from 1981 when
we first started talking about HIV age

497
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,560
to about 1994,
1995,

498
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:18,220
when the first antiretroviral
drugs came along, uh,

499
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,300
only 14 or 15 years, uh, that, that sort
of marketable accomplishment. I mean,

500
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:27,010
people have lived with small bugs for
a millennia. Um, so we have, we have,

501
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,180
we were able to do that.

502
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,830
Now the other thing which is quite
extraordinary is that cancer rates are

503
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:36,400
declining. Now, the reason why
that's so interesting is that

504
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,400
incidentally of cancer increased with age.

505
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,880
So as people grow older and on average
we continue to to increase our life

506
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:50,720
expectancy, the chances of you contracting
or developing cancer, not contracting,

507
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,920
but developing cancer get much
higher. Cancer is basically just, um,

508
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,750
cells dividing, uh, during
a normal process, um,

509
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,610
of, of human body, um, uh, existing.

510
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,930
Uh, but, uh, the more
subdivision of cells you get,

511
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:12,530
the more likely it is that one of
them is going to go crazy and start

512
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,130
subdividing without control and
cause cancer and you're going to die.

513
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,050
And the fact that cancer rates for men
and women are declining certainly in rich

514
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:25,760
countries, even though life
expectancy shooting up,
that's again an extraordinary,

515
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,110
um, an extraordinary achievement.
Um, because of early detection,

516
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:34,570
because of better drugs. Now
with Crispr cas nine, the um,

517
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,570
the gene editing, uh, system, uh,

518
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,240
we are probably going to be able
to focus on personalized medicines.

519
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,240
So we are going to be able to create
drugs specifically for one individual or

520
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,300
group of individuals who share. Um, can,

521
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:54,170
can you explain CRISPR a little bit
just for those that are, you know,

522
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,580
you don't have to give
you a major equation,

523
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,530
but like the sort of the most
simple explanation of it.

524
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:00,300
I was reading something on the side of
the today about CRISPR. Yeah. Well it's,

525
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:04,920
it's, it's a gene editing technique,
uh, which is to say that, uh,

526
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,200
hypothetically, and hopefully we're
not very far from, from that. Uh,

527
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,120
from that time you'll be able
to splice out of the genome, uh,

528
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
to cut out from the genome,
uh,

529
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,410
genes which are responsible
for a congenital diseases,

530
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,840
uh, which would be, uh, which
would be a very nice, uh,

531
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,840
it would be very nice to know
that if a child gets born,

532
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,800
it will develop multiple sclerosis,
uh, 20 years down the line and die in,

533
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,870
in terrible pain.

534
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,770
So these are the sorts of things that
we could do it with CRISPR. Yeah. Uh,

535
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:40,970
I want to move on to the environment,

536
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:44,120
but is there anything else on
the mathematical data? I mean,

537
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,720
education is the obvious, uh,
example. Uh, obviously, uh,

538
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,290
80% of the world is literate.

539
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,920
What is most of the time people
were not literate on those?

540
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:59,060
Now a gender parity between
boys and girls? Pretty much, uh,

541
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,770
on average in the world. Uh, again,

542
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,240
something to be happy about
because historically, uh,

543
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,850
girls were kept from education at
a higher rate than boys. I mean,

544
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:12,890
even in Afghanistan and now,
uh,

545
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,140
girls are allowed to go to school,
which again, is a wonderful thing.

546
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,170
And nutrition, I would, I would
really like to end with nutrition,

547
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:24,080
which is to say that,
um,

548
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,330
famine has disappeared from
the world outside of war zones.

549
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:33,220
We all remember those images
of starving children, um,

550
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,580
with inflated Belize in
Ethiopia, the early 1980s. Yeah.

551
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,250
And, um, uh, that's,
that's pretty much uh,

552
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,000
disappeared and, um, um, uh,

553
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,860
hunger was basically a normal human
condition throughout our history and,

554
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,910
uh, today, um,

555
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,920
and every African consumes
as many calories as the
Portuguese did in the early

556
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,250
1960s.
Just about everywhere in the world,

557
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,220
people are consuming more calories than,
uh,

558
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,600
than what the USDA recommends,
should be the average intake.

559
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,880
And in, in Africa, they are
certainly reaching that threshold.

560
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,860
And Africa is important because that's
really where absolute poverty, um,

561
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,350
continues to be a major problem. Um, I,

562
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,150
I think it's fair to say that
absolute poverty is going to,

563
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,220
is ending as a global problem. It
is now going to remain as a, as a,

564
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,610
as a, uh, as an African problem. Um,

565
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,330
that is concentrated in a couple
of African country in, in,

566
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,900
in a few African countries, including
places like the Congo. All right,

567
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,670
so let's shift to the environment.

568
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,280
You listened to the news.
It's getting hotter.

569
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,910
Everybody's freaking out about everything.
We don't have clean water.

570
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,050
All of these things

571
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,680
calm me down. Well, I don't want to
get into a debate. It's a debate over,

572
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:01,360
over the signs of, of global warming.
I'll leave it to the specialist. Um,

573
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,170
certainly I do acknowledge that there is
a consensus that the world is warming.

574
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,570
Uh,
whether it is warming at a,

575
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,070
at a too high a rate or a lukewarming
rate and where it is heading.

576
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,450
Obviously prediction of the future is
that that's the most difficult thing.

577
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,460
I'm going to leave that to, to a
specialty center scientists. Yeah.

578
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,890
Just very quickly on that though,

579
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,170
is it possible that in some of
the places that it's warming,

580
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:27,790
it's actually good that it's warming?
Well, a, suddenly this, this, uh,

581
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,610
this one scientist from Holland
called a professor tall,

582
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,760
has a calculated, uh, the,

583
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,840
the likely costs and benefits of
global warming until 2080 or so.

584
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,230
And he thought that, uh, um,
because of the growing, uh,

585
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,670
because of the longer growing season,
we'll be able to actually bring in, uh,

586
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,390
more, uh, more and more
food grow, grow more food.

587
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,400
We also thought that,
uh,

588
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:59,390
there is also some evidence that the world
is greening as a result of more a CEO

589
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,490
two in the atmosphere. But I do
acknowledge I want to make it very,

590
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,740
yeah.
Any hate mail to you or to me,

591
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:10,670
I want to go into get hate mail either
way. Right. Acknowledge way acknowledged

592
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,430
that, uh, uh, there are
serious concerns. Um, uh,

593
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,140
and, and I'm, I'm basically a
guy who is a techno optimist.

594
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,130
I want to look for
solutions to these problems,

595
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,293
uh,

596
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,070
rather than what I don't want to
do is to stop economic development.

597
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,450
I don't want to stop economic development
in developing countries because it's

598
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,970
extremely important that,
that people who are very,

599
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:39,490
very poor should not be very,
very poor.

600
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,880
It's very important that if a woman
in Angola or in Zambia has a premature

601
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:48,380
birth, she should be able
to have an access to a, uh,

602
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,110
to an incubator that is a run on a,
on a,

603
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,520
uh, on an electricity grid
that is not going to collapse,

604
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,620
for example, okay. That, uh, that
people can air condition their homes,

605
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,660
let's say in Africa or that they can,
they can keep themselves warm in a,

606
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,760
in Argentina basically, that, that is my,

607
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:13,930
my goal not to stop economic development,
um,

608
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,220
those particularly of true
of, um, of, of poor countries.

609
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,560
Uh, but I also think that it
applies to rich countries. Um,

610
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,130
if, if we can make life more
comfortable for people. I, I see, no,

611
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,080
I think it would be very difficult,

612
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,190
especially within the democratic
context context to stop that.

613
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,330
Now look at what's happening in,
uh, in macrons Paris. We've seen

614
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,510
riots, yeah. That country has and hasn't
seen since the 1960s. Why is that?

615
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,990
That's because the environmental concerns
of the French elite micron included

616
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,410
are bumping against, uh, the, uh,

617
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,490
living standards and limitations on the
living standards of ordinary French men

618
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:04,630
and women.
If you increase the price of electricity,

619
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:09,160
uh, dramatically in order to make
people cut down on electricity,

620
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
it's also going to reduce their,
their, both their comfort,

621
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,570
but also their standard of living.

622
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:18,010
If you're going to put additional taxes
on this, that, and the other cars, uh,

623
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,130
gasoline, what have you, uh,

624
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,040
eventually people are going to get upset
and are going to start voting for some

625
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,330
very unpleasant people.

626
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,470
And this is something that we see
happening throughout Europe. Now.

627
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:34,240
There are many different reasons why
people vote for, um, uh, for unpleasant,

628
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,960
uh, of political parties. But, uh, a,

629
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
a fundamental feeling that that
standards of living in Europe,

630
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,120
art stagnating and that they are being
taxed to a point where they actually have

631
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:51,620
to go out and protest in
the streets, burn, uh,

632
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,970
hundreds of cars and basically
vandalized the Arc de Triomphe. Okay. So,

633
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,150
so these things are happening.

634
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:02,800
So what I want to do is to sort of
navigate a middle course between,

635
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,470
uh, between concerns over the
environment, uh, and uh, and uh,

636
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,040
and continued economic development
and continued prosperity.

637
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:16,780
And I think that the answer
could potentially be found
in, um, techno optimism,

638
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,740
as I would call it.

639
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,690
So I would consider a fracking to be a
good example of taking our optimism. Okay.

640
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,440
Uh,

641
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,440
burning of one unit of natural gas
produces half as much co two emissions as

642
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,070
burning of coal [inaudible].

643
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,490
So I think it would make a lot of sense
to burn more natural gas than coal.

644
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,833
But

645
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,810
a friend's on the environmental side hate
that because it's still fossil fuels.

646
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,670
Okay. So let's forget about fossil
fuels. Let's have nuclear energy.

647
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,620
Okay. Last time anybody has died from a
nuclear accident, it was ensure no bill.

648
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,880
Um, because the communist leadership, uh,

649
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,270
cut corners when it came to the safety
and, uh, there was a breakdown of,

650
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,740
of um, chain of command and
whatever. And there wasn't this,

651
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,930
this accident where a, where dozens
of people died, but since then,

652
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,020
not a single person has died as
a result of nuclear accidents,

653
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,400
including in Fukushima, which
is the most recent one. Um,

654
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,490
so nuclear energy is a perfect
example of producing a lot of energy,

655
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,810
uh, without any CEO. Two emissions.

656
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,490
Are Our friends in the environmentalist
movement please? No, they are not.

657
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,500
Let's take another example. Um, uh,

658
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,430
say a photo Leiser.

659
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Let's say that we can genetically
engineer crops to need less fertilizer and

660
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,140
less pesticides.

661
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,730
Why do we want a less
fertilizer and less pesticides?

662
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,930
Because when those flow into
rivers and then into oceans,

663
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,230
they can have a negative
consequence for wildlife.

664
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,420
So ideally we would like to use
less fertilizer, less pesticide.

665
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,800
So imagine that through Gmos,
uh, through genetic engineering,

666
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:12,340
we could produce crops that, uh, that,

667
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,450
that don't require pesticides and
fertilizer are our friends in the

668
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:21,950
environmental, I'll be happy. No, they
hate, they hate those three letters.

669
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,760
In the time that we offer
as techno optimists,

670
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,990
we offer a gradual move
in the right direction,

671
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,020
which cumulatively could have a
massive impact on quality of life,

672
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,530
on the environmental
protection and so forth. Um,

673
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,300
you know, the, the, the
answer is always no. So what,

674
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:47,420
so it's interesting because when
you started talking about this,

675
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,630
there's this immediate hesitancy
because I think everyone,

676
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,380
if you talk about climate at all,
people think you're going to get slammed.

677
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:58,340
And I can tell you the most hate that I
ever got on the show was when I had Alex

678
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,640
Epstein on wrote a book called the
moral case for fossil fuels in there.

679
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,270
He wasn't denying climate science. He
was, you're saying that fossil fuels,

680
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,230
in his estimation,

681
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,670
are still the best way to advance
human prosperity going forward.

682
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,970
So it's interesting you,

683
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:14,630
you immediately said you didn't want
to go too far down that road because it

684
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:18,290
just opens up the the hate and
all that, but, but in essence,

685
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:23,240
what you're saying is that we're having
to fight the environmentalist's on what

686
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:27,680
you would prescribe as the best ways
to move the environment forward.

687
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:32,280
That that's pretty fascinating. So how do
you get through to these people then? I,

688
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,140
well, I don't know. I'm trying,

689
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,950
what are the things I'm trying to
explain to a lot of my friends is that

690
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:41,670
actually prosperity and
economic development can be
a friend of the environment.

691
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,570
That's because of this concept
of environmental Kuznets curve.

692
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,520
Now that's just a fancy way of
saying that when people grow richer,

693
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:55,170
they are willing to spend more money
on clean environment and protection of

694
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,310
animals. How do I know
that? Because in in,

695
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,350
well it's not just stats which show it,
but also look at the real life examples.

696
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,840
When do you kind of me
collapsed in Zimbabwe?

697
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,320
The first thing that people did in order
to survive was to start slaughtering

698
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,470
animals in the wild,
shooting zebras for meat,

699
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,990
shooting elephants for tusks. Um, and,

700
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:25,991
and the environment took a huge knock
in Venezuela when the economy collapsed.

701
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,510
Both socialist countries by the way,

702
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,620
but you never mind in Venezuela
when the economy collapsed,

703
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,620
uh, people started slaughtering
animals in the zoo.

704
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,840
The only way you can survive if it's a
choice between the life of an antelope

705
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,330
and the survival of your child,
you know exactly what to do.

706
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,710
And so economic development,
making people richer,

707
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,190
it's actually,
um,

708
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,360
a very good way of accomplishing
this environmental co Kuznets curve.

709
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,660
When people grow rich, they start
caring about the air they breathe,

710
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,130
they start caring about a welfare
of animals and so on and so forth.

711
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:09,540
Because those are from the perspective
of the survival of the human being.

712
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,980
Luxury goods.

713
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,370
And we are already seeing some very
interesting things happening around the

714
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:19,210
world. For example, the
forest coverage of, uh, of,

715
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:19,570
of,

716
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,570
of the Oris is still declining
by about 0.08% per year,

717
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,970
but it is declining primarily,

718
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,030
if not exclusively in poor countries and
especially in Africa and also like an

719
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,083
American,

720
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,560
but it is increasing in a rich countries,

721
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,480
uh, for a station is they can place
their more forest being grown.

722
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,490
And in China, uh, we are
seeing huge amount of our,

723
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,070
for a station because the country is now
Richard than what did you used to be.

724
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,970
So through economic development, we can
do that through economic development.

725
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,320
We can also, um, uh,

726
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,840
we can also start protecting
more of our marine life, um,

727
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,550
by creating exclusion zones, uh,
against fishing and so forth.

728
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,120
How can we do that? Why is that
connected to economic development? Well,

729
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,780
because if you're, for
example, you can, well,

730
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:19,950
not only do you have more
technological, um, uh,

731
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,410
ways of monitoring who
is breaking the rules,

732
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,970
but also you can still get access to
the food you want through aquaculture.

733
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,630
Okay. So countries which are richer, uh,

734
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,940
are able to,
uh,

735
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,360
are able to get their food from,
uh,

736
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,310
from aquaculture rather than from,
uh, from ordinary, uh, shore fishing.

737
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,840
So when, when it comes to these
solutions, which, by the way, I mean,

738
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,471
what you just said there,

739
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:51,040
it's pretty mind blowing that in much
of the world it's getting greener.

740
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,640
You know, I mean, that's, people just
don't think about that. We just sorted,

741
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,970
just don't accept that.
That's real. Most of this.

742
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:00,460
Do you see that we have
to have a, a sort of, uh,

743
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,060
public and private partnership on
how we move forward on these things?

744
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:05,920
Should most of this come from governments?

745
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:10,150
Should it come from private corporations?
Should it come from individual people?

746
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:14,340
I mean, that seems to be what a lot
of the debate is also about. Well, uh,

747
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,670
I think that the research that
the, um, uh, evidence, uh,

748
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:25,710
for the efficacy of a government
spending when it comes to a science,

749
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,560
um, w when it comes to
scientific research, for example,

750
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,780
is it's not all that persuasive.

751
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't think that governments are
particularly good at spending money on

752
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:41,590
scientific research.
Um,

753
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,650
meaning that the researcher shoddy or
just that they throw money at things and

754
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:48,040
then just nothing comes of it. Um,
yeah, that, that, that would be,

755
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:52,540
that will be part of reason.
Um, I am a believer in, uh,

756
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,070
in, uh, in, uh, private companies
doing their own research,

757
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,840
um, driven by the profit
motive, for example.

758
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,033
Um,

759
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,100
energy inputs into production
of anything from a can of coke,

760
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:12,730
two bottle of water. Uh, our costs money.

761
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,340
A companies actually do have a,

762
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,360
an incentive at profit incentive to try
to limit the amount of resources they

763
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:27,640
use in order to produce any type of good.
Um,

764
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,740
in the 1970s,
uh,

765
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,130
between 1970s and today,

766
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:38,610
the number of cans of coke that you
could get from a pound of aluminum has

767
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:41,080
actually increased by something like 40%.

768
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,600
That's because companies
don't want to spend money.

769
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:48,190
They don't have to spend on
electricity, uh, on, uh, uh,

770
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:51,550
spending money on natural resources and
will and raw materials and wood heavy.

771
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,060
And so what we are actually
seeing is that, uh,

772
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,570
the number of dark dollars, um, uh, per,

773
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,290
um, uh, what the,

774
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,360
the amount of the amount of energy we
need in order to produce a dollar of

775
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,630
output is actually declining.

776
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,440
And that that's happening naturally
through the process of profit maximization

777
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:16,660
on the parts of,
of corporations.

778
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:20,740
Now that doesn't mean that there is
absolutely no need for any kind of

779
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:24,340
regulations.
We don't want corporations to be,

780
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,610
to be dumping toxic materials in our
pristine rivers and what have you.

781
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,940
But, uh, uh, but what I am
saying is that, uh, is that uh,

782
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,940
corporations in search for profit,
um,

783
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,540
are actually very good at coming up with
innovative solutions to environmental

784
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,230
problems.
Yeah.

785
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,500
It's part of the problem here also
that different countries that are at

786
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:50,060
different stages of their evolution of
their economies and everything else need

787
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:52,280
different things,
need wildly different things.

788
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,520
What's happening in China now with
growth is very different than what's

789
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:56,780
happening in the United States or,

790
00:50:56,781 --> 00:51:01,370
or India or any of these
countries that now half, half to,

791
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,630
that are often putting out more co two
and emissions and things like that.

792
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,520
They're going through their
industrial revolutions.

793
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,630
We already did it so that
we have an unequal playing
field when it comes to some

794
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:16,010
of them. Yes. Um, so
that is a well known, uh,

795
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,010
notion within economic development
that, uh, as a country, uh,

796
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,500
starts on a pass to industrialization.

797
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:28,120
It's a them should environment increases.
But once again, it reaches that, uh,

798
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,720
that inflection point and then it
starts to decrease as people become rich

799
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:36,460
enough to start to appreciate,
um, nice environment. Um,

800
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,580
90% of the plastics that are entering
our oceans come from eight rivers are all

801
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:47,320
in the developing world,
in Africa and in Asia. Uh,

802
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:52,350
the contribution of western advanced
economies to plastic pollution of the

803
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:56,530
oceans is negligible,
um,

804
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,680
precisely because we are able to spend
more money and effort and thought on how

805
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:06,520
not to do it. What would you say
to the people that would say, uh,

806
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,810
our time is up here?

807
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:11,530
Or the evolution of humanity is
that we've got to go to the stars,

808
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:16,270
that eventually we'll have to get off
this mortal coil and do it again somewhere

809
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:18,960
else. Well, uh, first of all,

810
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:23,961
it is very important to remember that
a pessimism about humanity's future,

811
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,100
uh, has been with us since
the, since the dawn of writing,

812
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,430
um, um, from,

813
00:52:32,431 --> 00:52:37,410
from antiquity and ancient
poems and epics. You know, the,

814
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:40,480
the afternoon, the flood, what is
it about the flood is about closing.

815
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:44,710
The world's depressing, the
relation that, that, uh, that went,

816
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,110
uh, all right. Um,

817
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,220
the Cato, the elder, uh,

818
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:57,221
writing second century BC thoughts
that Rome was finished because,

819
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:02,540
um, you know, uh, the, the, the
young were corrupted and, uh,

820
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,740
um,

821
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,740
women had loose morals and men
were to feminists to fight wars.

822
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:14,220
And this is when Rome was just
a small town in, you know,

823
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:17,070
with fewer, uh, with a
few provinces in Italy.

824
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,050
Rome continue to expand for the
next three to 400 years. Um,

825
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,480
but he was just very early.
He was just very early. Uh,

826
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,590
but you can see every generation
thinks that, that, that we are,

827
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,810
especially as we grow
older, we think that, uh,

828
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,460
the world is entering a period of decline.
Whereas in fact what we are doing,

829
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:39,570
we are projecting our own physical
decline, uh, onto the world.

830
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,790
But so far those,
uh,

831
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,050
those warnings about the imminent collapse
of humanity have always been proven

832
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,120
wrong. As, um, uh, Thomas
Babington Macaulay, uh,

833
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,340
in 19th century British politician
and the writer has written on,

834
00:53:54,341 --> 00:53:59,341
on what basis is it without having seen
all this progress that we have made

835
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:03,720
behind us.
We see nothing but misery in front of us.

836
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,890
I'm paraphrasing,

837
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:08,370
but that's the essence of what he said
and I think he's absolutely right. Yeah.

838
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,170
So we've,

839
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,450
we've done the diseases,
we're eradicating,

840
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:14,300
we're doing a lot of good on the
environment or at least have,

841
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:15,800
have some options now.

842
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,930
Yes. Yeah. Uh, what else, what else should
we be hitting on to give people some,

843
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,230
some positivity to think
about? Well, I think, um,

844
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:29,420
my pet peeve is a, that I think that, uh,

845
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:33,940
people don't read enough history,
aren't enough versed in, uh, in,

846
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,880
in history how life really
used to be like, uh, before.

847
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,193
Um,

848
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:44,420
and I wish that people would spend more
time thinking about what they are doing

849
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:47,560
on their base daily basis
and asking themselves, uh,

850
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,590
would I be able to do this in the past?
Um,

851
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,500
I just had a crown,
uh,

852
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:58,700
have put in or a root canal operation
with anesthetic. And it was,

853
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,580
it was not something and there wasn't
a particularly pleasant, but, but,

854
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,890
but it was better than it would
have been a hundred years ago.

855
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,580
A hundred or 200 years ago. You
would have it, you know, um,

856
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,390
somebody would have to pull it
out of your, out of your mouth.

857
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,500
Um, and, um, um, so, so,
so that's the one thing.

858
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,200
Uh, I think that people, uh,

859
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,240
and I think that if people understand
history better and how life truly was

860
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,800
quite horrific until very recent
times, again, we are 300,000 years old,

861
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,450
but at the time of abundance,
it's roughly 200 years old,

862
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,340
250 years old. Maybe there will
be more grateful and um, uh,

863
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,390
for the things that we have and hopefully
they will be more appreciative and

864
00:55:43,391 --> 00:55:48,391
more supporting of the institutions
which underpin a modernity,

865
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,860
liberal democracy with all of its warts,

866
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,540
with all of its imperfections.

867
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,520
It is still functioning better
than a Putin is Russia or,

868
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,330
or the Turkey.
A free market.

869
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:08,170
Capitalism does have
its problems. Yes. Um,

870
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,070
we shouldn't socialize costs
of banking for example,

871
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,420
and prioritized and privatized
gains from Wall Street banking.

872
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,650
Um, but again, it is the best.

873
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:25,510
It is the best creative
known to humankind.

874
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,440
And so throwing it out because there
are imperfections on the margins that we

875
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:34,330
should be working on to, to, to
improve would be a great mistake. Um,

876
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,100
so yes, appreciation of the
past, gratitude for the present,

877
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,170
hopefulness for the future.
Um, those are the steps in,

878
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,591
I think,

879
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:49,591
in the right direction that my friend
is an a plus ending to an interview and

880
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:53,290
for more on Marriott and the incredible
work that think progress is doing.

881
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,990
