Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Monday morning podcast just before Friday. And

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you so you know your week's going. Oh, it's Thursday. You know, somebody gave me shit the other day. Fucking talking about how, uh, you know, I always say Thursday, it's payday. I go, who couldn't fucking job? Did you have, will you got by? I always got paid on Friday. I always get paid on Thursday. Whatever. So you're getting your money today or getting it tomorrow, right? We all know you're going to be broke by Tuesday. Right? Wednesday walking around, you know with your brown bag, you got to bring a fucking lunch cause you got no money for fucking to go out to the roach coach.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Yeah, you packed a lot. Chatty on funny, healthy. You're pro. Gotcha. Yeah. Um, I can't believe the fucking money I used to blow when I was a kid. I used to make 260 bucks a week, right? My only expense. Why had I had a car payment? 130 $838 and 62 cents. I still remember it. And uh, that was it. And gas that was making 260 bucks. And I was t that was my take home. 260 bucks a week, right? So what's that? 860 times four is two 40 I was making over grand a month and I'd be fucking broke every Wednesday. Fucking idiot. I swear to God, if I was a miser, I might as well have been a miser. This is what the fuck I should've done.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       Tell it was going out in the clubs and crushing it. Coming out with my fucking orange Afro. Hey ladies. I mean, it was a shit show. It was Charlie Brown trying to kick the football. It was like Atlanta trying to win a champion job. Come on bill. Come on. The new Cleveland Ladies and gentlemen, all of a sudden, Cleveland wins a fucking basketball championship and the entire country's and the cubs won. How nervous were you down there in La and Atlanta? You know what I mean? Atlanta. I came to say it this morning. Atlanta. Atlanta. How fucking nervous, where you Cleveland winds. You're like, Oh shit, all we got less the cubs, you know, maybe if the Indians win, then they went to champions. Cleveland winds two championships in a year. The cubs is still the fucking sad sacks at like 108 years or whatever. And then they went three in a row. The cubs win it and the entire sporting world just stops, turns around and stares at Atlanta Quiver and over in the corner. Like, hey guys, you know, for the record, the Braves one at 95,

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       it's got to count for something. Right? Oh, those poor bastards. You, I just connected in a, I connected in with the fuck was I in, um, in Atlanta. And I saw this woman walked by and she had on a falcons hat and I was like, you know what, good for, there's a real fan still wearing the Atlanta shit. Right. And it was a red hat, but then I also noticed that she was wearing red sneakers, you know what I mean? And she then, she was also African American and I was just, and I just assumed she didn't give a fuck. I learned that from Patrice O'Neil the first time I saw them with like an islanders hat on. Right. I was like, Oh fuck man, you like the islanders. He was like, what? I go, you liked the islanders. And he took off his hat and looked at, he goes, Nah man, I don't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       I goes, I, he goes, I just liked the colors and these pair of fucking islanders covered colored sneakers on. You told me to say, Bill Black people don't give a fuck about, I mean, I'm not saying generally, you know, hey, we got all the white guy. I've got to fucking make sure I fucking say this correctly. He was saying, generally speaking, we wear this shit because of colors. It's not, you know, and he joked, he just fuck it. Yeah. He trashed me all the fucking time. So anyways, so I looked at her and I did that. Patrice conversation just popped into my fucking head and I was just like, as she probably just probably just needed a hat to go with those fucking shoes.

Speaker 2:          00:04:16       Supposed to white people where were the same fucking hat forever. It's all frayed and shit. Walking around with your cargo pants and your flip flops. I don't think I'll ever get over fucking northern Florida. I know, I've heard a zillion jokes about it, but Jesus fucking Christ, Jesus fucking Christ. There are some characters out there. And what's amazing is it's absolutely gorgeous. And then there's people with like beautiful homes in money, but they're there. I swear to God, isn't me. There's no middle-class. It's like when you go to a third world country, it's just like this, just fucking people living in this crazy poverty and then they'll just be this mansion.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       I Dunno. Anyway, well, you know, probably didn't help that I fucking went to the Daytona 500 bunch of Yahoos like me. And by the way, I fit right in. I fucking fit right in. I'm, I'm, you know, I don't know. I should be more white collar. But uh, due to some financial reasons, I had a very fucking, you know, I'm, I'm pretty much a put it this way. I, it was, it wasn't until I hung out with a bunch of, of poetry stories here. I wasn't until I hung out with Patrice that I realized that macaroni and cheese wasn't a main dish.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       We used to have all of that shit. Macaroni and cheese with toast was a meal and I fucking loved it. Get half a tray just scooping that shit out was the craft. I've told you. Talk to you guys about this chicken Alec King on toast. Chipped beef on toast. I fucking hated that shit. Chicken Alan King was also gross. Um, those are the, yeah. You know, in mother's work and she comes home, she's got 90 kids, opens up a couple of cans, throws it in a pot and make some toast. Yay. You're fucking animals. Um, anyways, chef boy yard d.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       You know, when I think back, this was born, we didn't know anything about fucking nutrition back then. TV. We weren't never really big on the TV dinners. And I remember I used to ask my mother to get them. I think that there was something, I don't what the fuck was called Hungry Jack's or some shit. Something that had jack in it. It sounded manly, you know, and the commercials all you know, big chunks and Turkey with gravy Matt of, and I was sitting there going [inaudible] that looks fucking delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       I Dunno. We just never, we never, we weren't, we never, we didn't, we didn't cross that line with the fast food. You know, I remember steak hymns, those were my favorites. I'd be sitting in, I would be sitting not paying attention in the last three periods of school when I was in a middle school, junior high, whatever the fuck you call it. Just thinking about the state of that I was going to make when I got home. That's all I gave a felt. That was a game changer. You know, kid from the seventies eighties you know, you came home, your parents weren't home, right. Latch key kid, you come home. The game changer was when you went from making something just room temperature or cold to actually get in the, you know, the next level. It's like moving up in like a, you know, army ranks as Scientology, whatever. When you get to a new level of security clearance, okay, you can use the fucking frying pan and all of a sudden you had a fucking hot meal.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       I used to cook those fuckers up, put them on white bread and then you had to eat it real quick because the grease, there was so much fucking grease from whatever cut of meat. Was it squirrel? I didn't know what the fuck it was. It was such a shit cut of meat that the grease would just be coming through the bread. It was, it was fucking gross push. You put ketchup on and shit. Sorry if I'm grossing. Yeah. Let me get off the subject. I gotta. I gotta address all the fucking who and whom police. Oh my God. That's like a whole cult within itself. The level of fucking arrogance that people came and the joy that they had that I see that I'm not good at. Who in home you would think that you could actually make money off of that? Like they had a hot stock tip or some shit. Hey this fucking company's going to go public. You didn't hear it from me. This is one thing that I learned. I think I finally figured out, cause people told me this trick before, it's like if you could substitute he or she use who you know him or her use home some like to whom do I have the pleasure of speaking to and I'm like to him, I have the pleasure of, of speaking with, I wouldn't say that that sentence doesn't work to she do I have the pleasure of speaking. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:02       Like I don't fucking get it. But then it's like, no, who you speaking to? You would say to him, to her. Then I was like, oh, that's what they mean. I thought the, I thought you just meant take out a who are home and plug in. He or she who did this shit, he did this shit. I get it. I think I just got it. I think I finally cracked the fucking code. But here's the deal with who and wants the deal. Woo. Here's the deal with that shit. Nobody says whom out loud unless you're teaching an English class. No one says that. Right? It's always hope. Who the fuck do I? You know, it's not. To whom am I speaking? Was I, what the fuck am I talking to? Oh, the fuck are you? Who am I fucking speaking with?

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       it's speaking to fucking him. That's why you said fuck it home. Oh, all right, thanks Jerry. Nobody says it out loud, but it's one of those things if you, if you don't write it correctly, you know, if you, people flip the fuck out and they judge you like you're a fucking more, but I've never heard anybody, you know, that's, that's another one that's, that's another like security level. You go past, if you start out loud using the not not writing, okay. Speaking and you use the word whom like you've alienated probably 80% of the population of my country.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       And I don't think that there's a bigger example of the gap between wealth and regular people than using whom in public. I always picture that. I know you know something even that you know, because there's people that fucking rob and steal their way into the upper 1% and then they just a fucking dope like me still. But if you're born, if you're born into that shit, if you've got some trust fund hanging over your head, if you one of those kids and you have to learn how to fence, take a fencing fucking class in college to show that you're a gentleman. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       did you walk around with the date rape drug in your pocket? Cause your dad knows a judge and can get you off and you wear loafers with no socks. Right? There's a bunch of stereotypes. Um, I was speaking to that, me and the, I got this fucking monster debate last night. She take this show, she goes, she goes, Hey, I take this show. It's about rappers in Paris. You know, you ought to check this out. So I was like, all right, I'm going to watch this shit. Right. So immediately they show in these guys and they're rapping and French. I don't know what this saying. So you know, I'm trying to read the words. I'm a dope. It's going by too fast. But it sounds a lot like, you know, it's the same sort of point of view as a lot of rappers over here, which I am in a the minority group.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       I'm getting treated like shit. I'm living in the shittiest part of the fucking city. A lot of that stuff. Right. But it's flying by because I can't read fast enough. So they got this fucking nerdy white kid goes to interview this dude, um, who's Muslim and he's living in some part in Paris. Right. And he's talking about all of this stuff that's happening to him now. Right. And uh, no, the first thing he talked about, he said that he was talking about how um, he said thank God that he found, you know, rap and he did that, cause you know, he could've gone the other way. He said, I could've become a bomb. That's what he said. So the white dude goes like, oh, you mean like, you know, you would've blown some people up or something like that. And then the dude's basically like, I knew you're going to take it that way. That's not how I meant it. That's really offensive. And I, you know, and he's speaking through an interpreter, tell him if he's going to come down here and talk to people, he needs to check the way he's talking to people, blah, blah. And I'm just sitting there going like, you totally set him up for that. That was like fucking attracted. What do you think? He's going to think?

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:13       So Nia goes, well, he's not doing that. So you know, he gets judged because of those actions of the few of the few. And it's just like, I understand that. I totally understand that, but at some point you have to address the fucking elephant in the room, don't you? You know?

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       Like when people, like when I travel outside of this country and people treat me like shit because I'm an American, I don't act like that just fell out of the sky. I know where that's coming from. The pure listic way that we've colonized the entire fucking world, the amount of time we've, we've cited with dictators because they've given us fucking oil is they're oppressed in their own PD amount of times we've been on the wrong fucking side of shit. It's like an a walk around like, well, I didn't show it. That's like, you know, as much as it's still wrong to judge me, I understand that when I walk out of the House, I'm no longer me anymore. It's teams. It's like red sox and Yankees. Okay, and you're low and you're fucking the hat, the team hat you're wearing is you skin. Okay. And people are going to judge you for that. You know, back when I had here and I came walking down the street looking like fucking Richie Cunningham, you know, I knew that people were looking at me like that, you know, like fucking [inaudible]. I can take this kid's lunch money, look at his fucking hair.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       does it make it right? Absolutely does not make it right. But to sit there and act like you don't know where shit is coming from. That's what drives me nuts. And it's like I completely understand that on my side to have empathy for that guy. But what was pissing me off was there was no empathy coming from the other side being like, listen, I understand. You know, cause there was no understanding of that, that wrapper that this guy is totally on the outside looking in. So he's going to come from this fear-based fucking thing that he's, you know, from the shit that he sees in the media and the media is basically, you get judged all groups of people, you get judged by the Jerry Springer fucking group of your people. That's basically it. So with white people, we're either living in a trailer, fucking our sister or where these lizard people shapeshifters that live under a fucking mountain.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Illuminati is essentially it, right? There's a lot. This is a zillion of them. We were in a fucking eight group. We're in the fucking clan, we got have, we got a four wheeler, we're shooting a gun or whatever. Right. And you've got all those fucking stereotypes, um, which obviously is not a fair fucking thing. And I also wanted to stand that despite those stereotypes, the Matrix is made for white people. So I this spite those, it really doesn't affect my life and I get all of that type of shit. But I mean, I dunno, I just needed that guy in the moment to just be like, you know what? I understand why you said that. You know, rather than, than just immediately go into lecture mode because then when you're sitting at home, I don't know if you're like me, I just plugged myself in.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       Well, who would I be in that scenario? Oh, I'd be that guy getting a lecture. So I just started saying all this shit. I would've said back to him and it drove my fucking wife up the wall. She's like, why can't you just watch things? It's like, you know I, what do you mean why can't I, the TV's interacted to me the same shit I do when I watch wheel of fortune and I make fun of every contestant and you sitting there laughing your ass off and I turned it into this like a comedy show. You then get mad at me when I do the same fucking thing when I'm watching this other shit. And so I, we just made a truce. It's like, don't, I don't want to watch any of any shit with you that has to do with this stuff because we're going to end up in a fucking argument because I'm going to act like I'm watching wheel of fortune.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Um, anyways, why is this thing bing bang and booming and all that type of shit. You know, having said all that, I completely understood where that guy was coming from. It's like, yeah, I didn't do any of that shit. You know, I'm trying to get the fuck outta here. I've lived in this country my whole life and I never felt like it was mine. Okay. Which is, you know, and this is the arrogant thing that I'm going to do, not even living over there, I'm going to chastise white people like, cause we do it here. You can't do that to people. You can't have people living in the country their whole fucking lives. And the our American, they are French and all that. You cannot treat them like, yeah, but you know, you know, you're not real American American. It's like, well fucking neither were you then you're European or whatever the fuck you're from. Um, so I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a fucking, I like to think I'm not a fucking bad guy. I get all of that type of shit. But Jesus Christ at some point, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       like I used to joke right after nine 11 and they started racially profiling Arabs and all that, which was completely fucked up. And I understood it, but I never heard it. Like I just always looked at it like, all right, if 20 red heads knocked down some skyscrapers, you know, I'd expect to be getting some looks that next day at the airport. Does it make it right? But I wouldn't be sitting there going, oh, I completely understand where this is coming from. And I don't like it cause I'm an it. I'm an innocent guy. But I would have the empathy to at least address where the fear is coming from. And it's, I think that if you just fucking do that, the other side can relax and maybe listen to your point, you know, because that's what happened to me when I watched that and I watched that kid all of a sudden get a lecture after that guy said I'd turned my s I could've become a bomb. And I just felt he set the fucking kid up and then I immediately went into defense mode defending that kid. And I know, and I didn't even at that point, sit and listen to what this guy had to say. So then I didn't learn anything. I would equate that to like, you know, when people make, try to make a point, like when people were trying to teach me who and home. So much of it started with, hey, fuck head, maybe you should try blood. Um, how do I get past? Hey, fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       I don't know. I like to think that there was a decent point made in there. I'm sure I'll get a bunch of shit for that. But um, either way, it was an interesting debate, you know, hey, I bought those fucking Boston Celtics had beat the Cleveland Cavaliers. What a God's name is a cavalier. There's probably some fucking fancy name for white oppressor. Wait a second, Kev. I know you can act cavalier if your cavalier attitude, can you ever have a cavalier attitude and it's like a fucking, you'll get good thing. Cavalier is like, that's like a happy go lucky upper 1% or you know what I mean? Like if they were broke, they be, they be ob Taylor with the fucking stick over the shoulder with the little little fish hook on it. You know, just going to go skip some rocks. But all of a sudden, you know, if you cavalier and you're in the upper 1% is a white dude. That means a, I dunno, there's a bunch of kids digging for fucking m diamonds. I don't fucking know. Let me look this up. Okay hottie disdainful. I, because I was Ron Hardy. Disdainful or supercilious. I don't know what that word is. An arrogant and cavalier attitude towards other, offhand Cleveland Cavaliers is, is it anything, it's gotta be something else.

Speaker 2:          00:20:44       Yeah. Are they really the Cleveland arrogant concepts that what they, they named themselves. It can't be that. It's got a horseman there. It is. Especially a mounted soldier a night. Yeah. Oppressive, oppressive wire. White Guy. Uh, one having this spirit or bearing of a knight. A courtly gentleman galleon. These guys are arrogant. Huh? A man escorting a woman or acting as their partner in dancing. All right. We'll just slowly get into the NBA lifestyle here. They're coming out of the shower and all the whores hanging out waiting to get him his fucking magic. Johnson used to say, you got chastised for that. These women, they're out to get you after the show. Oh, that's offensive to women, not the horse. That's who I was talking about. Sweetheart, go back to your soccer mom. Pay with your red wine. Thank you. Um, okay. And a adherent of an adherent of Charles, the first of England in his contest with the pound.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       It's amazing that I speak this language in so many words that I've just never seen before and have no idea how to pronounce. All right. As an adjective hottie disdainful. And that's supercilious whatever the fuck that is. Um, offhand, that's a good name for a fucking dance. Like one of those meatpacking district dance clubs I got, I got down at, it's sell us last night. Am I old girlfriend? Totally fucking outdated. And apparently, yeah. Oh No. Getting onto the transplant. All right. Offhand or unceremonious of a relating to the Cavaliers. That's a fucking lazy definition of relating to a characteristic of the cavalier poets or their work. All right. I don't know what a cavalier is. This is either a gentleman, a knight, a poet, or a cunt. You know, one of the other, I guess it depends if you live in Cleveland or not. They probably think they're a bunch of gentlemen. They're not yet animals. Oh, those, that's a special kind of animal that lives up there in Cleveland. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       You know why that Lake caught on fire? It wasn't the lake of Zuora. You know what it was because so many of those animals walked into it and bathed. That's what happened. They took that beautiful water yeah. That God made and they turned it into something flammable. I'm just kidding. Yeah. They always say that mistake by the lake and they always say that lake eerie caught on fire. It didn't catch on fire. It was, it was way more understandable. It was like a, I think it was a whatever the runoff that went into the city and they were just dumping all their pollution into it. They didn't light a great lake on fire. Um, I dunno. But now with all that fracking, the FRAC and down the road, Shit, I go to get it my goddamn above ground pool. Next thing you know, I'm having a fucking, except I'm the main course.

Speaker 1:          00:23:48       Okay

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Sir. We understand that, uh, you are upset, but we don't feel that our company has anything to do with your above ground pool catching on fire. Oh, fuck you in your soup buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:00       Um, all right, let's read some advertising here for this week. Dirty Lemon. That sounds the only stupid fucking jokes. Hey, that dirty Sanchez.

I sent it to my podcast guy who's now going to edit it. I'm actually going to follow through and we should have a couple of videos for you on my, on my new fucking youtube page, youtube.com/user/monday morning podcast. Once again, www.youtube.com/users/monday morning podcast. I'm going to start doing those city tours again. I wanna make little stupid videos. I'm going to get that fucking thing going. Speaking of which, I'm going to be in Phoenix this week, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, flying in Sunday night to see the fucking Celtics, Isaiah Thomas p against the Phoenix Suns there on Sunday night.

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       I'll see you guys at the game. Um, oh, I'd also like to thank uh, some people at the, uh, Tampa Bay lightning for hooking me in forest. Shot up with some tickets. We got to see a Nikita coop giraffe get a hat trick against the Ottawa senators. It was a great fucking game, great fucking game. You know, Tampa, Tampa Bay came out and it was like they were fucking owning them and then all of a sudden auto it goes, hey gee, they're easy there. And then they took control of the game and then after the fucking, the first intermission, I don't know what the, I don't know what sort of a third time adjustments that they used. It's not half time for all you non hockey fans who try to say that there's two half times in hockey, you know, that always makes me feel smart. I'm like, mathematically that doesn't make sense. There's a third and then there's two thirds through the game. And if you ever played pickup hockey three on fucking three, if you've ever fucking done that and you look at of, there's no substitutions, you know why? You would know why they take two breaks. Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:36:16       Then a fucking lollygagging around like a bunch of baseball players and they just need to stretch once every seven 30 there is sprinting. Someone could beat the shit out of you and just sit down for five minutes. Okay. You're going to need to take a couple of breaks. All right, let's talk. Gas Monkey garage.

Speaker 4:          00:36:33       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       Monday nights episode was the episode that they'd been teasing the whole, the whole fucking season. The shit that you read about on social media before the season even started. The bearded wonder Aaron Kaufman came back from vacation. Eh, he fucking just, he straight up quit. It wasn't, he didn't give notice. A, I'll help you on a couple of builds. He was just like, I am out. It's been a great run. I'll fucking see you later.

Speaker 4:          00:37:04       And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       I'm Richard Rollins as always was hilarious. It's like I feel like I'm going to Puke.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       Can you go? Oh he's only said that a few times during the series and it's always fucking hilarious cause I feel like the word puke is kind of, that's like from my generation. Like he graduated high school the same year. I, I watched the show a lot. I'm not a psycho, but he, he mentions all the time he built that fucking, that mercury comment. You mentioned that he graduated high school in 87 and a I should've graduated in 86, but we're not going to talk. Why, why I didn't because I'm a cause you cause you heard cause you hear me read out loud. It should've happened in 86. It was exciting. I'm a year older than him, but puke. I just feel like nobody says that. I never hear it. I don't hear it enough. And he's only said it a couple times. He said it lat, uh, on Monday when Aaron quit going to Puke and he said it when he bought that Ferrari that had been in that major accident.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       And it was like his big, this giant investment, like 300 grand. He went in with the other, the fucking rich dude up the street who likes all the European stuff. I don't know why, I can't remember his name. I only seen him in fucking 9,000 episodes. And afterwards he was, he was so fucking nervous. He was talking about just, I feel like I'm gonna Puke. I don't know why. It always makes me laugh. So anyways, um, as a fan of the show, you know, it was like watching van Halen break up. It's like, ah, fuck, now they're going to bring in, you know, some other guy who was in David Lee Roth, not shitting on Sammy Hagar, you know, I'm just saying, you know what I mean, you like the be want the original guy. So I was actually happy that they, they for the rest of the episode.

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       So they was showing Aaron at his house and he was doing this build. It was fucking hilarious and everything fit engine went in, transmission, everything fucking winded fine. Um, and then he just got up and took a break and went over and was feeding his horses and I'm just like, oh, here you go. Although when he was, you know, he was trying to make this race car and he was taking all this shit out, you know, that they don't need so he can make it lighter, watching him have to do that by himself. I bet that kind of sucked. But, um, I'm just hoping as a fan that Aaron gets his own shows cause I read a really good interview and it wasn't all this he said, she said Shit, it just seemed like he wanted to do more adventurous builds of cars that, you know, when you're not on a TV show, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       You're kind of under the constraint. He was just saying how fast they will build in cars, kind of limited what they could do. And uh, I think that that was probably the reason why he left. Just got a little burnt out or whatever. But um, it's fucking brutal, man. I mean that was the guy. So we'll see what happens. But I have faith, I have faith that they're going to find someone to replace him. And I'm hoping that I'm going to get two shows out of it. Um, I dunno, but whatever. It's definitely the end of, of a Goddamn era. And, uh, I'm trying to think of my, my favorite builds that they've done on that show. Um, I always liked the random shit that they did. I've mentioned this before. I love when they did that low rider and I can't remember if it was one of those like a 85 Oldsmobile cutlass or something.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       I love that they just gave Casey a chance to fucking show off what he could do. And he was shown all that different kind of steady just painting it black or green. But I understand that they always say, you know, those are the two colors that sell and you gotta make you fucking money. But, um, there was another time they built this car, can't remember what it was, and it was this white car and on top, Casey did this lace thing on the hood, on Msre on the roof. I fucking love that. Um, did they have a fucking Lincoln continental? I've always loved the random shit as opposed to the, uh, the more obvious stuff. I love that fucking mercury comment that they made, although I gotta tell you, I like to fucking white and blue color scheme better when they first had it and I liked those rims better, but if they just did all the gas monkey shit underneath it and slammed it down to the ground, that's a fucking killer. Cock. I don't know. I like weird shit. Um, and my biggest heartbreak on that show was one time when Richard Rawlings blot that fucking cab over engine truck, that jeepers creepers truck. And I was like, oh my God, what the fuck are they going to do to this? And then he just, somebody came in like, the next day I'll give you an extra two grand for, he's like, I fuck it. Get outta here. And I was just like, what the hell?

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       I want to see them build more trucks. I hope they do. Um, all right. That's it. Uh, so good luck to Aaron Kaufman. I hope I see him on another TV show or whatever. I, I should give a shout out to his. Um, he's got, um, he has his own, he's got his own a, um, company, I guess that builds parts for, believe it or not, Ford f one hundreds. What? I have 68 FordF 100 and I believe it's called, I think it's called arclight. Just look up, uh, Aaron Kaufman, arclight. And uh, you'll actually find that article. I should put a link to it. It's a really good article about, um, why he left the show. And I thought I was happy that it wasn't a bunch of mudslinging or anything like that. It just seemed like it was time and he wanted to go in a different directions. So, so that's it. Um, that is the podcast for this fucking week. Um, no, it isn't this, that's just me checking in on you. I'll do the real podcast on Monday. This is not a real podcast. All right. That said, go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. You've constant joy of the music and equals doing an extra half hour above greatest hits from a podcast in a fucking Monday gone by.

Speaker 5:          00:43:03       Well, we were [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:43:37       So anyways, I went up to see some family over the 4th of July to celebrate the birthday of this country. And, uh, as I'm driving up, I'm listening on the radio and evidently I looked up the song on, uh, on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:43:58       It's a, uh, Carrie Underwood song, who I don't, I don't know what she has. I'm guessing she's white cause it sounded country and she had a little Twang in her voice, but I don't want to piss off any Koreans out there. She might've been Korean, um, as a song called before he cheats. So I'm driving a log and you know, I'm driving my buddy's car. This is how I'm going to fucking defend myself. That I was on a radio station that was actually playing this and I was just sort of clicking the, uh, the preprogram radios, fucking whatever. You know what I'm saying? I'm home, I'm feel like shit. Cut me some slack this week. So anyways, this song comes on and this, this Carrie Underwood CIC is sitting there singing this song going a rat. Now he's probably slow dancing. I have a bed Pratt now and she's singing about her boyfriend.

Speaker 6:          00:44:50       I got the lyrics right here right now. He's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey right now. He's probably up behind her with the pool stick, showing her how to shoot a combo. And then they go into the chorus and she goes and he don't know, um, that I dug my keys into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive car of my name and to his leather seats. I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights, slashed a hole in all four tires. And all I could think was, why don't you just break up with them? You dumb cunt.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:45:33       What are you going to do? You're going to do all this shit. Then he's going to get mad and then what you're going to make up after five days and then you're going to blow him again. I hate this fucking song and I'm going to tell you why, because it's, I, I'm pretty sure it's a hit. It's on the radio, right? Uh, I dunno. And you, what do I love about this is people will listen to this song and they won't even question the rationale of what the fuck someone's doing in there. Because so many people in life, myself included, you, you, you, you play, you like powerless in life. You just play the powerless card,

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       you know,

Speaker 6:          00:46:15       just get out of the fucking relationship. I fucking hate this song. And this is one of these songs too. We're fucking women all get together. They start singing, hey guy, cat, I don't even ask her. You're all a bunch of dumb cunts. Okay, you're fucking stupid. Just break up with the guy. Just break up with them. Not even to mention the fact that now you're going out there and you're, you're, you're doing damage. You, I don't know, is that a fella that's not a felony? I don't know what it is, but it's just a classic thing where a woman would listen to that song and at no point would she ever think, man, maybe I could get arrested for this. I am damaging somebody's property. No, you got fucking vagina. You can just go out in broad daylight. You don't even have to wear a fucking mask.

Speaker 6:          00:47:02       Do you know what I would have to do if I wanted to go out and go fuck up somebody's car? I would have to wait for the, first of all, I had to make sure I had an alibi. It'd be like I was killing somebody. I had to make sure somebody could cover for me and say that I was fucking somewhere. Right. I had to put on some goddamn cat suit and a fucking a mask. Right? Like I'm in there dead presidents movie and all I would able to get, I'd be able to get off one quick hit, right? One quick kid, let's, I want to start carving it up like a pussy. Right? But if I, if I really was going to go out there and smash somebodies head lights, I can hit one and the second the car alarm goes off, I have to fucking take off and then run home, get out of my little fucking fucking a little cat suit and then try to put on my pajamas. So when the cops show up, because you know they're going to find some sort of fucking fingerprint, I got to act like I'm not out of breath. Like I actually have been sitting there for fucking eight hours watching TV.

Speaker 6:          00:47:56       I Dunno, I just, I can't stand, you know, it just reminds me of when that movie, a fatal attraction came out, right. And the amount of women who would just sit there and you see that movie, Eh? Yeah. That's what you get. And as t yet, you know, there's no thought of like this bitch put a rabbit in, in boiling water. There's none of that women there. They're out of their fucking minds. But that's not even the point of this. My point of the Carrie Underwood song, it actually made me feel like a loser because the amount of fucking times, I mean I haven't gone out and fucked up somebody's car, but the amount of times you don't, what does that song is that song, it's a powerless song. That's what the fuck it is. And I went to the whole lyrics to see if she breaks up with them in the end and there's sort of an ambiguous line in the end where she goes a cause the next time he cheats, oh you know, it won't be on me. So that's sort of ambiguous because it could mean because I broke up with them or it could be because he doesn't want to get his truck fucked up.

Speaker 6:          00:49:02       So I dunno. You know, I just, it just fucking annoys me. That song just annoyed the shit out of me on both levels where you got somebody, it's like, just break up with the guy and your solution is, you know something, if a girl ever fucking cheated on me that, that I would break up with them. I'm not saying I wouldn't flip out and I give him a good fucking trashing verbally, but I would never go in like, uh, what, you know, throw all their clothes out in the front lawn and Burnham.

Speaker 6:          00:49:43       You know, why wouldn't I do that? I don't know. I don't know why. I think a lot of it has to do, cause I'd be fucking worried I'd get arrested for damaging property. Why do women have an exemption from damaging property? I don't understand it. Have a woman sat there smashing up somebody's car and broad daylight because the guy cheated on him. People would be laughing. I would be laughing. Everyone. It, we, it's, it's a comedy. It's just hilarious. But if the exact same scenario was going down and a guy did it, it'd be the classic, you know, the cops come and they put you in that little, you get tasered and they mush your face into the fucking pavement. I Dunno, I get it. Women have carry a kid around in that goddamn stomach for nine months, but I don't think that gives you the right to go out and tack somebody fee Arrow. I really don't. You know, so why don't you guys just fucking relax. All right. Yeah. A bunch of Goddamn Psychos, you know, with your, I'm on my period excuse, so three weeks a month, you're out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 6:          00:50:49       I think if a girl goes, even if you were cheating on a girl or on a woman, right? And she fucks up your car, I really think you ought to be able to go up to her and give her a nice fucking two piece combination to the Goddamn fucking cabbage. What do you think about that? Right? Just fucking, just hook off on that fucking hair teased head a lettuce on the top of her fucking shoulders. Right? What would you go with? I'm really gonna alienate a lot of my thoughts on this one, and I want you to know that most of this is not me advocating punching a woman in the face. Most of this is, I can't fucking sit in this stupid hotel room anymore. I can't fucking do it. I've had the Goddamn

Speaker 7:          00:51:31       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:51:32       Do not disturb light on for like four days. They probably think I overdosed in here. I'm really big on that. Don't clean up the room. Beat it. You know, you gotta come in and every three days and change the sheets. Like I'm a royalty. I changed his sheets like fucking once every three weeks. Maybe that's the only if that's only if they are white and I could tell how filthy they are. That's right. Wrinkle your nose up. You fucking pop his broads. That's how I live my life. Um, Jesus, why am I attacking women? I don't know why. What was I talking about? Oh yeah. If you, if you could punch a woman in a face, you're allowed to punches, what would you go with? Okay. What'd you go? Classic. Would you set up the overhand right with the jab? Would you actually waste the jet?

Speaker 6:          00:52:15       You know, waste a jab? Would you go, this is just evil. All right, I gotta get off this fucking subject. I know that song just annoyed me. Um, I hate those fucking songs when women just just openly talk about how they're going to go out and destroy a guy's fucking property rather than break up with them, you know? And it's considered some sort of justification, you know, rather than looking inward going, you know, maybe I'm a bad judge of character. What sort of qualities am I looking for in somebody? And I'll date that. I mean, didn't the fact that the guy had a souped up four wheel drive truck, didn't that give it all up within that? Give it away on any fucking level. Huh? In his, I mean, souped up four wheel drive truck, Carrie Underwood, your dumb fucking, what else did he have? Huh? A a fucking earring hanging down with a lightening bolt on the side of it. I have this fucking song sticks.

Speaker 6:          00:53:14       This is one of the, you know why I hate to sign this and I'm going to do my whole podcast on this fucking song. This is going to be one of those fucking songs. When I'm the raw on the road and I'm hating my life, you and I just don't want to go back to the hotel room and be lonely and I'm going to go out to a bar and that song's going to come on and fucking four fucking twats with their ear piercing. I'm singing and I'm drunk. High pitch voices are going to start singing every fucking word of that song. Liked it. They liked these fucking cunt bad asses. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:53:47       Okay. And I'm done. Alright, I'm done with that. I'm done with that fucking Oh Jesus Christ. That fucking suck.

Speaker 5:          00:54:46       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:54:49       hey, what's going on? It is Bill Burger and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday. Uh, what does it March 1st, 2009. Ah, in like a lamb out like a lion. I ate all that old fucking crap. They always talk about, you know, I've got to look at some fucking groundhog in the, what are they going to let that shit go? You know? Yeah. I've done mall shows. It's fucking left ball. Then it's gonna rain for the next nine Dars Jag. Hey nobody's, he's to dress up in a top hat like it's the fucking old days. You know what I mean? Some people are just so fucking married. It's disgusting that they, they, they just, that's all just repressed like sexual energy. You know, they've been banging this same broad until their fucking uterus dried out. You know?

Speaker 8:          00:55:43       So now they got to go out and they got to dress like fucking JP Morgan waiting for some wrote in to stick his fucking head out and then they got, you know, and if you're not familiar with the expression, they have a, what is it in like a lamb out like a lion and like a lamb out. Like I don't know what the fuck it means. You know, if it starts off good, it's going to end bad. If it starts off bad, it's going to end a good, that's how that would go. I am completely not even fucking prepared for this podcast. Usually I wait until about 45 minutes in and I let you guys figure it out that the podcast is going to suck for this week. But I'm going to give you a warning almost like have you ever see like going to movies coming out and they say a, this film has yet to be rated.

Speaker 8:          00:56:28       That means usually that means it sucks so bad. We're trying to keep it away from the critics. So by the time you figure out it's sucks, you're going to be looking at your date like, Oh God, you know what, I saw trailer, we all going to be bad. Will Smith is in it. You know, he's playing some homeless guys that even in the world. Um, yeah, this podcast is gonna suck. Um, I just got back from, uh, I was in, uh, Houston, Texas and uh, I was so good in Texas and I don't mean comedically. I mean as a person that I'm, I was just mind numbingly boring fucking, you know, I'm not drinking no internet porn. You can't do it. It's impossible. No, there's never an expression out there that says beware of the man that has no vice, isn't there? Hmm. Can I just ask you that?

Speaker 8:          00:57:19       Can I just fucking throw that out there? You know what? This is why this sucks right now cause I'm actually fucking trying to pull something up right now that I have to play because yesterday was probably the biggest fucking hockey game in the United States. Um, yeah, probably since, uh, 1980. That's what they're saying. I don't want to use that hack thing, dude, I don't want to do that. But it was fucking huge. Evidently 75% of Canada, they were estimating was watching the gold medal game and for all you Americans, actually not Americans, all you, all you people from the United States, uh, the u s has a hockey team, I'll call team USA and every four years they play in the Olympics and a, we made it to the final round for the gold medal and that game was yesterday. I know it's a little obnoxious, but that's how I felt in Houston.

Speaker 8:          00:58:15       If 75% of the people who are watching it in Canada, I don't think there was more than 75 people watching it in fucking Houston. They just completely didn't give a shit. I went down, this is basic, basically, I don't want to ruin it for you, but a Canada one, um, they just played a better game. I think that they, they were a better team. Uh, yesterday, I don't know what they did. Figured out their lines, but it was night and day since we, uh, beat them the week before how they looked, they looked awesome. I definitely thought they were a better team. And what I liked was nobody really choked. There wasn't any bullshit fucking calls. Um, I'll fuck you Canada. What the offsite thing. You guys got enough penalty. Shut the fuck up. I want to hear it. You won the game. Um, but that play was off sides and we did get a goal, but you know what I'm saying. But it was pretty much, it was, it was free of that and it went into overtime. And uh, I so wanted the United States to win because, uh, obviously I'm a huge, it was on two levels. Obviously I'm a huge hockey fan, but then secondly, the level with which Canada gives a shit, it is very few times that

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       you get a chance to devastate an entire nation and it doesn't involve dropping bombs on them. You know, like if we want that hockey game, um, I don't know what they would've been doing. Those people would have been slitting their wrists up there and their rig loose. Sorry, I just had to throw some ignorant American shit out there. Like you guys are fucking smart up there smoking cigarettes, sitting in a fucking Tim Hortons eating another fucking donut. What you think? I never been to Calgary. You know think you never thought I took that fucking highway up to Edmonton. Pass all those fucking cows in the oil wells. Fucking guys. Everybody's acting like their cosmopolitan. All worldly. Even these days, I'm getting tired of it. I'm tired of listening to the fucking hype about how fucking stupid Americans are. People who misstates here, not North Americans in general. Just people from the fucking states. And then you travel and you run into the exact same shithead that you are with a different accent. All right? Get over your fucking cells. But you know, I got to give it up. Got to give it up. Uh,

Speaker 8:          01:00:27       they won the fucking game. So I figured I'd find the gayest version. That national anthem.

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       True.

Speaker 8:          01:00:41       I think this was a, I don't know if this was old town or if this was in sync. Who did this one? This is a tribute to Canada. Our friends up north never harmed a fly. Never started a war. Like to pretend you're from Paris. Alright. Stop blaming the east. That arrogance goes right across the country. Stop with the arm down to Earth. Cause I'm from Winnipeg. I'm not buying it all you guys. You look down on us. Okay. I can't even listen to the rest. I gotta I gotta leave it. You won the fucking gold medal. Go ahead. I bet you guys a tearing up up there right now. Aren't you crying into your fucking, I don't know what, some sort of winter garb. Oh, is there any worse than acapella singing? What is the worst mimes or Acapella? I think. I think Acappella Leisha can't hear him or him. What's the deal? Yeah. Right. Sons of bitches you want again, but by the skinny teeth. Congratulations. Your fucks.

Speaker 6:          01:01:47       It's a hell of a game. Does a hell of a Goddamn game. You know, the best part was, was, uh, the United States. For those of you in America who didn't fucking watch it, uh, Zack per se, or the fuck you say his last name is, he, uh, he fucking tied it up with 20 seconds left and 75% of Canada collectively shit their pants. And I was like, oh my God, it's going to happen now that they soiled themselves. Ah, you know, they just fucking annoy me. They're cocky fans annoy me every fucking it

Speaker 8:          01:02:19       would come down. Right. Anytime you Americans doing anything good, they'd always be that fucking idiot wrapped in the, the America, the fucking Canadian flag gesturing at the fucking ice. Like the ref miss something. That's what I don't like about Canadians when it comes to hockey is their fucking, you know, this is our game. Did we get pissed when the Blue Jays won the fucking world series? I maybe a little bit. I was a, you know, I don't know. Fuck, I don't remember. You know, I did realize that the fucking Stanley Cup has not been in Canada since 1993, you know, so maybe that's why they went so crazy. Hey, what the fuck did they do? The metals, by the way, I kind of tapped out in the last couple of Olympics that you still look cool. It used to look like an Oreo cookie, but it was made out of gold that had the same sort of engraving, right.

Speaker 8:          01:03:11       Had there like the Olympic sign and now it looks like you took the metal and you put it on the fucking railroad tracks. Somebody ran over it. You know what I mean? I don't know. Whatever. I'm fucking around. Congratulations. A, that was a great game. It was great for hockey, but it was definitely a, all you guys out there, listen to me talk shit, you know, and enjoying, uh, Peyton Manning, uh, losing the Superbowl fucking up and all that. Uh, the Karma came back around. I was devastated all by myself out in Houston. And, uh, but it was, it was still great, man. And, you know, I, I did make fun of Michael will bond saying when he said, ah, this is the best hockey out there. I gotta admit, I gotta admit without the A, without the fighting. Um, the, uh, I don't know. Do you guys like no touch icing, automatic icing?

Speaker 8:          01:03:58       I liked a lot of it. I got to admit, I kind of liked the PG version of hockey. It was kind of Nice. This is sacrilegious to be saying this, but I kind of, I kind of enjoyed it, you know, to be great. If a couple of goons would make it to the fucking, the Olympic squad, you just so good. They put you on there. You just have like, you know, George La rock verse. Uh, I dunno who's the other big heavyweight, that fucking who's at big going on, on uh, Minnesota with that weird last name that has like three letter bs and an n in it or some shit. I don't fucking know. Anyways, let's plow ahead with the podcast. This is the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March 1st. Uh, the rent is due and, um, yeah, I had a hell of a fucking weekend out there in Houston, Texas.

Speaker 8:          01:04:45       I want to thank everybody who came out to the Improv. And, um, I had great shows Friday night that led into Saturday night and Saturday night. I think I might've had two of the best shows I've had in recent memory. Um, they were just, uh, everything sort of clicked. I kind of, I was sitting in this restaurant, um, eh, this is, this is how clean living I am. Okay. It's right before 7:00 AM I have an a salad with fucking a chicken breast in it. Right? I got my laptop, I'm typing out this fucking script, finishing it up, drinking a glass of water, getting the shit out of the way. And I just remember like, just having this feeling like this, this is what Tony Robbins does, you know? And that's how he has that fucking psycho, terminally happy fucking smile on his face, you know? And um, I don't know.

Speaker 8:          01:05:38       I realized some shit in that moment. I brought it to stage. I started riffing. The whole fucking thing worked. And I recorded it. But the beautiful thing about the universe is when you hit something great happens, something else has to balance it out. Like I get to see Peyton manning fuck up the Superbowl and thus make me feel vindicated. And then two weeks later, a crushing fucking over time loss. It wasn't crushing cause they used, they used to beat us by fucking, they used to be this like seven to one. All right, you gotta admit. Okay, you can at a Fox. Remember that back in the day it was a joke. Our hockey was a joke. First of all, 90% of the people in the league were all from Canada. Granted they were only six fucking teams, but still, um, and you guys used to crush us and now we're breathing down your neck and you better enjoy that gold medal cause I got a feeling that's the last one you're going to be fucking having for awhile.

Speaker 8:          01:06:26       How are you like dad? Huh? Now you wait till fucking next year buddy. Ah, can you guys handle that shit talking? All right. Anyways, so twice this weekend I had incidents with people in the crowd. Um, and both of them were women. And A, I'm the first to tell you that I do have fucking issues with women, but the, uh, the first night, um, I was on stage and there was this woman write down, I don't know if it's stage left to stage right from where I'm fucking at it stage left. All right? So I think that's the proper terminology. Why the fuck do you guys need to know stage left stage, right? You're in the crowd. You know, I go down to midas. Do I need to know what fucking wrench they're gonna use? I don't need, okay, so stage left or right, I'm looking down and a, this fucking girl is, she's, you know, she's talking, continue on with my jokes. They look down and she's still talking. So finally I say, hey, it is sweet tits.

Speaker 8:          01:07:26       Why don't you a, what's the problem? What are you talking about? And then she does the usual [inaudible], you know, I wouldn't say she was attractive if she was in from a small town. She be a Hottie, you know, just out of percentages. But um, so she did the usual like, what, what? I have a, I had no idea what the fuck I'm doing. You know, 10 minutes later I look back, she's still fucking talking. It gets a little more heated. I basically went to her table about six times until I finally told her to shut the fuck up and then I don't really even fuck her. Remember? Then all of a sudden, next thing you know, she's hammered and she's getting kicked out when I got like five minutes left in my show, so she threatened to sue the place and all this type of shit.

Speaker 8:          01:08:05       Now usually that's the end of the night, you know, the whole crowd is fucking clapping as she's leaving because she's been fucking annoying. Everybody around them who paid to see the show. All right, so usually that's the end of it. But you know what this psycho did. She actually sent a letter to the Improv and she tried to pretend that she, that she wasn't herself. She tried to pretend that she was an impartial member of the audience who completely agreed with her and thought that I was a fucking idiot. So, uh, I want to read you a little bit of this fucking letter here. Um, to whom it may concern, I attended bill burrs first show on Friday, the, uh, the 26th and was utterly appalled by his performance. I love comedy. Oh, this is what you always have to do whenever you bitch. Um, and you're not there in person so they can't see what a radiant human being you are.

Speaker 8:          01:09:00       You have to then after you state your bitch, you then have to fucking show how easygoing you are as a human being. So anyway, she saw my show. She was utterly appalled by, by my performance. And then she goes, I love comedy and I certainly expect there to be rudeness, crudity and what can be offensive topics. That's what comedy is all about. It makes it fun. That being said, okay, now she's established how fucking cool and laid back she is back to trash and oh, fucking howdy duty. Here she goes. That being said, Bill Bird took it way too far and he was quite unprofessional to say the least. While initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at. Yeah. That was the part where you was sober, your fucking lightweight. That was the beginning of the show when you weren't fucking on your nine fucking drink and you are actually paying attention to the show.

Speaker 8:          01:09:50       So yeah, initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at. I ain't, this person's trying to write as if it's medieval times and I should be like fucking holding this thing like a goddamn scroll. I know that isn't medieval ish, but she's used, she's doing that biblical thing where she's using extra fucking words to try to sound intelligent. Well, initially there was indeed quite a lot to laugh at instead of being, at first it was funny. Um, anyways, the show ended up, the show ended up being a complete disappointment okay for it. Okay. This is her complaint here for at least 30 minutes. He, blasphemy, God and the name of Jesus Christ. He outright degraded the Catholic religion. All right. Now that's complete bullshit. I only blasphemy God, the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic religion for about seven minutes. 30 minutes. What, what am I fucking George Carlin, I can't talk about anything but 30 minutes. Maybe you weren't so fucking hammered. You'd dumped cunt. You know, you'd have a better perception of, of, of how much time in a lapsed.

Speaker 8:          01:10:51       Oh Jesus. All right, let's continue. Although I'll go, that's this and another thing, another thing w was she, she's pulling this move again. He outright degraded the Catholic religion, although I do not belong to this religion. So now you're supposed to be like, wow, she's not even part of that religion. And even she found it offensive. Have you guys picked up on that? On Youtube at all? Like when someone wants to trash Obama, um, they'll say like Obama is the worst president ever. And then the right and I'm a democrat. You know, like you can prove it either way. Just trying to cut people off the past before they go, fuck you, you Fox News, watching right-wing, whatever. You know, women need to shut the fuck up. And I'm a girl, that dumb shits. Okay. So evidently she was, she was offended and she's not even a, she's not even Catholic anyway.

Speaker 8:          01:11:40       She said it was offensive and what he said went on and on again, while this type of thing should be accept a expected, he took it way too far. Um, and there was a young lady who like I and my friends was becoming offended. Yeah, of course she was because she's you, you fucking psycho. Can you believe that she thinks I'm this fucking stupid. And I know at this point is probably not obvious to you guys, but wait till I finish the rest of this. All right. I'm probably going to sound like some maniac here, but I don't give a fuck. I said there was a young lady who like I and my friends was becoming offended and said a few words instead of few words to someone at our table, you fucking lion sack a Twat. Anyways, uh, she, he said when he rudely addressed her, that's when I said, Hey lady, I guess lady is rude.

Speaker 8:          01:12:31       Hey Lady, could you do me a favor and maybe look at the show at some point. Um, he said when he really addressed her, she told him that she was Catholic. That never happened. He had no apologies or considerations. Just utter disrespect. Okay? First of all, she never said that out. She never said she was Catholic. And if she did, she said, it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it. So how the fuck could this random fucking woman in the crowd hear what she said? Oh, this fucking thing. It's gonna make me mad again. Alright, let's continue. After he finally got off that subject, his show just got worse. This is when she's on about her sixth strength. It appeared to my friends and I that he may have been getting heat from some of the audience and that he felt uncomfortable. This may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on the lady, the lady.

Speaker 8:          01:13:22       This is why I'm picking on her, not because she, I, and as I'm doing my act, by the way, I keep looking down and she's getting some sort of Martini thing that looks like there's a beer in it. I don't know what the fuck it was. It's one of those chick fucking drinks, you know, like what if we take rid pair and second fucking roofie in it? You know, she was drinking those things. Okay. And uh, so now she goes in this very male, uh, he goes, this may very well be the reason why he continued to pick on that lady even at one point telling her to shut the fuck up. Yeah. I told you to shut the fuck up because you were talking the entire time you Twat anyways. A, this is downright unprofessional. Who said that someone cannot say a few words to people at their table.

Speaker 8:          01:14:06       Did you see how obvious this is that this is this the actual fucking woman who would give a fuck this much? That you would write three pages. They were quietly speaking and not making any noise whatsoever. Oh, yet you heard her say that she was Catholic on the other side of the stage. There was another table, uh, talking quite a bit more and they were louder due to the drinks yet he did not pick on them. Do you want to fucking all, let me just fucking relax here. This isn't even funny anymore. Like I totally lost. I have, I've lost the whole humor in this. This is fucking making me so mad. They were more disruptive than anything, although he of course made jokes about it. All right? There was this table next to me. They were also drinking, but they were more doing that church thing where I would say something funny and then they was sorta like fucking repeating it so they were a little bit rowdy, but they were acceptable.

Speaker 8:          01:14:52       This woman who was fucking out drinking everyone at the other table had basically essentially her fucking back to me to the point that if I fucking punched her in the back of the head, I would've got two minutes for boarding pat. Possibly a fucking game is conduct. All right. There is something for you. Olympic hockey, fucking people. Anyways, let's, let's continue here. Actually, that would be roughing, wouldn't it? Let's say I took the mic stand and I turned it sideways. I could have crosschecked her on the fucking neck. All right, here we go. We are convinced that his wrong demeanor was due to his discomfort. After realizing that he had offended some of the audience in order to justify himself and ease any tension coming from the audience member, he said something along the lines of, don't listen to me. I'm just an idiot up here speaking. Pray for me please. That was obviously a demonstration of his uneasiness that this is, this is how drunk she was. What I was doing was I was, I was telling people in the crowd that if they were religious that I respected their religion. All right?

Speaker 8:          01:15:52       I just ha, I just personally don't buy into it. Okay, so I'm only stopping right now to say this because I know some of you, you get so religious, you get so into it that you can add. You get so holy that you can actually commit murder. You know God's usually Angela tool or you know, vengeance. I think that was the line I used. I said, okay, you shouldn't be getting mad at me. You should pray for me to help me see the light. And everyone got a huge fucking laugh at it. About it. Okay. And this lady is basically us. She's, I can't wait to email her back. I don't know. I, I've, I've flipped flopped a hundred times in my head. What I was going to say, you know, I just can't wait to, uh, I think I'm just gonna write back something really quickly.

Speaker 8:          01:16:38       Like, Ruth, you actually pretending to not be the dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Something to that effect. Basically let her know that I know that it's her and I'll see you next year at the Improv. You're content. Um, anyways, I'm very surprised. Surprised that your calling, this is where she tries to, um, this is where she tries to get me banned from the club. I'm very surprised that a, your club hosted this comedian. It was a true disappointment. I am embarrassed as I was the one who suggested the Improv when my friends and I were planning to on sing a comedy show. I do hope that you will consider not having this comedian back as he gives your club a bad name. If this is a, this had been my first time to the Improv, I never would have returned.

Speaker 8:          01:17:17       You might consider hiring some local talent. There are several good comedians in the area. We are good friends with one of them. If you'd like his name, I'll be happy to give it to [inaudible]. All right. As for the lady who we picked on, she and her table were unjustifiably asked to leave. There was no grounds on having them escorted from the show right in the middle of it. That's how drunk she was. She got escorted out 50 minutes into my one hour set and she's like, she was escorted out in the middle of it. Do you understand how drunk this woman was? I talked for, Jeez about Jesus for 30 minutes. No, actually it was seven minutes. I was escorted out in the middle. No, you actually escorted out 50 minutes into the show when you were on your fucking six drink. You're drunk count.

Speaker 8:          01:17:56       There were no grounds of on having them escorted from, uh, from the show right in the middle of it. Again, they were not being disrupted at all. This and this, this impartial person just wants to keep talking about how innocent this fucking lady is that she never met. If it hadn't been for bill burr picking on them, no one would even notice them. Okay. The kids who tell this is just the, the fucking drunk argument they had in the crowd and in the car on the ride home, the loud table. And the other side though is the one that took away attention from his show. I do understand that it is private property and then anyone can be asked to leave at any time. But this was wrong to do. This is a wrong time to do it. I personally believe that she should receive an apology from the Improv, but mostly from bill burr. That's clearly not my call. Just the thought. What a fucking, ah,

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:18:41       I don't know. Did I take too long reading that fucking thing. There you go. You want to be a standup comedian? That's what the fuck you have to deal with. She's actually like a total fucking control freak. And what happened that night was she completely lost on all levels.

Speaker 1:          01:18:57       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:18:57       You know, it's weird. You become like a part time psychologist as you're breaking down the crowd as a comedian and she sat at the power position at the table. The table is at like a fucking, we'll say like a 30 degree angle coming in stage left. This is going to get technical. All right, you fucked. Don't, don't, don't leave me here. She, you know, she didn't sit at like the the chair furthest away. If you sit furthest away, everybody you're at the table with has the back of their head to you. So then when you want to fucking talk, it's, it's a difficult time. What she did was not only did she sit in the first chair, she sat on the first chair closest to me, so they'll, so all she had to do is turn around. She had the whole fucking tables attention and when she stood up, when she went to leave her whole table stood up like a bunch of fucking minions.

Speaker 8:          01:19:42       You know, like you remember that dude, he used to carry the fucking umbrella for puffy. That's how they all got up. It was pathetic. And people like that surround themselves with fucking weak people like that because any normal people, person, you know, think about that. All you guys listening right now, if you're, if your buddy was being a drunk fucking asshole and got booted from the club, would you get up and leave immediately? Stand up like the fucking general just got up. I mean, I guess maybe you would. Could you be walk, he's drunk. Maybe he's going to go fuck and walk out and pee on a cop or something. I guess maybe. I Dunno. Anyways, you know, before I email her back, what do you guys think I should write back and come up with something clever other than calling her a con like I did.

Speaker 8:          01:20:20       I think I'm just, I'm going to write back something to the effect that I realized that it was her. And um, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Was that just a big waste of time? Should I not have been bothered with all of that? You know, I dunno. Then I had another incident with another fucking person. I don't know. I, I have issues with, with a beautiful woman. I really do. This is actually a bit I want to do on stage and I'll just, I'll maybe I'll do part of it for you here at bay. The basic idea, I just, I don't respect them on a certain level. I feel like I had to do something to achieve in life. All they had to do was basically they were born beautiful. This, it's really not an accomplishment I guess. You go to the gym, you stay beautiful past a certain age.

Speaker 8:          01:21:06       It is an accomplishment I guess. But you know, I don't know, for in order as a guy to get around beautiful women, you have to accomplish all this shit in life and all they have to do to get to where the fuck you're at after accomplishing all this shit is basically take a shower and feather their hair back like Farrah Fawcett and they're in the fucking VIP. You know? I also don't like them because, uh, I dunno. I Dunno if they're smart. They, if they're smart, they're absolutely stunning though. I have to admit that. But you know,

Speaker 1:          01:21:37       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:21:38       If they're, if they're dumb, that's like, it's like you got a Lamborghini but you find out it has a four cylinder in it, or even worse. My fucking hybrid. Did that make any fucking sense? You know, they have that one default emotion. Oh my God. And they give 58 different reads. You know, if they see something cute like a little puppy, they're like, oh, Mike,

Speaker 1:          01:21:57       good.

Speaker 8:          01:21:59       You know, if you do something sweet from, Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          01:22:04       yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:22:04       Did you know you'd do something that they fucking hate? Oh my God. Fucking idiots. They got three words floating around in there and they're in VIP, you know? Yes. Slapped a fucking spit out of the mouth. All right, let's plow ahead here. This is the Monday morning podcast and I'll also, you know, I don't know why I didn't think to say this. I'm like, oh, I have a new player. I've kind of abandoned Libsyn already. Okay. That was like my rebound girl after I broke up with fucking Geniecast. It just didn't work out. Um, you know, like Eddie Murphy and one of the spice girls, you know, but fortunately I didn't impregnate a luminosity that luminosity. I'm sorry, I've just redone that. Ah, Lipson, I'm speaking of that. I'll let the cat out of the bag. Um, this is something I'm trying to do is uh, to actually go on the internet and rather than becoming, even even dumber than I really am or is it more dumb?

Speaker 8:          01:22:56       I don't even know. I know it's more stupid. It's not stupid or is it? I have no fucking idea, but all I know is, uh, I'm trying to figure out how not to become more of a shithead online and I would really like to start this as a new segment. Where is, are there things out there that I can look at? I know ted.com I love that site even though I haven't been to it in a month. Ted like Ted kennedy.com minus the rape and alcohol. Um, there's one out here called luminosity.com, l u m o s I t y.com. And it's basically games for your brain. And I'm telling you, man, it's fucking awesome and I cannot even begin to tell you how low I scored on these things. Uh, you know, they got these things, they got everything. Literally they got one game called like duck hunting, right?

Speaker 8:          01:23:50       And what happens is a duck appears on the screen while simultaneously, you know, somewhere in your peripheral vision, while simultaneously on the screen, a letter appears. And then what you have to do is you have to click where the bird was and also remember the letter. And then when the, then they'll give you a series, like a lineup, usual suspect of letters. You got to pick the right letter. And then it's like wheel of fortune. You got one letter and you're trying to solve the word and it's a name of a bird. So you're fucking learning to look at two things at one time, process, both of them. And you're getting better at wheel of fortune all at the same time. And learning new names of fucking birds that you didn't even know existed. That's just one fucking game. Okay? So if we can get back into the ying and Yang, the balance of life, if you want to somehow balance off nine hours of fucking going onto you porn and watching people get kicked in the nuts on youtube, I highly, I can't recommend this site highly enough.

Speaker 8:          01:24:50       You can sign up, you get a free week of games, luminosity.com l u m o s, I t y.com and then, you know, even the membership is not that bad. But, um, I dunno, I'm not the brightest guy, but I think I have good common sense. And I have a feeling then in about 10 years after all the how to get fucking a six pack abs books have been written, somebody is finally going to focus on the brain and start to realize that your brain, like your fucking midsection can turn to mush the exact same way. And like I, I definitely think my brain is not nearly as sharp as it was 20 years ago. It's weird because as you get, you get older, you know, that whole thing, you know, you get older, you get wiser, you know, basically you're learning from fucking up, but you're not as sharp.

Speaker 8:          01:25:40       And, uh, I dunno this, this, this, um, this site was the closest thing to doing like mental pushups and they're cool. They're fun games, man. It taps into the video. I actually have a new found respect for video games where like, um, you know, I, I got away from video games because they were just eating up all of my free time. The last one I really played was grand theft auto part three, and it absolutely consumed my life. And the thing about that game was even after I finished the game, I had to get the sheets. I'm going to lie to you. I'm not gonna lie to you. You had to cheat, you know, um, when I finally finished everything, I would still play the game and just go on those rampages. And I found it to be like a stress relief and uh, but it was just like too much.

Speaker 8:          01:26:29       But after it, seriously, after playing those games, I kind of realized that, um, look at me. I'm too fucking stupid to convey this idea. Just go to luminosity.com and if anybody else knows any other sites like that or just something that, uh, can give me some mental setups, I would really like it because I'm, I'm getting into that stuff. Like, I don't know if I told you guys a this comedian, I forget who the fuck it was told me about. There was some book out there that was saying, um, a great exercise to do is if you're like, lefthanded is to start doing things with you that you normally do with your left hand right handed. All right, I'm going to wait for you guys to finish doing the Dick joke there. [inaudible] fucking rub. One elder will wait few weeks. Somebody else, uh, you guys fist pumping in your cubicles with that hack joke from fucking make me laugh in 1977.

Speaker 8:          01:27:14       Can I continue with my podcast? Thank you. Um, no, it actually, I don't know what it does. It's, it's somehow it actually makes you more, uh, God, I'm so fucking stupid. What is the word? Um, like say if you were playing guitar, say if you're, uh, if you're a lefthanded guitarist like I am, it's so pathetic to even call myself a guitar. Someone who attempts to play guitar. Um, I play left handed. If you actually, if I were actually to fuck around on a right handed guitar and try to learn to play something, if I, then the the second I went to the lefthanded guitar, you would actually learn it quicker. I have no idea why, which should be obvious at this point because I could barely fucking explain it. So anyways, I fly a lot. It drives me nuts. I hate flying. And so what I do when I fly is I actually sit there and I listen to music and I write the lyrics with my right hand rather than my left hand.

Speaker 8:          01:28:10       And I've actually gotten like halfway decent at it. And uh, at the very least I'm thinking of someday if I'm unfortunate enough to have a stroke, you know, my turnaround time's going to be incredible. I'll be rubbing them out. I'll be right in fucking letters catching the drool with my opposite hand. You know, that's so fucking bad. Yeah, that's what it is. Join me. Become stroke proof or whatever. Not stroke proof. Become A, I dunno, cuts your rehab costs 50%. God knows nobody has fucking health insurance anymore. It could be a good thing. Right? Have I said anything funny in the last fucking 19 minutes? I have no idea. Somewhere in the middle of that letter I got fucking mad again and all the funny went out the window. And I'll tell you the first rule of fucking losing a crowd. Well, I guess no confidence and having no jokes would be first, but other that it's just going up there and being an angry fucking cycle.

Speaker 8:          01:29:04       Um, oh, I want to thank everybody for, uh, you know, last week I talked about women's curling and uh, and by the way, I totally enjoyed the Olympics. I love the Winter Olympics and I'm sick of people shitting on them. All these late night talk show hosts talking about how those are the fucking boring. Really. Why don't you go do another lame monologue, Huh? About fucking that girl who got eaten by a fucking whale. Give me your take. Coming out there wearing a suit like you have a fucking war when before you had the Goddamn show. Sorry. You know I get heated when people make fun of the Olympics. You know, I was talking about how hot the fucking women of curling were. A little bit of phlegm left. Um, and somebody said a was actually saying like, I was trying to figure out why I was finding these fucking women so attractive other than the obvious that they were good looking women.

Speaker 8:          01:29:49       This guy actually said, hey, bill, uh, beside the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor, I really set that up bad. He's saying, this is why men find women curlers attractive. I just blew that joke. He said, besides the obvious hot women vigorously scrubbing the floor, I have two t I you so deserved a huge laugh on that and I just fucked you out of it. I'm sorry about that. Um, anyways, he says, I have figured out why we love watching this so much. When they released that stone, the way they let it slide out of their hand is reminiscent of the way a skillful woman releases your cock after delivering a massive hand job. First of all, I hope you're a surfer because that's the only reason why to the massive hand job, um, fucking massive hand job. Or maybe you just have a fucking bit, oh, maybe I'll just, you have a fat cock.

Speaker 8:          01:30:47       I Dunno. So anyways, she goes a, they don't drop it. Don't push it. Just let it slide out naturally as I go to sleep with my boxes around my ankles. Oh, I forgot. That was creepy. I know. I read it. I was supposed to just read the beginning joke cause I thought the joke was fucking great. I forgot the fucking picture in his ugh guys with those fucking insect looking legs on guy's legs, like insects with that fucking hair all over him. Skinny fucking legs were a mess. Fucking mess. I'm like praying mantis legs. Anyways, I'm a long time ago. I talked about unacceptable. This is when, you know the podcast sucks and I'm just plowing from fucking topic to topic and there's just no sort of a no segway other than dead silence. Um, let's go to youtube videos for the week. Let's, let's, let's go over here. You know, I feel like the fucking dumb fuck on, uh, on like jeopardy when there's like five difficult topics in one easy ones, you know, great scientist, architecture, medieval, whatever. And let's go, let's go with, uh, developments in lawn chairs for 100.

Speaker 8:          01:32:02       That's not even easy, isn't it? I'm so far. I'm just too dumb. I'm too fucking dumb. Whatever. You know what? I played those brain games. I'm too stupid this week. Here's a youtube video to look up. Look up Douche off. D O u c h e o f f a Douche off. Maybe you'll find that humorous. I can't remember if I did. I think I did. I believe I did because I left it there. Ah, bad wedding stories. This is another topic. Who the fuck do I sound like I'm doing right now? Did somebody do a Bob Dole impression lay out of, I can't. Can I tap out at this fucking point 37 minutes in a bag. Wedding stories. I'm, hey bill, I haven't listened to your podcast since the beginning. Decided it was about time I emailed you and told you how much I enjoy it.

Speaker 8:          01:32:46       Thank you very much. Uh, but, but the, the, okay, let's get to the, uh, to get to the marriage thing. Um, okay. I got a marriage story when I was 23. I was dating a girl and she got pregnant. Uh, dude. Okay. Uh, so we decided to get married. Okay. Stupid. Fucking move number two, even though a month before this I was thinking about dumping her ass. Stupid mistake number three. Actually that was the smart move. That was the, that was the three card Monte right there. Don't knock her up. Don't fucking marry your white. Knock her up. Marry her dumper ass. You know which one had the marble? You fucked up. All right, so all the plans are made, our families meet each other. Okay. Just cause I, you know, had to do that stupid three card Monte joke in a desperate attempt to try to be remotely funny at this point.

Speaker 8:          01:33:42       You know, it was, I have a blue wind screen this week. I'm going to blow that. I'm going to, I'm going to blame it on that one. You know, my fucking dog ate the orange one, so I'm going to blame it on the blue windscreen. Anyway. So basically, sky's 23 years old. He knocks up this fucking girl. He decides to get married even though he, he thought about dumping our month before. So anyway, so all the plans are made. Um, families meet each other, invitations are sent out, all that bullshit. So three days before the wedding, I'm watching some stupid movie where this guy tells his other guy that his dad told him before his wedding, it's never too late to change your mind, to which his friend says, but you're not married. And I guess it is. That's a laugh. So anyways, uh, so taking this as a sign from God that I just happened to be watching this movie.

Speaker 8:          01:34:30       I canceled a wedding. Great fucking move. Alright. Which says, suffice to say, brought a shit storm into my life. The worst part is that I actually felt so bad. I married the chick three months later. Oh Dude, you were out. You will fucking out. So basically I was a pussy. Yeah. Yeah, but too, that's a hard thing. You were dealing with a lot of shit at 23 your parents were crying. She was knocked up. Yeah. I wouldn't say you were pussy. You gave into peer pressure. Anyways, we were married for seven years with every year being worse than the year before. So we're divorced. So we're divorced now. So I guess I should have gone with my gut to wrap this up, I got a little gripe with, with chicks. My ex used to ask me when the marriage was going down, if I could go back, would I not meet her?

Speaker 8:          01:35:26       Which I would say, fuck yeah, I would avoid you like the plague. Which she would say, uh, but w at which point she would say, but you wouldn't have our two kids, don't you love them? And then he would say, yeah, but then I'd say, but I, I would never have met you, so I would have never had the kids. So in that scenario, the kids aren't even a thought. This of course would lead to a huge fight about my lack of carrying a moral to the story. Don't use logic when talking to chicks. All right? That's actually not the moral to the story. What it is, is you got to think how women think, you know, which, you know, if you're lucky, at some point when you're 90, you'll know, you'll understand 10% of what the fuck is going on in that brain. Um, basically when she's asking you that, she was asking that, I would guess one of two reasons.

Speaker 8:          01:36:20       One, she was insecure that, you know, you knocked her up and then you married her and you know that you were gonna marry her. Then you broke it off and then you fucking married her. Uh, believe it or not, I'm sure that's not how she dreamed of getting married. She probably dreamed of meeting her soulmate and they were so hopelessly in love that everyone in the crowd had tears in their lies for. They never found a love soap as great as theirs. She could have been thinking that and she wanted you to reassure her or she probably was just banging you, you know, and didn't want to fucking marry you and didn't think that you were the one either. And all of a sudden she got knocked up and she probably sitting there looking at the side of your fucking head one morning as you were eating pancakes, trying to find where in the world she loves you.

Speaker 8:          01:37:11       You know, on what fucking level. You know, just watching your temples going in and out as you're chewing, just fighting that fucking urge to slam a toaster over your fucking head. You know, just wondering, how the hell did I end up with this fucking guy? Why did I say Yes to this guy? Why did I let him fucking drop a fucking load in me? What is wrong with me? And just trying to make the fact that you had these two kids justice justice enough, you know, that's what the fuck was probably going on. But, uh, I dunno dude, you didn't really talk about how much of a nightmare the wedding was that that was the meat of the story there. I think you at the beginning and the end. But what are you thinking is she's coming down the aisle. What is your family thinking? You're not her up and then you dumped her and yen and you're like, fuck it, I'll marry or anyways, and you're only 23 they know you don't want to do it. Those weren't tears of joy, my friend, you know? What are you thinking? Is your up there? You know, was your Cumberbun like wringing wet with flop sweat as you was standing up? I can't imagine that.

Speaker 3:          01:38:21       Ugh.

Speaker 8:          01:38:23       Has anybody ever just ran off the side door? Cause I could definitely see like, oh my God, I don't know what to say. How do I get out of this shit? And then just in a panic when they started, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, you turn around looking, where is she a what a fucked and I have some wedding music underneath this would've would've been hilarious if I fucking prepared. You know, you're looking for the bitch, where the fuck is you? And then she comes around the corner and you're trying to make yourself lover and she comes around the corner and you just see that fucking face and you see those eyebrows and you know, we're going to be touching by the time she's 40 and you just fucking run out the side door in those cheap tuxedo bowling shoes

Speaker 8:          01:39:12       and you know what I mean? And you're in such a fucking panic, you know, there's no way that you're going to be able to get your car keys out in time, get them into the door, open the door, lock the door and get in there. And it's like people are going to be coming out running out of the church like some fucking Zombie movie as you're trying to get your car started. I mean the move there is shit, if anybody does that, don't go to your car. You keep running. Okay. Most people get married in the suburbs, so headed head for a wooded area. Alright, go online. Learn how to turn your fucking Cumberbun into a tent. Hang out there for a couple of days. Let Shit cool off. Grow a beard, come back to town, get some provisions that point you'll be so fucking filthy. You just another homeless guy wearing a suit.

Speaker 8:          01:40:02       You know what I mean? Just let her forget all about you. Then maybe they'll think that you're mentally ill and then uh, you know, one day you just show up on your mother's front steps and she faints. Her Dad catches you and punches you in the face cause he's a former marine. You know, haven't we all seen this movie? I'm trying to say. Run out the fucking door. Run out the fucking door if you're in that situation, if you're in that situation. All right, bill, longtime listener, first time writer. I've got a winning story to tell you. I'm 23 years old now. The 23 year old, I'd been to a, here's one for you. Don't go to a wedding or get married at 23. They all seem to have bad stories. Um, I've been to a few weddings and let me start by saying in this story, it wasn't actually a wedding I witnessed.

Speaker 8:          01:40:48       It was a wicking, a Wiccan hand fastening. Okay. Now though, for those of you not familiar with the Wiccan religion, I just want to state at this point, neither am I. Um, I can't remember if that's the one that actually has all those, uh, pagans symbols that, you know, the Catholic Church then so that they were devil signs according to the, uh, fucking Rosetta Stone or whatever that fucking movie was. I read the book too. What the fuck is the name of that Davinci Code? Um, whatever it was called, a wicked hand. Fascinating. And I know that because my sister didn't invite people to our wedding, she invited them to her hand fastening. That's why he knew it was a Wiccan hand fastening and not a wedding. Because she said, I'd like to invite you to my hand fastening cheeses. Um, he said, if you're 41, you still don't know what a hand fastening is.

Speaker 8:          01:41:45       Congratulations. Thank you. Because I didn't, so anyways, he goes, I'm 17 at the time, my sister's 23 or 24, we both still lived with our parents who are boyfriend and unemployed, alcoholic living off money. His mom left him when she died. Ah, there you go ladies. There you go. You don't have to settle for less when this guys like him out there. Um, anyways. Um, fuck am I, why didn't I make this type bigger? Jesus. What a flop this podcast is. So anyways, a, so this fucking alcoholic was over for dinner one night. He tapped his fork on the glass a few times to get everyone's attention. We were three feet from him and immediately my stomach knotted up because I knew this moron was about to say something stupid. You've got to meet you. You guys are fucking funny writers, man. Some really talented people. Listen to this fucking podcast. You guys write better than I do. Anyways, basically he announced his engagement to my sister in front of my mom and dad pulled out two onyx rings and they put them on each other's middle fingers. You know, I went to the Onyx Strip club in Houston last night. How funny is that? Anyways, it was dead silent and um, the look of re a repressed horror on my mom's face was unmistakable. It was so awkward. So I just started clapping going Yay. Quietly because nobody else joined in.

Speaker 8:          01:43:11       Oh, that's great. Is that your role in the family? You're, the person always tries to make it better. Uh, God bless you. Anyways, it was just dead silence and my sister and her boyfriend kissing each other like everything was fine. A few months later I found out they were financing those rings and going into payments on them. Every week. My sister's collecting child support and neither of them have a job and they are financing onyx hand fastening rinks. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. I can't believe there's more to this story. All right, here we go. Fucking knee deep. I got to go the rest of the way. All right. Anyway, so I finally, uh, it finally to their hand, fascinating day, and they're doing the ceremony right on Newport beach. It's in the middle of the day on a, on Sunday in the summer, they didn't have, oh, they didn't reserve a piece of beach or anything. They just showed up and go, hey, let's have the wedding here.

Speaker 8:          01:44:11       Um, the family we had, I don't know. Fuck, I gotta sit close to the damn screen. I can't read anymore. The family we have near the beach mostly all showed up. All the people who live near the beach mostly showed all up. There were about 30 or 40 of us. None of us, none of us are dressed in beach clothes. Half of them are in suits and dresses. There are no chairs. There's not even an altar. Everybody's just standing around hot and they can't sit down because there's no chairs and they don't, they don't want to ruin their clothes. My sister shows up in an all black gown with a veil. The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux with his face painted like one of the misfits, kind of like a skeleton face. Jesus Christ. It sounds like the episode of the office. Anyways, they don't do any traditional wedding stuff.

Speaker 8:          01:44:57       They just go right up front of the crowd with their Wiccan priest or whatever. The wicked priest is basically just a friend of theirs. He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff from a book in some other language. My sister and the boyfriend are responding in some other language. Nobody has any idea what's going on. Then all of a sudden, the boyfriend pulls out this crazy looking knife with a what? A hilt. I didn't know what that is. Uses it to cut my sister's veil. Then pokes the end of it into his finger until he's bleeding. He sticks the knife into the sand and wraps his bloody hand around my sister's neck while they kiss. The stone. Hippy priest holds up his book and said something loud in that different language. I assume it was her equivalent equivalent of I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Speaker 8:          01:45:47       I'm sure being comedian. You've heard the sound of 50 people gasping simultaneously. Family members in suits and dresses are just walking away at this point. A lifeguard saw with the boyfriend did with the knife called the cop and the day ended prematurely with him getting cuffed and driven away in a police cruiser. Jesus Christ. Anyways, thanks for the podcasts. I really enjoy Jesus Christ. How about a fucking round of applause for that story? All right. I think I have to read up on the a Wiccan religion. You know, one thing I did like about that, I did like the fact that they just showed up and just decided to have a wedding and they avoided all those other costs. Um, cause I wanted to say halfway through that, like, you know, they didn't have, they didn't reserve that piece of the beach or anything. And I was thinking like, well, you never had to back in the day. You know what I mean? You just fucking had a wedding. There was, it wasn't like nine zillion fucking dollars. Didn't matter where you were, but I guess you have to do that now. Uh, because there's nine zillion people and uh, and bankers run

Speaker 6:          01:46:49       the fucking world. Hey, speaking of that, did you, somebody sent me an email the other day. Evidently Europe elected a president. You hear that Europe elected a president, not England, not France, Europe, the entire continent now has a fucking president, has one guy in charge of all of them. See that just like those three d TVs that are only a few months away, that new world daughter is going to be available right down at the best. Come and sewed, come and fucking soon. If you go on and read about the uh, the bailout, uh, rolling stone has a great article and a, usually I try to stay away from their politics because there's so brutally to the left. It's fucking ridiculous. Um, you know, they never trashed Democrats or when they do it, so like light hand, they just doing it just because they trashed a republican so bad. They're trying to show that they're fair and balanced like those other fucking maniacs. Um, Fox News actually has a store now when you go through the airport, which I think is hilarious, they sell water and that type of shit. So I dunno, it's going to be with going gonna be one fucking news channel. There's going to be one president and one fucking currency and money and you better do what they say.

Speaker 8:          01:48:01       Oh, I ra, that's going to be the end of it, my friends. Um, anyways, if you want to check it out, it's the, um, it's the rolling stone that actually has, uh, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck on the cover. And if you guys are fans of music, I guess they're going to be doing a tour together, which is unbelievable. They used to be big time rivals back in the day and now they're fucking in their sixties. They're like, yeah, let's get some money for the medication we now need. And A, I guess they're going to be doing a tour and a, and with that, um, I didn't have time, you know, cause I, I got a couple of weird weeks coming up guys. I gotta tell you this. Well, I usually take Sundays off, so I'm flying home on Sundays and so then I get a good night's sleep and I can give you a decent podcast.

Speaker 8:          01:48:41       But, uh, this week and this upcoming week, I'm going to be at the Improv in San Jose. And I am working Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday so I won't be, uh, it is a quick flight. So the next weeks will be a good podcast, but that's why this one was so late today. So I apologize and I didn't get a chance to recommend any of the music that you guys have been sending in, but I'll definitely try to read it next week. And uh, I finally have gotten into Pan Tara to a sick fucking level and, um, if you get a chance, um, download a vulgar display of power or cowboys from hell. And um, I actually used to play in this fucking, uh, you know, garage band and a, my brothers and some of their other friends, she used to get into thrash and I was never into it. I was more liking to ACDC and John Bonam and trying to get my bass drum foot is fast as bottoms, so I never got a double pedal or any of that shit.

Speaker 8:          01:49:40       Well, few years ago, I finally got one and listening to cowboys from hell, I got to fucking get that down because, uh, I dunno, combination of Vinny Paul and Tim Alexander really make me want to play double bass and Alex Van Halen. Those are, uh, and I'm actually listening to the lamb of God. Now. I don't know what the fuck happened. You guys sent me that old school fucking hip hop from the late nineties. I fucking devoured that shit. And then now I'm going into deep into thrash. I Dunno. I like all of it. I like all of it except country music. Oh, speaking of which, you seen that stupid song that fucking woman wrote about being a redneck woman. How she likes being a redneck woman. Okay. If you guys, if you got crushed in this economy, if you want to get rich quick scheme, just write an anthem that celebrates being a complete fucking moron.

Speaker 8:          01:50:31       And I'm in, you basically tell people that under achieving in life is a good thing and people will absolutely love it. Like, just sing those stupid songs where like, I'd rather have a beer and sit in my own to where then fucking eat a steak and visit all the countries because, well, it's never going to be better land. But you can right here with my book and Banjo in a bear, in a tennis fit. All right. Something like that. It has to rhyme, you know, and then you gotta throw the fucking flag in there. I'll tell you right now, if, if, if, if country musicians ever did stand up, they would be the fucking worst comedian. They would be the exact kind of comedian. I hate the one that panders to the crowd, which is what, you know, the ones that fucking sit there and they look at this guy, he knows what I'm talking about.

Speaker 8:          01:51:22       Right. Back me up ladies. You know, oh look at this crowd. It could look in crowd and I give yourselves a round of applause for coming out tonight. Gad always love coming out here is one of my favorite cities. You know, they say that every town. So it doesn't fucking mean anything. That's what country singers alike a lot of them fucking singing those songs about supporting the troops. I mean, I mean, you fucking pussy take a chance. You know, you run a song support in the fucking troops, like, like any critic out there is now going to say like, well, you know, it's Kinda hacky chord progressions. I've heard that before. They can't because you're insulated by fucking putting our troops in front of you. You fucking pussy and bullying. I locked Bayer and ice cream. If you don't get the fuck out the country, well you know I like, I like, I like beer and ice cream too. You know, he's got everything in there, but saying we shouldn't fucking punch babies. Don't punch babies. Ain't, don't step on the American flag. And if you do, I'm going to punch you in the face. Everybody. All right. Thanks for listening to this week. Sorry. It was so disjointed and fucked up, but that's what you get when it's free, Huh? Oh, little Catholic guilt there. I do it for you.
