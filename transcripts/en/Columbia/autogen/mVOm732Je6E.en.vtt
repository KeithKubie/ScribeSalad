Poland these two possibilities these two
options were tried in a subsequent not

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:10.510
options were tried in a subsequent not
 

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.020

only decades but almost two centuries

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.030
only decades but almost two centuries
 

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:20.130

the the most interesting testing ground

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:20.140
the the most interesting testing ground
 

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.930
the the most interesting testing ground
of all these options and problems due to

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:24.940
of all these options and problems due to
 

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.870
of all these options and problems due to
the really dramatic compensation in

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880
the really dramatic compensation in
 

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.140
the really dramatic compensation in
those years of great hopes great efforts

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.150
those years of great hopes great efforts
 

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.520
those years of great hopes great efforts
and even greater disappointments were

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:34.530
and even greater disappointments were
 

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.970
and even greater disappointments were
years of the so-called great same the
