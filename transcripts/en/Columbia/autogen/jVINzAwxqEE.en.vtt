a little bit of data about the peer
 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.150
a little bit of data about the peer
review processes I've picked it out and

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160
review processes I've picked it out and
 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
review processes I've picked it out and
it is very particular to the experiences

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170

use it and develop further from it ok

use it and develop further from it ok
and so how do we do that these days well

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:11.380
and so how do we do that these days well
 

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.860
and so how do we do that these days well
we use peer-reviewed journals of the

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:13.870
we use peer-reviewed journals of the
 

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.170
we use peer-reviewed journals of the
highest possible stature and I see that

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.180
highest possible stature and I see that
 

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.760
highest possible stature and I see that
and it's you know it's heartbreaking to

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:17.770
and it's you know it's heartbreaking to
 

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.590
and it's you know it's heartbreaking to
me the stature element I won't talk

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600
me the stature element I won't talk
 

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.440
me the stature element I won't talk
about it very much today but if we get

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.450
about it very much today but if we get
 

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.690
about it very much today but if we get
back to it I think we all know the

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:24.700
back to it I think we all know the
 

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.840
back to it I think we all know the
importance of journal stature in terms

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.850
importance of journal stature in terms
 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.730
importance of journal stature in terms
of promotions and grants and all the

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:29.740
of promotions and grants and all the
 

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.640
of promotions and grants and all the
rest of it so we want some and and and

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:32.650
rest of it so we want some and and and
 

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.080
rest of it so we want some and and and
then I guess you know one way of

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.090
then I guess you know one way of
 

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.370
then I guess you know one way of
thinking about stature is if you can get

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:35.380
thinking about stature is if you can get
 

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.520
thinking about stature is if you can get
your journal into this really important

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:38.530
your journal into this really important
 

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.230
your journal into this really important
if you get your paper into this really

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240
if you get your paper into this really
 

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.230
if you get your paper into this really
important journal then you have somebody

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240
important journal then you have somebody
 

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.840
important journal then you have somebody
has decided that it's likely to be

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:45.850
has decided that it's likely to be
 

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.310
has decided that it's likely to be
really important and so you don't have

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320
really important and so you don't have
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.080
really important and so you don't have
to wait for the importance to be proven

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.090
to wait for the importance to be proven
 

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.240
to wait for the importance to be proven
by the fact that other people have

by the fact that other people have
actually made use of it or talk about it

actually made use of it or talk about it
 

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.470
actually made use of it or talk about it
or find it important you actually have

and we use peer review to somehow give

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:03.670
and we use peer review to somehow give
 

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.700
and we use peer review to somehow give
you a sense that you really did have a

you a sense that you really did have a

so you use reviewers to somehow be able

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:09.670
so you use reviewers to somehow be able
 

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.780
so you use reviewers to somehow be able
to help you help the journal assess

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:12.790
to help you help the journal assess
 

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.810
to help you help the journal assess
whether you get to make that claim the

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:15.820
whether you get to make that claim the
 

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.720
whether you get to make that claim the
discovery so journals use it as I said

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:18.730
discovery so journals use it as I said
 

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.640
discovery so journals use it as I said
to find out whether you have a right to

to find out whether you have a right to
 

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.160
to find out whether you have a right to
make that claim and in the basic

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.170
make that claim and in the basic
 

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.270
make that claim and in the basic
sciences we would say whether the

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.280
sciences we would say whether the
 

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.010
sciences we would say whether the
conclusions you draw from your research

conclusions you draw from your research
 

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.270

but I think that's true too in the

but I think that's true too in the
 

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.850
but I think that's true too in the
humanities whether you justified them

but I think everybody asked reviewers to

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.300
but I think everybody asked reviewers to
 

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.910
but I think everybody asked reviewers to
do some sort of assessment of that so I

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920
do some sort of assessment of that so I
 

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.700
do some sort of assessment of that so I
asked of authors and I'd sort of curious

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:11.710
asked of authors and I'd sort of curious

their own experiences change their
perspective and I do that before I ever

you submit anything yes right so the

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:28.539
you submit anything yes right so the
 

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:30.539
you submit anything yes right so the
question is why do you need a nun so so

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:30.549
question is why do you need a nun so so
 

00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:32.219
question is why do you need a nun so so
I would ask you to just muddle it over

00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:32.229
I would ask you to just muddle it over
 

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.139
I would ask you to just muddle it over
saying I told it that's peer review and

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:34.149
saying I told it that's peer review and
 

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:36.659
saying I told it that's peer review and
its purest form right and what I'm going

00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:36.669
its purest form right and what I'm going
 

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.309
its purest form right and what I'm going
I hope I can argue is that peer review

00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:38.319
I hope I can argue is that peer review
 

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.569
I hope I can argue is that peer review
when it's tied to journal submission

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:39.579
when it's tied to journal submission
 

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.449
when it's tied to journal submission
gets real it's hard for reviewers to do

00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:42.459
gets real it's hard for reviewers to do
 

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:43.949
gets real it's hard for reviewers to do
that well because of all the biases that

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959
that well because of all the biases that
 

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:49.109
that well because of all the biases that
come in um so do you ever get frustrated

00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:49.119
come in um so do you ever get frustrated
 

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.779
come in um so do you ever get frustrated
by the review process in that it doesn't

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:51.789
by the review process in that it doesn't
 

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.849
by the review process in that it doesn't
give you what you expect that it asks

00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:53.859
give you what you expect that it asks
 

00:13:53.859 --> 00:13:55.799
give you what you expect that it asks
for things that are unreasonable that it

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:55.809
for things that are unreasonable that it

for things that are unreasonable that it
seems like the reviewers don't know your

00:13:58.919 --> 00:13:58.929
seems like the reviewers don't know your
 

00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:00.569
seems like the reviewers don't know your
field as well as you do which actually

00:14:00.569 --> 00:14:00.579
field as well as you do which actually
 

00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:03.179
field as well as you do which actually
you hope they don't because you're the

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:03.189
you hope they don't because you're the
 

00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:04.799
you hope they don't because you're the
expert right does that ever do you ever

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:04.809
expert right does that ever do you ever
 

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:07.649
expert right does that ever do you ever
get frustrated I think that's probably

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:07.659
get frustrated I think that's probably
 

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:10.409
get frustrated I think that's probably
often the case and if you ever felt that

00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:10.419
often the case and if you ever felt that
 

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:15.509
often the case and if you ever felt that
a review you've seen is biased and I

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519
a review you've seen is biased and I
 

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.219
a review you've seen is biased and I
think all I mean I you know it's one of

00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:17.229
think all I mean I you know it's one of
 

00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:18.779
think all I mean I you know it's one of
those things that I'll get to I mean we

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:18.789
those things that I'll get to I mean we
 

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:20.909
those things that I'll get to I mean we
expect this absence of bias in the

00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:20.919
expect this absence of bias in the
 

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:22.799
expect this absence of bias in the
review system that hello were human you

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:22.809
review system that hello were human you
 

00:14:22.809 --> 00:14:24.960
review system that hello were human you
know and so I think bias actually exist

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:24.970
know and so I think bias actually exist
 

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.669
know and so I think bias actually exist
so reviewers those we've done that

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:26.679
so reviewers those we've done that
 

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:29.129
so reviewers those we've done that
why do you agree to review a paper in

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:29.139
why do you agree to review a paper in
 

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:33.239
why do you agree to review a paper in
the first place somebody tell me why do

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:33.249
the first place somebody tell me why do
 

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:36.749
the first place somebody tell me why do
you review service to the community so

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759
you review service to the community so
 

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:38.399
you review service to the community so
you just feel it's your job and you'll

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:38.409
you just feel it's your job and you'll
 

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:39.869
you just feel it's your job and you'll
do it does anyone do it because they

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:39.879
do it does anyone do it because they
 

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.689
do it does anyone do it because they
want to get a advance view of something

00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:42.699
want to get a advance view of something
 

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:46.109
want to get a advance view of something
that's relevant to their own research do

00:14:46.109 --> 00:14:46.119
that's relevant to their own research do
 

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:48.029
that's relevant to their own research do
they do it because they feel that by

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:48.039
they do it because they feel that by
 

00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:50.669
they do it because they feel that by
being a reviewer they have an influence

00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:50.679
being a reviewer they have an influence
 

00:14:50.679 --> 00:15:05.750

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760
 

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.490
so a reviewer can be incredibly

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:08.500
so a reviewer can be incredibly
 

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.590
so a reviewer can be incredibly
important by helping set the standards

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.040
six months to a year or whatever better
 

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.669

the current you know time from from
 

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.409
the current you know time from from
publication to when a lot of journals

00:19:17.409 --> 00:19:17.419
publication to when a lot of journals
 

00:19:17.419 --> 00:19:18.970

now make their work feel available and I

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:18.980
now make their work feel available and I
 

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.409
now make their work feel available and I
think editors really need to think about

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:20.419
think editors really need to think about
 

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.750
think editors really need to think about
what they're doing when they're just

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760
what they're doing when they're just
 

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.500
what they're doing when they're just
asking for

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:23.510
asking for
 

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.740
asking for
experiments okay so this led me to write

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:26.750
experiments okay so this led me to write
 

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.420
experiments okay so this led me to write
an editorial a couple of years ago where

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:28.430
an editorial a couple of years ago where
 

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.430
an editorial a couple of years ago where
I said it's ironic here we are in this

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440
I said it's ironic here we are in this
 

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.960
I said it's ironic here we are in this
Internet era where we could blog our

I am a scientist by training and I just

put out this claim so I wanted to know

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:48.620
put out this claim so I wanted to know
 

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.120
put out this claim so I wanted to know
whether that was true at least in the

whether that was true at least in the
 

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.680
whether that was true at least in the
field in which I've worked so I looked

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:53.690
field in which I've worked so I looked
 

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.450
field in which I've worked so I looked
at the Journal of cell biology I said it

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.460
at the Journal of cell biology I said it
 

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.820
at the Journal of cell biology I said it
was the first journal that I'd ever

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:57.830
was the first journal that I'd ever
 

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.230
was the first journal that I'd ever
published it and that's why I had a

00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240
published it and that's why I had a
 

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.970
published it and that's why I had a
particular interest in looking at it I

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:00.980
particular interest in looking at it I
 

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.130
particular interest in looking at it I
published my paper in June of 1985 so

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140
published my paper in June of 1985 so
 

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.960
published my paper in June of 1985 so
it's very self oriented bit of

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:04.970
it's very self oriented bit of
 

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.700
it's very self oriented bit of
preliminary research I looked at two

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:06.710
preliminary research I looked at two
 

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.990
preliminary research I looked at two
intermediate years and I did this

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000
intermediate years and I did this
 

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.480
intermediate years and I did this
analysis in 2008 and I just looked at

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.490
analysis in 2008 and I just looked at
 

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.270
analysis in 2008 and I just looked at
the published records for time sub from

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280
the published records for time sub from
 

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.860
the published records for time sub from
submission to acceptance and I'm going

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:14.870
submission to acceptance and I'm going
 

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.660
submission to acceptance and I'm going
to show you those data with a little bit

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:16.670
to show you those data with a little bit
 

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.990
to show you those data with a little bit
of commentary as I go along so the red

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000
of commentary as I go along so the red
 

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.140
of commentary as I go along so the red
lines the median okay June 8th 1985 so

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:23.150
lines the median okay June 8th 1985 so
 

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.060
lines the median okay June 8th 1985 so
that little dot at the bottom 0 days

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.070
that little dot at the bottom 0 days
 

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.710
that little dot at the bottom 0 days
from that was my paper so it was a

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720
from that was my paper so it was a
 

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.280
from that was my paper so it was a
little bit unusual even then but the

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.290
little bit unusual even then but the
 

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.250
little bit unusual even then but the
median time from its from submission to

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:33.260
median time from its from submission to
 

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.820
median time from its from submission to
acceptance in 1985 was 87 days I believe

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:38.830
acceptance in 1985 was 87 days I believe
 

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.640
acceptance in 1985 was 87 days I believe
97 12 years later it was about the same

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:41.650
97 12 years later it was about the same
 

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:47.730
97 12 years later it was about the same
and then somewhere around 2000 or so

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:47.740
and then somewhere around 2000 or so
 

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.250
and then somewhere around 2000 or so
2002 2003 we got electronic journal

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.260
2002 2003 we got electronic journal
 

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.800
2002 2003 we got electronic journal
submission so we actually cut a lot of

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:53.810
submission so we actually cut a lot of
 

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.400
submission so we actually cut a lot of
time of mailing reviews out having you

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:57.410
time of mailing reviews out having you
 

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.960
time of mailing reviews out having you
know 22 weeks later getting something

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:58.970
know 22 weeks later getting something
 

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.450

back saying I can't do this if any if

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.460
back saying I can't do this if any if
 

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.890
back saying I can't do this if any if
everything was the same you sort of

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:02.900
everything was the same you sort of
 

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.080
everything was the same you sort of
expect the time from submission to

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.090
expect the time from submission to
 

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.240
expect the time from submission to
acceptance to go down and in clinical

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.250
acceptance to go down and in clinical
 

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.040
acceptance to go down and in clinical
research actually where people have

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.050
research actually where people have
 

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.870
research actually where people have
tracked it it has to some degree gone

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880
tracked it it has to some degree gone
 

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.330
tracked it it has to some degree gone
down because some clinical research you

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:13.340
down because some clinical research you
 

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.520
down because some clinical research you
can't actually redo this you can't redo

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:15.530
can't actually redo this you can't redo
 

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.470
can't actually redo this you can't redo
the clinical research right that's done

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480
the clinical research right that's done
 

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.390
the clinical research right that's done
it's been rearranged long before you

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400
it's been rearranged long before you
 

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.130
it's been rearranged long before you
start it but in basic research you can

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:21.140
start it but in basic research you can
 

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.660
start it but in basic research you can
always do another experiment and here we

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:22.670
always do another experiment and here we
 

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.970
always do another experiment and here we
are where things should be moving faster

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:24.980
are where things should be moving faster
 

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.340
are where things should be moving faster
and and now we've doubled we're now 180

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:27.350
and and now we've doubled we're now 180
 

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.010
and and now we've doubled we're now 180
days and I've spoken with editors at

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.020
days and I've spoken with editors at
 

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.420
days and I've spoken with editors at
Journal of cell biology and they say

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:31.430
Journal of cell biology and they say
 

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.730
Journal of cell biology and they say
this is an underestimate of the real

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:33.740
this is an underestimate of the real
 

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.810
this is an underestimate of the real
time it take

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:34.820
time it take
 

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.210
time it take
submission to acceptance because if you

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:37.220
submission to acceptance because if you
 

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.659
submission to acceptance because if you
go past the time window that's required

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:40.669
go past the time window that's required
 

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:42.249
go past the time window that's required
for resubmission quite often they'll set

00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:42.259
for resubmission quite often they'll set
 

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.470
for resubmission quite often they'll set
the clock back to zero so we're sort of

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480
the clock back to zero so we're sort of
 

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.940
the clock back to zero so we're sort of
losing though so you saw some of these

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:45.950
losing though so you saw some of these
 

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.889
losing though so you saw some of these
outliers four hundred five hundred days

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:47.899
outliers four hundred five hundred days
 

00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:49.779
outliers four hundred five hundred days
and the early things were missing a lot

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:49.789
and the early things were missing a lot
 

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:51.490
and the early things were missing a lot
of those in our in our electronic data

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:51.500
of those in our in our electronic data
 

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.320
of those in our in our electronic data
records because we just no longer

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.330

consider them revisions anymore but even

00:21:55.509 --> 00:21:55.519
consider them revisions anymore but even

so our median has now gone up to six

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:58.580
so our median has now gone up to six
 

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.149
so our median has now gone up to six

months at a good cell biology journal
 

00:22:01.159 --> 00:22:04.149
months at a good cell biology journal
but it's not you know the thing every

it's pretty bad so this is all very

it's pretty bad so this is all very

basic research oriented I understand but

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559
basic research oriented I understand but
 

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.289
basic research oriented I understand but
I do think there's some data here behind

in the world become more competitive in
basic biomedical research and so they

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840
basic biomedical research and so they
 

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.500
basic biomedical research and so they
they start asking for more and more it

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:22.510

very much an apprenticeship where you

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200
very much an apprenticeship where you
 

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.900
very much an apprenticeship where you
learn how to do what you're doing by

to do what they're doing
and so you write your papers the way

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440
and so you write your papers the way
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.530

think the same is true of editors
 

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.540
think the same is true of editors
actually so I don't so there's that

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:00.550
actually so I don't so there's that
 

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.110
actually so I don't so there's that
problem

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120
problem
 

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.430
problem
with the apprenticeship and so I think

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440
with the apprenticeship and so I think
 

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.930
with the apprenticeship and so I think
part of it is that we just think that's

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:03.940
part of it is that we just think that's
 

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.780
part of it is that we just think that's
what we're expected to do and I think

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:06.790
what we're expected to do and I think
 

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.890
what we're expected to do and I think
there's a part of about the editorial

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:07.900
there's a part of about the editorial
 

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.660
there's a part of about the editorial
job and I'll talk about that in more

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:09.670
job and I'll talk about that in more
 

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.820
job and I'll talk about that in more
detail I think reviewer we asked

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:11.830
detail I think reviewer we asked
 

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.430
detail I think reviewer we asked
reviewers often as editors to tell us

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440
reviewers often as editors to tell us
 

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.440
reviewers often as editors to tell us
what we should publish and I don't think

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:16.450
what we should publish and I don't think
 

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.380
what we should publish and I don't think
reviewers can tell editors that to do

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:19.390
reviewers can tell editors that to do
 

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.850
reviewers can tell editors that to do
that they really need to somehow

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:20.860
that they really need to somehow
 

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.830
that they really need to somehow

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.420
understand everything about that journal
and what it's publishing to understand

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:24.430
and what it's publishing to understand

journal over the other would influence

journal over the other would influence
what editors were feeling about

what editors were feeling about

we've got tons of these kinds of papers

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:52.450
we've got tons of these kinds of papers
 

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.820
we've got tons of these kinds of papers
in this journal but we don't have enough

in this journal but we don't have enough
 

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.740
in this journal but we don't have enough
in that journal and then it's not really

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:55.750
in that journal and then it's not really
 

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.810
in that journal and then it's not really
fair to the paper to do that and you

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:57.820
fair to the paper to do that and you
 

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.430
fair to the paper to do that and you
have to know your biases to fight your

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440
have to know your biases to fight your
 

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.070
have to know your biases to fight your

I was a professional editor it was all I

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:03.730
I was a professional editor it was all I
 

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.880
I was a professional editor it was all I
was doing and I could feel that my

was doing and I could feel that my
 

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.799
was doing and I could feel that my
biases popping up so I think you know

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:07.809
biases popping up so I think you know
 

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:10.770
biases popping up so I think you know
kind of kind of asking that of reviewers

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:10.780
kind of kind of asking that of reviewers
 

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.799
kind of kind of asking that of reviewers
is really asking that asking too much

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:12.809
is really asking that asking too much
 

00:27:12.809 --> 00:27:15.600
is really asking that asking too much
okay so let's think about how we might

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:15.610
okay so let's think about how we might
 

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.980
okay so let's think about how we might
change things if we believe it's a

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:16.990
change things if we believe it's a
 

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.140
change things if we believe it's a
problem and I'm not I've had a lot of

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.150
problem and I'm not I've had a lot of
 

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.490

I'll just drumming up I think you do

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:24.670
I'll just drumming up I think you do

about a paper I want to kind of talk a
 

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:46.560
about a paper I want to kind of talk a
little bit about it you know have what's

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:46.570
little bit about it you know have what's
 

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.660

when I teach manuscript writing I tend
to think about papers research papers

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:55.690
to think about papers research papers
 

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.710

your own field and when I read papers

and fields in which I've been trained I
 

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.800

tend to focus on these things the

you know can they possibly get data that

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:13.570
you know can they possibly get data that
 

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.060
you know can they possibly get data that
are meaningful based on what they're

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.070
are meaningful based on what they're
 

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.870
are meaningful based on what they're
doing the data themselves and the

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880
doing the data themselves and the
 

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.790
doing the data themselves and the
legends to that so do I actually agree

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:20.800
legends to that so do I actually agree
 

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.710
legends to that so do I actually agree
to some degree you know what are the

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720
to some degree you know what are the
 

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.330
to some degree you know what are the
conclusions based on looking at the data

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:24.340
conclusions based on looking at the data
 

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.160
conclusions based on looking at the data
forget for a moment what they say their

forget for a moment what they say their
 

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.470
forget for a moment what they say their
conclusions are and I would generally

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480
conclusions are and I would generally
 

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.360
conclusions are and I would generally
not read any other part of a paper when

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:30.370
not read any other part of a paper when
 

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.000
not read any other part of a paper when
it's in the field as an editor or

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.010
it's in the field as an editor or
 

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.070
it's in the field as an editor or
somebody outlook thinking about a field

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080
somebody outlook thinking about a field
 

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.270
somebody outlook thinking about a field
that's not my own I actually read

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.280
that's not my own I actually read
 

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.670
that's not my own I actually read
completely differently I tend to ignore

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:38.680
completely differently I tend to ignore
 

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.050
completely differently I tend to ignore
the data because I can't really

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.060
the data because I can't really
 

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.600
the data because I can't really
understand it and as an editor I

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:42.610
understand it and as an editor I
 

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.060
understand it and as an editor I
shouldn't be assessing it and I rely on

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.070
shouldn't be assessing it and I rely on
 

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.800
shouldn't be assessing it and I rely on
the paper itself to teach me about

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:46.810
the paper itself to teach me about
 

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.380
the paper itself to teach me about
what's going on and so they're there

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:49.390
what's going on and so they're there
 

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.610
what's going on and so they're there
they're written with different languages

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:50.620
they're written with different languages
 

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.450
they're written with different languages
and they're written with different

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.460
and they're written with different
 

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.580
and they're written with different
expectations and different audiences and

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:53.590
expectations and different audiences and
 

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.680
expectations and different audiences and
so when I teach my script writing that's

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:55.690
so when I teach my script writing that's
 

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.150
so when I teach my script writing that's
why I said those two pieces they

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.160
why I said those two pieces they
 

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.190
why I said those two pieces they
definitely need to tie together and they

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200
definitely need to tie together and they
 

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.750
definitely need to tie together and they
need to translate well so they have to

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760
need to translate well so they have to
 

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.050
need to translate well so they have to
be actually telling the same story but

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.060
be actually telling the same story but

it's the reviewer job from the

it's the reviewer job from the
 

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.220
it's the reviewer job from the
perspective the editor is do you say it

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:23.230
perspective the editor is do you say it
 

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:24.690

doesn't satisfy you from the data and

doesn't satisfy you from the data and
 

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.320
doesn't satisfy you from the data and
can you

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.330
can you
 

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.580
can you
me whether it's been translated

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:26.590
me whether it's been translated
 

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.490
me whether it's been translated
appropriately and the editor can then

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:29.500
appropriately and the editor can then
 

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.110
appropriately and the editor can then
say if it's translated appropriately is

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120

as you could probably tell I think is

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:35.860
as you could probably tell I think is
 

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.030
as you could probably tell I think is
really hard to get okay so let's just

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.040
really hard to get okay so let's just
 

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.130
really hard to get okay so let's just
talk about that first one so we rely on

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:41.140
talk about that first one so we rely on
 

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.800
talk about that first one so we rely on
reviewers to set standards for the field

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:43.810
reviewers to set standards for the field
 

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.680
reviewers to set standards for the field
and to assess metha find methodological

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:46.690
and to assess metha find methodological
 

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.560
and to assess metha find methodological
major methodological flaws okay so this

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.570
major methodological flaws okay so this
 

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.850
major methodological flaws okay so this
is a paper that's published by richard

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:50.860
is a paper that's published by richard
 

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.100
is a paper that's published by richard
smith and co so richard smith was the

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.110
smith and co so richard smith was the
 

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.120
smith and co so richard smith was the
editor of the british medical journal

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.130
editor of the british medical journal
 

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.310

for a long time on the effects of

for a long time on the effects of

training on the quality of peer-review
 

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.930
training on the quality of peer-review
and so I would say BMJ is one of the few

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:00.940
and so I would say BMJ is one of the few
 

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.160
and so I would say BMJ is one of the few
it's not the only journal that's one of

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.170
it's not the only journal that's one of
 

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.360
it's not the only journal that's one of
the few journals that have started to

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:03.370
the few journals that have started to
 

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.300
the few journals that have started to
look at reviewer quality create

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:06.310
look at reviewer quality create
 

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.060
look at reviewer quality create
measurements that they are that they can

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.070
measurements that they are that they can
 

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.980
measurements that they are that they can
validate sort of assessment of reviewer

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:10.990
validate sort of assessment of reviewer
 

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.430
validate sort of assessment of reviewer
quality and then think about training

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440
quality and then think about training
 

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.200
quality and then think about training
quality so what they did here is they

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.210
quality so what they did here is they
 

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.770

took standard a very kind of standard

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:19.780
took standard a very kind of standard
 

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.720

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:21.730
clinical trial paper and clinical trials
 

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.970
clinical trial paper and clinical trials
are formulaic you have to have a

not currently actively engaged in
 

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.470
not currently actively engaged in
research right so they're not going to

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480
research right so they're not going to
 

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.360
research right so they're not going to
know okay here's you know I was a

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:19.370
know okay here's you know I was a
 

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.270
know okay here's you know I was a
biochemist by training you know I know

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280
biochemist by training you know I know
 

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.670

certain proteins are really sticky right

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680
certain proteins are really sticky right
 

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.380
certain proteins are really sticky right
so you try a certain column everything

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:26.390
so you try a certain column everything
 

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.340
so you try a certain column everything
you know it sticks to this come alive

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:27.350
you know it sticks to this come alive
 

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.050
you know it sticks to this come alive
you know it'll stick to any column I

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:29.060
you know it'll stick to any column I
 

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.120
you know it'll stick to any column I
know that I knew that for certain

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.130
know that I knew that for certain
 

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.760
know that I knew that for certain
proteins in my area the Marquis I didn't

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:33.770
proteins in my area the Marquis I didn't
 

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.090
proteins in my area the Marquis I didn't
know that right so so kind of looking

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:37.100
know that right so so kind of looking
 

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.010
know that right so so kind of looking
for those sorts of you know how is this

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.020
for those sorts of you know how is this
 

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.420
for those sorts of you know how is this
what is the problem you actually would

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:40.430
what is the problem you actually would
 

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.750
what is the problem you actually would
do better for that assessment with

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760
do better for that assessment with
 

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.550
do better for that assessment with
people are really actively engaged in

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560
people are really actively engaged in
 

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.190
people are really actively engaged in
research so you know you can imagine a

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200
research so you know you can imagine a
 

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.380
research so you know you can imagine a
review working in what you say okay I'm

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:50.390
review working in what you say okay I'm
 

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.020
review working in what you say okay I'm
going to do this you know I have more of

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.030
going to do this you know I have more of
 

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.430
going to do this you know I have more of
a perspective on the field as a whole

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440
a perspective on the field as a whole
 

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.130
a perspective on the field as a whole
but I don't actually do the methods

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:57.140
but I don't actually do the methods
 

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:57.910
but I don't actually do the methods
anymore

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920
anymore
 

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.200
anymore
and what I really wanted people were

00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.210
and what I really wanted people were
 

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.730
and what I really wanted people were
actively engaged the methods to evaluate

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:00.740
actively engaged the methods to evaluate
 

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.320
actively engaged the methods to evaluate
the method it's as part of that process

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.330
the method it's as part of that process
 

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.150
the method it's as part of that process
that's one way you might imagine and

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160
that's one way you might imagine and
 

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.170
that's one way you might imagine and
then they don't have been it then they

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:05.180
then they don't have been it then they
 

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.520
then they don't have been it then they
can think of it you know then the ego

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.530
can think of it you know then the ego
 

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.410
can think of it you know then the ego
isn't such an issue think say I've used

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:08.420
isn't such an issue think say I've used
 

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.320
isn't such an issue think say I've used
this as a training tool for my students

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.330
this as a training tool for my students
 

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.430
this as a training tool for my students
because they're learning how to give a

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440
because they're learning how to give a
 

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.950
because they're learning how to give a
review and they're making sure that the

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960
review and they're making sure that the
 

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.240
review and they're making sure that the
methods are you know they're the ones

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:16.250
methods are you know they're the ones
 

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:31.890
methods are you know they're the ones
who are up-to-date methods

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:31.900
 

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.950
right so I haven't um so a lot of the

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960
right so I haven't um so a lot of the
 

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.330
right so I haven't um so a lot of the
research on peer review that I've read

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:37.340
research on peer review that I've read
 

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.460
research on peer review that I've read
is clinical you have a lot of their

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:39.470
is clinical you have a lot of their
 

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:40.540
is clinical you have a lot of their
editors who have gotten involved

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:40.550
editors who have gotten involved
 

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:45.250
editors who have gotten involved
probably well it's his story you know

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:45.260
probably well it's his story you know
 

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.870
probably well it's his story you know
like everything else it has its history

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880
like everything else it has its history
 

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.450
like everything else it has its history
so there was a deputy editor name of

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:49.460
so there was a deputy editor name of
 

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.460
so there was a deputy editor name of
Gerald the drum and Renny

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.470
 

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.570
it's one of the medical journal editors

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:55.580
it's one of the medical journal editors
 

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.770
it's one of the medical journal editors
he actually started a peer review

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:56.780
he actually started a peer review
 

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.420
he actually started a peer review
Congress he's a medical journal editor

00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:58.430
Congress he's a medical journal editor
 

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.500
Congress he's a medical journal editor
he said we're gonna start looking at

00:37:59.500 --> 00:37:59.510
he said we're gonna start looking at
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.420
he said we're gonna start looking at
peer review carefully and because it was

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:01.430
peer review carefully and because it was
 

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.190
peer review carefully and because it was
started in medicine in a medical journal

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200
started in medicine in a medical journal
 

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.110
started in medicine in a medical journal
a lot of the work has happened in

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:05.120
a lot of the work has happened in
 

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.540
a lot of the work has happened in
medical journals I think another reason

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:07.550
medical journals I think another reason
 

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.810
medical journals I think another reason
why a lot of that happens in medicine is

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:10.820
why a lot of that happens in medicine is
 

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.960
why a lot of that happens in medicine is
that medical journal editors whether

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:13.970
that medical journal editors whether
 

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.790
that medical journal editors whether
they're doing it with ten even if

they're doing it with ten even if
 

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.750
they're doing it with ten even if
they're doing it with ninety five

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760
they're doing it with ninety five
 

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.210
they're doing it with ninety five
percent of their time as like the

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:19.220
percent of their time as like the
 

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.530
percent of their time as like the

those journal editors maintain their
licenses to practice so they recognized

so they actually they to recognize their
community commitment and I think that's

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:32.450
community commitment and I think that's
 

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.390

basic research editors at the highest

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.290
basic research editors at the highest
 

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.440
basic research editors at the highest
profile journals kind of leave their

profile journals kind of leave their
 

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.000
profile journals kind of leave their
careers and it's one of the reasons I'm

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.010
careers and it's one of the reasons I'm
 

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.740
careers and it's one of the reasons I'm
back in academia actually is because I

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:44.750
back in academia actually is because I
 

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.220
back in academia actually is because I
actually think that's dangerous to the

show me the ten Pape the one paper the
 

00:40:20.259 --> 00:40:23.339
show me the ten Pape the one paper the
ten papers and you know I won't give

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:23.349
ten papers and you know I won't give
 

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:25.470
ten papers and you know I won't give
numbers but I've certainly had the

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480
numbers but I've certainly had the
 

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.640
numbers but I've certainly had the
experience that people have made that

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:26.650
experience that people have made that
 

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.410
experience that people have made that
claim and then when I've gone to do the

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:28.420
claim and then when I've gone to do the
 

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.720
claim and then when I've gone to do the
literature search I haven't found this

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:30.730
literature search I haven't found this
 

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.789

prior knowledge that's been claimed by
the reviewers and so there are those

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480
the reviewers and so there are those
 

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.930

sorts of things happen a lot in basic
 

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.460
sorts of things happen a lot in basic
science and I think that I mean on the

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.470
science and I think that I mean on the
 

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.990
science and I think that I mean on the
clinical side so the journal I work on

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000
clinical side so the journal I work on
 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.490

that's nephrology does both basic
 

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.049
that's nephrology does both basic
research and clinical so I do see some

different perspectives I think people

00:40:56.819 --> 00:40:56.829
different perspectives I think people
 

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.349

have different inherent views about

had mixed reviews so somebody who got
 

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.670
had mixed reviews so somebody who got
really excited about the paper and

only get the positive effects and you
don't see the negative once so that's a

don't see the negative once so that's a

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:16.630
there's the challenge dog line which you
 

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.330
there's the challenge dog line which you
just mentioned so there also reviewer

just mentioned so there also reviewer
 

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.160
just mentioned so there also reviewer
inherent biases so work that comes to

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.170
inherent biases so work that comes to
 

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.600
inherent biases so work that comes to

to I look purple it's the first paper I
 

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.080

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.330
graduate student basically said the work
 

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.090
graduate student basically said the work
of my PhD advisor and I was this first

of my PhD advisor and I was this first
 

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.310

the paper he said show you identify the

the paper he said show you identify the
 

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.780
the paper he said show you identify the

you know it disagrees with me QED it's

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640
you know it disagrees with me QED it's
 

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.780
you know it disagrees with me QED it's
fly and and I went I found flaws you

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:48.790
fly and and I went I found flaws you
 

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.940

know but it was definitely you know that

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:50.950
know but it was definitely you know that
 

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.060

it's not going to matter as much and
 

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.660
it's not going to matter as much and
you're not gonna get the stature and

think this is really you know there was

think this is really you know there was
 

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.630
think this is really you know there was
a time and I started it so we can tell

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640
a time and I started it so we can tell
 

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.790
a time and I started it so we can tell
this right there was a field

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800
this right there was a field
 

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.140
this right there was a field
intermediate filaments was the field and

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.150
intermediate filaments was the field and
 

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.790
intermediate filaments was the field and
I tell you the reviewers in that field

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800
I tell you the reviewers in that field
 

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.580
I tell you the reviewers in that field
they had the view that if they'd had a

there was nothing in intermediate

could be more important than that paper
that had been rejected 10 years ago you

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480
that had been rejected 10 years ago you
 

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.750
that had been rejected 10 years ago you
know QED it's not publishable and that

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760
know QED it's not publishable and that
 

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.400
know QED it's not publishable and that
hurts the field it hurts the process of

hurts the field it hurts the process of
 

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.350
hurts the field it hurts the process of
reviewing and that one at least was

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:37.360
reviewing and that one at least was
 

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.700
reviewing and that one at least was
explicit it was kind of easy to see

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:38.710
explicit it was kind of easy to see
 

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.160
explicit it was kind of easy to see
those biases but if we go around saying

those biases but if we go around saying

you know I'm gonna send this off to

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:42.310
you know I'm gonna send this off to
 

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.220
you know I'm gonna send this off to
experts and I'm going to expect them to

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:44.230
experts and I'm going to expect them to
 

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.780
experts and I'm going to expect them to
give me unbiased reviews you're really

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:45.790
give me unbiased reviews you're really
 

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.460
give me unbiased reviews you're really
in trouble you sort of need to know

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:47.470
in trouble you sort of need to know

in trouble you sort of need to know
their biases I had a paper that's

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:49.990
their biases I had a paper that's
 

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.990
their biases I had a paper that's

the paper like okay that was useful you

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:04.100
the paper like okay that was useful you
 

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.590
the paper like okay that was useful you
know and you certainly need to know that

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:05.600
know and you certainly need to know that
 

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.690
know and you certainly need to know that
but I remember it so kind of

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:07.700
but I remember it so kind of
 

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.310
but I remember it so kind of

work because if they can be persuaded

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:13.990
work because if they can be persuaded
 

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.870
work because if they can be persuaded
that's pretty powerful but the fact that

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880
that's pretty powerful but the fact that
 

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.420
that's pretty powerful but the fact that
they can't be is almost meaningless and

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:19.430
they can't be is almost meaningless and
 

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:20.980
they can't be is almost meaningless and
I you know because of the biases that

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:20.990
I you know because of the biases that
 

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:35.900
I you know because of the biases that
exist and so I think yes

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:35.910
 

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.549
yes I do and I think one of the things

00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559
yes I do and I think one of the things
 

00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:40.499
yes I do and I think one of the things
that editors needs to need to do is sort

00:45:40.499 --> 00:45:40.509
that editors needs to need to do is sort
 

00:45:40.509 --> 00:45:41.789
that editors needs to need to do is sort
of recognize if they're going to use

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:41.799
of recognize if they're going to use
 

00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:43.890
of recognize if they're going to use
peer-review if their reviewers are

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:43.900
peer-review if their reviewers are
 

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.390
peer-review if their reviewers are
biased but they're specialized in

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400
biased but they're specialized in
 

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.910
biased but they're specialized in
particular areas and to read the reviews

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920
particular areas and to read the reviews
 

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.829
particular areas and to read the reviews
remembering why they sent that paper to

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839
remembering why they sent that paper to
 

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:52.559
remembering why they sent that paper to
that reviewer to begin with right and so

00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:52.569
that reviewer to begin with right and so
 

00:45:52.569 --> 00:45:54.480
that reviewer to begin with right and so
really it played the role of interpreter

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:54.490
really it played the role of interpreter
 

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.509
really it played the role of interpreter
and not just say well there are negative

00:45:57.509 --> 00:45:57.519
and not just say well there are negative
 

00:45:57.519 --> 00:45:59.999
and not just say well there are negative
comments here and I think one of the

00:45:59.999 --> 00:46:00.009
comments here and I think one of the
 

00:46:00.009 --> 00:46:01.980
comments here and I think one of the
things reviewers tend to do is feel they

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:01.990
things reviewers tend to do is feel they
 

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.319
things reviewers tend to do is feel they
have to comment on everything and they

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:04.329
have to comment on everything and they
 

00:46:04.329 --> 00:46:05.819
have to comment on everything and they
will act as experts for things they

00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:05.829
will act as experts for things they
 

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.259
will act as experts for things they
really don't know that much about and

00:46:07.259 --> 00:46:07.269
really don't know that much about and
 

00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:09.180
really don't know that much about and
their two editors need to say okay I'm

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.190
their two editors need to say okay I'm
 

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.910
their two editors need to say okay I'm
going to discount this negative comment

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920
going to discount this negative comment
 

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.339
going to discount this negative comment
because without understanding how this

00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:14.349
because without understanding how this
 

00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:16.049
because without understanding how this
person what that wasn't my accent this

00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:16.059
person what that wasn't my accent this
 

00:46:16.059 --> 00:46:17.640
person what that wasn't my accent this
paper so you really have to somehow have

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:17.650
paper so you really have to somehow have
 

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.210
paper so you really have to somehow have
a rubric to assess the reason I think

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:21.220
a rubric to assess the reason I think
 

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.430
a rubric to assess the reason I think
editors by and large don't do that

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440
editors by and large don't do that
 

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.730
editors by and large don't do that
anymore in many many fields we used to

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:26.740
anymore in many many fields we used to
 

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.410
anymore in many many fields we used to
it you know when I started as an editor

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:28.420
it you know when I started as an editor
 

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.819
it you know when I started as an editor
we started you know we felt we couldn't

00:46:29.819 --> 00:46:29.829
we started you know we felt we couldn't
 

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:31.019
we started you know we felt we couldn't
review a paper until we taken really

00:46:31.019 --> 00:46:31.029
review a paper until we taken really
 

00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:32.700
review a paper until we taken really
good notes on it I think what do I need

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:32.710
good notes on it I think what do I need
 

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.829
good notes on it I think what do I need
to learn from the editors in order to

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839
to learn from the editors in order to
 

00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:36.269

if we had a better paper but it's not
necessarily would shift it from

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:40.100
necessarily would shift it from
 

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.830
necessarily would shift it from

should be thinking about it would be you

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:47.150
should be thinking about it would be you
 

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.630
should be thinking about it would be you
know you know and that's and I think

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640
know you know and that's and I think
 

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.220
know you know and that's and I think
that's something a lot of editors don't

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:51.230
that's something a lot of editors don't
 

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.750
that's something a lot of editors don't
think about because it's scary to

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760
think about because it's scary to
 

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.770
think about because it's scary to
publish

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:53.780

ethically you need to listen to appeals

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:55.610
ethically you need to listen to appeals
 

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.190
ethically you need to listen to appeals
you know it is true that editors

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200
you know it is true that editors
 

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.050
you know it is true that editors
although they can be very clear about

00:49:59.050 --> 00:49:59.060
although they can be very clear about
 

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.120
although they can be very clear about
what their journals about are almost by

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.130
what their journals about are almost by
 

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.130
what their journals about are almost by

line of logic you'd be willing to you
 

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.400
line of logic you'd be willing to you
know kind of be clear about what your

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:12.410
know kind of be clear about what your
 

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:13.600
know kind of be clear about what your
the logic is that led you to that

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:13.610
the logic is that led you to that
 

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.460
the logic is that led you to that
decision that may rely too heavily on

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:15.470
decision that may rely too heavily on

something that the field nose isn't
 

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.770
something that the field nose isn't
reproducible or you know and therefore

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:20.780
reproducible or you know and therefore
 

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.420
reproducible or you know and therefore
shouldn't be held in quite the same way

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:22.430
shouldn't be held in quite the same way
 

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.660
shouldn't be held in quite the same way
so I think that's FX and so yeah we were

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:25.670
so I think that's FX and so yeah we were
 

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.640
so I think that's FX and so yeah we were
talking about Sarah Palin last night you

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.990
talking about Sarah Palin last night you
know

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000
know
 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.810

bias comes in all forms and and

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:31.820
bias comes in all forms and and
 

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.430
bias comes in all forms and and
everybody involved in publishing is

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440
everybody involved in publishing is
 

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.490
everybody involved in publishing is
biased all humans are biased and I think

most suggestions that I think about when

most suggestions that I think about when

most suggestions that I think about when
I think about improving peer-review in

the current system are really aimed at

the current system are really aimed at
trying to reduce bias so if you think

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:44.120
trying to reduce bias so if you think
 

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.270
trying to reduce bias so if you think
about the bias of a reputation of an

what double blind peer would be is about
 

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.630
what double blind peer would be is about
right it's kind of getting away from the

right it's kind of getting away from the
 

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.150
right it's kind of getting away from the
zip code effect as we like to say if you

zip code effect as we like to say if you

think about competitions between authors

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:57.290
think about competitions between authors
 

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.770
think about competitions between authors
and reviewers that's what open peer

00:50:59.770 --> 00:50:59.780
and reviewers that's what open peer
 

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.600

you know can't hide behind anonymity to

you know can't hide behind anonymity to
keep competitors work from print if you

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:07.130
keep competitors work from print if you
 

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.090
keep competitors work from print if you
have to sign that work and then there's

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:10.100
have to sign that work and then there's
 

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.830
have to sign that work and then there's
this other piece which I think you know

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:11.840
this other piece which I think you know
 

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.740
this other piece which I think you know
from my own experience is Journal

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:14.750
from my own experience is Journal
 

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.930
from my own experience is Journal
specific is reviewer history at a

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:16.940
specific is reviewer history at a
 

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.430
specific is reviewer history at a
particular journal which I already

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440
particular journal which I already
 

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.390
particular journal which I already
talked about and so it's hard I think

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400
talked about and so it's hard I think
 

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.180
talked about and so it's hard I think
not to assess a paper that you read to a

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:25.190
not to assess a paper that you read to a
 

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.890
not to assess a paper that you read to a

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:26.900
paper you've tried to publish in that
 

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.110
paper you've tried to publish in that
same journal and so one thing I've been

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:29.120
same journal and so one thing I've been
 

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.730
same journal and so one thing I've been
toying with is whether you can actually

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:30.740
toying with is whether you can actually
 

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.590
toying with is whether you can actually
create a system that does what I call

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:32.600
create a system that does what I call
 

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.110
create a system that does what I call
journal blind peer review a group of

journal blind peer review a group of
 

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.310
journal blind peer review a group of
journals that are in the same field all

journals that are in the same field all
quality journals slightly different

which journal it's at and maybe that

which journal it's at and maybe that
will help you stay away from this your

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:50.990
will help you stay away from this your
 

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:52.750
will help you stay away from this your
own experience at the journal and the

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760
own experience at the journal and the
 

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.760
own experience at the journal and the
reason I think about this and why I

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:54.770
reason I think about this and why I
 

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.920
reason I think about this and why I
expect that it would help is my

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:56.930
expect that it would help is my
 

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.410
expect that it would help is my
experience launching new journals and so

00:51:59.410 --> 00:51:59.420
experience launching new journals and so
 

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.650
experience launching new journals and so
of course this is just anecdotally days

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:02.660
of course this is just anecdotally days
 

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.539
of course this is just anecdotally days
of every journal I've ever launched

of every journal I've ever launched

of every journal I've ever launched
um when I've sent papers for review

00:52:06.519 --> 00:52:06.529
um when I've sent papers for review
 

00:52:06.529 --> 00:52:08.559
um when I've sent papers for review
reviewers would come back and say I

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:08.569
reviewers would come back and say I
 

00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:10.569
reviewers would come back and say I
don't know what to advise you because I

00:52:10.569 --> 00:52:10.579
don't know what to advise you because I
 

00:52:10.579 --> 00:52:11.949
don't know what to advise you because I
don't know what you're publishing I

00:52:11.949 --> 00:52:11.959
don't know what you're publishing I
 

00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:13.419
don't know what you're publishing I
guess I'll just have to stick to the

00:52:13.419 --> 00:52:13.429
guess I'll just have to stick to the
 

00:52:13.429 --> 00:52:14.799
guess I'll just have to stick to the
strengths and weaknesses of this paper

00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:14.809
strengths and weaknesses of this paper
 

00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:17.620
strengths and weaknesses of this paper
and let you decide thank you that's all

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:17.630
and let you decide thank you that's all
 

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.579
and let you decide thank you that's all
I want you know and at the same time

00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:20.589
I want you know and at the same time
 

00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.479
I want you know and at the same time
others would come to me whether the

00:52:22.479 --> 00:52:22.489
others would come to me whether the
 

00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:24.069
others would come to me whether the
papers accepted or rejected say those

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079
papers accepted or rejected say those
 

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:25.479
papers accepted or rejected say those
were the most constructive of these I've

00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:25.489
were the most constructive of these I've
 

00:52:25.489 --> 00:52:28.329
were the most constructive of these I've
ever seen and so I have this suspicion

00:52:28.329 --> 00:52:28.339
ever seen and so I have this suspicion
 

00:52:28.339 --> 00:52:30.669
ever seen and so I have this suspicion
but as a scientist by training I want

00:52:30.669 --> 00:52:30.679
but as a scientist by training I want
 

00:52:30.679 --> 00:52:33.069
but as a scientist by training I want
some data that if we could keep this out

00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079
some data that if we could keep this out
 

00:52:33.079 --> 00:52:35.919
some data that if we could keep this out
of the view of the reviewer and they do

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:35.929
of the view of the reviewer and they do
 

00:52:35.929 --> 00:52:39.669
of the view of the reviewer and they do
a better job and then there's the

00:52:39.669 --> 00:52:39.679
a better job and then there's the
 

00:52:39.679 --> 00:52:40.839
a better job and then there's the
question of whether we need peer review

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:40.849
question of whether we need peer review
 

00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:42.370
question of whether we need peer review
at all and I do want to finish up

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:42.380
at all and I do want to finish up
 

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.929
at all and I do want to finish up
because I know we have we want to have

00:52:43.929 --> 00:52:43.939
because I know we have we want to have
 

00:52:43.939 --> 00:52:46.719
because I know we have we want to have
time for responses and discussion is I

00:52:46.719 --> 00:52:46.729
time for responses and discussion is I

do think peer review is valuable for

00:52:48.579 --> 00:52:48.589
do think peer review is valuable for
 

00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:50.439
do think peer review is valuable for
constructive feedback when it becomes

00:52:50.439 --> 00:52:50.449
constructive feedback when it becomes

constructive feedback when it becomes

what to publish it creates it pushes

00:52:56.019 --> 00:52:56.029
what to publish it creates it pushes
 

00:52:56.029 --> 00:52:59.019
what to publish it creates it pushes
bias I think it pushes competition and

00:52:59.019 --> 00:52:59.029
bias I think it pushes competition and
 

00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:00.999
bias I think it pushes competition and
so there are people are playing with

00:53:00.999 --> 00:53:01.009
so there are people are playing with
 

00:53:01.009 --> 00:53:03.669
so there are people are playing with
peer review in this way sort of saying

00:53:03.669 --> 00:53:03.679
peer review in this way sort of saying
 

00:53:03.679 --> 00:53:06.130
peer review in this way sort of saying
authors get to select their reviewers or

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:06.140
authors get to select their reviewers or
 

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.749
authors get to select their reviewers or
some journals that do that

00:53:07.749 --> 00:53:07.759
some journals that do that
 

00:53:07.759 --> 00:53:09.339
some journals that do that
they're say I'll be happy if these

00:53:09.339 --> 00:53:09.349
they're say I'll be happy if these
 

00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:11.169
they're say I'll be happy if these
people review my paper they could have

00:53:11.169 --> 00:53:11.179
people review my paper they could have
 

00:53:11.179 --> 00:53:12.579
people review my paper they could have
done that before submission but kind of

00:53:12.579 --> 00:53:12.589
done that before submission but kind of
 

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.799
done that before submission but kind of
can do it in the context of submission I

00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:14.809
can do it in the context of submission I
 

00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:16.599
can do it in the context of submission I
completely believe we need our peers to

00:53:16.599 --> 00:53:16.609
completely believe we need our peers to
 

00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:18.099
completely believe we need our peers to
give us feedback I'm just not so sure

00:53:18.099 --> 00:53:18.109
give us feedback I'm just not so sure
 

00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:20.890
give us feedback I'm just not so sure
that it that doing it in the context of

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:20.900
that it that doing it in the context of
 

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.859
that it that doing it in the context of
the journal solves more problems than it

00:53:23.859 --> 00:53:23.869
the journal solves more problems than it
 

00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:26.650
the journal solves more problems than it

we could have it in the sciences and in
 

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:30.010
we could have it in the sciences and in

promotion and grant system we need to

00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599
promotion and grant system we need to
 

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:49.300
promotion and grant system we need to
accept that we don't know how important

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:49.310

in terms of their tenure and I think

in terms of their tenure and I think
 

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.420
in terms of their tenure and I think
that's you know that's a big question

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:58.430
that's you know that's a big question
 

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.460
that's you know that's a big question
but I do think this quote this

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:00.470
but I do think this quote this
 

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.099
but I do think this quote this
discussion is really worth having

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:02.109
discussion is really worth having
 

00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:05.050
discussion is really worth having
because if we you know if we are there's

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:05.060
because if we you know if we are there's
 

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.370
because if we you know if we are there's
so much grumbling what's going on about

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.380
so much grumbling what's going on about
 

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.690
so much grumbling what's going on about
peer review and yet we just kind of

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:07.700
peer review and yet we just kind of
 

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.819
peer review and yet we just kind of
accept it as the matter of course and I

00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:09.829
accept it as the matter of course and I
 

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:11.020
accept it as the matter of course and I
think the experiments being done are

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:11.030
think the experiments being done are
 

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.400
think the experiments being done are
interesting but they are kind of minor

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:12.410
interesting but they are kind of minor
 

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.349
interesting but they are kind of minor
many of them are really minor expert

00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359
many of them are really minor expert
 

00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:16.540
many of them are really minor expert
experiments and if it's really not

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:16.550
experiments and if it's really not
 

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.420
experiments and if it's really not
giving us what we need and it's up to us

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:19.430
giving us what we need and it's up to us
 

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:22.630
giving us what we need and it's up to us
to figure out how to do that and so I'm

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640
to figure out how to do that and so I'm
 

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.280
to figure out how to do that and so I'm
just kind of reminding you of what I

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:24.290
just kind of reminding you of what I
 

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.319
just kind of reminding you of what I
think of this the perfect paper I think

00:55:26.319 --> 00:55:26.329
think of this the perfect paper I think
 

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:28.150
think of this the perfect paper I think
you can get that paper without peer

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160
you can get that paper without peer
 

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.880
you can get that paper without peer
review as part of journal submission and

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:30.890
review as part of journal submission and
 

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:33.670
review as part of journal submission and
I think this conversation will somehow

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680
I think this conversation will somehow
 

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.099
I think this conversation will somehow
make it possible for us to have peer

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:36.109
make it possible for us to have peer
 

00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:39.099
make it possible for us to have peer
review do what it needs to do be part of

00:55:39.099 --> 00:55:39.109
review do what it needs to do be part of
 

00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:40.809
review do what it needs to do be part of
that conversation of research and not

00:55:40.809 --> 00:55:40.819
that conversation of research and not
 

00:55:40.819 --> 00:55:44.800
that conversation of research and not
simply a judge over it so thank you for

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:44.810
simply a judge over it so thank you for
 

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:55.240
simply a judge over it so thank you for
your attention here and I'm going to

social science looks a little bit

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:20.670
social science looks a little bit
 

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.790
social science looks a little bit
different than biological or medical

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800

that timeline of how I was going to get
 

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:46.220
that timeline of how I was going to get
me more papers into the review system

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:46.230
me more papers into the review system
 

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.340

so certainly the system worked for me

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020
so certainly the system worked for me
 

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.410
so certainly the system worked for me
but I think that the issue of timing and

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420
but I think that the issue of timing and
 

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.300
but I think that the issue of timing and
the length of time continues to be

that if we encouraged our doctoral

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.510
then you take a breather heavy sigh and
I think particularly coming from

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520
I think particularly coming from
 

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.510
I think particularly coming from
place of our academic discipline which

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520
place of our academic discipline which
 

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.280
place of our academic discipline which
tries to look at the ways that we really

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:21.290
tries to look at the ways that we really
 

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:24.640
tries to look at the ways that we really
privilege some groups and some types of

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:24.650
privilege some groups and some types of
 

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:27.280
privilege some groups and some types of
access to knowledge versus those that

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:27.290
access to knowledge versus those that
 

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.580
access to knowledge versus those that
are sort of marginalized that really it

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:30.590
are sort of marginalized that really it
 

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:32.410
are sort of marginalized that really it
stopped to make me think what are the

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:32.420
stopped to make me think what are the
 

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.300
stopped to make me think what are the
better ways that we could improve peer

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:34.310
better ways that we could improve peer
 

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.370
better ways that we could improve peer
review to make it more democratized like

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:36.380
review to make it more democratized like
 

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.230
review to make it more democratized like
open access and of course there are

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240
open access and of course there are
 

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.510
open access and of course there are
challenges with that as well

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520
challenges with that as well
 

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.600
challenges with that as well
I think around the issue of flaws again

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:43.610
I think around the issue of flaws again
 

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.880
I think around the issue of flaws again

that can be a problem and how it gets

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:51.350

peer review process creates that border

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:56.450
peer review process creates that border
 

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.440
peer review process creates that border
for us between the experts and then the

01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.450
for us between the experts and then the
 

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.890

general public and in in Social Work and
 

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.340
general public and in in Social Work and
social sciences I think that perhaps

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:06.350
social sciences I think that perhaps
 

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:08.350

that in the field so this is not just a

that in the field so this is not just a
 

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.840
that in the field so this is not just a
problem a peer review this is actually

why NIH is entirely restructuring their

from 2010 is that we're really not doing

01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:50.360
from 2010 is that we're really not doing
 

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.600
from 2010 is that we're really not doing

going and we are building knowledge and

going and we are building knowledge and
again this is different because I think

01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880
again this is different because I think
 

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.540
again this is different because I think
in medicine it's harder to sort of see

efficacy trials and you know we can say

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:05.780
efficacy trials and you know we can say

it's really time to move that to evident

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:15.020
it's really time to move that to evident
 

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.810
it's really time to move that to evident

research and our journals have been

research and our journals have been
 

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:20.770
research and our journals have been
developed in the last two or three

developed in the last two or three
 

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.740
developed in the last two or three
decades around best evidence but what

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:23.750
decades around best evidence but what
 

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.450
decades around best evidence but what
happens is then all the reviewers that

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:25.460
happens is then all the reviewers that
 

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.050
happens is then all the reviewers that
are part of the system

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:27.060
are part of the system
 

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.840
are part of the system
of support for best knowledge are kind

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:29.850
of support for best knowledge are kind
 

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.790

trial is the gold standard and these are
 

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.930
trial is the gold standard and these are
the methods that we should be looking

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940
the methods that we should be looking
 

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.180
the methods that we should be looking
for in our of you so there's not as much

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:38.190
for in our of you so there's not as much
 

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.500
for in our of you so there's not as much
room for innovation a changing way of

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:42.510
room for innovation a changing way of
 

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.600
room for innovation a changing way of
looking at how we might solve some of

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:44.610
looking at how we might solve some of
 

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.230
looking at how we might solve some of
the problems so that so that actually

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240
the problems so that so that actually
 

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.510
the problems so that so that actually
speaks to I think the system of peer

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520
speaks to I think the system of peer
 

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.850
speaks to I think the system of peer
review in the sense that it sort of it

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:52.860
review in the sense that it sort of it
 

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.130
review in the sense that it sort of it
separates out the expert from maybe the

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140
separates out the expert from maybe the
 

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.040
separates out the expert from maybe the
lay or the practitioners who are

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.050
lay or the practitioners who are
 

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.320
lay or the practitioners who are
clinical practitioners in the field and

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:00.330
clinical practitioners in the field and
 

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:04.790
clinical practitioners in the field and
as well it speaks to how we can

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:04.800
as well it speaks to how we can
 

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.520
as well it speaks to how we can
introduce ways to shift the thinking

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:07.530
introduce ways to shift the thinking
 

01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:10.730
introduce ways to shift the thinking
from time to time maybe that has to do

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:10.740
from time to time maybe that has to do
 

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.500
from time to time maybe that has to do
with a competition maybe that has to do

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:12.510
with a competition maybe that has to do
 

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:16.430
with a competition maybe that has to do
with NIH I think since a lot of what we

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440
with NIH I think since a lot of what we
 

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.920
with NIH I think since a lot of what we
write comes from funding that has to you

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:18.930
write comes from funding that has to you
 

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.480
write comes from funding that has to you
has to start with the funding so maybe

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:20.490
has to start with the funding so maybe
 

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.760
has to start with the funding so maybe
as that process shifts then indeed the

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:22.770
as that process shifts then indeed the
 

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.200
as that process shifts then indeed the
peer review system work will shift

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:24.210
peer review system work will shift
 

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:30.170
peer review system work will shift
somewhat so and I guess the other thing

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180
somewhat so and I guess the other thing
 

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.670
somewhat so and I guess the other thing
that I'm very concerned about in terms

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680
that I'm very concerned about in terms
 

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.770
that I'm very concerned about in terms
of the peer review system again as how

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780
of the peer review system again as how
 

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.960
of the peer review system again as how
we shift it and I don't think it's

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:35.970
we shift it and I don't think it's
 

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.430
we shift it and I don't think it's
specific to preview but how we shift it

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440
specific to preview but how we shift it
 

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.950
specific to preview but how we shift it
to reach more of the practitioners how

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960
to reach more of the practitioners how
 

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.890
to reach more of the practitioners how
we actually take what it is that we're

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900
we actually take what it is that we're
 

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.080
we actually take what it is that we're
publishing in our peer reviewed journals

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.090
publishing in our peer reviewed journals
 

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:48.050
publishing in our peer reviewed journals
and are we including in the peers who

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:48.060
and are we including in the peers who
 

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.640
and are we including in the peers who
are part of the review boards

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:51.650
are part of the review boards
 

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:54.560
are part of the review boards
practitioners who are in the field who

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:54.570
practitioners who are in the field who
 

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.570
practitioners who are in the field who
actually could speak more to how we

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:56.580
actually could speak more to how we
 

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.840
actually could speak more to how we
translate from science to from bench to

translate from science to from bench to
 

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.810
translate from science to from bench to
trench right from from the science to

trench right from from the science to
 

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.080
trench right from from the science to
the practical application and I hope

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.090
the practical application and I hope
 

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.590
the practical application and I hope
that as we take a look at changing

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:09.600

peer-review moving forward that we might

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520
peer-review moving forward that we might
 

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.750
peer-review moving forward that we might
be able to consider ways to strengthen

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760
be able to consider ways to strengthen
 

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.120
be able to consider ways to strengthen
the application of the science in in

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:17.130
the application of the science in in
 

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.000
the application of the science in in
professional fields so as I was

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.010
professional fields so as I was
 

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.770
professional fields so as I was
preparing my my talk and I was stuck on

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780
preparing my my talk and I was stuck on
 

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.330
preparing my my talk and I was stuck on
the issue of timing and how long it took

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:23.340
the issue of timing and how long it took
 

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.560
the issue of timing and how long it took
and I was thinking about this one

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:24.570
and I was thinking about this one
 

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.030
and I was thinking about this one
particular case where it took me two

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040
particular case where it took me two
 

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.950
particular case where it took me two
years to get something published up on

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960

I heard the windows be

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:31.220
I heard the windows be
 

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.520
I heard the windows be
and I got a new email and the subject

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:33.530
and I got a new email and the subject
 

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.710
and I got a new email and the subject
line it was from web-fed central and the

your research within 48 hours and I

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:40.670
your research within 48 hours and I
 

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.170
your research within 48 hours and I
thought wow you know that's like under

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:44.180
thought wow you know that's like under
 

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.550
thought wow you know that's like under
the category of you can't make that

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:45.560
the category of you can't make that
 

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.770
the category of you can't make that
stuff up yes I was sitting there and I

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:47.780
stuff up yes I was sitting there and I
 

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.089
stuff up yes I was sitting there and I
thought I have to find out what this is

01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:49.099
thought I have to find out what this is
 

01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:51.220
thought I have to find out what this is
and so sure enough it was one of these I

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:51.230
and so sure enough it was one of these I
 

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.890
and so sure enough it was one of these I
looked more closely and it was they they

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:53.900
looked more closely and it was they they
 

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.620
looked more closely and it was they they
they claim that if it's a reasonably

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:56.630
they claim that if it's a reasonably
 

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:58.599
they claim that if it's a reasonably
well done study they can publish it in

01:04:58.599 --> 01:04:58.609
well done study they can publish it in
 

01:04:58.609 --> 01:05:01.329
well done study they can publish it in
48 hours but they also do post

01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:01.339
48 hours but they also do post
 

01:05:01.339 --> 01:05:04.150
48 hours but they also do post
publication review I think I love this

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160
publication review I think I love this
 

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.040
publication review I think I love this
idea I think that that that's actually a

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.050
idea I think that that that's actually a
 

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:09.849
idea I think that that that's actually a
way to both keep a peer-review process

01:05:09.849 --> 01:05:09.859
way to both keep a peer-review process
 

01:05:09.859 --> 01:05:11.680
way to both keep a peer-review process
and then and we'll talk about this in

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:11.690
and then and we'll talk about this in
 

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.240
and then and we'll talk about this in
discussion I'm sure but that might be a

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:13.250
discussion I'm sure but that might be a
 

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.160
discussion I'm sure but that might be a
really nice compromise between keeping

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:15.170
really nice compromise between keeping
 

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:18.730
really nice compromise between keeping

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:18.740

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.640
intact what we know can vet best quality
science but also open up an opportunity

for the community to give reflections on

01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319
for the community to give reflections on
 

01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:25.599
for the community to give reflections on
what can work and what doesn't work

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:25.609
what can work and what doesn't work
 

01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:28.960

about it so I love that and then there

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:28.970
about it so I love that and then there
 

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:30.970
about it so I love that and then there
was the August 23rd article in that

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:30.980
was the August 23rd article in that
 

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.880
was the August 23rd article in that
times that talked about how they did an

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:33.890

trial where they took a corps of experts

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:37.670
trial where they took a corps of experts
 

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:40.480
trial where they took a corps of experts
and they posted online a series of

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:40.490
and they posted online a series of
 

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:41.829
and they posted online a series of
essays and so this would be actually

01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839
essays and so this would be actually
 

01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:43.720
essays and so this would be actually
humanities I'd be really interested to

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:43.730

gotta be a line between how much

01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:04.940

there's all kinds of quality assurance

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760
there's all kinds of quality assurance
 

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.059
there's all kinds of quality assurance
to be built in there that that could be

01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:13.069
to be built in there that that could be
 

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.150
to be built in there that that could be
quite challenging but I love that idea

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160
quite challenging but I love that idea
 

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.099
quite challenging but I love that idea
and so then the last thing I want to

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:18.109
and so then the last thing I want to
 

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:20.740
and so then the last thing I want to
share is that on this issue of sort of

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:20.750
share is that on this issue of sort of
 

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:24.400
share is that on this issue of sort of

difficult rejection and thankfully I've
only had a few but the most difficult

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920
only had a few but the most difficult
 

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.480
only had a few but the most difficult
rejection was when I submitted a piece

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:40.490
rejection was when I submitted a piece
 

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.859

so what we decided to do we thought

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:33.510
so what we decided to do we thought
 

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.030
so what we decided to do we thought
would be innovative would be to do a

couples how did we break down those
barriers so it was a very process

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:45.210
barriers so it was a very process
 

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.510
barriers so it was a very process
oriented paper and we combined that with

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520
oriented paper and we combined that with
 

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.570
oriented paper and we combined that with
quantitative paper that looked at who

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:50.580
quantitative paper that looked at who
 

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.520
quantitative paper that looked at who
was eligible and what their

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:52.530
was eligible and what their
 

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:54.050
was eligible and what their
characteristics were and then who

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:54.060
characteristics were and then who
 

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.970
characteristics were and then who
enrolled and what their characteristics

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980
enrolled and what their characteristics
 

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.500
enrolled and what their characteristics
were and there was some very interesting

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:57.510
were and there was some very interesting
 

01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:00.260
were and there was some very interesting
statistics that sort of defined who we

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:00.270
statistics that sort of defined who we
 

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.450
statistics that sort of defined who we
missed and then we talked about it so we

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460
missed and then we talked about it so we
 

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.790
missed and then we talked about it so we
put it together as two papers and the

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:04.800
put it together as two papers and the
 

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.310
put it together as two papers and the
editor of a very well-known at the time

01:08:07.310 --> 01:08:07.320
editor of a very well-known at the time
 

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.080
editor of a very well-known at the time
there weren't as many AIDS education and

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.090
there weren't as many AIDS education and
 

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:11.030
there weren't as many AIDS education and
prevention journals but the editor

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:11.040
prevention journals but the editor
 

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.280
prevention journals but the editor
looked at both pieces and read our cover

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:13.290
looked at both pieces and read our cover
 

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.630
looked at both pieces and read our cover
letter that said we really think that

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640
letter that said we really think that
 

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.190
letter that said we really think that
this is important because we really

01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:16.200
this is important because we really
 

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.420
this is important because we really
believe that a lot of scientists are

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:17.430
believe that a lot of scientists are
 

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.950
believe that a lot of scientists are
interested in hearing more about you

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960
interested in hearing more about you
 

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.150
interested in hearing more about you
know how you can first of all

01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160
know how you can first of all
 

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.070
know how you can first of all
successfully recruit and retain then

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080
successfully recruit and retain then
 

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.500
successfully recruit and retain then
look at this data and so he looked at it

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:24.510
look at this data and so he looked at it
 

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:26.660
look at this data and so he looked at it
and he said well there's really not

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:26.670
and he said well there's really not
 

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.370
and he said well there's really not
enough meat in this recruitment piece

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380
enough meat in this recruitment piece
 

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.440
enough meat in this recruitment piece
but I really like that you know data

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:30.450
but I really like that you know data
 

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.750
but I really like that you know data
based piece so I'm gonna keep that one

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:32.760
based piece so I'm gonna keep that one
 

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.789
based piece so I'm gonna keep that one
and log it in you really should try

01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799
and log it in you really should try
 

01:08:34.799 --> 01:08:36.320
and log it in you really should try
submitting the other one to a women's

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:36.330
submitting the other one to a women's
 

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:38.360
submitting the other one to a women's
health journal or to a minority health

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:38.370
health journal or to a minority health
 

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.090
health journal or to a minority health
journal and and I kept the letter

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100
journal and and I kept the letter
 

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.370
journal and and I kept the letter
because I was so incensed I mean I

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380
because I was so incensed I mean I
 

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.340
because I was so incensed I mean I
haven't met him yet at it at a

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:45.350
haven't met him yet at it at a
 

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.660
haven't met him yet at it at a
conference but the day that I do I'm

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:47.670
conference but the day that I do I'm
 

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.390
conference but the day that I do I'm
going to tell him you know there was so

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400
going to tell him you know there was so
 

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.460
going to tell him you know there was so
much nuanced in that communication that

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:52.470
much nuanced in that communication that
 

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.099
much nuanced in that communication that
made me crazy so and I know that's not

01:08:55.099 --> 01:08:55.109
made me crazy so and I know that's not
 

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:56.160
made me crazy so and I know that's not
exactly a peer review

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.170
exactly a peer review
 

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:58.289
exactly a peer review
related question but but it kind of is

01:08:58.289 --> 01:08:58.299
related question but but it kind of is
 

01:08:58.299 --> 01:09:01.890
related question but but it kind of is
in the sense that he had a very strong

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:01.900
in the sense that he had a very strong
 

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.289
in the sense that he had a very strong
bias one about quantitative versus

01:09:04.289 --> 01:09:04.299
bias one about quantitative versus
 

01:09:04.299 --> 01:09:07.950
bias one about quantitative versus
qualitative and in terms of what he

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960
qualitative and in terms of what he
 

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.950
qualitative and in terms of what he
wanted to see in his journal but we

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960
wanted to see in his journal but we
 

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.450
wanted to see in his journal but we
really believed you know being on the

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:12.460
really believed you know being on the
 

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.919
really believed you know being on the
ground that this was an important piece

01:09:13.919 --> 01:09:13.929
ground that this was an important piece
 

01:09:13.929 --> 01:09:15.030
ground that this was an important piece
that would come that would be

01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040
that would come that would be
 

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.950
that would come that would be
complimentary and so we wound up

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960
complimentary and so we wound up
 

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.689
complimentary and so we wound up
publishing them separately and they both

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:18.699
publishing them separately and they both
 

01:09:18.699 --> 01:09:21.329
publishing them separately and they both
got published but it really made me

01:09:21.329 --> 01:09:21.339
got published but it really made me
 

01:09:21.339 --> 01:09:22.769
got published but it really made me
start to think more about these issues

01:09:22.769 --> 01:09:22.779
start to think more about these issues
 

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:23.999
start to think more about these issues
that we're going to struggle with they

01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:24.009
that we're going to struggle with they
 

01:09:24.009 --> 01:09:26.669
that we're going to struggle with they
think around bias and and who controls

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679
think around bias and and who controls
 

01:09:26.679 --> 01:09:28.340
think around bias and and who controls
some of these decisions about what

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:28.350
some of these decisions about what
 

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:41.669
some of these decisions about what
publish so I think I just agreed with

01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679
publish so I think I just agreed with
 

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.860
publish so I think I just agreed with
just about everything Vivian said so

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:43.870
just about everything Vivian said so
 

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:46.200
just about everything Vivian said so
I'll try to add a little bit to the

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:46.210
I'll try to add a little bit to the
 

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:48.539
I'll try to add a little bit to the
discussion around around general

01:09:48.539 --> 01:09:48.549
discussion around around general
 

01:09:48.549 --> 01:09:50.880
discussion around around general
agreement a couple things that I think

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:50.890
agreement a couple things that I think
 

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:53.370
agreement a couple things that I think
are worth just stating at the outset and

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:53.380
are worth just stating at the outset and
 

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.030
are worth just stating at the outset and
it and it's a little counterintuitive

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040
it and it's a little counterintuitive
 

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.490
it and it's a little counterintuitive
publishing and editing and submitting

01:09:59.490 --> 01:09:59.500
publishing and editing and submitting
 

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.380
publishing and editing and submitting
and and so forth

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:01.390
and and so forth
 

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.570
and and so forth
at least from afar seems like a

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:03.580
at least from afar seems like a
 

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:08.280
at least from afar seems like a
non-emotional activity and the one thing

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:08.290
non-emotional activity and the one thing
 

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.919
non-emotional activity and the one thing
that that I've learned with lots of

01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:10.929
that that I've learned with lots of
 

01:10:10.929 --> 01:10:12.660
that that I've learned with lots of
years of editing and lots of years of

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:12.670
years of editing and lots of years of
 

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.270
years of editing and lots of years of
submitting and many rejections and some

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280
submitting and many rejections and some
 

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.610
submitting and many rejections and some
acceptances is it's deeply emotional for

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:17.620
acceptances is it's deeply emotional for
 

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.290
acceptances is it's deeply emotional for
just about everybody involved and that

01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:19.300
just about everybody involved and that
 

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.479
just about everybody involved and that
that's true of the editor it's true the

01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:21.489
that's true of the editor it's true the
 

01:10:21.489 --> 01:10:23.250
that's true of the editor it's true the
person submitting it's true of the

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:23.260
person submitting it's true of the
 

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:28.050
person submitting it's true of the
reviewer who invests their own personal

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:28.060
reviewer who invests their own personal
 

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.510
reviewer who invests their own personal
time and energy in the process and

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520
time and energy in the process and
 

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.090
time and energy in the process and
expects to be respected which is

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:33.100
expects to be respected which is
 

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:34.590
expects to be respected which is
sometimes difficult for the for the

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600
sometimes difficult for the for the
 

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.979
sometimes difficult for the for the
editor to do if things work out in a

01:10:37.979 --> 01:10:37.989
editor to do if things work out in a
 

01:10:37.989 --> 01:10:40.680
editor to do if things work out in a
particular way the other thing I'd sort

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:40.690
particular way the other thing I'd sort
 

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:42.390
particular way the other thing I'd sort
of just want to say a little bit about

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400
of just want to say a little bit about
 

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.660
of just want to say a little bit about
is one of the interesting themes that

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:45.670
is one of the interesting themes that
 

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.459
is one of the interesting themes that
ran through I think the presentation was

01:10:47.459 --> 01:10:47.469
ran through I think the presentation was
 

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:49.830
ran through I think the presentation was
this whole issue of bias and I think

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840
this whole issue of bias and I think
 

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.919
this whole issue of bias and I think
you're absolutely right it is everywhere

01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:52.929
you're absolutely right it is everywhere
 

01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:56.280
you're absolutely right it is everywhere
in the process and what makes it

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:56.290
in the process and what makes it
 

01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:58.470
in the process and what makes it
problematic is we assume that it's not

01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480
problematic is we assume that it's not
 

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.500
problematic is we assume that it's not
so we imagine a process that is bias

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:01.510
so we imagine a process that is bias
 

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:04.620
so we imagine a process that is bias
free and yet we're we're encountering it

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:04.630
free and yet we're we're encountering it
 

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:06.810
free and yet we're we're encountering it
at every step and we're encountering it

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:06.820
at every step and we're encountering it
 

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.300
at every step and we're encountering it
at all of the junctures so not just in

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:09.310
at all of the junctures so not just in
 

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:10.310
at all of the junctures so not just in
the obvious place

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320
the obvious place
 

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.550
the obvious place
but in in difficult places so for

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560
but in in difficult places so for
 

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.240
but in in difficult places so for
example it's very clear to me from lots

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.250
example it's very clear to me from lots
 

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.710
example it's very clear to me from lots
of editing that an editor can

01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:18.720
of editing that an editor can
 

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.810
of editing that an editor can
predetermine the outcome of any

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820
predetermine the outcome of any
 

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.410
predetermine the outcome of any

submission just by the reviewers that
 

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.970
submission just by the reviewers that
they select and sometimes you know I

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980
they select and sometimes you know I
 

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.610
they select and sometimes you know I
think editors are not as though as aware

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620
think editors are not as though as aware
 

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.490
think editors are not as though as aware
of that fact because of course once you

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500
of that fact because of course once you
 

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.710
of that fact because of course once you
get the reviews back that you expect you

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:36.720
get the reviews back that you expect you
 

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.230
get the reviews back that you expect you
reinforced in your initial notions of

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:39.240
reinforced in your initial notions of
 

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.940
reinforced in your initial notions of
the paper and you believe that in fact

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:40.950
the paper and you believe that in fact
 

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.560
the paper and you believe that in fact
we've got this objective and lovely

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:42.570
we've got this objective and lovely
 

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:45.440
we've got this objective and lovely
process but just selecting the the

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:45.450
process but just selecting the the
 

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:48.410
process but just selecting the the
reviewers I think is is is an example of

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420
reviewers I think is is is an example of
 

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.310
reviewers I think is is is an example of
a kind of instant inter inter sees where

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320
a kind of instant inter inter sees where
 

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.470
a kind of instant inter inter sees where
lots goes on that is often unseen and

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480
lots goes on that is often unseen and
 

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.840
lots goes on that is often unseen and
unrecognized so one of the things I've

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:56.850
unrecognized so one of the things I've
 

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.730
unrecognized so one of the things I've
started doing in trying to talk to

01:11:58.730 --> 01:11:58.740
started doing in trying to talk to
 

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.440
started doing in trying to talk to
people about this is really not using

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:00.450
people about this is really not using
 

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.420
people about this is really not using
the word bias because right there it

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:02.430
the word bias because right there it
 

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.880
the word bias because right there it
sort of loads that the discussion and so

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:04.890
sort of loads that the discussion and so
 

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:06.320
sort of loads that the discussion and so
I've shifted to talking about

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:06.330
I've shifted to talking about
 

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.330
I've shifted to talking about
perspective which everyone feels

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340
perspective which everyone feels
 

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.610
perspective which everyone feels
comfortable having and everyone can

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620
comfortable having and everyone can
 

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.260
comfortable having and everyone can
acknowledge that others have ones that

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:12.270
acknowledge that others have ones that
 

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:14.810
acknowledge that others have ones that
are different from their own and

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820
are different from their own and
 

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.250
are different from their own and
sometimes people are a little more

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260
sometimes people are a little more
 

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.840
sometimes people are a little more
forthcoming if they talk about their

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:17.850
forthcoming if they talk about their
 

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:19.550
forthcoming if they talk about their
perspective that tends to be more

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560
perspective that tends to be more
 

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.190
perspective that tends to be more
appreciative of qualitative work or

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:22.200
appreciative of qualitative work or
 

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.800
appreciative of qualitative work or
quantitative work or applied work or

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:24.810
quantitative work or applied work or
 

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:27.020
quantitative work or applied work or
basic work and you can at least get

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:27.030
basic work and you can at least get
 

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:29.030
basic work and you can at least get
people to to feel somewhat more

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040
people to to feel somewhat more
 

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.730
people to to feel somewhat more
comfortable the other thing that it's

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:31.740
comfortable the other thing that it's
 

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.970
comfortable the other thing that it's
useful for thinking about perspective is

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:33.980
useful for thinking about perspective is
 

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.380
useful for thinking about perspective is
journals themselves have perspectives

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:36.390
journals themselves have perspectives
 

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.910
journals themselves have perspectives
and in fact they're you know we

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920
and in fact they're you know we
 

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.040
and in fact they're you know we
sometimes call them reputations but the

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:40.050
sometimes call them reputations but the
 

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.600
sometimes call them reputations but the
perspectives that they bring are

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:41.610
perspectives that they bring are
 

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.250
perspectives that they bring are
oftentimes what they believe to be

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260
oftentimes what they believe to be
 

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.890
oftentimes what they believe to be
valuable because if if we are to keep

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900
valuable because if if we are to keep
 

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.510
valuable because if if we are to keep
journals that is if we are not to give

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520
journals that is if we are not to give
 

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.790
journals that is if we are not to give
up on journals one of the things one of

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800
up on journals one of the things one of
 

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.230
up on journals one of the things one of
the reasons we might want to keep them

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:51.240
the reasons we might want to keep them
 

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.560
the reasons we might want to keep them
is that even before you invest the time

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:54.570
is that even before you invest the time
 

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.260
is that even before you invest the time
to read an article as a reader of a

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:57.270
to read an article as a reader of a
 

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:59.090
to read an article as a reader of a
journal that you know you believe you

01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100
journal that you know you believe you
 

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.580
journal that you know you believe you
know something before you make that

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:01.590
know something before you make that
 

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:03.020
know something before you make that
effort about what you're about to

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:03.030
effort about what you're about to
 

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:05.150
effort about what you're about to
experience and and that's a perspective

01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:05.160
experience and and that's a perspective
 

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.300
experience and and that's a perspective
that that comes to the journal let me

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:08.310
that that comes to the journal let me
 

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.380
that that comes to the journal let me
say just a little bit about the

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:09.390
say just a little bit about the
 

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.380
say just a little bit about the
different actors in a try to organize it

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:12.390
different actors in a try to organize it
 

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.170
different actors in a try to organize it
a little bit because there was advice

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:15.180
a little bit because there was advice
 

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.880
a little bit because there was advice
for I think for all of us and in this

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:16.890
for I think for all of us and in this
 

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:20.180
for I think for all of us and in this
process so for authors I think the

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:20.190
process so for authors I think the
 

01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:21.950
process so for authors I think the
advice for authors too

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960
advice for authors too
 

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.160
advice for authors too
who share their work early share it

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:25.170
who share their work early share it
 

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:27.590
who share their work early share it
before they submit it is I think really

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600
before they submit it is I think really
 

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.610
before they submit it is I think really
good advice

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620
good advice
 

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.709
good advice
I think the complication than that

01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719
I think the complication than that
 

01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:33.020
I think the complication than that
advice is that authors find themselves

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.030
advice is that authors find themselves
 

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.240
advice is that authors find themselves
in very different kinds of contexts and

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:35.250
in very different kinds of contexts and
 

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:38.090
in very different kinds of contexts and
some authors find themselves in very

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100
some authors find themselves in very
 

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.690
some authors find themselves in very
rich contexts with very experienced

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:41.700
rich contexts with very experienced
 

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.790
rich contexts with very experienced
colleagues who are very gracious and

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800
colleagues who are very gracious and
 

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.700
colleagues who are very gracious and
generous with their time others find

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:46.710
generous with their time others find
 

01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:48.500
generous with their time others find
themselves and totally the opposite

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:48.510
themselves and totally the opposite
 

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:51.229
themselves and totally the opposite
either with very expert and ungracious

01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239
either with very expert and ungracious
 

01:13:51.239 --> 01:13:54.709
either with very expert and ungracious
and ungenerous colleagues or isolated in

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719
and ungenerous colleagues or isolated in
 

01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:57.050
and ungenerous colleagues or isolated in
institutions where they're the expert on

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060
institutions where they're the expert on
 

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.209
institutions where they're the expert on
the campus and so there are some real

01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219
the campus and so there are some real
 

01:13:59.219 --> 01:14:01.010
the campus and so there are some real
issues in terms of giving back to the

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020
issues in terms of giving back to the
 

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.380
issues in terms of giving back to the
issue of the idea of which which

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:03.390
issue of the idea of which which
 

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:04.760
issue of the idea of which which
publications are elite and which

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:04.770
publications are elite and which
 

01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.950
publications are elite and which
scholars get to be elite and and who

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960
scholars get to be elite and and who
 

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.660
scholars get to be elite and and who
gets to have status within the field

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:08.670
gets to have status within the field
 

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.370
gets to have status within the field
that those things are not all well

01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380
that those things are not all well
 

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.740
that those things are not all well
distributed so at some point we have to

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:12.750
distributed so at some point we have to
 

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.990
distributed so at some point we have to
have a enough of a forgiveness in the

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000
have a enough of a forgiveness in the
 

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.420
have a enough of a forgiveness in the
system that we take in papers from

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:17.430
system that we take in papers from
 

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:19.430
system that we take in papers from
authors who are in situations where they

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440
authors who are in situations where they
 

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.520
authors who are in situations where they
can't get that kind of feedback that

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:22.530
can't get that kind of feedback that
 

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:26.510
can't get that kind of feedback that
turns out to be a time-consuming and

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520
turns out to be a time-consuming and
 

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.030
turns out to be a time-consuming and
difficult thing for for journals to do

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040
difficult thing for for journals to do
 

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.530
difficult thing for for journals to do
over a period of time but it's something

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540
over a period of time but it's something
 

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.180
over a period of time but it's something
we have to work on and it's a good

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:32.190
we have to work on and it's a good
 

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:34.910
we have to work on and it's a good
argument for having a broader set of

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920
argument for having a broader set of
 

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.070
argument for having a broader set of
journals each of which might be taking a

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080
journals each of which might be taking a
 

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.530
journals each of which might be taking a
smaller flow of papers and therefore

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540
smaller flow of papers and therefore
 

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.630
smaller flow of papers and therefore
being able to devote more editorial time

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640
being able to devote more editorial time
 

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.090
being able to devote more editorial time
that's not the way things tend to go but

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100
that's not the way things tend to go but
 

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.470
that's not the way things tend to go but
that might be an argument for that

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480
that might be an argument for that
 

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.720
that might be an argument for that
implications for reviewers I think it's

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:50.730
implications for reviewers I think it's
 

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.640
implications for reviewers I think it's
intriguing this notion that we would

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:52.650
intriguing this notion that we would
 

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:56.810
intriguing this notion that we would
train reviewers I think as someone in

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820
train reviewers I think as someone in
 

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.100
train reviewers I think as someone in
the audience already mentioned I think

01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:58.110
the audience already mentioned I think
 

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:00.310
the audience already mentioned I think
that's a hard thing to sell people on

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320
that's a hard thing to sell people on
 

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.570
that's a hard thing to sell people on
one of the things that we've done with a

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580
one of the things that we've done with a
 

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.670
one of the things that we've done with a
fair degree of success is not train

01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:04.680
fair degree of success is not train
 

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.970
fair degree of success is not train
reviewers but we now rate and select

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980
reviewers but we now rate and select
 

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.010
reviewers but we now rate and select
reviewers in a much more systematic way

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020
reviewers in a much more systematic way
 

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.760
reviewers in a much more systematic way
than we did a decade ago so we use a

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:13.770
than we did a decade ago so we use a
 

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:15.920
than we did a decade ago so we use a
very large pool of reviewers which I've

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:15.930
very large pool of reviewers which I've
 

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:17.959
very large pool of reviewers which I've
discovered from other editors tends to

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:17.969
discovered from other editors tends to
 

01:15:17.969 --> 01:15:22.490
discovered from other editors tends to
be not an uncontroversial decision that

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500
be not an uncontroversial decision that
 

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.410
be not an uncontroversial decision that
is some editors think you should have a

01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420
is some editors think you should have a
 

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.290
is some editors think you should have a
very close-knit set of reviewers that

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300
very close-knit set of reviewers that
 

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.150
very close-knit set of reviewers that
you have known since graduate school and

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:29.160
you have known since graduate school and
 

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.890
you have known since graduate school and
you can trust because you know how

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900
you can trust because you know how
 

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.410
you can trust because you know how
they've been trained other editors take

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420
they've been trained other editors take
 

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.959
they've been trained other editors take
a different perspective we've gone too

01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:35.969
a different perspective we've gone too
 

01:15:35.969 --> 01:15:38.060
a different perspective we've gone too
a much broader set of reviewers just

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:38.070
a much broader set of reviewers just
 

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:39.649
a much broader set of reviewers just
because we're looking for quality

01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659
because we're looking for quality
 

01:15:39.659 --> 01:15:41.719
because we're looking for quality
reviews which means people who will take

01:15:41.719 --> 01:15:41.729
reviews which means people who will take
 

01:15:41.729 --> 01:15:43.459
reviews which means people who will take
the time who will deal with the

01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:43.469
the time who will deal with the
 

01:15:43.469 --> 01:15:45.709
the time who will deal with the
methodological issues and then we track

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719
methodological issues and then we track
 

01:15:45.719 --> 01:15:48.680
methodological issues and then we track
those reviews for their quality so we

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:48.690
those reviews for their quality so we
 

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:51.290
those reviews for their quality so we
know in our database if you've delivered

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300
know in our database if you've delivered
 

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.060
know in our database if you've delivered
good reviews for us in the past

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:53.070
good reviews for us in the past
 

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.549
good reviews for us in the past
unfortunately your reward is we get we

01:15:55.549 --> 01:15:55.559
unfortunately your reward is we get we
 

01:15:55.559 --> 01:15:58.790
unfortunately your reward is we get we
ask you again so no good deed goes

01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800
ask you again so no good deed goes
 

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.129
ask you again so no good deed goes
unpunished in our system but it actually

01:16:01.129 --> 01:16:01.139
unpunished in our system but it actually
 

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:04.189
unpunished in our system but it actually
I think has has some promise editors I

01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199
I think has has some promise editors I
 

01:16:04.199 --> 01:16:07.549
I think has has some promise editors I
think the whole issue of editors is an

01:16:07.549 --> 01:16:07.559
think the whole issue of editors is an
 

01:16:07.559 --> 01:16:09.379
think the whole issue of editors is an
intriguing one and I've now been an

01:16:09.379 --> 01:16:09.389
intriguing one and I've now been an
 

01:16:09.389 --> 01:16:12.020
intriguing one and I've now been an
editor I guess for almost well not quite

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:12.030
editor I guess for almost well not quite
 

01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:16.279
editor I guess for almost well not quite
20 years but a lot of editing time and I

01:16:16.279 --> 01:16:16.289
20 years but a lot of editing time and I
 

01:16:16.289 --> 01:16:17.959
20 years but a lot of editing time and I
was trying to think back and preparing

01:16:17.959 --> 01:16:17.969
was trying to think back and preparing
 

01:16:17.969 --> 01:16:19.700
was trying to think back and preparing
for this you know what it was like to be

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:19.710
for this you know what it was like to be
 

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.669
for this you know what it was like to be
in a young editor a beginning editor and

01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679
in a young editor a beginning editor and
 

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:24.310
in a young editor a beginning editor and
what it's like now to be an old editor

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320
what it's like now to be an old editor
 

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.160
what it's like now to be an old editor
and I think one of the things I've come

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:28.170
and I think one of the things I've come
 

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:31.430
and I think one of the things I've come
to appreciate is just how little we do

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440
to appreciate is just how little we do
 

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.370
to appreciate is just how little we do
to prepare people to become editors how

01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380
to prepare people to become editors how
 

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.680
to prepare people to become editors how
little support we offer them and really

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:36.690
little support we offer them and really
 

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:40.879
little support we offer them and really
how tricky that role is it's amazingly

01:16:40.879 --> 01:16:40.889
how tricky that role is it's amazingly
 

01:16:40.889 --> 01:16:43.370
how tricky that role is it's amazingly
complicated it's very easy to get in

01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380
complicated it's very easy to get in
 

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.700
complicated it's very easy to get in
trouble particularly in a lot of

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:46.710
trouble particularly in a lot of
 

01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:49.189
trouble particularly in a lot of
journals there are solo editors and not

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199
journals there are solo editors and not
 

01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:52.250
journals there are solo editors and not
really strong editorial support systems

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260
really strong editorial support systems
 

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.069
really strong editorial support systems
so so developing those kinds of systems

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:55.079
so so developing those kinds of systems
 

01:16:55.079 --> 01:16:57.830
so so developing those kinds of systems
I think would be helpful I've been on a

01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840
I think would be helpful I've been on a
 

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.560
I think would be helpful I've been on a
board where we've recruited and

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:00.570
board where we've recruited and
 

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:04.939
board where we've recruited and
appointed and removed editors so one of

01:17:04.939 --> 01:17:04.949
appointed and removed editors so one of
 

01:17:04.949 --> 01:17:06.589
appointed and removed editors so one of
the things that's clear is the sort of

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:06.599
the things that's clear is the sort of
 

01:17:06.599 --> 01:17:08.810
the things that's clear is the sort of
inclination and natural talent for

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820
inclination and natural talent for
 

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.479
inclination and natural talent for
editing is not widely distributed among

01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:11.489
editing is not widely distributed among
 

01:17:11.489 --> 01:17:13.669
editing is not widely distributed among
the academic profession nor is there any

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679
the academic profession nor is there any
 

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:16.069
the academic profession nor is there any
reason to believe that it should be and

01:17:16.069 --> 01:17:16.079
reason to believe that it should be and
 

01:17:16.079 --> 01:17:18.469
reason to believe that it should be and
so we probably under invest I think in

01:17:18.469 --> 01:17:18.479
so we probably under invest I think in
 

01:17:18.479 --> 01:17:20.419
so we probably under invest I think in
in how we bring people into the

01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:20.429
in how we bring people into the
 

01:17:20.429 --> 01:17:23.930
in how we bring people into the
editorial process and what that's like

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940
editorial process and what that's like
 

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.819
editorial process and what that's like
and and that goes from everything from

01:17:25.819 --> 01:17:25.829
and and that goes from everything from
 

01:17:25.829 --> 01:17:27.919
and and that goes from everything from
the inability put to put your own work

01:17:27.919 --> 01:17:27.929
the inability put to put your own work
 

01:17:27.929 --> 01:17:30.140
the inability put to put your own work
in perspective and aside and to and to

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:30.150
in perspective and aside and to and to
 

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.779
in perspective and aside and to and to
graciously work on someone else's work

01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:32.789
graciously work on someone else's work
 

01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:35.120
graciously work on someone else's work
on their terms and in their perspective

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.130
on their terms and in their perspective
 

01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:39.080
on their terms and in their perspective
but it goes beyond that another actor

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:39.090
but it goes beyond that another actor
 

01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:44.020
but it goes beyond that another actor
that I sort of got mentioned indirectly

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:44.030
that I sort of got mentioned indirectly
 

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:47.779
that I sort of got mentioned indirectly
I would say are our review processes

01:17:47.779 --> 01:17:47.789
I would say are our review processes
 

01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:49.770
I would say are our review processes
tenure and promotion

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:49.780
tenure and promotion
 

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.680
tenure and promotion
career development processes and here I

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:52.690
career development processes and here I
 

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.050
career development processes and here I
think there are lots of issues that bear

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:55.060
think there are lots of issues that bear
 

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:59.970
think there are lots of issues that bear
on this whole process you know it

01:17:59.970 --> 01:17:59.980
on this whole process you know it
 

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.430
on this whole process you know it
appears and I'm about to go back on to

01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440
appears and I'm about to go back on to
 

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.900
appears and I'm about to go back on to
the tenure and Promotion Committee so I

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:03.910
the tenure and Promotion Committee so I
 

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:06.120
the tenure and Promotion Committee so I
say appears but it appears to me that

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:06.130
say appears but it appears to me that
 

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.920
say appears but it appears to me that
those committees are increasingly

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:07.930
those committees are increasingly
 

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.860
those committees are increasingly
relying upon the place of publication in

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:10.870
relying upon the place of publication in
 

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:13.320
relying upon the place of publication in
making the judgments that that they are

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:13.330
making the judgments that that they are
 

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:15.630
making the judgments that that they are
making and they're less reliant upon

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:15.640
making and they're less reliant upon
 

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.410
making and they're less reliant upon
actually there I say reading the papers

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420
actually there I say reading the papers
 

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.690
actually there I say reading the papers
and and making their own independent

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:21.700
and and making their own independent
 

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.150
and and making their own independent
judgment of that and so I think you know

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:24.160
judgment of that and so I think you know
 

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.920
judgment of that and so I think you know
what I take away from that is when we

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:25.930
what I take away from that is when we
 

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:28.260
what I take away from that is when we
when we sort of ask the question should

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:28.270
when we sort of ask the question should
 

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.500
when we sort of ask the question should
we have journals another way to ask the

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:31.510
we have journals another way to ask the
 

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:33.900
we have journals another way to ask the
question is should journals become less

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:33.910
question is should journals become less
 

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.410
question is should journals become less
important and in particular can we

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:36.420
important and in particular can we
 

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.030
important and in particular can we
imagine them being less important in the

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040
imagine them being less important in the
 

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.950
imagine them being less important in the
tenure and promotion process and that

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960
tenure and promotion process and that
 

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.800
tenure and promotion process and that
would require different ways of

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:43.810
would require different ways of
 

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.650
would require different ways of
conducting those kinds of reviews and

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:46.660
conducting those kinds of reviews and
 

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:48.840
conducting those kinds of reviews and
and a fair amount of work in preparing

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:48.850
and a fair amount of work in preparing
 

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.850
and a fair amount of work in preparing
people to engage in that process which

01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:50.860
people to engage in that process which
 

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:55.800
people to engage in that process which
itself is is is complicated so I think

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:55.810
itself is is is complicated so I think
 

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:57.900
itself is is is complicated so I think
I'll leave it there I hope I've raised a

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:57.910
I'll leave it there I hope I've raised a
 

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:00.570
I'll leave it there I hope I've raised a
few questions in the in to add to the

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:00.580
few questions in the in to add to the
 

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.160
few questions in the in to add to the
conversation and just look forward to

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:02.170
conversation and just look forward to
 

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:11.640
conversation and just look forward to
folks have to say thank you all three

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:11.650
folks have to say thank you all three
 

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:13.680
folks have to say thank you all three
I'm gonna ask you all to come up to the

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:13.690
I'm gonna ask you all to come up to the
 

01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:15.570
I'm gonna ask you all to come up to the
table here where we've got three mics

01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:15.580
table here where we've got three mics
 

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.430
table here where we've got three mics
and remind everyone that we are taping

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440
and remind everyone that we are taping
 

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.640
and remind everyone that we are taping
this and we do put these sessions up on

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:23.650
this and we do put these sessions up on
 

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:25.950
this and we do put these sessions up on
YouTube pretty quickly after the events

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960
YouTube pretty quickly after the events
 

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.700
YouTube pretty quickly after the events
and all our previous talks are on

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:29.710
and all our previous talks are on
 

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:32.670
and all our previous talks are on
YouTube so if you ask a question be

01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:32.680
YouTube so if you ask a question be
 

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.380
YouTube so if you ask a question be
grateful if you come to the mic in the

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:34.390
grateful if you come to the mic in the
 

01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:36.870
grateful if you come to the mic in the
center of the room and if you feel like

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880
center of the room and if you feel like
 

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.000
center of the room and if you feel like
introducing yourself we'd love you to do

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.010
introducing yourself we'd love you to do
 

01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:47.370
introducing yourself we'd love you to do
that as well well I have a question just

01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:47.380
that as well well I have a question just
 

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.230
that as well well I have a question just
to lead off you you did talk a little

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:49.240
to lead off you you did talk a little
 

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.460
to lead off you you did talk a little
bit about some of the alternative

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:52.470
bit about some of the alternative
 

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:56.010
bit about some of the alternative
publication approaches and we see that

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:56.020
publication approaches and we see that
 

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.169
publication approaches and we see that
in physics and

01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179
in physics and
 

01:19:57.179 --> 01:19:58.969
in physics and
economics and a few other disciplines

01:19:58.969 --> 01:19:58.979
economics and a few other disciplines
 

01:19:58.979 --> 01:20:01.399
economics and a few other disciplines
we're seeing this long tradition of

01:20:01.399 --> 01:20:01.409
we're seeing this long tradition of
 

01:20:01.409 --> 01:20:04.370
we're seeing this long tradition of
print preprints going into the networked

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380
print preprints going into the networked
 

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.529
print preprints going into the networked
environment and and having made that

01:20:06.529 --> 01:20:06.539
environment and and having made that
 

01:20:06.539 --> 01:20:09.890
environment and and having made that
transition very securely can you imagine

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900
transition very securely can you imagine
 

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.810
transition very securely can you imagine
for example in some of your disciplines

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:13.820
for example in some of your disciplines
 

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.189
for example in some of your disciplines
seeing that sort of really major

01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199
seeing that sort of really major
 

01:20:16.199 --> 01:20:19.399
seeing that sort of really major
transition to pre-publication preprint

01:20:19.399 --> 01:20:19.409
transition to pre-publication preprint
 

01:20:19.409 --> 01:20:21.560
transition to pre-publication preprint
publication and then the sort of

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:21.570
publication and then the sort of
 

01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:24.649
publication and then the sort of
endorsement that follows heavy citation

01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659
endorsement that follows heavy citation
 

01:20:24.659 --> 01:20:29.299
endorsement that follows heavy citation
use and so on and there was an

01:20:29.299 --> 01:20:29.309
use and so on and there was an
 

01:20:29.309 --> 01:20:31.489

very very few people were willing to do

know posting preprints or even speaking

01:21:01.429 --> 01:21:01.439

at scientific conferences there's

01:21:03.979 --> 01:21:03.989
at scientific conferences there's
 

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.629
at scientific conferences there's
getting more and more of a this feel

01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639
getting more and more of a this feel
 

01:21:05.639 --> 01:21:08.689
getting more and more of a this feel
that I'll only speak about it once it's

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699
that I'll only speak about it once it's
 

01:21:08.699 --> 01:21:10.850
that I'll only speak about it once it's
impressed and it's really a shame from

01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860
impressed and it's really a shame from
 

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.620
impressed and it's really a shame from
my perspective but there's so much fear

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:12.630
my perspective but there's so much fear
 

01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.549
my perspective but there's so much fear
in a world in which the experiments

01:21:16.549 --> 01:21:16.559
in a world in which the experiments
 

01:21:16.559 --> 01:21:18.379
in a world in which the experiments
themselves are pretty easy to do there's

01:21:18.379 --> 01:21:18.389
themselves are pretty easy to do there's
 

01:21:18.389 --> 01:21:20.270

equipment there's stuff you can just buy

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280
equipment there's stuff you can just buy
 

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.040
equipment there's stuff you can just buy
once you know what the result is it's

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:22.050
once you know what the result is it's
 

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:24.830
once you know what the result is it's
pretty easy to reproduce it within a lot

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840
pretty easy to reproduce it within a lot

get lots of questions from authors about

does that preclude publication what does

their future relies on the success of
 

01:22:51.059 --> 01:22:52.790
their future relies on the success of
this relative experiment but I think for

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800
this relative experiment but I think for
 

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.160

pre tenured faculty who are trying to
 

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.859
pre tenured faculty who are trying to
build a CV it would be too much of a

build a CV it would be too much of a
 

01:22:57.869 --> 01:23:06.919
build a CV it would be too much of a
risk so maybe small experiments and

01:23:06.919 --> 01:23:06.929
risk so maybe small experiments and
 

01:23:06.929 --> 01:23:09.109

01:23:23.359 --> 01:23:23.369
people who have moved in that direction
 

01:23:23.369 --> 01:23:26.029
people who have moved in that direction
have chosen their projects for those

01:23:26.029 --> 01:23:26.039
have chosen their projects for those
 

01:23:26.039 --> 01:23:28.549
have chosen their projects for those
kinds of collaborations and have done so

01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:28.559
kinds of collaborations and have done so
 

01:23:28.559 --> 01:23:30.649
kinds of collaborations and have done so
you know quite successfully so I

01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659
you know quite successfully so I
 

01:23:30.659 --> 01:23:31.669
you know quite successfully so I
wouldn't say so I think there are

01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679
wouldn't say so I think there are
 

01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:34.669
wouldn't say so I think there are
pockets of exceptions there and that if

01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679
pockets of exceptions there and that if
 

01:23:34.679 --> 01:23:37.609

collaboration you can succeed in biology

01:23:40.459 --> 01:23:40.469
collaboration you can succeed in biology
 

01:23:40.469 --> 01:23:43.790

think you it's a it's the NIC I don't

01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:45.449

think it's the nature of the beast I

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:47.099
think it's the nature of the beast I
 

01:23:47.099 --> 01:23:48.589
think it's the nature of the beast I
used to say when I was a student that

01:23:48.589 --> 01:23:48.599
used to say when I was a student that
 

01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:51.020
used to say when I was a student that
you had two options one was to be open

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:51.030
you had two options one was to be open
 

01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:52.699
you had two options one was to be open
with everyone and then there was some

01:23:52.699 --> 01:23:52.709
with everyone and then there was some
 

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:54.020
with everyone and then there was some
community standard that would say hey

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:54.030
community standard that would say hey
 

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.640
community standard that would say hey

what was this person right so you're
 

01:23:59.039 --> 01:24:00.439
what was this person right so you're
open with everyone or you become very

01:24:00.439 --> 01:24:00.449
open with everyone or you become very
 

01:24:00.449 --> 01:24:02.390

private and I think that that

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400
private and I think that that
 

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.339
private and I think that that
polarization I think is happening even

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:04.349
polarization I think is happening even

to acceptance do you know why puzzle is

01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520
to acceptance do you know why puzzle is

why I mean those are data and certainly

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260
why I mean those are data and certainly
 

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.140
why I mean those are data and certainly
my point was that you'd think of

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:42.150
my point was that you'd think of
 

01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:44.210
my point was that you'd think of
anything if everything were the same it

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:44.220
anything if everything were the same it
 

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.190
anything if everything were the same it
would be faster and it's not faster so

01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:46.200
would be faster and it's not faster so
 

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.010
would be faster and it's not faster so
something has changed whether it's that

01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:49.020
something has changed whether it's that
 

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.350
something has changed whether it's that
papers have gotten more complicated so

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360
papers have gotten more complicated so
 

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.910
papers have gotten more complicated so
you need lots of different experts and

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920
you need lots of different experts and
 

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.620
you need lots of different experts and
that is certainly true that we've moved

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:54.630
that is certainly true that we've moved
 

01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:57.170
that is certainly true that we've moved
in biology from having two reviewers to

01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:57.180
in biology from having two reviewers to
 

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.090
in biology from having two reviewers to
in some of these complicated papers

01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100
in some of these complicated papers
 

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.830
in some of these complicated papers
having three or four or five reviewers

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840
having three or four or five reviewers
 

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.660
having three or four or five reviewers
on a single paper you get off them all

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:02.670
on a single paper you get off them all
 

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.930
on a single paper you get off them all
in you know you it all takes you know

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940
in you know you it all takes you know
 

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.660
in you know you it all takes you know
it's a harder thing to orchestrate I

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:08.670
it's a harder thing to orchestrate I
 

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.780
it's a harder thing to orchestrate I
think reviewing has changed that's what

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:11.790
think reviewing has changed that's what
 

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:14.830
think reviewing has changed that's what
I think you know my own sense of it I

01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840
I think you know my own sense of it I
 

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.570
I think you know my own sense of it I
feel like I have to wait for a long time

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580
feel like I have to wait for a long time
 

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.880
feel like I have to wait for a long time
for certain reviewers to get back to me

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:19.890
for certain reviewers to get back to me
 

01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:23.450
for certain reviewers to get back to me
with my paper so there's not a deadline

01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460
with my paper so there's not a deadline
 

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.570
with my paper so there's not a deadline
for reviewers there is often a deadline

01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580
for reviewers there is often a deadline
 

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.590
for reviewers there is often a deadline
for reviewers but so it depends on the

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600
for reviewers but so it depends on the
 

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.010

problem is reviewers say yes I can do

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:53.310
problem is reviewers say yes I can do

experimental revision quite often you

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:42.380
experimental revision quite often you

reviewers and they may have had time to

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:46.130
reviewers and they may have had time to
 

01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.220
reviewers and they may have had time to
do it quickly the first time around but

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:48.230
do it quickly the first time around but
 

01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.390
do it quickly the first time around but
you can't just shift the reviewers a

01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400
you can't just shift the reviewers a
 

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.530
you can't just shift the reviewers a
second time they may be writing their

second time they may be writing their
own grant or doing something else but

01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:52.340
own grant or doing something else but
 

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.209
own grant or doing something else but

couple of reasons for that so it sounds

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320
couple of reasons for that so it sounds
 

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.500
couple of reasons for that so it sounds
like there's no advantage to be a

it slowed right down again so I think

more places and of course if we simply

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:10.770
more places and of course if we simply
 

01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:13.010
more places and of course if we simply
speed it up the process right that would

01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020
speed it up the process right that would
 

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.500
speed it up the process right that would
make it even even worse because the same

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:15.510

don't think there is a great you know a
 

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.380
don't think there is a great you know a
great answer to that question I mean I

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:24.390
great answer to that question I mean I
 

01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:26.419
great answer to that question I mean I
think we've all tried to expand where we

01:29:26.419 --> 01:29:26.429
think we've all tried to expand where we
 

01:29:26.429 --> 01:29:28.280
think we've all tried to expand where we
can expand review or bowles but it's

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:28.290
can expand review or bowles but it's
 

01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:31.310
can expand review or bowles but it's
really tough to get exactly the kind of

01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320
really tough to get exactly the kind of
 

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.510
really tough to get exactly the kind of
people that you want about uncoupling

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520
people that you want about uncoupling
 

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.149
people that you want about uncoupling
the assessment of a paper in terms of

the assessment of a paper in terms of

the assessment of a paper in terms of
its methodology from and its potential

01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159
its methodology from and its potential
 

01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:42.530
its methodology from and its potential
importance from whether it belongs in a

particular journal is that it can enable

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:44.670

those reviews to be used at multiple

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:46.710
those reviews to be used at multiple
 

01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:49.160
those reviews to be used at multiple
journals and so you just said kind of

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:49.170
journals and so you just said kind of
 

01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:51.169
journals and so you just said kind of
inherently well obviously if it goes

01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179
inherently well obviously if it goes
 

01:29:51.179 --> 01:29:52.280
inherently well obviously if it goes
through multiple journals that's gonna

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:52.290

you're going to use reviewers more and

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760
you're going to use reviewers more and
 

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.209
you're going to use reviewers more and
more times if we could undo that somehow

01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219
more times if we could undo that somehow
 

01:29:56.219 --> 01:30:00.919
more times if we could undo that somehow
by having the review be fungible then I

01:30:00.919 --> 01:30:00.929
by having the review be fungible then I
 

01:30:00.929 --> 01:30:02.959
by having the review be fungible then I
think we could speed up the process even

01:30:02.959 --> 01:30:02.969
think we could speed up the process even
 

01:30:02.969 --> 01:30:05.180
think we could speed up the process even
if you used journals and so the

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:05.190
if you used journals and so the
 

01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:07.010
if you used journals and so the

know that when I was at Cell Press we

know that when I was at Cell Press we
 

01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:19.399
know that when I was at Cell Press we
used to allow people to submit to

used to allow people to submit to
 

01:30:19.409 --> 01:30:21.530
used to allow people to submit to
multiple journals at the same time and

01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540
multiple journals at the same time and
 

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:24.320
multiple journals at the same time and
our own anecdotal experience with that

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:24.330
our own anecdotal experience with that
 

01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:25.910
our own anecdotal experience with that
has been that reviewers

has been that reviewers

thought-provoking presentations and I
 

01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:07.070
thought-provoking presentations and I
had a few questions we may be able to

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080
had a few questions we may be able to
 

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.100
had a few questions we may be able to
start with one which is what you think

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:10.110
start with one which is what you think
 

01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:13.070
start with one which is what you think
of the notion of charging authors to

01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080
of the notion of charging authors to
 

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.890
of the notion of charging authors to
publish their papers and that obviously

01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900
publish their papers and that obviously
 

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.050
publish their papers and that obviously
raises a lot of issues for the authors

01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060
raises a lot of issues for the authors
 

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:23.030
raises a lot of issues for the authors
and having conceived of the idea of

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040
and having conceived of the idea of
 

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.280
and having conceived of the idea of
starting my own journal and having that

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:25.290
starting my own journal and having that
 

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:29.660
starting my own journal and having that
as a model definitely I sort of brush up

01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:29.670
as a model definitely I sort of brush up
 

01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:31.640
as a model definitely I sort of brush up
against different opinions so I'm

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:31.650
against different opinions so I'm
 

01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:35.950
against different opinions so I'm
wondering what your thoughts are

01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960
 

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.900

to be separable from research funds I

think that's really it's really hard to

publishing this paper or doing the next
piece of work and I think there been

01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360
piece of work and I think there been
 

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.460

lots of work around how to do that so

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:57.470
lots of work around how to do that so
 

01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:59.560
lots of work around how to do that so
that's my kind of view but I don't think

there's anything inherently bad about

there's anything inherently bad about
other side charges but I do think there

01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920
other side charges but I do think there
 

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.710
other side charges but I do think there

need to be sort of tackled head-on but I
 

01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:20.170
need to be sort of tackled head-on but I
think it's probably worth noting that

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:29.890
influence the nature of the
communication and one of the concerns I

01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:29.900
communication and one of the concerns I
 

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.150
communication and one of the concerns I
have you know is it's a mild concern but

01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:34.160
have you know is it's a mild concern but
 

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.370
have you know is it's a mild concern but
a concern is that as we move away from

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:36.380
a concern is that as we move away from
 

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:39.600
a concern is that as we move away from
having journals supported by readers

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:39.610
having journals supported by readers
 

01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:42.130
having journals supported by readers
it's very likely that the nature of the

01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:42.140
it's very likely that the nature of the
 

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:45.040
it's very likely that the nature of the
communication will become different and

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:45.050
communication will become different and
 

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:48.970
communication will become different and
if it's only a journal for authors to

01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:48.980
if it's only a journal for authors to
 

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.190
if it's only a journal for authors to
satisfy authors and if it's supported by

01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:51.200
satisfy authors and if it's supported by
 

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.370
satisfy authors and if it's supported by
authors that may whether that's good or

is an open question but I think it's

01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.110
is an open question but I think it's
 

01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.209
is an open question but I think it's
going to be different than if it's

01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219
going to be different than if it's
 

01:34:59.219 --> 01:35:01.459
going to be different than if it's
actually supported by by end consumers

01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:01.469
actually supported by by end consumers
 

01:35:01.469 --> 01:35:03.080
actually supported by by end consumers
and by readers and I think one of the

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:03.090
and by readers and I think one of the
 

01:35:03.090 --> 01:35:05.449
and by readers and I think one of the
problems that all of the disciplines

01:35:05.449 --> 01:35:05.459
problems that all of the disciplines
 

01:35:05.459 --> 01:35:08.449
problems that all of the disciplines
have is a real under investment in

01:35:08.449 --> 01:35:08.459
have is a real under investment in
 

01:35:08.459 --> 01:35:11.750
have is a real under investment in
communicating with outside publics and

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760
communicating with outside publics and
 

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.850
communicating with outside publics and
demonstrating the value of the work so I

01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860
demonstrating the value of the work so I
 

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:19.120
demonstrating the value of the work so I
would be concerned on that ground

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.130
 

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:22.520
I agree with that

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:22.530
I agree with that
 

01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:24.709
I agree with that
in principle I my problem with that with

01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719
in principle I my problem with that with
 

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:27.140
in principle I my problem with that with
respect to kind of the role that what

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:27.150
respect to kind of the role that what
 

01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:29.449
respect to kind of the role that what
the reader side charge really is I mean

01:35:29.449 --> 01:35:29.459
the reader side charge really is I mean
 

01:35:29.459 --> 01:35:31.520
the reader side charge really is I mean
so most of our reader readers side

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:31.530
so most of our reader readers side
 

01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:33.620
so most of our reader readers side
charges are hits the librarian who's

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:33.630
charges are hits the librarian who's
 

01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.500
charges are hits the librarian who's
paying that bill right it's not the

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:36.510
paying that bill right it's not the
 

01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:40.370
paying that bill right it's not the
reader of the journal article and so and

01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380
reader of the journal article and so and
 

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.339
reader of the journal article and so and
and so what I have felt certainly my own

01:35:43.339 --> 01:35:43.349
and so what I have felt certainly my own
 

01:35:43.349 --> 01:35:45.669
and so what I have felt certainly my own
perspective about the reader the current

01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679
perspective about the reader the current
 

01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:49.069
perspective about the reader the current
what we had is reader side charges is in

01:35:49.069 --> 01:35:49.079
what we had is reader side charges is in
 

01:35:49.079 --> 01:35:51.140
what we had is reader side charges is in
fact neither the author nor the reader

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:51.150
fact neither the author nor the reader
 

01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:52.850
fact neither the author nor the reader
was paying it was a library that was

01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860
was paying it was a library that was
 

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.560
was paying it was a library that was
paying and so it created a really kind

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:54.570
paying and so it created a really kind
 

01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:57.109
paying and so it created a really kind
of in elasticity that and no correlation

01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119
of in elasticity that and no correlation
 

01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:58.549
of in elasticity that and no correlation
anyone who's done the study kind of

01:35:58.549 --> 01:35:58.559
anyone who's done the study kind of
 

01:35:58.559 --> 01:36:00.649
anyone who's done the study kind of
there isn't a correlation between price

01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659
there isn't a correlation between price
 

01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:02.959
there isn't a correlation between price
and value if you perceive value as the

read it it you know in the you know five

read it it you know in the you know five
 

01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:10.879
read it it you know in the you know five
or ten years ago and we you know in any

seemed to be an inverse correlation the

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179
seemed to be an inverse correlation the
 

01:36:15.179 --> 01:36:16.969
seemed to be an inverse correlation the
journals that had the least the smallest

01:36:16.969 --> 01:36:16.979
journals that had the least the smallest
 

01:36:16.979 --> 01:36:19.699
journals that had the least the smallest
readerships were the much more niche

01:36:19.699 --> 01:36:19.709
readerships were the much more niche
 

01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:21.500
readerships were the much more niche
like journals that you know they were

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:21.510
like journals that you know they were
 

01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:23.750
like journals that you know they were
they had really huge charges because

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760
they had really huge charges because
 

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.209
they had really huge charges because
only handful of librarians were paying

01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219
only handful of librarians were paying
 

01:36:26.219 --> 01:36:27.770
only handful of librarians were paying
for them and therefore they had to cover

01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780
for them and therefore they had to cover
 

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:29.929
for them and therefore they had to cover
the whole cost whereas journals like

01:36:29.929 --> 01:36:29.939
the whole cost whereas journals like
 

01:36:29.939 --> 01:36:32.989
the whole cost whereas journals like
nature or you know or science which has

01:36:32.989 --> 01:36:32.999
nature or you know or science which has
 

01:36:32.999 --> 01:36:34.819
nature or you know or science which has
a hundred and eighty thousand

01:36:34.819 --> 01:36:34.829
a hundred and eighty thousand
 

01:36:34.829 --> 01:36:36.500
a hundred and eighty thousand
subscribers or something like that they

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:36.510
subscribers or something like that they
 

01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:38.060
subscribers or something like that they
could bring those costs way down for any

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:38.070
could bring those costs way down for any
 

01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:40.909
could bring those costs way down for any
individual user and so the one of the

01:36:40.909 --> 01:36:40.919
individual user and so the one of the
 

01:36:40.919 --> 01:36:43.009
individual user and so the one of the
things I've always liked about the the

01:36:43.009 --> 01:36:43.019
things I've always liked about the the
 

01:36:43.019 --> 01:36:44.689
things I've always liked about the the
author side charge they said at least

01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699
author side charge they said at least
 

01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:47.649
author side charge they said at least
you see something about costs connected

01:36:47.649 --> 01:36:47.659
you see something about costs connected
 

01:36:47.659 --> 01:36:52.399
you see something about costs connected
to quality that you actually see the

01:36:52.399 --> 01:36:52.409
to quality that you actually see the
 

01:36:52.409 --> 01:36:53.750
to quality that you actually see the
cost even if you don't pay the cost

01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760
cost even if you don't pay the cost
 

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.209
cost even if you don't pay the cost

trends that are going on right now make
me think that something that I thought

me think that something that I thought
 

01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:29.930
me think that something that I thought
was sort of bogus to begin with is even

01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940
was sort of bogus to begin with is even
 

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:32.180
was sort of bogus to begin with is even
more bogus and I'll give you some

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:32.190
more bogus and I'll give you some
 

01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:34.910
more bogus and I'll give you some
examples you know I think a lot of

01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920

journals are just trying to publish
 

01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:38.420
journals are just trying to publish
reviews because that's a way to get

01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:38.430
reviews because that's a way to get
 

01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:41.120
reviews because that's a way to get
their impact factor out and at least in

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.130
their impact factor out and at least in
 

01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:42.710
their impact factor out and at least in
the clinical journals those reviews

01:37:42.710 --> 01:37:42.720
the clinical journals those reviews
 

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.110
the clinical journals those reviews
aren't very good they're not a

01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120
aren't very good they're not a
 

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.730
aren't very good they're not a
particularly high quality and they're

01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:46.740
particularly high quality and they're
 

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.850
particularly high quality and they're
not reporting on you know new results

01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860
not reporting on you know new results
 

01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.310

they're not particularly synthesizing

they're not particularly synthesizing

they're not particularly synthesizing
anything in a particularly useful way so

anything in a particularly useful way so

factor is up from two point one to three

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360
factor is up from two point one to three
 

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.630
factor is up from two point one to three
point and it seems like every journals

01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:23.640
point and it seems like every journals
 

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.460

impact factor is going up because of

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:25.470
impact factor is going up because of
 

01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:27.440
impact factor is going up because of
these tendencies so I'm just wondering

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:27.450
these tendencies so I'm just wondering
 

01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:32.270
these tendencies so I'm just wondering
what your thoughts are so I have a

years ago when he went to raise the

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:41.010
years ago when he went to raise the
 

01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:42.500
years ago when he went to raise the
impact factor of Journal of cell science

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:42.510
impact factor of Journal of cell science

I'm telling his story he he didn't

01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460
I'm telling his story he he didn't
 

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.520
I'm telling his story he he didn't
handle the research at all what he did

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:46.530
handle the research at all what he did
 

01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:48.590
handle the research at all what he did
was he invited big-name people to write

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600
was he invited big-name people to write
 

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.960
was he invited big-name people to write
reviews for the front of the journal and

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:50.970
reviews for the front of the journal and
 

01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:53.900
reviews for the front of the journal and
the impact factor doubled at Journal of

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:53.910
the impact factor doubled at Journal of
 

01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:57.440
the impact factor doubled at Journal of
cell science from I think it was 3 to 6

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:57.450
cell science from I think it was 3 to 6
 

01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:59.150
cell science from I think it was 3 to 6
let's say I'm just making the numbers up

01:38:59.150 --> 01:38:59.160
let's say I'm just making the numbers up
 

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.820
let's say I'm just making the numbers up
what really puzzled Richard and me was

01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:01.830
what really puzzled Richard and me was
 

01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:04.850
what really puzzled Richard and me was
that the editorial board saw this new

01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860
that the editorial board saw this new
 

01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.610
that the editorial board saw this new
impact factor and said yeah I've noticed

01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620
impact factor and said yeah I've noticed
 

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:09.710
impact factor and said yeah I've noticed
that the paper the research papers are

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:09.720
that the paper the research papers are
 

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.480
that the paper the research papers are
getting better in the Journal of cell

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:11.490
getting better in the Journal of cell
 

01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:14.030
getting better in the Journal of cell
science there's some interesting

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040
science there's some interesting
 

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.710
science there's some interesting
phenomenon when people see an impact

01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:15.720
phenomenon when people see an impact
 

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.930
phenomenon when people see an impact
factor they look at the papers in a

01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940
factor they look at the papers in a
 

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.800
factor they look at the papers in a
different way

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:18.810
different way
 

01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:21.680
different way
and that really troubles me that was

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:21.690
and that really troubles me that was
 

01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:24.020
and that really troubles me that was
coming my impact but we are definitely

01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:24.030
coming my impact but we are definitely
 

01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:26.480
coming my impact but we are definitely
moved but I want to raise a couple

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:26.490
moved but I want to raise a couple
 

01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:27.860
moved but I want to raise a couple
things you said they are bogus numbers

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:27.870
things you said they are bogus numbers
 

01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:29.090
things you said they are bogus numbers
so anyone noticed that act of

01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100
so anyone noticed that act of
 

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.800
so anyone noticed that act of
crystallographic a-- has a higher impact

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:30.810
crystallographic a-- has a higher impact
 

01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:32.150
crystallographic a-- has a higher impact
factor than the New England Journal of

01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:32.160
factor than the New England Journal of
 

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.250
factor than the New England Journal of
Medicine this year the reason is they

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.260
Medicine this year the reason is they
 

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.710

published a review it was a review of a

01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:39.720
published a review it was a review of a
 

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.050
published a review it was a review of a
bit of software protein folding software

01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060
bit of software protein folding software
 

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.390
bit of software protein folding software
and within the review said you know if

01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400
and within the review said you know if
 

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.430
and within the review said you know if
you're if you're using the software this

01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440
you're if you're using the software this
 

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.050
you're if you're using the software this
would be a really good citation to use

01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060
would be a really good citation to use
 

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.660
would be a really good citation to use
because it's published and it tells you

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:50.670
because it's published and it tells you
 

01:39:50.670 --> 01:39:51.880
because it's published and it tells you
about the software and you don't have

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:51.890
about the software and you don't have
 

01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:55.640
about the software and you don't have
manuals aren't in PubMed so it becomes a

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:55.650
manuals aren't in PubMed so it becomes a
 

01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:57.560
manuals aren't in PubMed so it becomes a
sizable reference it got cited 6,000

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:57.570
sizable reference it got cited 6,000
 

01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:03.970
sizable reference it got cited 6,000
times so it's so there was one paper

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:03.980
times so it's so there was one paper
 

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.320
times so it's so there was one paper
there's a cancer reviews Journal that

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:06.330
there's a cancer reviews Journal that
 

01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:08.390
there's a cancer reviews Journal that
every year every two years publishes

01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400
every year every two years publishes
 

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.130
every year every two years publishes
cancer statistics epidemiology

01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:10.140
cancer statistics epidemiology
 

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:12.560
cancer statistics epidemiology
statistics for the u.s. those were those

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:12.570
statistics for the u.s. those were those
 

01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:14.990
statistics for the u.s. those were those
reviews get cited by everyone who's

01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000
reviews get cited by everyone who's
 

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.820
reviews get cited by everyone who's
working on those cancers for the next

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:16.830
working on those cancers for the next
 

01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:18.740
working on those cancers for the next
two years so they always have an impact

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:18.750
two years so they always have an impact
 

01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:20.810
two years so they always have an impact
factor higher than England Journal so

01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820
factor higher than England Journal so
 

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.450
factor higher than England Journal so
yes there are ways to game the system I

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460
yes there are ways to game the system I
 

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.860
yes there are ways to game the system I
think any time use and tell people to

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:24.870
think any time use and tell people to
 

01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:26.360
think any time use and tell people to
work to a number they will figure out a

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:26.370
work to a number they will figure out a
 

01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:29.330
work to a number they will figure out a
way to work to that number and that's I

01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340
way to work to that number and that's I
 

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:31.160
way to work to that number and that's I
think that's problem with any metric

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:31.170
think that's problem with any metric
 

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.410
think that's problem with any metric
actually but impact factor is

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420
actually but impact factor is
 

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.360
actually but impact factor is
particularly troubling because it's not

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:35.370
particularly troubling because it's not
 

01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:37.280
particularly troubling because it's not
it's not the metric you think it is

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:37.290
it's not the metric you think it is
 

01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:39.740
it's not the metric you think it is
right so what's it's in the numerator is

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:39.750
right so what's it's in the numerator is
 

01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:50.180
right so what's it's in the numerator is
not what you think sits there

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:50.190
 

01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:52.490
do you have one more question yeah I

01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500
do you have one more question yeah I
 

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:55.660
do you have one more question yeah I
think we have time for one more question

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:55.670
think we have time for one more question
 

01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:58.760
think we have time for one more question
so from from the answer you gave him

01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:58.770
so from from the answer you gave him
 

01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:01.580
so from from the answer you gave him
about the author is paying the journals

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:01.590
about the author is paying the journals
 

01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:03.050
about the author is paying the journals
and also the library paying the journals

01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060
and also the library paying the journals
 

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.240
and also the library paying the journals
for subscriptions so journals are

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:05.250
for subscriptions so journals are
 

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:07.630
for subscriptions so journals are
getting double to pay is that right

01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:07.640
getting double to pay is that right
 

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.430
getting double to pay is that right
you'd say with anything is that you have

01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440
you'd say with anything is that you have
 

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.040
you'd say with anything is that you have
a mixed revenue model right so you look

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:13.050
a mixed revenue model right so you look
 

01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:16.790
a mixed revenue model right so you look
any almost many healthy economies will

01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800
any almost many healthy economies will
 

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.740
any almost many healthy economies will
say we want to pick up we want to mix

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:18.750
say we want to pick up we want to mix
 

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:21.170
say we want to pick up we want to mix
our revenues so that we aren't sensitive

01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:21.180
our revenues so that we aren't sensitive
 

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.729
our revenues so that we aren't sensitive
we're not going to be sensitive to any

01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739
we're not going to be sensitive to any
 

01:41:22.739 --> 01:41:24.020
we're not going to be sensitive to any
one thing dropping the difference

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:24.030
one thing dropping the difference
 

01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:25.900
one thing dropping the difference
between an author pays model and a

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:25.910
between an author pays model and a
 

01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:28.820
between an author pays model and a
library pays model it's the difference

01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:28.830
library pays model it's the difference
 

01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.470
library pays model it's the difference
between having all your money so library

01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480
between having all your money so library
 

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.850
between having all your money so library
will pay a subscription at the beginning

01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860
will pay a subscription at the beginning
 

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:33.439
will pay a subscription at the beginning
of the year and you have that all that

01:41:33.439 --> 01:41:33.449
of the year and you have that all that
 

01:41:33.449 --> 01:41:35.810
of the year and you have that all that
money for the year author pays side is

01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:35.820
money for the year author pays side is
 

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.580
money for the year author pays side is
almost like a retail business right

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:37.590
almost like a retail business right
 

01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:39.560
almost like a retail business right
every time you read publisher paper you

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:39.570
every time you read publisher paper you
 

01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:41.450
every time you read publisher paper you
you put out a charge it's actually much

01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:41.460
you put out a charge it's actually much
 

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.910
you put out a charge it's actually much
harder to get these small payments

01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920
harder to get these small payments
 

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.070
harder to get these small payments
through than it is to get these big

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080
through than it is to get these big
 

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.200
through than it is to get these big
large payments so it's a different it's

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:48.210
large payments so it's a different it's
 

01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:49.670
large payments so it's a different it's
kind of a whole different business

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:49.680
kind of a whole different business
 

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.590
kind of a whole different business
dynamic that happens there and the

01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600
dynamic that happens there and the
 

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.450
dynamic that happens there and the
