00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.519
In the diagram below,
quadrilateral EFGH--

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.990
so that's this one
here-- was obtained

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.310
by performing a sequence
of transformations

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.339
on quadrilateral ABCD.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.880
And then they tell
us the information

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.046
that's already written here.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.700
Measure of angle
A is 69 degrees.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.150
Measure of angle
B is 102 degrees.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.280
Measure of angle
G is 145 degrees.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.290
And measure of angle
H is 44 degrees.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.500
Which of the following
additional facts

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.790
is sufficient to conclude that
the only transformations used

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.270
were translations, rotations,
reflections, and dilations,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.146
and not any other kind
of transformations?

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:39.520
So this is another
way of saying,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.950
if we only used translations,
rotations, reflections,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.160
and dilations, then that means
that these two figures are

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.134
similar.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:49.550
So if this is the
case, then we're

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.960
dealing with similar
quadrilaterals.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.840
So another way of saying this
is, which of these facts--

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.870
so either this first
fact, or this second fact,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.120
or both of them, or neither
of them-- which of these facts

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.100
are sufficient in order to
determine that these two

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.550
quadrilaterals are similar,
which is another way of saying

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.720
that you could go from
one to another only

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600
through translations, rotations,
reflections, and dilations?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.290
So let's look at this first
set of facts right over here.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.060
So they give us the measure
of angle C is 145 degrees.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.120
So they tell us that right
over there is 145 degrees.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.415
And they tell us that
the measure of angle E

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.040
is 69 degrees.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.340
So they tell us that
this is 69 degrees.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.280
So with that piece of
information right over here,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.420
in each of these quadrilaterals,
we know three of the angles.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.240
And because we know three,
we can figure out the fourth.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.850
We can figure it
out because the sum

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.580
of the angles in a
quadrilateral are

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.460
going to add up to 360 degrees.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.590
So if we wanted to figure
out the measure of angle F

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.150
right over here--
let's say that is

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.410
x-- we could say that x
plus 69 degrees plus 145

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.610
degrees plus 44 degrees
is equal to 360 degrees.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.620
So let's get the calculator
out right over here.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.330
Our x would essentially
be 360 minus these things.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:37.380
So 360 minus 69 minus 145
minus 44 is 102 degrees.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.360
So this angle right over
here is 102 degrees.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.400
Now notice, these two already
have three angles in common.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.380
They have a 69 degree--
let me color code

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.270
it-- so this angle
right over here

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.550
has a measure of 69 degrees.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.150
So does this one.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.660
Then you move one over.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.080
This angle right over here is
102 degrees, so is this one.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.640
Then you move to the next
angle is 145 degrees, well,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.371
that would correspond
to this one.

00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:15.870
And if you know
three of the angles,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.244
you know that this
last one right

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:20.920
over here, this fourth one, was
going to have to be 44 degrees.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.470
You could take 360 and from
it subtract 145, 102, and 69,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.815
and you will get 44 degrees.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.600
So you have two quadrilaterals
where all of these angles

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.580
are congruent to each other.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.000
So if you have these
two shapes and you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.040
have all the
corresponding angles

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.265
are congruent to
each other, then you

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:47.630
know that they are similar.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.730
And if you know that
they are similar,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.570
you know that you
can go from one

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.345
to another purely through some
combination of translations,

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:58.470
which is really just shifting
it in two dimensions,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.590
rotating it around some
points, reflecting it, which

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.710
you can kind of use flipping
it over around some line,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.450
and dilations, which is
scaling it up or down.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.520
So the first one
is definitely good.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.260
Let's see if the second one
could also independently help

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.010
us determine that these
two things are similar.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.360
So what I'm going to
do is clear this out

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.150
so I have some
space to work with.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.100
Let me clear it out.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.230
Let me clear this
right over here.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.320
And now let's think about
what the second statement is

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.720
telling us.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.860
The second statement tells
us the measure of angle

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.190
D is 44 degrees.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.570
So they're saying
that is 44 degrees.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.775
And that the measure of
angle F is 102 degrees.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.970
So once again, it's given us
one more angle in each of them.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.460
And from that, we can
figure out the last angle.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.237
And so if you know all of the
angles in two quadrilaterals,

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:00.820
you can determine
if they are similar.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.750
They're going to be
similar only if you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.900
have four corresponding
angles that

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.250
are congruent to each other.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.130
Let me just show
it to you just so I

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.870
don't say that it's enough.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.200
Let's calculate this last
angle right over here.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.250
We can get our
calculator back out.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.970
It's going to be 360
minus 102 minus 145

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.940
minus 44, which is
equal to 69 degrees.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.740
So this right over
here is 69 degrees.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.950
So notice, 102 degrees, then
69 degrees, then 44 degrees.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.190
And so this last one has
to be 145 degrees, just

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.140
like this one.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.640
If three of the
angles are the same,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.700
that fourth one
has to be the same.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.890
So this angle corresponds
to this angle.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.930
This angle corresponds
to that angle.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.870
This angle corresponds
to that angle.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.750
And then finally, this angle
corresponds to this angle.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.440
You have two quadrilaterals.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.680
The interior four angles
are all congruent.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.930
They correspond to each other.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.207
So they must be similar.

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:23.790
And so you can get
from one to another

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.630
through translations, rotations,
reflections, and dilations.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.100
So this one is also good.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.980
So actually, either of
these are sufficient

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.530
in order to conclude that the
only transformations used were

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.340
these.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.800
So I would click, both
answers are correct.
