00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.520
 When you meet other game developers 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.080
 They realize how enthusiastic they are 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920
 And their passion 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
 Seeking to participate 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.000
 What you know and inspired 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 new ideas. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 There is a big difference between enjoying the games 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 And manufacturing. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 It requires learning a lot 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 And made a great effort 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.880
 And continuous work on 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.000
 The game itself for a long time 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.160
 And learning programming techniques. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 Not only do you imagine the game 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.680
 And enjoy it. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560
 My name is Gerald Tok 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.400
 I am the CEO of Inzen Studio 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.080
 In Singapore. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.200
 Dark Dot is a special game. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 The pool is between 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.280
 Traditional shooting games 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.800
 But instead of fast movement 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 The movement made us slower 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 Via adding a tactical element 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
 The method uses a shape change. 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.200
 On Independent Game Developers Day 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
 We learned to connect our thoughts 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 With data 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.840
 And learn how 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.640
 User interaction 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.440
 With changes. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.040
 Analytics has helped us recently 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 On the test card 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 New store data 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.160
 The number of game downloads increased 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.400
 By 25 percent. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 We are fully acquainted with 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480
 Platform features 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.320
 We were able to interact more 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.160
 With players. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.120
 We have now registered more than 200 thousand 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.920
 Download new and get us 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.720
 Editor's Choice Award. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.640
 My name is Yogi Aditya 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.560
 I am a technology officer at Niji Games 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.680
 In Yogyakarta. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.760
 Our goal was innovation 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.320
 Game puzzles distinct. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.760
 That was the most important. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000
 After several months, we invented 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280
 Game we enjoy playing 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.520
 We launched it on Google Play. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.720
 Cute Munchies 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 The admiration of everyone. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 I upgraded the number of downloads and got the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.920
 5 star ratings, but did not last 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.000
 Users in play. 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200
 Google taught us how to urge 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 Users to play more 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.320
 For a longer period. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
 Google explained to us how to apply 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.880
 The feature saves the progress level of the game 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.520
 And Google Play Games services. 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.440
 We tried to improve 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
 Store data cards and icons 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.440
 Downloads increased by 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.520
 93 percent well and profits 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.560
 By 51 percent. 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 The retention rate has improved 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 Since the first week. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720
 Now we think about the future 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 And by creating games 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 more developed. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.880
 My name is Vinh Nguyen 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.160
 I create games with my friends 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 For V-Games in Vietnam. 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.320
 Game innovation took 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.960
 Gungun two years. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.000
 We were inventing the game that 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.880
 We wanted to play it. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 But in the end 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
 We have not made any profits. 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.280
 We thought of innovation 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.960
 Another game, however 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.320
 We were relieved of failure. 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.080
 We decided to keep trying 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.360
 We did not accept failure. 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.720
 We met a Google consultant 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 He told us that our game was fantastic 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.520
 But we have made it in a way 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.320
 Ensures profitability. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.680
 We've added a bundle for premium users 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.200
 To buy additional features and let us buy 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.960
 Mobile vehicles and personalities 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 directly. 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.840
 Our earnings have increased automatically 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.760
 By 100 percent 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 One day. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.280
 We achieved second place 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 On the Play site. 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.080
 The enthusiasm of our staff helps us 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.800
 Always achieve 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 What we hope. 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.040
 We have masquerade amateurs and artists 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.640
 The company has a pleasant atmosphere 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.520
 We draw from them 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.640
 The philosophy of designing our games. 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120
 Do not worry if you are a freelance game developer 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.080
 If you try and persevere 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.000
 You'll find a way to succeed. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.880
 We are now players 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.520
 In a larger game. 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920
 The important thing is that we are still playing.
