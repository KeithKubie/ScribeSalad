00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.052
So thinking back to our slide triangle, we
know that 208 is not actually the length

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:09.270
of the slide that we're trying to find.
Instead, this is the square of that

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.335
length. In other words, we want to find
out which number, when multiplied by

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.081
itself, is equal to 208. Is this number
rational?
