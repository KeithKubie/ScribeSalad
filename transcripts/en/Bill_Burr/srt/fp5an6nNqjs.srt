1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,590
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Bur and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,750
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,650
Monday morning podcast and
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,050
What's going on now?
Why Ya? Um, I'm fucking,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,610
ah, I didn't want to get into
it. We're up to episode 10.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,740
I have no life. I'm trying to fucking,

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,760
and I'm trying to get in a quick workout
before I go to work because I am,

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,510
I'm fucking right back up to where I was
last year when I was like a buck 86 one

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,590
87. I am, I f you. It kills
me. I've been working out.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,510
Why do you walk out? You still put on, um,

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,290
you know, it is, it's late night. I'm
coming home. I'm eating like a fat chick,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,830
you know, meeting like some sad
fellow doesn't like himself.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,020
I just come home and I'm fucking fried.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,580
I get home at like seven o'clock
at night and I go, ah, fuck it.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,290
That's what I say. I get all
the way to my street going,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,290
I'm going to get a salad.
I've got to have a protein.

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm going to fucking eat the
bag of beans or whatever,

18
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,890
and then I just drive into my
driveway and I go, ah, fuck it. Right.

19
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:11,100
And I order a fucking
pizza or burger, you know,

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,260
or I have a beer or something like
that and MIH had, that's it. That's it.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,580
I go to my looks, I got them on my
fucking second trimester right now. Oh,

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,820
is this my wife the other day
and went to a fucking mall,

23
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,740
which is something I never do. Go
into a fucking mall. Right? You know,

24
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,830
people go to a malls, people
with children. I get it.
You get them out there,

25
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:36,660
they fucking watched the trolley go by
and you know Santa Claus is there. Right?

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,260
Just fucking sit there waiting for
you to put your kid in his lap.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,270
You fucking Weirdos, right? Hey,

28
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:46,560
let's keep the lie going to the point we
put our child in some fucking perverts

29
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:50,740
fucking lap. So they think he comes
down, the Goddamn Chimi Mija gets,

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,900
is there any wonder? So many people
end up in cars they don't want to be,

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,730
and that's, that's how you start out
their life. You know, some fucking dude,

32
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:03,720
we don't know, you know, don't really
talk to sort of Godlike, you know,

33
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,240
sort of culty right? Charlie Manson hair,

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,750
all fucking A's fucking coming
in and everything's cool.

35
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,350
You go sit in his fucking lap, but
don't talk to strangers. Right? I don't,

36
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,121
I don't fucking,

37
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm just so whenever we go to this
fucking thing and we're walking by the

38
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:22,590
fountain, right? There's a trolley and a
fountain. This is like the fucking gay,

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,000
his place you could ever go to. And I
don't mean gay in like the homophobic way.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,890
I mean, the way it used to mean
like the 1890s, the gay nineties,

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,310
as in, Oh my God, could a
decade get any happier? Right?

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,410
It was everything but fucking
showgirls coming down, you know,

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,280
like the end of the family guy song.
That was the only thing that was missing.

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,910
And it's, I just was like, what is
all the excitement? We're fucking,

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,970
everybody's here buying pants. Why
are we having a fucking parade?

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,830
You know? So I went in there and
I, I took her to go see the, uh,

47
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:03,190
the lives of pets, which I really
enjoyed. Cause you know, I'm a dog,

48
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,240
right? I love fucking dogs. And
you know what, I was curious,

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,900
what does my dog do when I leave?
Evidently they have quite the adventures.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,053
Yeah,

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,810
that was a fucking really
good movie. I liked it.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,720
And that was a bunch of kids in there
screaming and yelling and that's what I

53
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,100
wanted. You know what I mean? And
I went to the matinee show and,

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,760
and just have a bunch of
kids screaming and yeah,

55
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:25,730
I wanted the full effect of watching
that fucking movie. You know what I mean?

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,590
It's like when you go to a horror movie,

57
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,010
you gotta go see it and there's going
to be a bunch of people yelling at the

58
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:35,990
screen right at either that, that's
part of the fucking experience.

59
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,120
If you want to go see a movie, when
everybody shuts the fuck up, you know,

60
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,830
you got to do it in your house.

61
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,930
Maybe slap a few people around before
the movie starts, you know, set the tone.

62
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,340
Daddy ain't putting up with this
shit. All right. So anyways,

63
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:55,220
long story short and I dressed up a little
bit when I went down there. You know,

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,420
I've been working a lot, so
I'm going to take out my lady.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,770
So when we're walking out, we'll
go and buy the fountain, you know?

66
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,620
And there's like all, you know, like
the plane, like fucking Tony Bennett.

67
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:12,621
If I ruled the world every day would
be like the first day of spring.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,050
Every douche would have such a wonderful
song to sing. If I ruled the world,

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,180
what a wonderful world it would be.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,310
And everybody's just
sitting there mesmerized,

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,300
eaten this fucking ice cream
and shit. Yeah, bide pants.

72
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,750
It was fucking weird, man. It
was like, when you go to this,

73
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,780
you go to some of these fucking malls.
It's like you're in a Christmas special.

74
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,850
I'm telling you, I wouldn't be surprised
if they got a fucking Mesta right.

75
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,230
And they're putting some sorta like,

76
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:47,040
like little little dopamine in the air
and you get like this fucking high and

77
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,150
all of a sudden you're
like, you know what?

78
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:51,780
I already have fucking nine
pairs of pants. Uh, one more.

79
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,980
I'm in the double digits seven days
in the week. I want the overlap.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,870
I'm going to go over the bar line, right?
Like Vinny call Yoda in a pet's way.

81
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,933
Um,

82
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,973
okay.

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
So anyways, so I go, all
right, I'm, I'm gonna,

84
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,760
I don't know what had came over me. We
walked by the fountain. I said, I need,

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,550
let's get a picture.
She's like [inaudible] she
couldn't fucking believe it.

86
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,240
I was going to take a picture next
to, in front of a fountain at a mall.

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,820
This is not me behavior. Right?
Of course she's all over it.

88
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,150
Women love that tie. Oh my God.
That'd be so nice. Right. You just,

89
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,170
it just makes you want to start crying
like, oh, what happened to me? Right.

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,980
So all I want to do is take a fucking
selfie. Right, right. You know,

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
get up fucking heads in it.

92
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:39,520
My head taken up three quarters of it
cause it's so fucking big and some Douche

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
has to come along and be
like, oh, you will all,

94
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,190
we'll take the parish before you.
And I'm thinking, no, I want you to,

95
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,130
I don't want to prolong this moment.
You fucking asshole. Where's your guy?

96
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,550
Cold. Of course my wife goes, oh
my God, that would be great. Right?

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,310
So what does he do? He
fucking takes one. Oh,

98
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,330
let's get one more for
right. Takes another one.

99
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,150
Oh my God. And I look at this picture
in the fucking horror that I see.

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,873
Okay.

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,870
My fucking stomach pushing out the
bottom of my button down shirt.

102
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,680
And then when you really just know
you're just getting fat is that fucking

103
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,410
button right? Uh, right
on your breast plate.

104
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,390
It looks like it's doing the iron cross.

105
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,880
Just trying to hold both parts
of the shirt together. And uh,

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,450
I looked so fucking bad. I
almost got mad at my wife.

107
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,690
Like you letting me walk around
looking like that. It's like,

108
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,450
I get that you love me, but you know,
how about a little bit of tough love?

109
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,470
You know, how about a little,
hey, fatty cakes, you know,

110
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,800
you really going to have
waffles again this morning.

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,440
Exhibit a right? And you're bust
out a fucking photo you took of me.

112
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,000
Nothing will make you lose weight. Like
a bad fucking photo. Huh? Jesus Christ.

113
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,260
You know, it's bad enough when they
catch it in your own backyard, you know?

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,990
But I'll tell you, you
take a photo in public,

115
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:01,490
in front of a fucking fountain at a mall
that has a trolley while Tony Bennett's

116
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:05,390
playing. I mean, I'm glad I didn't
look at it until I got home.

117
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,830
I would've fucking jumped in 10 a sailors
dive right into the bottom of that

118
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,664
fountain.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,433
Okay?

120
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,670
Yeah. I'm too vain to kill
myself. I'll just hang around.

121
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:19,650
Make everybody else miserable. That's
what you do. That's what you do. Um,

122
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,240
oh, by the way, I w I finally, I
watched the, uh, the record of the, uh,

123
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,700
the British Grand Prix, um,

124
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,530
fascinating fucking race with all the
rain there who's gonna go in and change

125
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:34,590
the tires? Who's going to keep
going? And by fucking lap seven,

126
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:37,740
everybody changed their
fucking tires, right?

127
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,300
It kinda seems if you get Paul position,
you're basically going to win the race.

128
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,670
These guys are so good in the cars
are so equal. You can't, I don't have,

129
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,850
I've never seen nobody does this stroke,

130
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,820
a race thing where you're way in the back
and all of a sudden you know your past

131
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:54,600
three people and you do the
little Zz top fucking ole move.

132
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,470
You know, remember fucking movie. He's,

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,900
he goes by three cars that are all fucking
in line drafting each other and I've

134
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:05,400
watched enough NASCAR who has to scold
bearing the Harry Gant car, right?

135
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,050
Darrell Waltrip, Cale Yarborough.

136
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,590
I watched enough of that shit to know if
two people that draft and they're going

137
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,320
to slingshot around you, I'll tell you
what, not when Burt Reynolds is there,

138
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,350
I don't know what he did. Did
he take off his two pains,

139
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,750
stick his head out the window and
make himself a little more fucking

140
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,420
aerodynamic? Is that how he went
by three cars? I don't know.

141
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,610
Fastest chicken in the south. That
shit does not happen in Formula One.

142
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,520
If you're not one of the top three
fucking drivers of the Illuminati,

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,830
you're basically, as far as I can tell,

144
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,610
the five races I've ever watched
from star stat to finish,

145
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:41,760
you're not going to win
the Goddamn race, you know,

146
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,910
unless the two guys up front don't like
each other and they smash into each

147
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,380
other. Jesus Christ,

148
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,310
Louis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg
right at the end of the fucking race.

149
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:54,960
Lewis Hamilton wins it, right guys from
fucking England, everybody island man.

150
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,190
What? Everybody's going fucking
nuts and a, as I mentioned before,

151
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,680
those two don't like each other
though. He smashing into each other,

152
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:06,540
so in the end they always show the green
room afterwards, after somebody one and

153
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,810
okay.

154
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,690
It was just like they didn't
say one word to each other.

155
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,460
Fucking meow fellows.
They didn't say one five.

156
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,800
I think the fucking Todo Guy.

157
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,720
All I want to do and I wake up in the
morning is feel your ass. When he fell,

158
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,670
he fucking set the two of them down. He
goes, listen, you [inaudible] all right.

159
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,640
I know you went out there and
you watched stroke arrays.

160
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,930
I know you watch that Kenny Rogers
movie where he adopts the six kids,

161
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,960
but never really legally, and nobody
had a fucking problem with that.

162
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:42,680
I know you watch days at thunder.
All right? This ain't that.

163
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,000
This cost real fucking money. Stop
smashing into each other. All right?

164
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,290
Yeah,

165
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,780
no, I'll take you back to Germany and
I'll reopen the, I can't go that far. Uh,

166
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,190
Oh, the Germans, you know,
I'm telling you right now,

167
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:03,840
if you take out about 10 years of their
history, they're great people. Um,

168
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,460
anyway, you pick one wrong guy. That's
what's so scary about this fucking,

169
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,200
this election.

170
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,040
I think that they should make Trump
and Hillary both put on a Hitler mask.

171
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,921
Matt on the mask,

172
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:19,390
put on a Hitler fucking mustache
and whoever looks the closest,

173
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,620
you vote for the other person.

174
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,503
Okay?

175
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,390
You know what? The results may surprise
you. Somebody make a clickbait. Fucking,

176
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:32,310
I'm a clickbait fucking whatever the
hell you call the meme or the, the,

177
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,130
the, the fucking vine. You know,

178
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,600
we put both the presidential
candidates in a Hitler Mass,

179
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,750
a Hitler mustache. Why can't I talk
this morning and Hitler Mustache,

180
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,180
the results may surprise you.

181
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,550
Okay.

182
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,220
And just, you know, whoever you're for,
you just make the other person, I guess.

183
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,410
Yeah, I don't, I don't know how you, I
don't know how you bring that one home.

184
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,630
You know all you kids today. Oh, you
fucking internet superstars. You know,

185
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:00,230
I went into a place the other day to get
some lunch of fucking salad with some

186
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:04,700
chicken, right. Desperately trying to
fucking bring down the belly. You know,

187
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,530
fucking Moba Day is what it look like
right now. You know, shaved head,

188
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,610
fucking ghost, white body. You know,
there's a lot of blubber on me right now.

189
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,140
You know, if I was to swim in the ocean,
my biggest fear would not be sharks.

190
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,093
You know,

191
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,070
it'd be some hipsters out there fucking
whale hunting cause they thought,

192
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,800
you know, they were taking it back. Right.

193
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,950
Get fucking Harpoon there. Um,

194
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,510
okay.

195
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,890
The fuck was I talking about? Oh yeah.

196
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,920
So I went in to go get this fucking salad
and I'm standing there and there's a

197
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:38,600
guy in line wearing a fucking Versace
robe, gold, Versace robe. And slippers.

198
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
So I text my wife going, there's
a dude in here, you know? Yeah.

199
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,630
Do you want me to take a picture?
You gotta see this guy, right?

200
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:47,630
So I fucking take a picture of the
guy. And she was like, oh my God,

201
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,020
my friend knows that person.
He makes these vines, right?

202
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,970
So then I clicked on his youtube page
and the guys now, whatever Twitter page,

203
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,050
the guy's fucking hilarious
and I'm just sitting,

204
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,450
they go is this fucking guy?

205
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,960
He doesn't need to be in a writers room
while he's has his own fucking show.

206
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,230
And he gets to walk around his bath
robe and slippers all day making cooking

207
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:13,030
videos. God bless him. I don't
know what the point of all this is.

208
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,940
I think the point of all this is I need
to get back on elliptical soon so I

209
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,680
don't have a fucking heart
attack before I go to, uh,

210
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,660
I'm going to say the Middle East
before I go to the fucking, um,

211
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,810
go over to England. Uh, anyways, so yeah,

212
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,860
I gotta fucking knock this shit.

213
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,220
I gotta knock off this
podcast and then I have a,

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,793
okay.

215
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,950
Actually I have some people coming over
here because our kitchen's all fucked

216
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:40,580
up. You know what's wrong bill?
What's wrong with the kitchen? Oh,

217
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:43,430
I don't know whether you put on
the hot water or the cold water.

218
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,570
The hot water still comes out, you know,
problem. I fixed fucking nine times.

219
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,260
You've got to shut off the fucking
hot water. The handle comes off.

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,170
Cupboards are all falling apart, you know,

221
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,940
everything else in the
house is pretty much nice.

222
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,820
I probably shouldn't even say
that shit. So, um, I got this,

223
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,960
like the final fucking thing I
have to do. You know what I mean?

224
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,910
Cause I fixed up the rest of the house.

225
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,370
I'm hoping it's the final
fucking thing I have to do.

226
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,750
But if for the most part I
fixed up the rest of the house.

227
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,100
And so now like the kitchen has
become like this ice I saw, you know,

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,980
it'd be like if you bought a brand new
suit and they had these old shitty shoes,

229
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,620
you know, and people looked down and
they were just like, you know what,

230
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,970
I was going to get in
business with this guy,

231
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,560
but what the fuck is with
those shoes? See you.

232
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,940
What are you fucking Willy Loman
there? You fucking Willy Loman.

233
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,280
Um, so that nightmare project
is about ready to start.

234
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,750
People coming over today with
their ideas. I have an idea.

235
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,550
Like what if we just took
everything out and put new stuff in,

236
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,551
in the exact same place except for a
couple of things and it costs you fucking

237
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:51,950
three zillion dollars. How about that?

238
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,240
I could be rustic yet
modern yet postmodern,

239
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,390
but kind of our deco ish,

240
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,370
but doesn't compromise the
integrity of the structure.

241
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,603
All right,

242
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm signing up for that shit again.
Um, but you know what though,

243
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,870
you know that they can probably put
it into six weeks. In other words,

244
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,420
in about nine months, I think
it ought to be done breathing.

245
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,460
And a bunch of dust. I'll have
fucking, um, coal miner's daughter,

246
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,570
lung, whatever the fuck they
call it. I have no idea. Um,

247
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,710
we don't have any Goddamn, um, I
don't have any questions on this one.

248
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:33,560
And I also don't have any
advertising. You know,

249
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,900
I will do some advertising here. Uh,

250
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:40,901
Tuesday night I went back
to the troubadour and I saw
wheeler walker jr right.

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,400
You say it's over. Pack up your stuff.

252
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,990
Something, something you've had enough.

253
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,770
I'm that fuck you bitch.
You broke my heart.

254
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,400
Fuck you Franz. Tearing us apart.

255
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,860
Fuck your dog open. Never comes home.
I saw that guy fucking live, man.

256
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,080
It was what? I wonder
what a fun fucking show.

257
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm just great in the bands killer.

258
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,240
The Bass player actually plays in
one of my favorite fucking bands,

259
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,730
truth and salvage company.
He's on the road with them,

260
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,770
had a killer band and the dude comes out,

261
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,910
wheeler walker jr he fucking murdered
it. Absolutely fucking murdered it.

262
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,230
Um, I didn't know what to expect
when I went down there. You know,

263
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,600
when somebody goes down there, they're
doing funny songs. You're like, go,

264
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,950
I don't know what's gonna happen here.

265
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,570
Is this going to be like a one joke
song and then you fucking like still

266
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,700
standing there for another
45 minutes. It was,

267
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:38,600
it was great and he was fucking
hilarious in between songs,

268
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,740
his band or what the crowd,

269
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,980
what I'm saying is if you get a chance
to see wheeler walker jr he's coming to a

270
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:49,190
fucking club near you
theater near you arena.

271
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,650
Fucking a amphitheatre

272
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,700
a a car port. I don't know.

273
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,430
I'm trying to think of every
structure I can think of.

274
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,970
Definitely go out and see him. He's, he's,

275
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:04,670
he's absolutely worth the money
and uh, and the band sounds great.

276
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:09,050
And he had, uh, on another
band open up in front of him,

277
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,190
two ladies with guitars. They were
great just to fucking kill a show.

278
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,460
And I ran into a bunch of
comics when I was there,

279
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,530
ran into Doug Benson and all these other
guys. Look at me dropping names here,

280
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,510
dropping fucking names and I sat there
in the back of the club and I just drank

281
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,940
water all night cause I'm fucking fat.
All right. I'm not gonna lie to you.

282
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,270
I had one whiskey, you know,
you've got to have one. You know,

283
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,410
even John Wayne would have one, you know,

284
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,320
before he ate half a fucking
cow that he barely cooked.

285
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,870
Isn't that what happened to him? You
know, that's what, you know what happened?

286
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:42,950
All those guys back in the day,

287
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,370
they just kept eating red meat because
back then it was all about, Whoa,

288
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,620
you know, why would I eat hamburger
when I got steak at home? Right?

289
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,441
Isn't that what they said?

290
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,470
And weren't they literally talking about
food considering what most of them died

291
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,920
of? I know that was
about their ladies. Um,

292
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,480
but anyways, uh, back then, right,

293
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,110
if you will like a guys guy, you are
eating steak. If you were fucking,

294
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,240
if you were successful,

295
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,700
it was considered the highest
cut of fucking meat and all that.

296
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:15,570
You didn't realize it was tearing apart
your fucking guts and back then there's

297
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,770
no way you let another man fucking look
in your ass to make sure you weren't

298
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:24,060
going to die of ass cancer. Right?
There's no fucking way you could do that.

299
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,220
And then get on a horse
and call yourself a cowboy.

300
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,190
That's not what it was about. All right.

301
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,090
He kept eating steak then.
Yet when you, when you would,

302
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,490
your wife was done making the steak,

303
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,050
you fucking fucking wrapped it with the
frying pan. I said, clean it up, right?

304
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,750
Then you went over and you put butter
on the steak and then that was it.

305
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,380
And I think it was better for
the environment back then.

306
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,050
You know what I mean?
Women were being beaten,

307
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,610
so they were drinking themselves to death.

308
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:57,660
So they died earlier and guy's fucking
ate themselves to death. And you know,

309
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,130
people got out of the way and there
was only like fucking a couple billion

310
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:05,610
people on the planet. Now look at
everybody. Everybody's doing yoga.

311
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:09,750
Nobody's beating their wives, right?
Everybody's having a fucking salad.

312
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,050
And now there's seven and a half
billion people on the fucking planet.

313
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,500
You know? And I think it's high time
that we go back to the way it was,

314
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,120
you know, oh, whatever. We'll
let Hillary becomes president.

315
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,310
And at the end of her 48 year run,

316
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,760
then it goes back to
the fucking dark ages.

317
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,590
We go back to a feudal system,
the real one, you know,

318
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,650
where you're actually aware of what was
happening rather than now where it's

319
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,260
just banker's fucking silently sucking
the life out of the fucking middle cloud.

320
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,150
Jesus. Bill, you're going to get on a
fucking, you know, fucking kills me.

321
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,260
Bernie Sanders,

322
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,290
arguably the scientists from back to
the future fucking endorses Hillary

323
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,310
Clinton. Get it. Can
you fucking any of them?

324
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,520
Can any of them just fucking have a
point of view and just stick with it?

325
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,670
They're always like,
this is what I'm above.

326
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,880
You could vote for me because I'm
above this. Right. And then the second,

327
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:07,881
all of a sudden they start taking on
water or this or the thing that's working.

328
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,940
Speaking of water. Do you know
there's more shark attacks than ever

329
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,610
and they're doing fucking stories about
what should we do about this? It's like,

330
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:21,160
well, you know, you could not
swim in the ocean. You'd dumb con.

331
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,440
There's plenty of fucking, there's
plenty of lakes. You know what I mean?

332
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,210
You know, Shit, fill up your bathtub, you
know, have make a day in it, you know,

333
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,620
but a snorkel on it. Stare at your
balls. I mean, do whatever you gotta do,

334
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,730
but don't go in the fucking water. Right.

335
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,000
Why do you think there's more shark
attacks now? Well, two reasons. One,

336
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,790
there's more fucking people until
we're eating all the fucking fish.

337
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,870
So the menu is becoming more
limited. You know, back in the day,

338
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:51,510
shark could be like, oh look at that
fucking surfboard. Or Eh, you know,

339
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,670
like the fucking bore gets between my
teeth. It's not that that tougher mate.

340
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,970
You know, he's still in politeness.
And I had quote and I'll look at that,

341
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,710
the school of tuna, Toro, Toro, right?

342
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,340
I'm going to go over there
and fucking have some total.

343
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,820
All those options aren't there anymore.

344
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,760
And these people still go out there
and that boogie boards, right?

345
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,210
If you've got on a boogie board,
you're like a slider, like children,

346
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,900
children on Boogie boards. That's
like a slider now for a fucking shark.

347
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,960
And then you get to the a, you get
to the bigger people. You know,

348
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,410
I'll tell you right now how fat I am.

349
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,090
There's no fucking way
I would go out there.

350
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,920
They'd think I was a fucking sea lion,

351
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,960
an albino sea lion that got shunned
by the rest of the herd. You know,

352
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,020
is there anything worse than watching a
fucking animal on one of those animals

353
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,100
shows getting shunned by the
rest of the herd. You know,

354
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,110
animals are like super fucking racist.

355
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,990
I don't know what it is to second
somebody, a fucking albino.

356
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,600
They show a little bit a weakness. I mean,

357
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,510
they're really people and you
never hear Peter Bring that up.

358
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,423
Okay.

359
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,230
I mean sure they sit there and they talk
about how bad human beings are. Hey,

360
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,500
you know, guilty as charged.
You're looking at it. I'd be,

361
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,780
I've gone down to fucking
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

362
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,540
I've eaten their beatless
chicken. You know,

363
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,800
all walking around roided up like
McGuire and fucking Sosa fallen on their

364
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,580
fucking faces. Cause people like
the white meat more. You know,

365
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,700
I've eaten that shit
guilty's fucking charge.

366
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,090
But what they don't talk about
is how those fucking chickens,

367
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,240
if they were allowed to
keep their beaks, you know,

368
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,340
and not have chest so
big that they fell down,

369
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:27,760
they would be bullying the
fucking weak as hen, you know,

370
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,680
you don't deserve to have children, right.

371
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,790
Just go over and they'd pack her to
death and they never, you know, they go,

372
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,410
you know, that's just how they are.

373
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,660
Okay.

374
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,051
You know,

375
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:40,920
it's survival of the fittest and all
that shit and then all of a sudden human

376
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,960
beings start doing it, right.

377
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,370
Some fucking nerd gets thrown into a
locker and all of a sudden it's this

378
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,780
national fucking story.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,460
I think when human beings is going
to turn it around as the day,

380
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:57,120
we just admit that we're just a
bunch of fucking animals. You know?

381
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,320
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I just, I have not looked at any news.

382
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,110
I don't know what this fucking
Pokemon thing is about.

383
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:06,600
Everybody's talking about it. I
finally asked somebody at work,

384
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,280
I know that there's like,

385
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,990
okay,

386
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,830
I know it was a movie. I
know kids were in toward,

387
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,390
I guess just people running
around with their phones,

388
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:17,030
trying to find the pokemons to,

389
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,010
to capture them in the
middle of the fucking day.

390
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,550
We were in the writers room and these
kids ran up to this dumpster and it was

391
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:28,400
like a fucking Wednesday afternoon.
It's like, don't you have to go to work?

392
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,490
Shouldn't you be somewhere
right now? You know what I mean?

393
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,810
She'd be out there blaming
your parents for something. Um,

394
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,440
I don't know.

395
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,320
It's really making that pope Pokemon
things really making me feel old.

396
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,870
Okay.

397
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,250
Everybody like is going around.

398
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,890
A lot of people going around doing it
and then there's people watching people

399
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:47,341
doing it.

400
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:50,790
So it's like they're not doing anything
and then you're watching them doing

401
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,850
nothing. It's kind of
fucking weird, right?

402
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,400
It's like, I saw this thing
the other day, you know,

403
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:59,800
on roller coasters now that
some of the new roller coasters,

404
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,640
they're having people get on the roller
coaster and then you put on virtual

405
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:07,140
reality glasses, right? And it's like,

406
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:09,720
it's not enough to be on the roller
coaster and then you gotta be on the,

407
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,010
put the glasses on and you go up the
hill and then as you go over the top and

408
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,060
you had that big drop,

409
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,230
they make it feel as though you're
falling off of a building or something.

410
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,510
It's like, well, you know, you're
kind of doing that in real life.

411
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:26,330
Why don't you take them off and enjoy
it? I don't, you know what it is,

412
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,340
it's all of us just slowly but
surely working our way to robots,

413
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,420
you know, having a robot, mom and
dad and these fucking, you know,

414
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:38,660
I ran into some nerd the other day
that was into fucking robotics,

415
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,523
believe it or not.

416
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,570
Okay.

417
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,460
Did this benefit for a,

418
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,540
that tragedy there in Orlando, right?

419
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,440
Do you guys remember that tragedy or is
there have been 52 more fucking shooting

420
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:53,390
since then that people don't
even remember it. Right.

421
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,480
So we did a benefit for that and um,

422
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,640
okay,

423
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,940
I'm standing out in the alley afterwards
having a fucking cigar, right?

424
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,550
And this kid comes up, I call him a kid.

425
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:06,760
That means he was like 26 years old and
he was fucking talking about how he's

426
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,860
into robotics and all this type
of shit. And I was just like,

427
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:15,760
why are you doing that? What about
in way he wasn't in a robotics?

428
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,870
What the fuck was he into?

429
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,710
Okay.

430
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,410
It was into some shit that would just
basically gather information on the user

431
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,960
without the person really knowing
it. And it's just like, why?

432
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,930
Why are you doing that? You know? And
he's going, well, but blah, blah, blah,

433
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:28,351
blah, blah.

434
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:31,050
And I just kept hammering them with
the questions and hammer them with the

435
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:34,950
questions. And at the end of the day,
the only way he could defend what he,

436
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,190
what he was doing was he, he
basically said this, well, you know,

437
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,490
if I didn't do it, someone else
would right there. That's the devils.

438
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,470
That's the devil song right there.
Hi, how high? How if I didn't do it,

439
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:51,770
someone else would it does it
rhyme? Who gives a fuck? I hope.

440
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,330
Let's go fucking do something evil.
That's might've been the worst song ever.

441
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,410
If you have to justify your fucking
job by basically say, you know,

442
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,980
if I didn't do it, somebody
else would. What jobs are those

443
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,630
spying on people dealing drugs,

444
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,813
right?

445
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,680
Fucking, I don't know what
shooting porno, dropping bombs.

446
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,670
I mean, anytime. The only way to
justify your job is if I didn't do it,

447
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:24,990
somebody else would,
uh, you know, I dunno.

448
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,150
Okay.

449
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,620
But these fucking assholes
making these robots, man, they,

450
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:33,290
they're making them too good. I
used to do a bit about it. You know,

451
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,370
that basic, you know, I don't mind if
you make the fucking thing super smart.

452
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,490
Just don't have it be able to
run like fucking Bo Jackson,

453
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,630
which is what they're doing.

454
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,860
Cause they keep trying to improve it and
they're fucking competing with somebody

455
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,600
out some other con, uh, companies,

456
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:51,650
fucking robot and they're just making
the thing into the $6 million man.

457
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,030
It's like, guys, guys,

458
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,580
okay,

459
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,090
you're already stuck every fucking answer
to any question ever. And it between,

460
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:02,110
it's fucking non-existent. Metal fucking
ears, I guess. It has metal lists,

461
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,500
non-existent human years and now you're
going to be able to make it run a

462
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:10,240
fucking four 40 you know like this, this
thing knows the answers to everything.

463
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,883
Right.

464
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,710
You Know Anna, Anna can make the
fucking Seahawks secondary at that.

465
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,270
That's what the fuck you're building
and you don't think that that's going to

466
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:23,050
come back and bite us in the ass.
It knows the answer to everything.

467
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,650
So it basically knows how to do open heart
surgery and also how to load and fire

468
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:34,270
an AK 47 fly an f six stayed.

469
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,070
I mean it's limitless.

470
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,850
Like you remember those fucking action
movies where like the fucking, this the,

471
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,850
the hero, the movie. I don't care.

472
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,460
Kind of mode of transportation
of fucking boat and helicopter,

473
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,860
a motorcycle, this space shuttle.

474
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,980
This fucking guy knows how to use it.

475
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,880
No preflight, you just start
the fucking helicopter.

476
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,710
Ropy yanked the guts out of it. You know,

477
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,230
I took a ride in a fucking ace star
the other day and there's no fiber.

478
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,040
I wouldn't be able to figure out
how to fucking start that thing up.

479
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,561
I got over it. I got,

480
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:11,280
I got 120 hours flying a Robinson 22.

481
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:15,090
You stick me in an a star. It's
like, hey kids, a little help.

482
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,790
These fucking Rambo guys,
these Steven Seagal guys,

483
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:25,620
these muscles from Brussels
guys, Chuck Norris, right,

484
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,971
Eddie D's, all of them.

485
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,971
They just fucking ran up and could just
do it and used to always laugh going,

486
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:35,580
that's fucking bull. Anybody, you know,
if you had a boat, you'd just be like,

487
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,420
wow, what if, what do you know where the
fucking keys were? Just jumps right in.

488
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,650
The fucking keys are right there.

489
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,900
And he knows exactly where
the fucking throttle is.

490
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,530
He doesn't have to look around and get
his bearings like, hey, this is this.

491
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,950
That's that. He just fucking
jumps in like it's his boat.

492
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,120
And it always makes you laugh going, yeah,
that would never happen in real life.

493
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,060
Well, guess what? In 2016,
that's going to happen.

494
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,670
These fucking robots.

495
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,190
I don't know why they would be running
away and they're not going to be running

496
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:05,700
away from us. They're going to be
running after us. And, uh, you know,

497
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,190
they get sick of fucking
running, which why would they,

498
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,870
they don't have a respiratory system
as long as they're charged up like a

499
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,070
fucking Tesla. They're never gonna
stop, but it doesn't make a difference.

500
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,100
What mode of transportation,
what weapon is nearby?

501
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,100
That was another thing with those
action heroes, whatever. Fucking they,

502
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,700
they'd pick up a goddamn garden and hoe
and all of a sudden this spinning around

503
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,370
like Bruce Slick. It's like,
Jesus, we will you in band.

504
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,110
You when you were a major red too,

505
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,490
you went time to fucking
master all the martial arts.

506
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,330
Learn how to use not only
every mode of transportation,

507
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,080
every fucking aberration of that
fucking mode of transportation.

508
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,840
Is that the right word? You know,
every style of fucking boat.

509
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,400
I don't give a fuck if it's sailing.

510
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,330
If it's a submarine or
a fucking cruise ship,

511
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,830
you know how to get that fucking thing
going and to docket and tie it off all at

512
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:59,670
the same fucking time. Right?
These robots can do that,

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,310
but at least Rambo, at least ramble. Bled.

514
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,540
He had to take time to fucking sell
himself back up. These robots don't leave.

515
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:10,440
He completes. We can kill it.
The fucking robots don't bleed.

516
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,250
You know what I mean? And you know
these fucking nerds, you know,

517
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:17,730
back in the day you poured a Dixie Cup
of water on down their back, you know,

518
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,300
and they didn't do like a person lift
their shoulders up and go, all right,

519
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,900
they don't, they fucking short
circuit out and then they fall down.

520
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,110
So you know what these nerds are doing?
They're like, well, we can't have that.

521
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,130
You know, the competition's robot. If
you dump a little bit of water down,

522
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,000
it's back at shorts out and it goes
fucking a zillion dollars worth of

523
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,450
technology. You know, that they're making,

524
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,340
they're gonna make these
full fucking robots.

525
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,720
They're going to make them
be able to swim, right?

526
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,890
Do everything is going to be
just like that fucking movie.

527
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,650
Okay,

528
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,321
well that guy at all,

529
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,470
those fucking lady robots and he
was fucking them and shit, right?

530
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,980
And then the one kid gets locked in
the breezeway and he's screaming like,

531
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:57,520
I thought you loved me. And she
just goes away with the expression,

532
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,910
this look on her face. That's what
they're going to do. I guarantee,

533
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,960
I bet you right now, as I'm talking,

534
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,440
somebody somewhere is fucking a robot.

535
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,300
Yeah.

536
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,890
Then got the lab coat on and shit. So he
makes him feel like he's doing research

537
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,180
and there's a bunch of other scientists
watching him fucking the robot. Right.

538
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,020
And then afterwards he's going to give
the feedback. Oh No. You know what it is?

539
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,250
It's a fucking,

540
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,440
it's probably just some regular
person who has like Hep-c,

541
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,830
but can't afford that 1090 $5 a pill
to get rid of it or somebody's HIV

542
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:35,340
positive. So they go, hey man,
you want that fucking pill?

543
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,410
You got to come in here and
fuck this robot on film. Oh,

544
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:41,760
this is last thing I'll tell
you and I've got to go to work.

545
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:44,310
Did you fucking see, uh, have
you seen this? Evidently,

546
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,120
I don't know if this is fucking
true, but ever since Bentley,

547
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,220
the pharmaceutical lobbyists,
any states where weed is legal,

548
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,570
that going after, uh, the
legalization of weed because any,

549
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:57,760
any state where weed is legal, um,

550
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,100
the prescriptions go down. I
don't know if this is true,

551
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:05,310
but somebody told me it was and I
never looked up any information,

552
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:09,930
so I'm going to say it's true and I owe
a big apology to all the fucking weed

553
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:14,190
smokers out there. Evidently
you are right. Um, so anyways,

554
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,070
but I'm going to keep drinking. I'm too
far down this fucking road. All right.

555
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:17,791
I gotta get Outta here.

556
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,640
I gotta go to fucking work and knock
out this last fucking one for Christ's

557
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,940
sake. Um, that's the podcast should cons.

558
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,330
I will talk to you on a Thursday.
I'll check in on you. All right,

559
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:29,640
go fuck yourselves and
I'll see you Thursday.

560
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,870
[inaudible] when those
get to use it all to Cuba,

561
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,683
we have to

562
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,403
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

563
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,910
Hey, what's going on? It's bill.

564
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,480
And uh,

565
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,480
this is the Monday morning
podcast for the week of July 10th,

566
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,730
2008 is it July 10th? I have no idea. I
just got off a plane coming back from,

567
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,020
uh, from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. I flew us there.

568
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:48,800
I sat in seat 18 a and.

569
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,230
M there were two people
about, Oh, I dunno,

570
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,470
19 rows behind me talking really
loudly. You know, those people, they,

571
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:59,750
they laugh at everything that they
say and they never say anything funny.

572
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,750
Four hours of that shit for fucking hours
of that. People just going, you know,

573
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,460
how many hours are left on the
flight? I don't know. Four and a half.

574
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,580
[inaudible] he just start laughing.

575
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,560
It was fucking killing me was,

576
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,320
it was torture the whole
flight. I ended up, you know,

577
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,130
I ended up doing, I got a new battery
from my, uh, made of wood laptop,

578
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,510
so I was able to watch good fellas.

579
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,590
Song's able to drown her out for
a w how long has good fellas? Huh?

580
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,850
So like two hours long or
some shit. So I had that on.

581
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,770
I had Goodfellas on cranked
as high as I could, you know,

582
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,400
we did, but we won it. We were wise guys.

583
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,170
I had that fucking crank is high
as I could to try to drown out

584
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,080
this Widdicombe plus group of people.
I don't know. I, you know what I mean?

585
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:57,710
Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm so
fucking miserable, you know?

586
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:01,240
Am I so miserable that I actually need
something to be funny to laugh at it?

587
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,890
You know? I mean, I was sitting
there and the end of it trying,

588
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,950
you don't want to, and they
finally, you know, I actually,

589
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:09,530
I didn't even watch the end of and
end up good fellows. I hate when he's,

590
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,420
when he fucking becomes a Druggie, you
know what I mean? He just pisses me off,

591
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,650
you know? And then he, then he feels
like all, he feels like he's the victim,

592
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,000
you know, 6,000 bucks for a life of work.

593
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,350
He gives me six grand.

594
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,050
You're lucky you didn't fucking
blow your brains out right there.

595
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:28,820
He told you not to fuck with the drugs,

596
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,570
the exact fucking thing he told you
not to do. You went out and you did it.

597
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:37,250
And then he ends up going to jail
and dying in jail. You piece of shit.

598
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,830
I fucking hate at the beginning
of that movie is great,

599
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,170
right up through the was the Lewenza
fucking robbery. That movie is awesome.

600
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:48,470
And then the second is second,

601
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,100
he gets that co core and
that flopped house apartment.

602
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,750
And then he's got that retard
with the attitude though the girl,

603
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,330
they're the fucking babysit.
And I got to get my hat.

604
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,180
I Dunno. I Dunno. So anyway,
that's what I was doing.

605
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:10,181
I was fucking listening to that movie
on 10 Janice Lassie as though I had that

606
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,370
fucking blasting in my ears. One
of my ears is ringing right now.

607
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,210
I already have tinnitus in one ear from
playing drums years ago and fucking,

608
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,870
it's going to be ringing even more
because of these fucking idiots, man.

609
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,860
It's just, I dunno, does anybody, you
know, you got anybody who does that shit.

610
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,533
They just, you know,

611
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,440
they come walking up and you know the
only be sit standing there waiting for an

612
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,720
elevator and they just go, hey,
how you doing? You're like, good.

613
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,280
And they're like, Eh, good. Yeah.

614
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,990
You know, if you go to anybody
fucking Lou does that at work. Just

615
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,660
discreetly leave a book on self
confidence in their little cubicle area,

616
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:55,440
something, you know what I mean? People
either do that or though they sit,

617
00:35:55,441 --> 00:36:00,300
oh they hum songs. I think I already
joked about that about 28 podcasts ago,

618
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:03,630
but for those of you who are new to
my podcast, I used to work with a guy.

619
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,750
You have to work with someone who
uh, hums a tune that doesn't exist.

620
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,920
You know what I mean? Used
to walk around the office,

621
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,310
Eh,

622
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,260
boot or Doodoodoo

623
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:17,880
duty

624
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,120
all fucking day long. And I used to be
like, what the fuck? That's not a song.

625
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,020
Right. It's not a stuff sound like a
song when I hummed it. Yeah, exactly.

626
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:29,820
But that's a dead on rendition of
his fucking, you know, it just,

627
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,690
it went on forever.

628
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,830
Like one of those progressive
prog rock bands or Dave Matthews,

629
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,740
I saw him in concert and
fucking was this terrible.

630
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,710
Somebody hooked me up with
tickets and it was one of those,

631
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,620
those bands that you get after
fucking a song and a half.

632
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,370
And then there's a black guy playing
a fiddle, which is, which is weird,

633
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,410
you know, I usually like random
shit like that, you know,

634
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:53,730
like seeing a fat Asian, you know, just
don't see that too often. You know,

635
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:58,290
black guy playing a fiddle, you know,
she'll be like, she'll be, you know,

636
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,880
isn't that, but you think that he
would, he would do it the black guy way,

637
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,743
you know,

638
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,350
where all of a sudden he teaches white
people that have fiddle can actually be

639
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:10,320
cool as opposed to some, you know,

640
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,920
redneck instrument or a,

641
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,670
I guess in classical music it's cool.
But you know what I mean? I mean,

642
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,010
black people made happy birthdays,
make a cool sound, you know, cool song.

643
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,150
You'd pick it. You know? That's what I,

644
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,550
that's when I saw a black guy with a
fiddle. That's what I thought. Okay.

645
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,980
He's gonna, he's gonna,
he's gonna break it down.

646
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,090
I thought something was gonna happen and
he just was playing that skip to my loo

647
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,460
spin. Your partner ran to
a rat deck that that style.

648
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,620
I think the black guy who plays the
saxophone in the Dave Matthews band,

649
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,050
I bet he doesn't talk to the
black guy that plays the fiddle.

650
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,640
I bet he thinks she's a Cielo. Just
coming up some heavy show, you know,

651
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,790
motherfucker is bad enough. You'd
be playing a mother fucking violin.

652
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,570
You'd be doing that shit
every night in front.

653
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,960
All these motherfucking white people.
How do you think that makes me feel?

654
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,990
That was the worst impression of a black
saxophone player in a band that I don't

655
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,180
like, that I'll ever do,
but I don't give a fuck.

656
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:08,460
I let he just got off of Goddamn
playing, cut me some slack.

657
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:12,630
I listen to people laugh, you know? It
was like a nightmare fucking comedy show.

658
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,760
You know what I mean? Where
all of a sudden it didn't,

659
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:17,850
it didn't make sense anymore. Like
you just said anything like, Hey,

660
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,430
can I get up? I need to need to
go to the bathroom. Yeah. Okay.

661
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,070
All right. Anyways, let's get
on with the podcast here. Uh,

662
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,170
what do we got here? What
am I going to do this week?

663
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,250
And I'm going to start with the question.
It's not fucked in. I'm going to,

664
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,380
I want to height the
shit first. First of all,

665
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,490
I just got that the Improv in Pittsburgh,

666
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,060
unbelievable turnout and
99.9% of that has to go to a,

667
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,410
the Jim and Randy show on WTV.
Those guys totally hooked me up.

668
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,760
They let me come in on a Wednesday on a
Thursday and on a Friday I did like nine

669
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:55,480
hours a fucking radio with those guys
letting everybody know that I was going to

670
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:59,350
be over at the stacks, the
mall over there. And uh,

671
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:04,030
other than the fact that a couple people
got shot and one was murdered, um,

672
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:07,810
I think it was a good week over there
at the mall. Get an happen one week,

673
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,850
one night we were out drinking and uh,

674
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,660
all of a sudden we couldn't leave
the mall cause somebody got shot.

675
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,340
This is fucking unbelievable.
Stand within a stone stove.

676
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,490
We have a stone store, no pun
intended, a cold stone creamers.

677
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,060
That's not supposed to happen,
isn't it? When you, you know,

678
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,400
when you see a fid Rutgers,
right. I just don't,

679
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,220
I just don't associate that
with violence. But anyways,

680
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:34,240
I had a great week out there and I want
to thank all the guys over at a DV for

681
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:37,000
hooking me up and everybody
who came out to see me,

682
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm also once again to remind you,

683
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:44,620
I have a one hour special coming
out on comedy central August 23rd.

684
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,330
All right. Set your Tivo six
weeks ahead. For some reason,

685
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,950
my fucking CD comes out before the
special, which makes no sense to me,

686
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,770
but I believe that's in
stores on August 5th.

687
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,800
And then the DVD DVD comes
out I think September 14th.

688
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,710
I know, it's bizarre. You guys are
going to be sick of me by mid September,

689
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,900
but anyways, please check it out.

690
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:11,020
I'm really proud of this special
we shot at ourselves. Uh,

691
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,830
tell your friends to
watch it and uh, whatever.

692
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,820
Hopefully they become fans of what I do
and then they show up at my shows and

693
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,770
someday I can afford
to take a private jet,

694
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,990
or at the very least set up in first class
where I can afford those Bose headset

695
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,910
where I can drown out people if they
fucking, uh, uh, laughing about shit.

696
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:34,480
That isn't funny. All right, let's
get on with the podcast questions.

697
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:38,260
If you new to my podcast, this is
what I do every week. I babble.

698
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,140
I bitch about people in
airports. I answer questions.

699
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,730
I riff about the Dave Matthews band
and I hide my shit. I'm, no, I don't,

700
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,410
I don't riff about the Dave Matthews Fan.

701
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,370
I don't even know any of these
fucking songs. I just know, uh,

702
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,210
I know crash into you. Yeah, they,

703
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,030
they, um, and then I come into you,

704
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,180
he really is like disgusting lyrics
when you really think about it,

705
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,850
but he thinks he thinks of nicely.

706
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,090
I don't like that little James
Brown fucking Jig. He does either.

707
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:11,800
When he's sitting in
with his Acoustic Guitar,

708
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,820
I never really noticed how much I
didn't like that, man. You know what?

709
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:16,930
I'm going to have to think about this.

710
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,050
I'm going to get back if you have
to get back to you guys on this one.

711
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,540
Listening. I'm stuttering. I'm so
fucking annoyed from that flight.

712
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,640
Maybe I'm really just pissed at
the people on the plane and uh,

713
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,450
I'm taking it out of the Dave Matthews
band. Misdirected anger. All right,

714
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,980
let's get into the questions here. People.

715
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,990
I got to make this one a quick one cause
I got a bunch of bull shit I gotta do

716
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,220
today and one of them is the fix my
attitude. All right, question number one,

717
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,470
Bill. Um, I have a question for you
podcast. Why don't you just ask it? Okay.

718
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,080
That's like, people go, let me
tell you something. He said,

719
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,900
he's just fucking saying it. I
said, I think I do that. All right.

720
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:54,230
I have a question for you. Podcast.
Being a comic from New York City,

721
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,980
which coast do you think is best
for stand up comedy? First of all,

722
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,130
I am not a comic from New York
City. I'm a comic from Boston,

723
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:05,840
Massachusetts who then moved
to New York City. I'm okay.

724
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,360
Uh, I will. What's the question?

725
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:13,310
Which coast do I think is
best for standup comedy? Uh,

726
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,120
Christ. I don't know. I ain't go,

727
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:20,270
how's that for fucking a bad
answer? Um, New York City,

728
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,010
if you just want to become a great comic,

729
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:25,790
there's nothing better than New York
City. It's gotten like 9 million clubs.

730
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,170
He can do like 10 sets a night. If
you want. Not 10, you could do 10.

731
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,110
But I think realistically
you do seven or eight.

732
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:36,050
Once you ran with all the clubs,
at least you could back in the day.

733
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,960
Just keep digressing with
everything I'm saying.

734
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:41,750
So I would say New York was
great. And then there's other,

735
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,830
other cities that are good to start
out in, which is, uh, Boston was great.

736
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,520
Houston's always have a good
scene. Denver, San Francisco,

737
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,990
Seattle's bunch of funny guys there.
Minnesota's got a great scene.

738
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,530
Um, yeah. You know what I mean? I worked
in Atlanta. I don't know if you funny,

739
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:01,760
just get your shit together,

740
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:06,290
but I guess you're asking me should you
move to New York City or la? Um, you,

741
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,960
I would visit both places before
you went out there because, uh,

742
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,481
I don't know,

743
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:15,230
New York City just felt like home when
I went there and when I went to La,

744
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,860
you know, the weather was
great and everything was
cool, but it was a, you know,

745
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,900
I stood in line for
fucking nine hours to do a,

746
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,910
a to sign up for a three minute spot at
the laugh factory and he had a fucking

747
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:31,214
sunburn.

748
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,210
I got there at nine in the morning for
a sign up that was at six at night.

749
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,540
This is no bullshit, right. Sat
right there on sunset avenue.

750
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,920
They take you guys down, memory
lane, some sitting there and uh,

751
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,880
I just remember there was these
two fat chicks and fucking Utah,

752
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:48,800
something that had really bad tattoos.

753
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:53,540
I was third in line by nine in the
morning. That's all I remember. And uh,

754
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,770
yeah, I, and then I wasn't
down there with anybody else,

755
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:01,580
so I couldn't leave other than
quickly to go take a bathroom break.

756
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:04,640
Like there was literally a whole system.
It was a fucking nightmare. Right.

757
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,320
Ended up getting a sunburn right
on my huge forehead and uh,

758
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,820
went home after I signed up,
it's six, went back to the kids,

759
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,830
a problem where I was staying,
showered really quickly,

760
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:19,520
came back down and had to do
three minutes of stand up,

761
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,910
which is practically impossible.
You know what I mean?

762
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,690
That's like trying to finish a bowl of
cereal and like two scoops, you know.

763
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,690
So I went down there and I don't
know how the fuck I did it,

764
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:34,691
but I went on stage and I absolutely
fucking destroyed for three minutes.

765
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,090
I did a tight three minutes
set that had a beginning,

766
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,600
a middle and an end probably cause I
only had like a half hour of material.

767
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,740
I knew I figured out how to do it. So
I'm sitting there going like, Oh man,

768
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,950
I got off stage. I was like,
that's it. I'm in at this club.

769
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,520
I'm going to get a manager. This is,
you know, everything's going to happen.

770
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,740
And then I went upstairs and uh,

771
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,250
I met the infamous Jamie Masada
who calls everybody body.

772
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,670
So I'm sitting there and he had his
table and I sit down at his table.

773
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,010
I'm thinking, this guy is just
going to kiss my ass. You know,

774
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm some young buck. I went up there
fucking destroyed. I was better than,

775
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,170
you know, the two fat chicks from
Utah. This is it. It's over, right?

776
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,110
So I sit down, you know,

777
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,960
my ego's through the fucking
roof and he's just like,

778
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,870
I don't mean he set this
stared at me for a second.

779
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:29,760
He had his hands together like
not in a fist, but sort of like a,

780
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:31,920
he's doing the church and
the steeple thing set.

781
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,150
All these things are up and he had his
index fingers up on his mouth and he just

782
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:40,830
goes, you're very funny. And I was
like, oh, thank you very much. I'm like,

783
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,860
okay, here comes sit, comes here comes,
he's going to have to manage me. Right?

784
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,820
And he's like, uh, you
know, you, you, you talk,

785
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,750
you talk a lot about [inaudible]
about your father. Yeah. I go, yeah,

786
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,620
yeah. You, and he said, you should
do more. You should do mono, buts,

787
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,720
do modal Butts, your father. And I'm
like, Oh yeah, yeah. You know, I,

788
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:03,210
I got a ton of stuff about my dad.
I got some more stuff about my mom.

789
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,020
And as I'm saying that, he holds
my, his hand up to silence me,

790
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,060
at which point I literally shut the
fuck up and he just goes, you'll father,

791
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,240
let me ask you a question.

792
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,200
How does it make you feel
when your father yells?

793
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,820
And then he leaned back in his
chair, right? And it was like,

794
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,080
I felt like he was gonna
give me the answer.

795
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,610
So all my standup questions
in the form of a riddle,

796
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,940
and immediately I,

797
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:40,570
I began grabbing the legs on the back of
the chair because I was going to smash

798
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:45,300
it over his fucking head because I was
so fucked. I was so pissed. I was like,

799
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:45,540
you gotta be,

800
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,940
I just fucking killed for three minutes
and now you're going to act like you're

801
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:52,170
this standup Guru, you Jack Ass.
And that's exactly what he did.

802
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,580
He didn't ask to manage me.

803
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,690
He just gave me a little, how does it
make you feel when your dad yells, Jamie,

804
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:03,210
I hope you listen to this cause
I'm playing you club this week.

805
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,050
How do you think it made me feel?
Made me feel like, let me feel sad.

806
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,470
Is that what you wanted
to hear? Jesus Christ.

807
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:12,270
This guy came at me
like one of those guys.

808
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,110
You ever see those interviews when they
interview somebody after like a tornado

809
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:19,230
hit their house and killed
their favorite dog, you know,

810
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,240
and they sitting there interviewing them
and they want them to cry and then not

811
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,600
clients. And then they gotta ask.

812
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,710
They gotta sit there and
ask them questions to try
and make them fucking cry.

813
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,310
I think that's what he
was trying to do to me.

814
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,480
So I literally was grabbing the back
of the chair, the legs on the back.

815
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:39,310
I distinctly remember doing that and
I was like, fuck this guy. Fuck La.

816
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,550
I'm going to New York. That's
how I ended up in New York.

817
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,410
One three minutes set after
nine hours in a second degree,

818
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,670
sunburn on my forehead.

819
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,780
I decided that the east coast
was the place I needed to be.

820
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,590
You know what I mean? And a, you
know, I worked out well for me.

821
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,690
You know what? You know it's funny.

822
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,500
Somebody who's probably gonna fucking
tell Jamie than I actually said that shit

823
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,180
just so they can try and get a
three minute audition on Tuesdays.

824
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:08,110
So this week when I go down there,
Jamie's going to be like, buddy Bobby,

825
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,530
what do you, what are you doing
buddy? I actually love Jamie now man.

826
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,720
And I'm not kissing his ass
either cause I don't give a fuck.

827
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,750
But he said the funniest shit to me the
like three weeks ago I'm working as club

828
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,130
and I'm standing in the lobby
and these two gorgeous girls,

829
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,120
you know la to fucking gorgeous.
So I'm looking at him, you know,

830
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,560
I'm bugging out of my head and
Jamie's like, buddy, buddy, buddy.

831
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:35,410
Well what are you doing man? What
do you, what? What do you like?

832
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:37,480
What do you mind? I go, what do
you mean? What am I doing? My Go,

833
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,250
I'm looking at the girls. He
goes, yeah buddy, but what? Why?

834
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:46,120
Why are you looking at the girls? I
go, cause they're beautiful. I go,

835
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:49,390
why wouldn't I be looking at the
girls? And he goes, cause you're a fag.

836
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,360
I think I butchered that. He said
it even better. It was the fucking,

837
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,460
he said he totally set me up, son
of a bitch. And if you live in La,

838
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,770
I'm going to be down there
Tuesday night, Thursday night,

839
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,270
Friday night and Saturday night,

840
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:08,410
all on the 10 o'clock show and I'll be
having a good time down there. All right.

841
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,810
So there you go. See that? I Trust Jamie.

842
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,580
Then I tell a funny story where he trashes
me and then I hype his club and then

843
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:18,970
it's all good. Huh? Who the fuck's in
show business? I am. I know how to do it.

844
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,840
I know how to escape the fucking line.
All right, so that's what I would do,

845
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,460
son. I would,

846
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,760
I would go to New York and La and
figure out which one you want to be in.

847
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,880
All right. That's it. All
right. Question number three.

848
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,740
Have you ever had any thoughts about
doing a European tour of your show?

849
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,070
Absolutely. I feel that
I'm in conspiracy theory.

850
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,420
I feel like they're crashing the
dollar and all these corporations,

851
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,150
they're all going global, so
I'm going global with them.

852
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,830
I'm not going to be caught flat footed
with a pocket full of currency that isn't

853
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:52,180
worth the Goddamn peso.

854
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,530
So I'm actually setting up a European
tour for the beginning part of next year,

855
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,260
or at some point in 2009, I should say
I'm going to go over to England, Sweden.

856
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,920
Uh, I did some shit one time
in, uh, the Netherlands.

857
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,880
It's really disappointing when I went to
no Netherlands when I got off the plane

858
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,390
and the first thing I saw was
like a fucking Dunkin donuts,

859
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,290
you know what I mean? And like a
McDonald's, it just, it just really is a,

860
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,480
I understand why people find America so
annoying is because the urban sprawl of

861
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,330
our fucking corporations,
you know what I mean?

862
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:28,670
I literally think that I
could to like fucking Ah,

863
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,823
let me pick a movie.

864
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,740
Pick a fucking nice obscure country that
I don't even know where it is on a map.

865
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,770
Let me think of something. Bosnia. No,

866
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,400
I know why that's fucking eastern Europe,

867
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,790
Olivia and it was one of those
blah blah. That's in South America.

868
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,560
Whatever you go to fucking Bolivia.

869
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,430
You think going to go down there and
see that fucking that guy from the tee

870
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:54,020
shirt that everybody wears
che go viral, Gutierrez,

871
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:58,250
whatever his name is. Balance
Way Ala that fucking guy.

872
00:50:58,251 --> 00:50:59,450
And you'd go down and
he'd get off the list.

873
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:02,570
The first thing you see Carl Sanders
on a big bucket of fucking chicken.

874
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,090
I think that's what you go chop is
his big fucking, I love that guy, man.

875
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,260
That guy is the shit. You
know what I mean? Those guys,

876
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:16,280
they remind me like Tony
Montana, that's what you go.

877
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:20,390
Chavez is stupid Chavez taken on the u s
knowing full well that we could fucking

878
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,380
Newcomb anytime we wanted to
talk and shit about us at the UN.

879
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:28,280
He's like in his early Tony
Montana years, you know, um,

880
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,860
for Jesus Christ is on annoying.
Even as early Tony Montana years,

881
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:36,740
like right before he a, he gets the, uh,

882
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,100
the Cadillac with the leopard
skin. You know what I mean?

883
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:41,660
When he's still washing dishes with that,

884
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,960
that fucking Robin
Williams Hawaiian shirt.

885
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,090
That's what Hugo Chavez is right
now. All right, question number four.

886
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:52,790
This is very, a little jet
lag here. People, sorry,

887
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:55,580
let me fucking blow through these and
they'll stop wasting your time. All right,

888
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,180
question. I'm a for a, Oh
God. This one has a backstory.

889
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,030
Yesterday I attempted to renew
my Norton Antivirus. I'm like,

890
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:05,840
I want me to sing a song about Microsoft.
I can't, I can't remix this songs,

891
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,140
dude. Unless they have a song. You
know what I mean? You gotta, you gotta,

892
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,070
you gotta pick one. You gotta
pick a product that annoys you,

893
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:14,210
that actually has a song,

894
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:18,500
and I will do a fucking puff daddy remix
of it that has the word continent and

895
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,470
it'll make you feel better. All right?
All right, question number five.

896
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,330
Hey Bill, here's a question.

897
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:26,240
Have you ever had people bring
their kids to your shows?

898
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,130
And I'm not talking 18 years old. I
mean like five years old. Absolutely.

899
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,660
I've had people bring babies and I've
been in the middle of talking about

900
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,100
something really, uh,

901
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:41,690
I don't know evil talking about going
to a titty bar and now I hate that,

902
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,390
you know, regular girls go
to titty bars now, you know,

903
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:46,520
cause they killed the
perverted vibe of the club.

904
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,160
I was doing that bit talking about how
strip clubs are for horizontally and then

905
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:56,420
I can feel comfortable leering at a
stripper when I'm sitting next to Melissa,

906
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,480
you know, doing that joke and all
of a sudden you just hear this baby

907
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,750
babies that's crying in the back
and then it, you know, something,

908
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:10,850
it's even more awkward when they
bring a kid that can speak, you know,

909
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,380
why don't I just say a five,

910
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:17,000
five years old or over rather than having
you guys picture mutes or something.

911
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,280
Yeah. I've actually, I've
had people bring kids,

912
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm trying to think and
hasn't happened in a while.

913
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,800
There was a girl this week in Pittsburgh.
She laughed like a little kid,

914
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,290
so it was weird. She
sounded like a little kid,

915
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,990
so it was freaking all the comics out.

916
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,700
And then it turned out
she wasn't a little kid.

917
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:38,040
She was just an adult with
a really annoying voice.

918
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:42,900
And then she came up to me afterwards and
she had these huge titties and she was

919
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,710
saying, come on down to plush, which
is some strip club in Pittsburgh.

920
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,610
And she had that classic,
a Anna Nicole Smith.

921
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,930
I'm going to overdose in
a hard rock cafe voice.

922
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,070
So if she's listening, I
hope you're still alive.

923
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,900
He didn't. Oh d that I had
to tell you that story.

924
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,540
I played the same hard rock cafe,

925
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,680
the fucking in and Nicole Smith died in
and I gotta tell you something that's

926
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,070
been there for three fucking days. I
get it. I think she killed herself.

927
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,370
I don't think it was an overdose.
I think you know an accidental,

928
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:21,720
I think she did it on purpose because
a, that place sucks. All right,

929
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,950
question number seven, Bill.

930
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,390
I recently went to an open mic at my
local comedy club the first time just to

931
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:30,570
watch the club, just
to watch Jesus Christ.

932
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,720
Nobody puts capital letters
anymore or punctuation.

933
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:36,600
I just went right to
the next sentence. Bill.

934
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,770
I recently went to open mic night and
my local comedy club for the first time

935
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:45,360
just to watch the club only has
open mic night once a month,

936
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,320
which is gay, but I can't
do anything about it anyway.

937
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,460
I figure most of the, most of the
comments that got up with suck and bomb,

938
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,590
maybe a few would do okay.

939
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:58,980
But there were about 14 and 13 of
them ended up doing really well.

940
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:02,880
This was discouraging to me because I
figured most open micros would suck,

941
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,170
which would make me feel better
about myself and my comedy. Comedy.

942
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,130
Is this how open Mike was for you? Please
share your wisdom with me. Alright.

943
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,070
I'll show you my stories. Wisdoms
going a little too far. Yeah,

944
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:15,904
that's what it's like.

945
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,790
You go down there and there's people who
are still doing open mics, but they're,

946
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,210
they're better than being
open micros at that point. Um,

947
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,560
but they still need the stage time
and uh, you know, sometimes you know,

948
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,280
features and sometimes even a headline
on my drop and that's Kinda how it is.

949
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,170
And uh, yeah, your first few
open Mike. So lonely, but uh,

950
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,950
you just got to see the humor and it just
go up there the first time you do it.

951
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:44,420
It's not even about doing well whether it,

952
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,950
you don't judge it whether
you did good or bad.

953
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,910
The first time you go on stage is just
all about having the balls to go up there

954
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,420
when they call your name, you know, and
if you have the balls to go up there,

955
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:55,800
then you know,

956
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,060
you got more balls than 95%
of people in that situation.

957
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:03,420
So just take that as a victory tape.

958
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:06,510
You said keep it, you know,

959
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,180
lock it away in a safe and then
some day when you're good at it,

960
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:13,560
you can take it out and just laugh
your ass off at the shit that you,

961
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,520
that the, the shit that you attempted.
I wish I'd take my first one. I did.

962
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,400
I mean just to give you,
to make you feel better.

963
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:23,380
I was supposed to do five minutes.
I think I did about three.

964
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,440
I walked up there and the
second I saw the microphone,

965
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,240
I forgot everything I was going to say.

966
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,340
And I started in the middle of the shift
that I wanted to say and then brought

967
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,100
it back around to the front kind of,

968
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,690
I followed the same pattern of pulp
fiction. You know what I mean? Well,

969
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,090
they start with that. Oh
you mother fuckers get on
the ground on that bullshit.

970
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,580
And then he goes to the
beginning and then fucking,

971
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:48,250
you end up seeing that scene. Oh,
like Goodfellas. Same fucking thing.

972
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,200
That's how I, that's how
my first stand up set went.

973
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,730
Except unlike those awesome
movies. Mine was terrible.

974
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,040
So just picture, if they
was that the happening,

975
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:04,630
if m m night Shambhala Ama
Dingdong made that fucking movie,

976
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:08,650
the way they made pulp fiction that,
you know, that's the way my friend,

977
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:11,140
I'm trying to tell you, my first
set sucks, so don't worry about it.

978
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,110
Don't worry about it. Just go
up there and this. I get it.

979
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,770
You got to find the humor and bombing.
There's nothing funny than bombing.

980
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:18,820
It's fucking hilarious.

981
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,530
It's just something undeniably funny
about standing in front of a room full of

982
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,990
people and just putting it out there.

983
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,710
Especially if you're high energy and
you and your joke fucking bad at bat and

984
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:36,200
everybody's just fucking staring
at you this. Yeah. You just,

985
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,650
just, there's no other way to describe
what a fucking tool you feel like,

986
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:46,330
but everybody's been there, you
know, bring some water up there.

987
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,000
You're going to get dry mouth. All
right. And just, just do it, man. It's,

988
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:53,530
you know, you'll be fine. You'll be
fine. Fuck it. Alright, last question.

989
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,190
All right. Yes. It's actually a story, um,

990
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,830
which I actually find really
interesting. Kay. Hey Bill. And on,

991
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:02,860
what the fuck happened? My email last
week, a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

992
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,170
All right, here we go. Okay.
A lot of damage related.

993
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:11,020
This is a real fucking long one. Let me
try to get to the meat of this thing.

994
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,480
Um, okay. This is an auto
damage related story. All right.

995
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:21,040
I must preface this story with the fact
that I find it very difficult to contain

996
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,180
my temper already.

997
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:26,170
I like this story with even I really
difficult to contain my temper with even

998
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,460
the most meaningless shit,

999
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,620
such as stubbing my toe or getting
cut off while driving. Anyways,

1000
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:33,490
uh,

1001
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:38,490
when something of actual meaning happens
to me having something of mine stolen,

1002
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,680
let's say I really lose
my shit. All right.

1003
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:45,370
A few months ago I had an expensive set
of knives missing from my kitchen and I

1004
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:49,240
flew into a rage through
deductive reasoning.

1005
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:52,930
I concluded it must've been
stolen by one of two people.

1006
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,820
Now listen to the descriptions. You
can guess where this story's going. Uh,

1007
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:02,230
it was either a, the sketchy
Jewish kid who lived upstairs,

1008
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,880
or B, the Mexican
repairment who still had a,

1009
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,860
had a key since I just moved in. Well,

1010
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:16,090
the reasoning part of my tamper
tantrum was taking place.

1011
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:21,120
A few racial slurs may have slipped
out and as one made to Deuce,

1012
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,350
a temper tantrum is often accompanied
by loud screaming, oh, that's great.

1013
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,010
They're okay. The screaming is
most often followed by regret,

1014
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:33,680
usually concluding with
embarrassment. Anyhow,

1015
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:35,540
the following day I went out to my car,

1016
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:39,380
which was parked out front to
gather some belongings in the trunk.

1017
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:40,760
When I got to my car,

1018
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,330
I noticed that some thoughtful neighbor
who obviously heard my screaming the day

1019
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:51,020
before notched a large swastika
in the center rear of my car.

1020
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,020
After a few moments of
careful contemplation,

1021
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,730
I left and decided to keep it
there for shameful posterity.

1022
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,760
This swastika remains as a
painful reminder for me to
get a handle on my anger.

1023
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,000
The steak knives were never
found. All right. You know what,

1024
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:15,410
I find that fucking really
to be an interesting story
because the guy actually,

1025
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,550
he seems like, you know, he's trying
to improve himself as a person.

1026
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:25,400
You know, he knows he has a temper
and he knows what he did was wrong.

1027
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:27,740
And uh, I would, this is a
question I have for you guys.

1028
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,910
If somebody flies in cause you know,
they're, they always say that, you know,

1029
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,710
I dunno like your, your real
thoughts come out in anger.

1030
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:41,330
I don't know if I like 100 a
hundred percent believe that.

1031
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,340
I think when you get angry sometimes
it isn't like you have this deep seated

1032
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:51,170
hate. Sometimes it just, it just
trying to hurt the other person.

1033
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:54,260
You know, like they get mad at some
you fucking cock sucker. I mean,

1034
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:57,620
do you really think that they're out
there sucking dick? You know what I mean?

1035
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:03,010
But then he got the other side is all
of a sudden when somebody goes into the,

1036
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,750
in the actually, you know,

1037
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,050
racial slurs that's like above
and beyond. I don't know. I don't,

1038
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,120
I dunno about that one dude. I,
that's what I'm asking is, you know,

1039
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:17,630
like if somebody, if somebody gets mad
at me, yeah, you fucking Dick. Like,

1040
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:19,340
I don't think that they
really think I'm a dick.

1041
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:22,080
I think that they're mad at me and
they called me a dick. Now there's,

1042
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,880
does anybody think that it's possible?
Because this guy seemed like good dude,

1043
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:30,590
he left this, wants to go on it. He
realized, all right, I'm a fucking ass on.

1044
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:35,090
I gotta you know, keep my temper
in check. Does anybody think,

1045
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,710
is it possible? That's what I
want to know to lose your shit.

1046
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,890
And you start yelling racial slurs and
you still stick it in the same category

1047
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:50,000
of like, I was just mad. It's he
just calling, just calling, you know?

1048
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,080
I Dunno. I don't fucking know
work. You know what, be thankful.

1049
01:01:56,081 --> 01:02:00,440
You're not famous. You know what I
mean? You would ended up like a Kramer.

1050
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,390
You wouldn't have to go on a, actually,

1051
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,970
you wouldn't have gone on Al Sharpton
show you where I had to go on. Uh,

1052
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,290
Jesus Christ, who's a
Jewish guy with a bad perm

1053
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,800
to a Mexican guy with a bad perm.

1054
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,580
You know how shocked would do a lot more
for his credibility if you would really

1055
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,530
get rid of that pimp haircut.
You know what I mean?

1056
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,130
I always felt he looked
like boss hog. Like if,

1057
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,680
if they ever did like the black boss
Hog, you know what I mean? Need all that.

1058
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,890
So that's like the hacky thing to do
in Hollywood. Like once you write it,

1059
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,870
ideas, you just take, you
know, a sitcom like it's Alice,

1060
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,670
but it's black. And then it'll was,

1061
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,880
I didn't know what the fuck I'm
talking about this point. Anyways,

1062
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,520
I got shit to do here. Okay.

1063
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,300
There's a long ass podcast as always a
once again thanks to everybody came out

1064

fucking unbelievable. I couldn't,

1065
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,940

18 people, so I really appreciate it.

1066
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,680
And um, I got the comedy

1072
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,780
I think I'm doing umass Amherst
with Charlie Murphy and uh,

1073
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,130
I think that's about it.
But anyways, everybody, uh,

1074
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,600

you miss last week's podcast,

1077
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:38,040

thing. It's entitled thank you.

1078
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,670
Cause this is what that lady was yelling
at me after every fucking punchline.

1079
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,560
And, uh, I'll be adding another one.

1080
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:48,350
Just come stop putting random
shit up from shows that I do. Uh,

1081
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,760
people seem to enjoy it and
it's a way to make you laugh,

1082
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:55,260
show you some new standup without
burning any bits. So, uh, so that's it.

1083
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,070
Once again, thanks to everybody, uh,
