00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.779
Humans have been playing sports for thousands
of years, with injuries and sometimes even

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.200
death being expected.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.559
But when we look at the physical consequences
modern athletes endure, what is the most dangerous

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.629
sport in the world?

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.350
If we simply look at who gets injured the
most often, US hospital data - collected by

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.180
the CPSC in 2016 - found that for males, football
and soccer cause a significant proportion

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
of injuries, while for women, soccer and baseball
almost top the list.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.310
But the number one sport for both sexes was
basketball, with 190,453 injuries for men

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.160
and 34,707 for women.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.730
A study of injuries among NBA athletes over
a 17 year period found that lateral ankle

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.829
sprains were the most common, while a separate
study found that those who wore shoes with

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.260
air cells in the heel were 4.3 times more
likely to injure their ankle - so you might

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.940
want to ditch your Nike airs.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.070
But minor injuries can happen for any sport
and hardly deserve the title of most dangerous;

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.380
take curling for example, which has a higher
injury rate then speed skating and luge.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.859
Or snowboarding, where 8% of injuries take
place when loading or unloading off the ski

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.859
lift - as the lifts are actually designed
for skiers.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:18.020
Luge, which involves riding a sled laying
on your back at speeds up to 150 km/h will

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.700
put you at a 40% risk of injury, however only
4% of those injuries result in missing more

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.350
than one day of practice.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.880
So what about...death?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880
In terms of fatalities, a report by the National
Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.060
found that between 1982 and 2016, the most
fatalities in high school sports came from

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.799
football, with 133 deaths.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.299
However, that rate is 0.39 per every 100,000
individuals, given that football is the most

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.399
popular American sport.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.799
Regardless, sports like football and hockey
often rank as some of the most dangerous sports

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.520
because of the constant collisions and hits
at top speeds, leading to a variety of injuries

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.289
including concussions.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.500
In fact, autopsies of many former athletes
have revealed that they had chronic traumatic

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.709
encephalopathy or CTE; a disease that people
with multiple head injuries can get.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.140
It leads to weakness in the lower limbs, hesitancy
of speech, unsteadiness, mood problems and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.689
difficulty thinking.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.910
These are the result of brain atrophy and
deposits of protein in the brain.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.579
And brain injuries are actually the leading
cause of death from sports.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.460
This leads us to the actual most dangerous
sport, which when considering all factors,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.930
turns out to be a combat sport.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.410
And while you might be thinking of Mixed Martial
Arts or MMA, it turns out that boxing is actually

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.870
the most dangerous.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.040
The University of Alberta, using medical data
after matches, found that although 60% of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.550
MMA fighters sustained injuries vs 50% of
boxers, MMA injuries were less severe.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.560
7% of boxers had either loss of consciousness
or suffered serious eye injury during fights,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.190
compared to only 4% of MMA fighters.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.849
The study attributes this to MMA style fighting
which involves hitting various areas of the

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.170
body whereas boxing focuses on the head.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.280
And boxers seem to present worse symptoms
of CTE than even athletes in football.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.010
This is likely because of the rotational force
of hook punches, compared to the linear force

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.760
in football, which may make the brain trauma
worse.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.129
At the end of the day, a punch to the head
during a boxing match can range anywhere from

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:40.290
650-1100 pounds of force making boxing arguably
the most dangerous sport in 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.870
the world.
