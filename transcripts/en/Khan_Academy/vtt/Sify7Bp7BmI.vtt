00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:01.869
- [Voiceover] Let's get
some practice taking sums

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.755
of infinite geometric series.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:06.798
So we have one over here.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.224
And just to make sure that we're dealing

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:09.673
with a geometric series,

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:12.082
let's make sure we have a common ratio.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.234
So let's see, to go from the
first term to the second term

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:18.986
we multiply by 1/3,
then go to the next term

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.879
we are going to multiply by 1/3 again,

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.439
and we're going to keep doing that.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.590
So we could rewrite the series as

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.757
eight plus eight times 1/3,

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.813
eight times 1/3, plus

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.531
eight times 1/3 squared,

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.712
eight times 1/3 squared.

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:46.903
Each successive term we
multiply by 1/3 again.

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.312
And so when you look at
it this way, you're like,

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:51.351
okay, we could write
this in sigma notation.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:55.193
This is going be equal to, so
this, the first thing we wrote

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:58.259
is equal to this, which is equal to,

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.342
this is equal to the sum.

00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:03.970
And we could start at zero or at one,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.648
depending on how we like to do it.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:09.484
We could say from k is equal to zero.

00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:11.430
And this is an infinite series right here,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.674
we're just gonna keep on going forever,

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:18.091
so to infinity of, well
what's our first term?

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.562
Our first term is eight.

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:23.982
So it's going to be eight
times our common ratio,

00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:28.149
times our common ratio 1/3 to the k power.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:31.937
Now, let me just verify
that this indeed works.

00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:33.868
And I always do this
just as a reality check,

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:35.501
and I encourage you to do the same.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:38.463
So, when k equals zero, that
should be the first term

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:39.296
right over here.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:41.526
You get eight times 1/3 to the zero power,

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:42.833
which is indeed eight.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.063
When k is equal to one,

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:46.007
that's gonna be our second term here.

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:48.586
That's gonna be eight times
1/3 to the first power.

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:49.756
That's what we have here.

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:52.298
And so when k is equal to two,

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:54.402
that is this term right over here.

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:57.750
So these are all
describing the same thing.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.281
So now that we've seen that we can write

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.533
a geometric series in multiple
ways, let's find the sum.

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:07.166
Well, we've seen before and
we prove it in other videos,

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.083
if you have a sum from
k equal zero to infinity

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.080
and you have your first term a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.256
times r to the k power,

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.941
r to the k power, assuming this converges,

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.358
so, assuming that the absolute value

00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:29.601
of your common ratio is less than one,

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:32.148
this is what needs to
be true for convergence,

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:35.747
this is going to be equal to,
this is going to be equal to

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:38.247
our first term which is a over

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.799
one minus our common ratio,

00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:46.498
one minus our common ratio.

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:47.786
And if this looks unfamiliar to you,

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:48.881
I encourage you to watch the video

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:52.115
where we find the formula,
we derive the formula

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.580
for the sum of an
infinite geometric series.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.702
But just applying that over here,

00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:58.990
we are going to get, we are going to get,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.398
this is going to be
equal to our first term

00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:02.648
which is eight,

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:05.261
so that is eight

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:07.789
over one minus,

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:14.027
one minus our common ratio, over 1/3.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.233
And we know this is going to converge,

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.075
because our common ratio, the magnitude,

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:22.783
the absolute value of 1/3
is indeed less than one.

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:26.268
And so this is all going to converge to,

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.518
this is going to converge to eight over

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.034
one minus 1/3 is 2/3,

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:39.217
which is the same thing
as eight times 3/2,

00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:41.598
which is, let's see this could become,

00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.228
divide eight by two, that becomes four,

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:46.561
and so this will become 12.
