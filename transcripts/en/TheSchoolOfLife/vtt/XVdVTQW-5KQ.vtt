00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:04.792
The ‘needy’ person is
a stock figure of caricature:

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.559
they call too much, they cry when
you leave to get a glass of water,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.059
they feel put out when
you check your phone,

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:13.375
they were upset when
you watched a film without them.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.518
We hate needy people a lot.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:18.792
But let’s look at this another way.

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:23.059
There are, of course, a few
pathologically dependent people at large,

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:26.559
but a lot of the time,
far more than is generally accepted,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:31.375
the person who has the problem
isn’t the ‘needy’ person at all, it is us;

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.792
the ones who are doing the accusing.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:37.518
We will feel someone is sickeningly ‘needy’

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:42.334
when we don’t see ourselves as
appropriate targets of someone else’s need.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.033
Somewhere inside,

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:49.059
we don’t trust that we are reliable,
strong, dependable, admirable or decent;

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.934
we aren’t quite grown-up,

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.976
and those who need something from us

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
therefore come across as
deranged and fitting targets for mockery.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:02.018
At the first sign that someone is
becoming reliant on us, we flinch.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.335
We suspect that someone who needs us enough
to depend on us

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.802
for a pleasant weekend or
evening must be diseased.

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:14.083
At the root of our hatred of
so-called needy people is self-hatred.

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:16.768
Ostensibly, we all want love,

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:19.809
but when love actually starts
to be reciprocated,

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:24.500
it may prove intensely alarming if
we are not convinced of our own lovability.

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:30.309
We can start to think very badly of the
person we liked only a little time before.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.976
We feel they are naive
in finding us wonderful,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.583
a great deal more wonderful
than we feel we are.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.643
We think them gullible,
and too easily taken in by a character

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.417
we ourselves don’t believe in.

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:45.792
The solution isn’t necessarily
to try to change a lover,

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:48.309
by telling them to stop asking so much.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.268
They most probably aren’t
asking too much at all.

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.917
They just aren’t afflicted with
a sense that it is peculiar

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:55.459
to be loved or to love.

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.893
Put another way, they’re just
strong enough to reveal

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:03.250
that they aren’t invulnerable and
judicious enough to like the look of us.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.184
They rightly presume showing need

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:09.291
is a precondition of strength
rather than weakness.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.351
The solution is to revise
our view of ourselves;

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:16.226
to see ourselves as
more or less plausible people

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.000
for someone else to stand in need of.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.434
The fear of ‘needy’ people is
only a species of self-hatred

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.000
rippling outwards to tar our lover.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.476
A reduction of self-hatred doesn’t
depend on self-boosterism

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.393
(telling ourselves how great we are).

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.226
We should learn to tolerate ourselves
not by believing that we are wonderful,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.059
but via a secure realisation that everyone
is both OK and sometimes a bit awful:

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.042
that is enough to deserve love.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.059
We can be cured of our uncommonly
vicious self-suspicion

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.375
by a more accurate vision of
what constitutes normality.

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:55.226
Of course we are a bit a weak, a bit sly
and a bit foolish, to put it gently.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.646
But so is everyone.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.417
We’re no more idiotic or
wayward than the next person.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.184
We can embrace a person’s hopes for
a close and deep relationship with us

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:08.398
simply on the basis that we are,
in fact, all a bit odd and broken.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.940
The need that the lover
has of us isn’t delusional,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.768
it’s an accurate request that any
flawed human might make of another

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:17.934
comparably damaged example.

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.184
We’ll start to find other people
a lot less needy,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:24.434
that is, a lot less alarming
when they need us,

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.559
when we can accept with good grace

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:29.893
that there is nothing unusually
strange or abhorrent

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:32.417
about someone deciding they like us.
