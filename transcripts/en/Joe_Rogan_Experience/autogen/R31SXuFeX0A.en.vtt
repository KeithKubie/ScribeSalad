interesting about that is because

interesting about that is because
 

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.500
interesting about that is because

because this was the closest pass of an

totally out of the blue came in and
 

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.160
totally out of the blue came in and
exploded over Chelyabinsk Siberia so it

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.170
exploded over Chelyabinsk Siberia so it
 

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.710
exploded over Chelyabinsk Siberia so it
was very interesting and coincidental if

orbits of those satellites Wow at the
 

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.800
orbits of those satellites Wow at the
same time that this object is coming

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:01.810

suddenly unexpectedly here comes the

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.070
suddenly unexpectedly here comes the
 

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.780
suddenly unexpectedly here comes the
second object and explodes with the

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:09.790
second object and explodes with the
 

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.910
second object and explodes with the
force of about a I believe it was about

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920
force of about a I believe it was about
 

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.090
force of about a I believe it was about
a 50 kilo ton nuclear weapon and of

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.100
a 50 kilo ton nuclear weapon and of
 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.450
a 50 kilo ton nuclear weapon and of
course it had exploded quite high about

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:18.460
course it had exploded quite high about
 

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.790
course it had exploded quite high about
20 I believe about 18 to 20 miles in the

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800
20 I believe about 18 to 20 miles in the
 

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.570
20 I believe about 18 to 20 miles in the
atmosphere and so it didn't kill anybody

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:24.580
atmosphere and so it didn't kill anybody
 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.450
atmosphere and so it didn't kill anybody
however the thing to bear in mind is if

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:27.460
however the thing to bear in mind is if
 

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.640
however the thing to bear in mind is if
that object had been just a little bit

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:29.650
that object had been just a little bit
 

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.440
that object had been just a little bit
bigger or it had been a little bit

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.450
bigger or it had been a little bit
 

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.690
bigger or it had been a little bit
denser or the angle of approach had been

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:33.700
denser or the angle of approach had been
 

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.480
denser or the angle of approach had been
a little steeper instead of 1,600

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.490
a little steeper instead of 1,600
 

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.340
a little steeper instead of 1,600
injuries that probably could have been

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
injuries that probably could have been
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.640
injuries that probably could have been
1600 or more casualties at that point I

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:41.650
1600 or more casualties at that point I
 

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.230
1600 or more casualties at that point I
think the world would have really sat up

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240
think the world would have really sat up
 

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.920
think the world would have really sat up
and taken notice but

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:45.930
and taken notice but
 

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.829
and taken notice but
it was basically just a warning shot it

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839
it was basically just a warning shot it
 

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:50.780

seems to me that our knowledge of

00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820
they were anything unusual
 

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.840
they were anything unusual
modern skeletal skeletal remains of

modern humans are now dating between a
hundred and fifty and a hundred and

hundred and fifty and a hundred and
 

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.990
hundred and fifty and a hundred and
eighty thousand years so when you think

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000
eighty thousand years so when you think
 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.120
eighty thousand years so when you think
about that you know compared to what we

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.130
about that you know compared to what we
 

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.400
about that you know compared to what we
actually have over our record of history

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:13.410
actually have over our record of history
 

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.210
actually have over our record of history
a record of history is one 20th 125th

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220
a record of history is one 20th 125th
 

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.210
a record of history is one 20th 125th
one thirtieth of the actual time that we

one thirtieth of the actual time that we
 

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.490
one thirtieth of the actual time that we
humans have been here now now it could

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500
humans have been here now now it could
 

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.199
humans have been here now now it could
be that modern humans have actually been

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:24.209
be that modern humans have actually been
 

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:26.810
be that modern humans have actually been
here much longer than than 180 thousand

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820
here much longer than than 180 thousand
 

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.370
here much longer than than 180 thousand
years we have no way of knowing at what

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380
years we have no way of knowing at what
 

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.970
years we have no way of knowing at what
point we moderns first appeared on this

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980
point we moderns first appeared on this
 

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.920
point we moderns first appeared on this
planet but when you think of a hundred

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:33.930
planet but when you think of a hundred
 

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.990
planet but when you think of a hundred
and eighty thousand years compared to

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000
and eighty thousand years compared to
 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.150
and eighty thousand years compared to
let's say in round numbers five thousand

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160
let's say in round numbers five thousand
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.860
let's say in round numbers five thousand
years it means that there's a lot of the

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:39.870
years it means that there's a lot of the
 

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.420
years it means that there's a lot of the
human story missing and the thing that's

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.430
human story missing and the thing that's
 

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.210
human story missing and the thing that's
always intrigued me is that given the

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220
always intrigued me is that given the
 

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.880
always intrigued me is that given the
assumption that they would have had the

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:49.890
assumption that they would have had the
 

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.400
assumption that they would have had the
same intelligence as us the same big

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.410
same intelligence as us the same big
 

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.949
same intelligence as us the same big
they've got the same brain case size the

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959
they've got the same brain case size the
 

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.720
they've got the same brain case size the
same cranial capacity so one would

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:56.730
same cranial capacity so one would
 

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.030
same cranial capacity so one would
assume that with brains as big as our

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040
assume that with brains as big as our
 

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.660
assume that with brains as big as our

they were able to think they had

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500
they were able to think they had
 

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.260
they were able to think they had

presumably have a you know have some

presumably have a you know have some
kind of a tradition that could be passed

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.210
kind of a tradition that could be passed
 

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.090
kind of a tradition that could be passed
on from generation to generation and

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100
on from generation to generation and
 

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.260
on from generation to generation and
accumulated learning but what we see is

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.270
accumulated learning but what we see is
 

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.020
accumulated learning but what we see is
that there's basically no record to

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.030
that there's basically no record to
 

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.490
that there's basically no record to
speak of of what people were doing

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500
speak of of what people were doing
 

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.280
speak of of what people were doing
culturally and and that has led a lot of

culturally and and that has led a lot of
 

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.650

they haven't taken into account is the

they haven't taken into account is the
 

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.110
they haven't taken into account is the
extremity of some of the global changes

we'll pull up some images I think you'll
 

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.100
we'll pull up some images I think you'll
begin to get an idea of how extreme and

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.110
begin to get an idea of how extreme and
 

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.470
begin to get an idea of how extreme and
how sweeping some of these changes have

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480
how sweeping some of these changes have
 

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.320
how sweeping some of these changes have
been and why in the aftermath of those

been and why in the aftermath of those

evidence because what you'll hopefully
 

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.360
evidence because what you'll hopefully
begin to appreciate is that were some of

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.370
begin to appreciate is that were some of
 

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.910
begin to appreciate is that were some of
these events of the scale and magnitude

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920
these events of the scale and magnitude
 

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.250
these events of the scale and magnitude
that have happened probably a dozen or

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260
that have happened probably a dozen or
 

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.070
that have happened probably a dozen or
more times in the hundred and fifty or

more times in the hundred and fifty or
 

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.240
more times in the hundred and fifty or
two hundred thousand years that we've

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.250
two hundred thousand years that we've
 

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.160
two hundred thousand years that we've
been here were those events to occur

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.170
been here were those events to occur

here and that's the thing we have to get
 

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.830
here and that's the thing we have to get
into our consciousness you know I guess

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:39.840
into our consciousness you know I guess

work that I've been doing is that we

such an incredible length of time that

years ago I think was it had to do with

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:37.289
years ago I think was it had to do with
 

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:39.019
years ago I think was it had to do with
the idea of if what if humans just

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:39.029
the idea of if what if humans just
 

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:40.849
the idea of if what if humans just
suddenly departed and what if we took

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:40.859
suddenly departed and what if we took
 

00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:43.099
suddenly departed and what if we took
humans out of the equation what would

00:16:43.099 --> 00:16:43.109
humans out of the equation what would
 

00:16:43.109 --> 00:16:44.779
humans out of the equation what would
happen to all of the infrastructure left

was there before it could have been

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120
was there before it could have been
 

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.360
was there before it could have been
several thousand years old when they

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:32.370
several thousand years old when they
 

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.190
several thousand years old when they
decided to cover it up but it was

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200
decided to cover it up but it was
 

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.940
decided to cover it up but it was
purposely filled in an enormous area

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:36.950
purposely filled in an enormous area
 

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.200
purposely filled in an enormous area
purposely filled in somewhere around

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.210
purposely filled in somewhere around
 

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.730
purposely filled in somewhere around
twelve thousand years

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740
twelve thousand years
 

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.160
twelve thousand years
could it have been purposely covered up

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.170
could it have been purposely covered up
 

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.169
could it have been purposely covered up
in order to protect it and preserve it

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179
in order to protect it and preserve it
 

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:47.510
in order to protect it and preserve it
could be right that we were hoping what

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520
could be right that we were hoping what
 

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.980
could be right that we were hoping what
they were hoping rather that someone

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:48.990
they were hoping rather that someone
 

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.110
they were hoping rather that someone
like us would come along not honestly

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120
like us would come along not honestly
 

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.130

maybe you but we come along and uncover

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.070
maybe you but we come along and uncover
 

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.580
maybe you but we come along and uncover
it and then go whoa what's what's this

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:58.590
it and then go whoa what's what's this
 

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.950
it and then go whoa what's what's this
all about like maybe they knew that

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960
all about like maybe they knew that
 

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.500
all about like maybe they knew that
there were going to be moments in time

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:03.510
there were going to be moments in time
 

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.799
there were going to be moments in time
where these things happen these impacts

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:06.809
where these things happen these impacts
 

00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:10.220
where these things happen these impacts
these asteroid impacts and that there

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:10.230
these asteroid impacts and that there
 

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.780
these asteroid impacts and that there
needed to be some sort of a way of

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:11.790
needed to be some sort of a way of
 

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.180
needed to be some sort of a way of
keeping track or some sort of a way of

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.190
keeping track or some sort of a way of
 

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.240
keeping track or some sort of a way of
preserving well that that would probably

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.250
preserving well that that would probably
 

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.549
preserving well that that would probably
be one way of preserving it for sure and

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559
be one way of preserving it for sure and
 

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:21.020
be one way of preserving it for sure and
the other thing would be is just like

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.030
the other thing would be is just like
 

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.730
the other thing would be is just like
you mentioned you mentioned we the two

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740
you mentioned you mentioned we the two
 

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.290
you mentioned you mentioned we the two
things Mount Rushmore and the Great

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:24.300
things Mount Rushmore and the Great
 

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.760

Pyramid of course are both built of
 

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.120
Pyramid of course are both built of
stone which is obviously much more

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.130
stone which is obviously much more
 

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.730
stone which is obviously much more
durable than steel or you know the

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740
durable than steel or you know the
 

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.520

going to degrade over a few millennium
 

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.140
going to degrade over a few millennium
but if you want to preserve something

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.150
but if you want to preserve something
 

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.780
but if you want to preserve something
for millennia make it out of stone and

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:44.790
for millennia make it out of stone and
 

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.140
for millennia make it out of stone and
make it monumental and you know we're

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.150
make it monumental and you know we're
 

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.580
make it monumental and you know we're
looking at it's something like you just

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:49.590
looking at it's something like you just
 

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.350
looking at it's something like you just
made an interesting point about it could

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360
made an interesting point about it could
 

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.890
made an interesting point about it could
have how much pre vyas to the to the

you know it's difficult to date stone

00:20:59.660 --> 00:20:59.670
you know it's difficult to date stone
 

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.700
you know it's difficult to date stone
the way you would dates known is you

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:01.710
the way you would dates known is you
 

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.120
the way you would dates known is you
know you can use various some Oh Cosmo

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.130

but if it's buried it's not going to be
 

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.840
but if it's buried it's not going to be
subject to cosmic rays so that you can't

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:20.850
subject to cosmic rays so that you can't
 

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.010

date it that way which you'd probably

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020
date it that way which you'd probably
 

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.250
date it that way which you'd probably
have to do is date find some organic

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260
have to do is date find some organic
 

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.310
have to do is date find some organic
material within the soil matrix or

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.239
it's becoming much more precisely dated
now you'll find a lot of references in

00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:07.249
now you'll find a lot of references in
 

00:23:07.249 --> 00:23:08.889
now you'll find a lot of references in
the scientific literature that says

00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:08.899
the scientific literature that says
 

00:23:08.899 --> 00:23:11.320
the scientific literature that says
gives the date eleven point six or

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.330
gives the date eleven point six or
 

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.149
gives the date eleven point six or
eleven thousand six hundred years as

00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159
eleven thousand six hundred years as
 

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:16.629
eleven thousand six hundred years as
being the onset of the Holocene which is

being the onset of the Holocene which is
 

00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:18.759
being the onset of the Holocene which is
an interesting date for me because I

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:18.769
an interesting date for me because I
 

00:23:18.769 --> 00:23:20.859
an interesting date for me because I

wrote it down but what it's interesting
 

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.740
wrote it down but what it's interesting
is that in in Plato's account he gives

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:20.750
is that in in Plato's account he gives
 

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.790
is that in in Plato's account he gives
the dating for the demise of Atlantis as

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:23.800

give or take a decade or two 600 BC we
 

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.180
give or take a decade or two 600 BC we
go back that's 2600 years ago okay add

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.070
go back that's 2600 years ago okay add
that to the 9,000 years and we've got

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080

now according to Plato's account he says

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:45.380
now according to Plato's account he says
 

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.040
now according to Plato's account he says
that it was shortly after this great war

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.050
that it was shortly after this great war
 

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.470
that it was shortly after this great war
between the Atlanteans and the proto

between the Atlanteans and the proto
 

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.770
between the Atlanteans and the proto
Athenians that there was this tremendous

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:52.780
Athenians that there was this tremendous
 

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.290
Athenians that there was this tremendous
cataclysm and Atlantis sunk beneath the

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:56.300
cataclysm and Atlantis sunk beneath the
 

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.680
cataclysm and Atlantis sunk beneath the
waves so he's giving that date at eleven

00:24:59.680 --> 00:24:59.690
waves so he's giving that date at eleven
 

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.900
waves so he's giving that date at eleven
thousand six hundred years ago we now

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:01.910
thousand six hundred years ago we now
 

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.990
thousand six hundred years ago we now
know from the scientific record that at

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000
know from the scientific record that at
 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.520
know from the scientific record that at
eleven thousand six hundred years ago

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:06.530
eleven thousand six hundred years ago
 

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.920
eleven thousand six hundred years ago
there was a major climate transition and

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:08.930
there was a major climate transition and
 

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.200
there was a major climate transition and
there was a catastrophic warming spike

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:11.210
there was a catastrophic warming spike
 

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.400
there was a catastrophic warming spike
that was associated with a mega scale

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:15.410
that was associated with a mega scale

meltdown event of the great ice sheets
 

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.710
meltdown event of the great ice sheets
that were covering North America it was

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720
that were covering North America it was
 

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.270

this event at eleven thousand six

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.280
this event at eleven thousand six
 

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.820
this event at eleven thousand six

out of the the depths of this Ice Age

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:27.680
out of the the depths of this Ice Age
 

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.410
out of the the depths of this Ice Age
that it had been in for thousands and

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:29.420
that it had been in for thousands and
 

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.980
that it had been in for thousands and
thousands of years with that melting you

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:32.990
thousands of years with that melting you
 

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.030
thousands of years with that melting you
had a rapid rise of sea level so it's

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.040
had a rapid rise of sea level so it's
 

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.280
had a rapid rise of sea level so it's
very interesting that the date that he

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:39.290
very interesting that the date that he
 

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.650
very interesting that the date that he
gives is precisely now the date that

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:43.660
gives is precisely now the date that
 

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.200
gives is precisely now the date that
that the scientists are giving for this

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.210
that the scientists are giving for this
 

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.760
that the scientists are giving for this
transition from what's called the

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:48.770
transition from what's called the
 

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.350

Younger Dryas I think Graham has

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360
Younger Dryas I think Graham has
 

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.270
Younger Dryas I think Graham has
mentioned that in in some of your

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:54.280
mentioned that in in some of your
 

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.410
mentioned that in in some of your
interviews with him that the younger

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:56.420
interviews with him that the younger
 

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.200

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.210
driest which was this climate spasm that
 

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.110
driest which was this climate spasm that
ended the last ice age so if we look at

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120
ended the last ice age so if we look at
 

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.740
ended the last ice age so if we look at
the chronology of events around 26,000

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:05.750
the chronology of events around 26,000
 

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.710
the chronology of events around 26,000
years ago we were in the latter phases

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720
years ago we were in the latter phases
 

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.540
years ago we were in the latter phases
of a what appears to have been an

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:10.550
of a what appears to have been an
 

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.750
of a what appears to have been an
interglacial period not too much

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760
interglacial period not too much
 

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.600
interglacial period not too much
different from what we're in now around

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:16.610
different from what we're in now around
 

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.860
different from what we're in now around
26,000 years ago the climate rapidly

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:19.870
26,000 years ago the climate rapidly
 

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.340
26,000 years ago the climate rapidly
degenerated

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.350
degenerated
 

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.510
degenerated
and these massive glaciers had expanded

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520
and these massive glaciers had expanded
 

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.710
and these massive glaciers had expanded
during this what they called the final

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720
during this what they called the final
 

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.100
during this what they called the final
phase or the late Wisconsin they refer

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.110
phase or the late Wisconsin they refer
 

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.169
phase or the late Wisconsin they refer
to it because initially they were

00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:32.179
to it because initially they were
 

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:34.029
to it because initially they were
looking for this evidence in the state

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039
looking for this evidence in the state
 

00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:36.010
looking for this evidence in the state
of Wisconsin so they they named that

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.020
of Wisconsin so they they named that
 

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.590
of Wisconsin so they they named that
this last final phase the latest onsen

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600
this last final phase the latest onsen
 

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.740
this last final phase the latest onsen
so around 26,000 years ago we see the

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:41.750
so around 26,000 years ago we see the
 

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.200
so around 26,000 years ago we see the
the launching of this final phase of the

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.210
the launching of this final phase of the
 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.380
the launching of this final phase of the
Ice Age the late was concen then at

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.390
Ice Age the late was concen then at
 

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.900
Ice Age the late was concen then at
around 13,000 years ago as the dates are

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:49.910
around 13,000 years ago as the dates are
 

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.060
around 13,000 years ago as the dates are
now giving it there was this enormous

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.070
now giving it there was this enormous
 

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.240
now giving it there was this enormous
spasm of warming and this seemed to be

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:55.250
spasm of warming and this seemed to be
 

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.000
spasm of warming and this seemed to be
associated with rapid melting and the

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.010
associated with rapid melting and the
 

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.630
associated with rapid melting and the
first real rapid sea level rise okay

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640
first real rapid sea level rise okay
 

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.000
first real rapid sea level rise okay
what happened is after a very short

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.010
what happened is after a very short
 

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.580
what happened is after a very short

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:17.799
if you go back 18,000 years ago this was
the coldest part of the ice age I mean

the coldest part of the ice age I mean
 

00:27:17.809 --> 00:27:21.630
the coldest part of the ice age I mean
this was bitterly cold period of time

southern southern Ohio excuse me so it
 

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:40.810
southern southern Ohio excuse me so it
was a really really different climate

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:40.820

has pointed out there are now four
hundred feet underwater Wow so you begin

00:30:22.629 --> 00:30:22.639
hundred feet underwater Wow so you begin
 

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:24.009

to appreciate when you begin to really

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:24.019
to appreciate when you begin to really
 

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:26.320

look at the history of our planet what

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.330
look at the history of our planet what
 

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.599
look at the history of our planet what
you realize is that it's been just

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:28.609
you realize is that it's been just
 

00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:32.079

alteration from a from a interglacial to
 

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:38.799
alteration from a from a interglacial to
a glacial age is an extreme process and

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:38.809
a glacial age is an extreme process and
 

00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:42.249
a glacial age is an extreme process and
so I guess the upshot of it is is that

so I guess the upshot of it is is that
 

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:44.950
so I guess the upshot of it is is that

you pull out that ice core it's layered

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720
you pull out that ice core it's layered
 

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.260
you pull out that ice core it's layered
you think think of cutting down a tree

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.270
you think think of cutting down a tree
 

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.270
you think think of cutting down a tree
and looking at the annual layers where

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.280
and looking at the annual layers where
 

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.560
and looking at the annual layers where
you can actually count the number of

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:14.570
you can actually count the number of
 

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:19.090
you can actually count the number of

well it's very similar in in an ice core

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.260
well it's very similar in in an ice core
 

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.930
well it's very similar in in an ice core
you've got layers annual layers because

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:25.940
you've got layers annual layers because
 

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.210
you've got layers annual layers because
each year there's snow that falls it

gets compressed into fern f ir n which

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.130
gets compressed into fern f ir n which
 

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.820
gets compressed into fern f ir n which
is the transitional phase between snow

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:33.830
is the transitional phase between snow
 

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.220
is the transitional phase between snow
and glacial ice and it eventually gets

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.230
and glacial ice and it eventually gets
 

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.840
and glacial ice and it eventually gets
compressed into glacial ice and when you

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:37.850
compressed into glacial ice and when you
 

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.400
compressed into glacial ice and when you
look at a cross-section of the ice core

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:39.410
look at a cross-section of the ice core
 

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.230
look at a cross-section of the ice core
you'll see these fine layers in there

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240
you'll see these fine layers in there
 

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.090
you'll see these fine layers in there
right so they can go back and they can

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
right so they can go back and they can
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.530
right so they can go back and they can
look at these layers they can count the

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:44.540
look at these layers they can count the
 

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.240
look at these layers they can count the
layers and there's a lot of things going

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.250
layers and there's a lot of things going
 

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.910
layers and there's a lot of things going
on in these layers oxygen isotopes are a

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:48.920
on in these layers oxygen isotopes are a
 

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.250
on in these layers oxygen isotopes are a
critical one for ascertaining climate

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:51.260

changes because oxygen isotopes are a

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.020
changes because oxygen isotopes are a
 

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.620
changes because oxygen isotopes are a
function of temperature and we have a

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:56.630
function of temperature and we have a
 

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.840
function of temperature and we have a
graph here we'll pull up in a minute we

00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:58.850
graph here we'll pull up in a minute we
 

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.420

can actually look at that but what we

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:01.430
can actually look at that but what we
 

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.120
can actually look at that but what we
see is that the climate is constantly

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.130
see is that the climate is constantly
 

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.000
see is that the climate is constantly
isolated back and forth and when we look

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.010
isolated back and forth and when we look
 

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.040
isolated back and forth and when we look
at the Holocene going back 10,000 years

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.050
at the Holocene going back 10,000 years
 

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.640
at the Holocene going back 10,000 years
and then we take that comparatively and

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:12.650
and then we take that comparatively and
 

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.690
and then we take that comparatively and
we go back 250 to 400 thousand years we

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:16.700
we go back 250 to 400 thousand years we

and astronomers and geometrician Xand
 

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.180
and astronomers and geometrician Xand
and all of these people brought together

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:43.190
and all of these people brought together
 

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.130
and all of these people brought together
to create these incredible cathedrals

to create these incredible cathedrals
 

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.290
to create these incredible cathedrals
and it was made possible by the fact

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:47.300
and it was made possible by the fact
 

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.480
and it was made possible by the fact
that European society had become

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:49.490
that European society had become
 

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.450
that European society had become
relatively wealthy and this wealth was

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:52.460
relatively wealthy and this wealth was
 

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.960
relatively wealthy and this wealth was
brought on by this global warmth right

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:55.970
brought on by this global warmth right

Gothic building boom and and by the way
there's about 500 smaller Abbey's that

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400
there's about 500 smaller Abbey's that
 

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.920
there's about 500 smaller Abbey's that
were constructed during this interval

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:08.930
were constructed during this interval
 

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.140
were constructed during this interval
this was a very prolific time for a

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.150
this was a very prolific time for a
 

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.730
this was a very prolific time for a
number of reasons this was the time that

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:12.740
number of reasons this was the time that
 

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.920
number of reasons this was the time that
you had the Templar knights forming

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:14.930
you had the Templar knights forming
 

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.060
you had the Templar knights forming
you've probably heard of that the

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.070
you've probably heard of that the
 

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.030
you've probably heard of that the
Templar knights I'm sure you had schools

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040
Templar knights I'm sure you had schools
 

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.640
Templar knights I'm sure you had schools
of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and

of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and
 

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.610
of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:24.620
and you had the rise of Cather ISM you
 

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.620
and you had the rise of Cather ISM you
had the troubadours you had these

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:26.630
had the troubadours you had these

amazing spiritual things going on
amazing culturally it was a very

cathedrals were never finished and what

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:41.450
cathedrals were never finished and what
 

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.849
cathedrals were never finished and what
we see is that

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:42.859
we see is that
 

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:44.349
we see is that
some of them have the appearance you

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359
some of them have the appearance you
 

00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:47.890
some of them have the appearance you
know I'm a builder by profession and you

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:47.900
know I'm a builder by profession and you
 

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.660
know I'm a builder by profession and you
know it's it's I've looked at some of

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:49.670
know it's it's I've looked at some of
 

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.549
know it's it's I've looked at some of
these and but it's very much like as

00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:51.559
these and but it's very much like as
 

00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:53.559
these and but it's very much like as
they're going along building and then

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:53.569
they're going along building and then
 

00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:55.059
they're going along building and then
all of a sudden one day nobody shows up

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:55.069
all of a sudden one day nobody shows up
 

00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:57.640
all of a sudden one day nobody shows up
to work and there's still tools laying

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:57.650
to work and there's still tools laying
 

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.620
to work and there's still tools laying
around there's still materials that are

00:39:59.620 --> 00:39:59.630
around there's still materials that are
 

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.859
around there's still materials that are
often a pile that we're waiting to be

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:01.869
often a pile that we're waiting to be
 

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:04.660
often a pile that we're waiting to be
incorporated into the structure and what

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:04.670
incorporated into the structure and what
 

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.689
incorporated into the structure and what
happened was that the climate began to

00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:07.699
happened was that the climate began to
 

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:14.259
happened was that the climate began to
cool again between 13 15 and 13 20% of

00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:14.269
cool again between 13 15 and 13 20% of
 

00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:17.169
cool again between 13 15 and 13 20% of
this tremendous Gothic building boom is

00:40:17.169 --> 00:40:17.179
this tremendous Gothic building boom is
 

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:19.779
this tremendous Gothic building boom is
when the climate began to cool and it

00:40:19.779 --> 00:40:19.789
when the climate began to cool and it
 

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:21.900
when the climate began to cool and it
cool for the next several decades and

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:21.910
cool for the next several decades and
 

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.489
cool for the next several decades and
what we then see as a repeat of what

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:24.499
what we then see as a repeat of what
 

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:27.929
what we then see as a repeat of what
happened between 536 and 542 ad

00:40:27.929 --> 00:40:27.939
happened between 536 and 542 ad
 

00:40:27.939 --> 00:40:31.539
happened between 536 and 542 ad
agricultural collapses crops rotting in

think was around between 1340 and 1345

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:38.179
think was around between 1340 and 1345
 

00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:41.890
think was around between 1340 and 1345
the onset of the Black Plague and once

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:41.900
the onset of the Black Plague and once
 

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.929
the onset of the Black Plague and once
again the population of Europe was

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:43.939
again the population of Europe was
 

00:40:43.939 --> 00:40:46.749
again the population of Europe was
decimated and it took a hundred and

00:40:46.749 --> 00:40:46.759
decimated and it took a hundred and
 

00:40:46.759 --> 00:40:48.939
decimated and it took a hundred and
fifty years basically to recover from

00:40:48.939 --> 00:40:48.949
fifty years basically to recover from
 

00:40:48.949 --> 00:40:51.429
fifty years basically to recover from
that and what we see is that what what

00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:51.439
that and what we see is that what what
 

00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:52.959
that and what we see is that what what
what was happening is the planet was

00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:52.969
what was happening is the planet was
 

00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:54.279
what was happening is the planet was
shifting into what's called the Little

00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:54.289
shifting into what's called the Little
 

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:56.229
shifting into what's called the Little
Ice Age well you've probably heard that

00:40:56.229 --> 00:40:56.239
Ice Age well you've probably heard that
 

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:58.359
Ice Age well you've probably heard that
term the Little Ice Age right there was

00:40:58.359 --> 00:40:58.369
term the Little Ice Age right there was
 

00:40:58.369 --> 00:41:01.089
term the Little Ice Age right there was
two phases to the Little Ice Age and the

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:01.099
two phases to the Little Ice Age and the
 

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:03.249
two phases to the Little Ice Age and the
first phase began like I said around

00:41:03.249 --> 00:41:03.259
first phase began like I said around
 

00:41:03.259 --> 00:41:05.890
first phase began like I said around
1320 lat said about a hundred and fifty

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:05.900
1320 lat said about a hundred and fifty
 

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.989
1320 lat said about a hundred and fifty
years and then there was a break and it

00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:07.999
years and then there was a break and it
 

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:09.789
years and then there was a break and it
was during that break that warm period

00:41:09.789 --> 00:41:09.799
was during that break that warm period
 

00:41:09.799 --> 00:41:12.160
was during that break that warm period
that basically the Renaissance kicked in

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.170
that basically the Renaissance kicked in
 

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.979
that basically the Renaissance kicked in
and we began to really move forward the

00:41:14.979 --> 00:41:14.989
and we began to really move forward the
 

00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:17.259
and we began to really move forward the
second phase of the Little Ice Age came

00:41:17.259 --> 00:41:17.269
second phase of the Little Ice Age came
 

00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:20.439
second phase of the Little Ice Age came
in during the 1600s and it was actually

00:41:20.439 --> 00:41:20.449
in during the 1600s and it was actually
 

00:41:20.449 --> 00:41:22.769
in during the 1600s and it was actually
even colder than the first phase and

00:41:22.769 --> 00:41:22.779
even colder than the first phase and
 

00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:26.169
even colder than the first phase and
worldwide glaciers expanded to the

00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:26.179
worldwide glaciers expanded to the
 

00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:28.839
worldwide glaciers expanded to the
largest they had been in 10,000 to

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:28.849
largest they had been in 10,000 to
 

00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:30.789
largest they had been in 10,000 to
12,000 years since the end of the big

00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:30.799
12,000 years since the end of the big
 

00:41:30.799 --> 00:41:32.519
12,000 years since the end of the big
Ice Age throughout the whole Holocene

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:32.529
Ice Age throughout the whole Holocene
 

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:35.890
Ice Age throughout the whole Holocene
glaciers had been smaller now during the

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:35.900
glaciers had been smaller now during the
 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.499
glaciers had been smaller now during the
big ice the Little Ice Age they grew and

00:41:38.499 --> 00:41:38.509
big ice the Little Ice Age they grew and
 

00:41:38.509 --> 00:41:40.269
big ice the Little Ice Age they grew and
they grew to the biggest that they've

00:41:40.269 --> 00:41:40.279
they grew to the biggest that they've
 

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:43.269
they grew to the biggest that they've
been in 10,000 years it's important to

00:41:43.269 --> 00:41:43.279
been in 10,000 years it's important to
 

00:41:43.279 --> 00:41:45.249
been in 10,000 years it's important to
have that context of understanding when

00:41:45.249 --> 00:41:45.259
have that context of understanding when
 

00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:47.769
have that context of understanding when
we talk about glacier recession because

00:41:47.769 --> 00:41:47.779
we talk about glacier recession because
 

00:41:47.779 --> 00:41:50.259
we talk about glacier recession because
the glaciers begin to recede around the

00:41:50.259 --> 00:41:50.269
the glaciers begin to recede around the
 

00:41:50.269 --> 00:41:52.719
the glaciers begin to recede around the
middle of the 19th century worldwide as

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:52.729
middle of the 19th century worldwide as
 

00:41:52.729 --> 00:41:55.839
middle of the 19th century worldwide as
the Little Ice Age begin to wane and

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:55.849
the Little Ice Age begin to wane and
 

00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:56.630
the Little Ice Age begin to wane and
glow

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640
glow
 

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.670
glow
warmth warmth begin to return to the

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680
warmth warmth begin to return to the
 

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.210
warmth warmth begin to return to the
planet this happened in the mid 1800s

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220
planet this happened in the mid 1800s
 

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.809
planet this happened in the mid 1800s
around 1840 to 1860 we see the Little

00:42:05.809 --> 00:42:05.819
around 1840 to 1860 we see the Little
 

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:08.120
around 1840 to 1860 we see the Little
Ice Age coming to an end and at that

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.130
Ice Age coming to an end and at that
 

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.370
Ice Age coming to an end and at that
point the glaciers worldwide began to

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380
point the glaciers worldwide began to
 

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.559
point the glaciers worldwide began to
recede they began to contract they've

00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:12.569
recede they began to contract they've
 

00:42:12.569 --> 00:42:15.470
recede they began to contract they've
been pretty much contracting uniformly

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480
been pretty much contracting uniformly
 

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.470
been pretty much contracting uniformly
since then so when we're talking about

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480
since then so when we're talking about
 

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.870
since then so when we're talking about
glacier recession it's important to

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880
glacier recession it's important to
 

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.180
glacier recession it's important to
understand that the glacier recession

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.190
understand that the glacier recession
 

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.309
understand that the glacier recession
really began a century and a half ago or

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319
really began a century and a half ago or
 

00:42:25.319 --> 00:42:28.160
really began a century and a half ago or
more and has basically consider

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:28.170
more and has basically consider
 

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.099
more and has basically consider
continued more or less uniformly since

00:42:31.099 --> 00:42:31.109
continued more or less uniformly since
 

00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:34.819
continued more or less uniformly since
then with no real change with the advent

00:42:34.819 --> 00:42:34.829
then with no real change with the advent
 

00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:38.380
then with no real change with the advent
of human fossil fuel to the atmosphere

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:38.390
of human fossil fuel to the atmosphere
 

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.299
of human fossil fuel to the atmosphere
human carbon dioxide which began really

00:42:41.299 --> 00:42:41.309
human carbon dioxide which began really
 

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:43.309
human carbon dioxide which began really
in earnest during the Second World War

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319
in earnest during the Second World War
 

00:42:43.319 --> 00:42:46.400
in earnest during the Second World War
is when when we begin to add significant

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:46.410
is when when we begin to add significant
 

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.500
is when when we begin to add significant
amounts of carbon dioxide to the

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:48.510
amounts of carbon dioxide to the
 

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.839
amounts of carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere it's important to realize

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:50.849
atmosphere it's important to realize
 

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:53.329
atmosphere it's important to realize
that the glaciers had been receding

00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339
that the glaciers had been receding
 

00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:56.589
that the glaciers had been receding
almost a full century before that point

00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599
almost a full century before that point
 

00:42:56.599 --> 00:43:00.769
almost a full century before that point
so when you see all this modern hysteria

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:00.779
so when you see all this modern hysteria
 

00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:03.670
so when you see all this modern hysteria
about global warming and the human

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680
about global warming and the human
 

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.680
about global warming and the human
created global warming that we keep

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:06.690
created global warming that we keep
 

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.259
created global warming that we keep
hearing about in the news and that our

00:43:09.259 --> 00:43:09.269
hearing about in the news and that our
 

00:43:09.269 --> 00:43:12.589
hearing about in the news and that our
influence on the atmosphere does it

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599
influence on the atmosphere does it
 

00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:14.390
influence on the atmosphere does it
drive you crazy I mean do you think it's

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400
drive you crazy I mean do you think it's
 

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.910
drive you crazy I mean do you think it's
silly we obviously human beings are

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920
silly we obviously human beings are
 

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.259
silly we obviously human beings are
contributing to the carbon footprint

00:43:18.259 --> 00:43:18.269
contributing to the carbon footprint
 

00:43:18.269 --> 00:43:20.539
contributing to the carbon footprint
right obviously obviously yes and

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:20.549
right obviously obviously yes and
 

00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:22.339
right obviously obviously yes and
obviously that has an effect on global

00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:22.349
obviously that has an effect on global
 

00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:25.640
obviously that has an effect on global
warming yes yes but you gotta bear in

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:25.650
warming yes yes but you gotta bear in
 

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.529
warming yes yes but you gotta bear in
mind the carbon dioxide it's only one

00:43:27.529 --> 00:43:27.539
mind the carbon dioxide it's only one
 

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:29.809

penetrating the atmosphere is a function

00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:31.739
penetrating the atmosphere is a function
 

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:33.410
penetrating the atmosphere is a function
of a couple of things you've got the

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420
of a couple of things you've got the
 

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.769
of a couple of things you've got the

the whole solar system the Sun actually
 

00:44:43.229 --> 00:44:47.150
the whole solar system the Sun actually
is fairly variable and what that means

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160
is fairly variable and what that means
 

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.930
is fairly variable and what that means
is that when the solar wind is in more

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940
is that when the solar wind is in more
 

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.370
is that when the solar wind is in more
intense phase like when when the

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:54.380
intense phase like when when the
 

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.079
intense phase like when when the
sunspots for example are very active the

00:44:57.079 --> 00:44:57.089
sunspots for example are very active the
 

00:44:57.089 --> 00:45:00.680
sunspots for example are very active the
solar wind is is much stronger what that

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:00.690
solar wind is is much stronger what that
 

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.499
solar wind is is much stronger what that
does is it serves as a buffer that

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:02.509
does is it serves as a buffer that
 

00:45:02.509 --> 00:45:05.569
does is it serves as a buffer that
prevents cosmic rays from penetrating

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579
prevents cosmic rays from penetrating
 

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:08.799
prevents cosmic rays from penetrating
the atmosphere of the earth as as

00:45:08.799 --> 00:45:08.809
the atmosphere of the earth as as
 

00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:11.839
the atmosphere of the earth as as
strongly as they did previously also the

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:11.849
strongly as they did previously also the
 

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:13.849

geomagnetic field of the earth acts as a
 

00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:16.579
geomagnetic field of the earth acts as a
buffer so here's two things that are

00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:16.589
buffer so here's two things that are
 

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:21.499
buffer so here's two things that are
completely not included in the scenarios

00:45:21.499 --> 00:45:21.509
completely not included in the scenarios
 

00:45:21.509 --> 00:45:24.170
completely not included in the scenarios
of the IPCC but probably have a very

of the IPCC but probably have a very
 

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.219
of the IPCC but probably have a very
profound effect on global climate the

00:45:28.219 --> 00:45:28.229
profound effect on global climate the
 

00:45:28.229 --> 00:45:30.109
profound effect on global climate the
Earth's geomagnetic field is you know

00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119
Earth's geomagnetic field is you know
 

00:45:30.119 --> 00:45:32.209
Earth's geomagnetic field is you know
probably know that the geomagnetic field

00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:32.219
probably know that the geomagnetic field
 

00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:33.769
probably know that the geomagnetic field
has periodically throughout Earth

00:45:33.769 --> 00:45:33.779

00:45:36.719 --> 00:45:38.660
history disappeared completely sometimes
it's it's disappeared and come back with

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:38.670
it's it's disappeared and come back with
 

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.829
it's it's disappeared and come back with

well that geomagnetic field acts as a

00:45:42.469 --> 00:45:42.479
well that geomagnetic field acts as a
 

00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:46.789
well that geomagnetic field acts as a
buffer which helps to reduce the amount

00:45:46.789 --> 00:45:46.799
buffer which helps to reduce the amount
 

00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:48.920
buffer which helps to reduce the amount
of cosmic rays penetrating the

mid-atlantic ridge as the as the lava

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:58.610
mid-atlantic ridge as the as the lava
 

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:02.090
mid-atlantic ridge as the as the lava
flowed out and crystallized locked in

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:02.100
flowed out and crystallized locked in
 

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.100
flowed out and crystallized locked in
the geomagnetic field they looked at it

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:04.110
the geomagnetic field they looked at it
 

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.750
the geomagnetic field they looked at it
and they could see that there were times

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760
and they could see that there were times
 

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.180
and they could see that there were times
when it had completely reversed itself

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:08.190
when it had completely reversed itself
 

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.360
when it had completely reversed itself
and so this was like very powerful

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.370
and so this was like very powerful
 

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.280
and so this was like very powerful
evidence that the theory of continental

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:13.290
evidence that the theory of continental
 

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.330
evidence that the theory of continental
drift was right that the Atlantic Ocean

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:17.340
drift was right that the Atlantic Ocean
 

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:20.360
drift was right that the Atlantic Ocean
had been spreading and in getting back

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.370
had been spreading and in getting back
 

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.860
had been spreading and in getting back
to this whole atlantis thing which is

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:21.870
to this whole atlantis thing which is
 

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.750
to this whole atlantis thing which is
interesting to me is because when you

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760
interesting to me is because when you
 

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.240
interesting to me is because when you
look at at REE Plato's account he

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.250
look at at REE Plato's account he
 

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.910
look at at REE Plato's account he
describes Atlantis as being west of the

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920
describes Atlantis as being west of the
 

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.830
describes Atlantis as being west of the
pillars of Herakles which of course is

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:30.840
pillars of Herakles which of course is
 

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.510
pillars of Herakles which of course is
the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520
the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of
 

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.220
the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of
the Mediterranean he describes how if

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:37.230
the Mediterranean he describes how if
 

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.500
the Mediterranean he describes how if
you go you come to some islands then you

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:39.510
you go you come to some islands then you
 

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.420
you go you come to some islands then you
come to some more islands and that was

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:41.430
come to some more islands and that was
 

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.330
come to some more islands and that was
the the island complex of Atlantis and

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:44.340
the the island complex of Atlantis and
 

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.120
the the island complex of Atlantis and
beyond that was another cold continent

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.130
beyond that was another cold continent
 

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.610
beyond that was another cold continent
he describes that right if you look in

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:49.620
he describes that right if you look in
 

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.110
he describes that right if you look in
the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:51.120
the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've
 

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.280
the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've
got the Azores Plateau which is now a

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.290
got the Azores Plateau which is now a
 

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.500
got the Azores Plateau which is now a
couple of thousand feet under the sea

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:57.510
couple of thousand feet under the sea
 

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.760
couple of thousand feet under the sea
the Azore islands are the tops of

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:01.770
the Azore islands are the tops of
 

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.820
the Azore islands are the tops of
mountains that that emerge from the

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:04.830
mountains that that emerge from the
 

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.660
mountains that that emerge from the
surface of the ocean right and they sit

the planet well when you have an ice age
 

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.330
the planet well when you have an ice age
and you start piling ice up onto like

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:29.340
and you start piling ice up onto like
 

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.610
and you start piling ice up onto like
the North American continent what

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:31.620
the North American continent what
 

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.770
the North American continent what
happens is the weight of that ice begins

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780
happens is the weight of that ice begins
 

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.700
happens is the weight of that ice begins
to crush the the crust of the earth down

when you get up and you walk away then
 

00:49:06.089 --> 00:49:08.210
when you get up and you walk away then
you will have isostatic compensation

photographs we could probably even pull
 

00:49:46.499 --> 00:49:47.599
photographs we could probably even pull
some up here in a minute there are

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:47.609
some up here in a minute there are
 

00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:50.539
some up here in a minute there are
photographs taken where you can see the

Bay because it's still rising right
 

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.499
Bay because it's still rising right
what's interesting too is if you look at

00:49:57.499 --> 00:49:57.509
what's interesting too is if you look at
 

00:49:57.509 --> 00:50:00.680
what's interesting too is if you look at
the the the distance between these

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:00.690
the the the distance between these
 

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.739
the the the distance between these
shorelines you'll see that early on

shorelines you'll see that early on
 

00:50:03.749 --> 00:50:06.229
shorelines you'll see that early on
there's a greater distance because the

00:50:06.229 --> 00:50:06.239
there's a greater distance because the
 

00:50:06.239 --> 00:50:09.229
there's a greater distance because the
land was rising faster as the millennia

00:50:09.229 --> 00:50:09.239
land was rising faster as the millennia
 

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:11.299
land was rising faster as the millennia
have have gone on the distance

00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:11.309
have have gone on the distance
 

00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:13.519
have have gone on the distance
separating each shoreline has diminished

00:50:13.519 --> 00:50:13.529
separating each shoreline has diminished
 

00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:15.559
separating each shoreline has diminished
but now you have to think that all of

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:15.569
but now you have to think that all of
 

00:50:15.569 --> 00:50:17.959
but now you have to think that all of
that weight is being transferred back

00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:17.969
that weight is being transferred back
 

00:50:17.969 --> 00:50:21.079
that weight is being transferred back
into the ocean basins a lot of it was

00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:21.089
into the ocean basins a lot of it was
 

00:50:21.089 --> 00:50:22.999
into the ocean basins a lot of it was
dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean

00:50:22.999 --> 00:50:23.009
dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean
 

00:50:23.009 --> 00:50:25.789
dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean
either via like the st. Lawrence River

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799
either via like the st. Lawrence River
 

00:50:25.799 --> 00:50:27.920
either via like the st. Lawrence River
up there the Hudson River up in the New

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:27.930
up there the Hudson River up in the New
 

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.380
up there the Hudson River up in the New
York area or via the Mississippi River

into the Gulf of Mexico now you've got

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180
into the Gulf of Mexico now you've got
 

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.539
into the Gulf of Mexico now you've got
all this water dumping back into the

00:50:35.539 --> 00:50:35.549
all this water dumping back into the
 

00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:37.400
all this water dumping back into the
ocean like I said ocean levels are

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.410
ocean like I said ocean levels are
 

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.559
ocean like I said ocean levels are
coming up hundreds of feet right so now

00:50:39.559 --> 00:50:39.569
coming up hundreds of feet right so now
 

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.749
coming up hundreds of feet right so now
you're adding all of this weight to the

00:50:41.749 --> 00:50:41.759
you're adding all of this weight to the
 

00:50:41.759 --> 00:50:44.209
you're adding all of this weight to the
ocean basin and now you've got the

00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:44.219
ocean basin and now you've got the
 

00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:45.680
ocean basin and now you've got the
mid-atlantic ridge which is some of the

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:45.690
mid-atlantic ridge which is some of the
 

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.559
mid-atlantic ridge which is some of the
thinnest crust on the earth right this

00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:48.569
thinnest crust on the earth right this
 

00:50:48.569 --> 00:50:51.079
thinnest crust on the earth right this
is what it's doing it's like a hinge

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:51.089
is what it's doing it's like a hinge
 

00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:52.049
is what it's doing it's like a hinge
line

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:52.059
line
 

00:50:52.059 --> 00:50:55.049
line
right so now you picture during a

00:50:55.049 --> 00:50:55.059
right so now you picture during a
 

00:50:55.059 --> 00:50:57.059
right so now you picture during a
glacial age when the weight is taken out

00:50:57.059 --> 00:50:57.069
glacial age when the weight is taken out
 

00:50:57.069 --> 00:51:00.509
glacial age when the weight is taken out
it does this lifts up lifts up listening

00:51:00.509 --> 00:51:00.519
it does this lifts up lifts up listening
 

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:04.529
it does this lifts up lifts up listening
not watching yeah when the ice melts the

00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:04.539
not watching yeah when the ice melts the
 

00:51:04.539 --> 00:51:06.509
not watching yeah when the ice melts the
water goes in sea level rises it

00:51:06.509 --> 00:51:06.519
water goes in sea level rises it
 

00:51:06.519 --> 00:51:09.509
water goes in sea level rises it
subsides right now you look at the

00:51:09.509 --> 00:51:09.519
subsides right now you look at the
 

00:51:09.519 --> 00:51:12.959
subsides right now you look at the
Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African

00:51:12.959 --> 00:51:12.969
Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African
 

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:16.019
Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African
plate that got left over when the

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:16.029
plate that got left over when the
 

00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:18.539
plate that got left over when the
continents separated around 70 to 80

00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:18.549
continents separated around 70 to 80
 

00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:21.989
continents separated around 70 to 80
million years ago right if we you've

00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:21.999
million years ago right if we you've
 

00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:24.029
million years ago right if we you've
seen the maps in the showing how you can

00:51:24.029 --> 00:51:24.039
seen the maps in the showing how you can
 

00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:26.579
seen the maps in the showing how you can
fit the contents together yeah if you

00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:26.589
fit the contents together yeah if you
 

00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:28.229
fit the contents together yeah if you
fit these back together if you if you

00:51:28.229 --> 00:51:28.239
fit these back together if you if you
 

00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:31.439
fit these back together if you if you
reverse continental drift go back about

00:51:31.439 --> 00:51:31.449
reverse continental drift go back about
 

00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:33.929
reverse continental drift go back about
70 or 80 million years and it's all fits

00:51:33.929 --> 00:51:33.939
70 or 80 million years and it's all fits
 

00:51:33.939 --> 00:51:35.549
70 or 80 million years and it's all fits
together like a piece of the puzzle but

00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559
together like a piece of the puzzle but
 

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.219
together like a piece of the puzzle but
when it's separated a piece of the of

00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:38.229
when it's separated a piece of the of
 

00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:41.009
when it's separated a piece of the of
the African plate got left behind and

00:51:41.009 --> 00:51:41.019
the African plate got left behind and
 

00:51:41.019 --> 00:51:43.559
the African plate got left behind and
this is what is the Azores Plateau and

00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:43.569
this is what is the Azores Plateau and
 

00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:45.599
this is what is the Azores Plateau and
it sits right there astride the

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:45.609
it sits right there astride the
 

00:51:45.609 --> 00:51:48.179
it sits right there astride the
mid-atlantic ridge it's maybe a little

00:51:48.179 --> 00:51:48.189
mid-atlantic ridge it's maybe a little
 

00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:50.339
mid-atlantic ridge it's maybe a little
bit smaller than the Maya then Iceland

00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:50.349
bit smaller than the Maya then Iceland
 

00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:52.109
bit smaller than the Maya then Iceland
which is considered to be an island but

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119
which is considered to be an island but
 

00:51:52.119 --> 00:51:55.019
which is considered to be an island but
of a pretty good sized island right now

00:51:55.019 --> 00:51:55.029
of a pretty good sized island right now
 

00:51:55.029 --> 00:51:58.019
of a pretty good sized island right now
if you're doing this and you have as

00:51:58.019 --> 00:51:58.029
if you're doing this and you have as
 

00:51:58.029 --> 00:51:59.819
if you're doing this and you have as
much as two or three thousand feet or

00:51:59.819 --> 00:51:59.829
much as two or three thousand feet or
 

00:51:59.829 --> 00:52:02.519
much as two or three thousand feet or
maybe more of this vertical movement

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:02.529
maybe more of this vertical movement
 

00:52:02.529 --> 00:52:04.469
maybe more of this vertical movement
right and you add to that to four

00:52:04.469 --> 00:52:04.479
right and you add to that to four
 

00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:06.479
right and you add to that to four
hundred feet of sea level rise

00:52:06.479 --> 00:52:06.489
hundred feet of sea level rise
 

00:52:06.489 --> 00:52:08.429
hundred feet of sea level rise
now you can I think begin to get a

00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:08.439
now you can I think begin to get a
 

00:52:08.439 --> 00:52:10.859
now you can I think begin to get a
scientific rationale for how you may

00:52:10.859 --> 00:52:10.869
scientific rationale for how you may
 

00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:12.630
scientific rationale for how you may
have had a large island in the

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640
have had a large island in the
 

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.439
have had a large island in the
mid-atlantic back during the Ice Age

00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:15.449
mid-atlantic back during the Ice Age
 

00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:18.239
mid-atlantic back during the Ice Age
also additional evidence have suggested

00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:18.249
also additional evidence have suggested
 

00:52:18.249 --> 00:52:21.390
also additional evidence have suggested
that the Gulf Stream which now basically

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400
that the Gulf Stream which now basically
 

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.069
that the Gulf Stream which now basically
brings subtropical warmth up to

00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079
brings subtropical warmth up to
 

00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:27.419
brings subtropical warmth up to
northwestern Europe I mean if you were

00:52:27.419 --> 00:52:27.429
northwestern Europe I mean if you were
 

00:52:27.429 --> 00:52:30.150
northwestern Europe I mean if you were
to terminate the Gulf Stream England

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160
to terminate the Gulf Stream England
 

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.319
to terminate the Gulf Stream England
would would have some pretty pretty

00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:33.329
would would have some pretty pretty
 

00:52:33.329 --> 00:52:35.999
would would have some pretty pretty
malignant times so in northwestern

00:52:35.999 --> 00:52:36.009
malignant times so in northwestern
 

00:52:36.009 --> 00:52:37.949
malignant times so in northwestern
Europe because the warmth is being

00:52:37.949 --> 00:52:37.959
Europe because the warmth is being
 

00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:41.029
Europe because the warmth is being
brought up by that Gulf Stream right

00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:41.039
brought up by that Gulf Stream right
 

00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:43.079
brought up by that Gulf Stream right
well during the Ice Age of the Gulf

00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:43.089
well during the Ice Age of the Gulf
 

00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:46.019
well during the Ice Age of the Gulf
Stream diverted to the south at about 45

00:52:46.019 --> 00:52:46.029
Stream diverted to the south at about 45
 

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:48.749
Stream diverted to the south at about 45
to 46 degrees which was hundreds of

00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:48.759
to 46 degrees which was hundreds of
 

00:52:48.759 --> 00:52:51.479
to 46 degrees which was hundreds of
miles farther south than it now goes so

00:52:51.479 --> 00:52:51.489
miles farther south than it now goes so
 

00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:53.849
miles farther south than it now goes so
essentially if you look at the Azores

00:52:53.849 --> 00:52:53.859
essentially if you look at the Azores
 

00:52:53.859 --> 00:52:56.339
essentially if you look at the Azores
plateau a big chunk of that Azores

00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:56.349
plateau a big chunk of that Azores
 

00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:58.499
plateau a big chunk of that Azores
Plateau would have been above sea level

00:52:58.499 --> 00:52:58.509
Plateau would have been above sea level
 

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:00.989
Plateau would have been above sea level
during the Ice Age and that Gulf Stream

00:53:00.989 --> 00:53:00.999
during the Ice Age and that Gulf Stream
 

00:53:00.999 --> 00:53:02.699
during the Ice Age and that Gulf Stream
with its warmth would have just

00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:02.709
with its warmth would have just
 

00:53:02.709 --> 00:53:05.330
with its warmth would have just
basically embraced at sea

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:05.340
basically embraced at sea
 

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.190
basically embraced at sea

Age that's probably where you might want

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940
Age that's probably where you might want
 

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.760
Age that's probably where you might want
to go is the Azores Plateau it might

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:13.770
to go is the Azores Plateau it might
 

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:15.230
to go is the Azores Plateau it might
have been of one of the most benign

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240
have been of one of the most benign
 

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.000
have been of one of the most benign

places on earth to live during the Ice
 

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:19.580
places on earth to live during the Ice

civilization could evolve that would be
 

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.990
civilization could evolve that would be
a very logical place for it to occur

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000
a very logical place for it to occur

by putting all these environmental
regulations on Natural Resources and

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:46.080
regulations on Natural Resources and
 

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.530
regulations on Natural Resources and
then the the left which is screaming at

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540
then the the left which is screaming at
 

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.150
then the the left which is screaming at
the top of their lungs that the sky is

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160
the top of their lungs that the sky is
 

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.430
the top of their lungs that the sky is
following the oceans are gonna rise and

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440
following the oceans are gonna rise and
 

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.130
following the oceans are gonna rise and
people are gonna drown when you when you

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140
people are gonna drown when you when you
 

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.350
people are gonna drown when you when you
know so much about what has happened

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:57.360
know so much about what has happened
 

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.380
know so much about what has happened
over the course of the earth when you've

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:00.390
over the course of the earth when you've
 

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.630
over the course of the earth when you've
studied this for a great deal of time

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640
studied this for a great deal of time
 

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.550
studied this for a great deal of time
like you have what is your take on all

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:04.560
like you have what is your take on all
 

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.440
like you have what is your take on all
this stuff well I guess my take is is is

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:08.450
this stuff well I guess my take is is is
 

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:12.170
this stuff well I guess my take is is is
fairly simple I I tend to think that you

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180
fairly simple I I tend to think that you
 

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.600
fairly simple I I tend to think that you
know if you know if you look at the the

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:14.610
know if you know if you look at the the
 

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:17.540
know if you know if you look at the the
the whole process of if you look at the

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:17.550
the whole process of if you look at the
 

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:18.980
the whole process of if you look at the
carbon cycle for example

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:18.990
carbon cycle for example
 

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.260
carbon cycle for example
what what you see there is interesting

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:21.270
what what you see there is interesting
 

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.359
what what you see there is interesting
we have to I can talk to this into this

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:23.369
we have to I can talk to this into this
 

00:55:23.369 --> 00:55:25.280
we have to I can talk to this into this
as much as possible yeah have as little

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:25.290
as much as possible yeah have as little
 

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.590
as much as possible yeah have as little
variation in the tone as possible thank

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:27.600
variation in the tone as possible thank
 

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.160
variation in the tone as possible thank
you you know putting this into context

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.170
you you know putting this into context
 

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.380
you you know putting this into context
we have to say right now we're

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:33.390
we have to say right now we're
 

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:37.520
we have to say right now we're
approaching 400 parts per million of the

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:37.530
approaching 400 parts per million of the
 

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.240
approaching 400 parts per million of the
ambient amount of co2 in the atmosphere

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:40.250
ambient amount of co2 in the atmosphere
 

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.290
ambient amount of co2 in the atmosphere
at the beginning of the Industrial

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300
at the beginning of the Industrial
 

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.850
at the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution it was about a hundred parts

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:43.860
Revolution it was about a hundred parts
 

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.450
Revolution it was about a hundred parts
per million less it's you could say

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460
per million less it's you could say
 

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.820
per million less it's you could say
basically that over the last century we

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:49.830
basically that over the last century we
 

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.500
basically that over the last century we
have increased the amount of co2

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:51.510
have increased the amount of co2
 

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:53.140
have increased the amount of co2
measurable co2 into the atmosphere

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:53.150
measurable co2 into the atmosphere
 

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:55.070
measurable co2 into the atmosphere
assuming that it's all from us now I

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:55.080
assuming that it's all from us now I
 

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.109
assuming that it's all from us now I
mean there's questions about that too

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119
mean there's questions about that too
 

00:55:57.119 --> 00:55:58.820
mean there's questions about that too
because if there are other factors

00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:58.830
because if there are other factors
 

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.370
because if there are other factors
inducing global warming such as changes

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380
inducing global warming such as changes
 

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.470
inducing global warming such as changes
in solar irradiance the amount of

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480
in solar irradiance the amount of
 

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.330
in solar irradiance the amount of
insulation penetrating the atmosphere

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:05.340
insulation penetrating the atmosphere
 

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.670
insulation penetrating the atmosphere
and so on it means that the oceans are

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680
and so on it means that the oceans are
 

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.040
and so on it means that the oceans are
warming as a result of that okay

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:10.050
warming as a result of that okay
 

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:12.440
warming as a result of that okay
oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:12.450
oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide
 

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:17.330
oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide
sink when they're warm they exude carbon

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:17.340
sink when they're warm they exude carbon
 

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.520
sink when they're warm they exude carbon
dioxide when they're cold they absorb it

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:19.530
dioxide when they're cold they absorb it
 

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.490
dioxide when they're cold they absorb it
right so if you have a natural warming

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500
right so if you have a natural warming
 

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.180
right so if you have a natural warming
it's going to expel some carbon dioxide

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.190
it's going to expel some carbon dioxide
 

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.340
it's going to expel some carbon dioxide
so it's not even clear necessarily that

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:28.350
so it's not even clear necessarily that
 

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.560
so it's not even clear necessarily that
that 100 parts per million is totally

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:30.570
that 100 parts per million is totally
 

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:33.250
that 100 parts per million is totally
the result of fossil fuel burning but

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:33.260
the result of fossil fuel burning but
 

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.390
the result of fossil fuel burning but
for the sake of argument let's say that

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400
for the sake of argument let's say that
 

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.210
for the sake of argument let's say that
it is okay a hundred parts per million

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220
it is okay a hundred parts per million
 

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:42.260
it is okay a hundred parts per million
that's minuscule trace of this very

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:42.270
that's minuscule trace of this very
 

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.330
that's minuscule trace of this very
important constituents of our atmosphere

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:44.340
important constituents of our atmosphere
 

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.790
important constituents of our atmosphere
you know that carbon dioxide is what

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800
you know that carbon dioxide is what
 

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.090
you know that carbon dioxide is what
fuels photosynthesis right and if you

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:50.100
fuels photosynthesis right and if you
 

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.770
fuels photosynthesis right and if you
start reducing the amount of carbon

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780
start reducing the amount of carbon
 

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.510
start reducing the amount of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere and you start

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520
dioxide in the atmosphere and you start
 

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.520
dioxide in the atmosphere and you start
once you start dropping below 200 parts

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:55.530
once you start dropping below 200 parts
 

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:56.960
once you start dropping below 200 parts
per million and you get down to about

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:56.970
per million and you get down to about
 

00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.770
per million and you get down to about
150 to 100 photosynthesis plant food of

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780
150 to 100 photosynthesis plant food of
 

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.349
150 to 100 photosynthesis plant food of
synthesis starts shutting down I mean

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359
synthesis starts shutting down I mean
 

00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:05.540
synthesis starts shutting down I mean
it's kind of like the amount of co2 in

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:05.550
it's kind of like the amount of co2 in
 

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.099
it's kind of like the amount of co2 in
the atmosphere right now is at the very

00:57:07.099 --> 00:57:07.109
the atmosphere right now is at the very
 

00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:10.160
the atmosphere right now is at the very
bottom of the scale you know if we look

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.170
bottom of the scale you know if we look
 

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.050
bottom of the scale you know if we look
at history going back when you mentioned

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:12.060
at history going back when you mentioned
 

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.609
at history going back when you mentioned
the cretaceous-tertiary when the

00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619
the cretaceous-tertiary when the
 

00:57:13.619 --> 00:57:16.940
the cretaceous-tertiary when the
dinosaurs ruled there have been many

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:16.950
dinosaurs ruled there have been many
 

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:21.020
dinosaurs ruled there have been many
times more the the amount of co2 up to

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.030
times more the the amount of co2 up to
 

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:23.000
times more the the amount of co2 up to
well in excess of a thousand parts per

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:23.010
well in excess of a thousand parts per
 

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:23.660
well in excess of a thousand parts per
million

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:23.670
million
 

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:25.730

several thousand parts per million in

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740
several thousand parts per million in
 

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.910
several thousand parts per million in
the atmosphere but if we have increased

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920
the atmosphere but if we have increased
 

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.700
the atmosphere but if we have increased
the amount of co2 by 100 parts per

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:31.710
the amount of co2 by 100 parts per
 

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:32.190

million
 

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.069
million
in a hundred years it means we've for

00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079
in a hundred years it means we've for
 

00:57:35.079 --> 00:57:38.430
in a hundred years it means we've for
every million molecules of air up there

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440
every million molecules of air up there
 

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.140
every million molecules of air up there
we add one molecule of co2 every year or

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:43.150
we add one molecule of co2 every year or
 

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.150
we add one molecule of co2 every year or
two maybe try to make it a little bit

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160
two maybe try to make it a little bit
 

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.809
two maybe try to make it a little bit
more comprehensible if for every hundred

00:57:48.809 --> 00:57:48.819
more comprehensible if for every hundred
 

00:57:48.819 --> 00:57:52.589
more comprehensible if for every hundred
thousand molecules of air up there every

thousand molecules of air up there every
 

00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:58.200
thousand molecules of air up there every
10 years we add one molecule of co2 I'm

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.210
10 years we add one molecule of co2 I'm
 

00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.880
10 years we add one molecule of co2 I'm
not convinced that that's going to lead

00:57:59.880 --> 00:57:59.890
not convinced that that's going to lead
 

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.410
not convinced that that's going to lead
to global catastrophe

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:01.420
to global catastrophe
 

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.730
to global catastrophe
I mean think of it this way you got a

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:02.740
I mean think of it this way you got a
 

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.829
I mean think of it this way you got a
huge tank with a hundred thousand fish

00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839
huge tank with a hundred thousand fish
 

00:58:04.839 --> 00:58:07.470
huge tank with a hundred thousand fish
in it every 10 years you're throwing one

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480
in it every 10 years you're throwing one
 

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.720
in it every 10 years you're throwing one
more fish are you even going to notice

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:09.730
more fish are you even going to notice
 

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:12.660
more fish are you even going to notice
that you know I think that what's

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:12.670
that you know I think that what's
 

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.630
that you know I think that what's
happened is that co2 like I said is one

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640
happened is that co2 like I said is one
 

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.299
happened is that co2 like I said is one
variable in a very complex equation but

does Bayes me is that we're told that

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240
does Bayes me is that we're told that

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.859
scientists don't agree when you have
though a major government funded program

00:58:40.859 --> 00:58:40.869
though a major government funded program
 

00:58:40.869 --> 00:58:43.799
though a major government funded program
like climate change research which is

00:58:43.799 --> 00:58:43.809
like climate change research which is
 

00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:45.750
like climate change research which is
funded to the tune of about two billion

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760
funded to the tune of about two billion
 

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.720
funded to the tune of about two billion
dollars per year you're gonna have a

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:48.730
dollars per year you're gonna have a
 

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.589
dollars per year you're gonna have a
large vested interest in basically I

00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599
large vested interest in basically I
 

00:58:52.599 --> 00:58:55.770
large vested interest in basically I
mean if these guys came out and said nah

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:55.780
mean if these guys came out and said nah
 

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.900
mean if these guys came out and said nah
co2 is really not a big deal it's

00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:57.910
co2 is really not a big deal it's
 

00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:02.940
co2 is really not a big deal it's
perhaps fueling plant growth and this is

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:02.950
perhaps fueling plant growth and this is
 

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:04.500
perhaps fueling plant growth and this is
an interesting aside you know if you

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:04.510
an interesting aside you know if you
 

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.470
an interesting aside you know if you
look at the the projections of forests

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480
look at the the projections of forests
 

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.569
look at the the projections of forests
and inventory back in the 50s and 60s

00:59:09.569 --> 00:59:09.579

inventories were going to rebound if you

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:22.630
inventories were going to rebound if you
 

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:24.059
inventories were going to rebound if you
look at those projections back in the

00:59:24.059 --> 00:59:24.069
look at those projections back in the
 

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:27.450
look at those projections back in the
50s and 60s and then you realize that in

really started looking at this date of
just how much forest there was compared

00:59:45.059 --> 00:59:45.069
just how much forest there was compared
 

00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.730
just how much forest there was compared
to what the

forest growth well it's very likely that
 

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.680
forest growth well it's very likely that
at least part of it was because of the

at least part of it was because of the
 

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:05.290
at least part of it was because of the
slight increase in co2 there's a result

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:05.300
slight increase in co2 there's a result
 

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.320
slight increase in co2 there's a result
as a result of our fossil fuel burning

as a result of our fossil fuel burning
 

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:11.400
as a result of our fossil fuel burning
now we put in every year we burn about

billion tons of co2 well there's about

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200
billion tons of co2 well there's about
 

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.270
billion tons of co2 well there's about
750 or 760 billion tons of co2 in the

750 or 760 billion tons of co2 in the
 

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.450
750 or 760 billion tons of co2 in the

from atmosphere into the biosphere into
 

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.960
from atmosphere into the biosphere into
the oceans and so on so our contribution

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:33.970
the oceans and so on so our contribution
 

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:37.030

isn't really that significant but

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040
isn't really that significant but
 

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.109
isn't really that significant but
another part of the the argument is that

01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119
another part of the the argument is that

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:47.510
of fossil fuel that we're burning there
 

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.090
of fossil fuel that we're burning there
should be twice as much co2 into the

what has actually provoked the planet to
go into a full ice age or what has

go into a full ice age or what has
caused it to come out of an ice age if

still have a hell of a lot to learn
 

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.330
still have a hell of a lot to learn
about how the climate works so I get

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:52.340
about how the climate works so I get
 

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.920
about how the climate works so I get
really frustrated when I hear this claim

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:53.930
really frustrated when I hear this claim
 

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:55.599

that the debate is over the debate is
 

01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:58.150
that the debate is over the debate is
over because the debate hasn't really

you see we need to really look at all of

01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:02.369
you see we need to really look at all of
 

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:05.000
you see we need to really look at all of
these other factors as well I mean when

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.010
these other factors as well I mean when
 

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.950
these other factors as well I mean when
you look at wind currents and ocean

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960
you look at wind currents and ocean
 

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.000
you look at wind currents and ocean
currents you have the the El Nino

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.010
currents you have the the El Nino
 

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.579

Southern Oscillation you have the the
 

01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:13.130
Southern Oscillation you have the the
the Indian Ocean dipole you have the

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140
the Indian Ocean dipole you have the
 

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.770
the Indian Ocean dipole you have the
Pacific decadal oscillation all of these

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780
Pacific decadal oscillation all of these
 

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.720
Pacific decadal oscillation all of these
things have a very profound influence on

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:17.730
things have a very profound influence on
 

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:19.790
things have a very profound influence on
the climate but they're essentially

you know yourself if you walk out you
 

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:21.060
you know yourself if you walk out you
know if you're walking in a field and

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:21.070
know if you're walking in a field and
 

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:24.500
know if you're walking in a field and
then you walk onto a asphalt parking lot

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.510
then you walk onto a asphalt parking lot
 

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.640
then you walk onto a asphalt parking lot
immediately it's it's much much hotter

satellite sensors basically what they're
 

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:42.270
satellite sensors basically what they're
showing is that the average global

temperature from that perspective it
 

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.689
temperature from that perspective it
hasn't warmed in 15 yeah now there are

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:00.699
hasn't warmed in 15 yeah now there are
 

01:12:00.699 --> 01:12:03.570
hasn't warmed in 15 yeah now there are
regional pockets of warming and you know

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:03.580
regional pockets of warming and you know
 

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.060
regional pockets of warming and you know
records being set all the time because

about the urban heat island effect is is
 

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:17.580
about the urban heat island effect is is
a local or regional condition but

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:17.590
a local or regional condition but
 

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:20.040
a local or regional condition but
because of the fact that the climate

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:20.050
because of the fact that the climate
 

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:22.250

now we don't talk about global warming

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:27.370
now we don't talk about global warming
 

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:29.910
now we don't talk about global warming
we talked about climate change but those

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920
we talked about climate change but those
 

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.010

global warming is a very specific model
of climate change which is that you've

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:37.030
of climate change which is that you've
 

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:41.340

climate scientists who say human
 

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.900
climate scientists who say human
activity is contributing to climate

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:21.910
activity is contributing to climate
 

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:25.200
activity is contributing to climate

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.210
change and rising sea levels human
 

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.090

activity is contributing to climate

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:27.100
activity is contributing to climate
 

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.430
activity is contributing to climate
change no doubt there's no doubt that

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440
change no doubt there's no doubt that
 

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.230
change no doubt there's no doubt that
human activity contributes to climate

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:31.240
human activity contributes to climate
 

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.660
human activity contributes to climate
change human activity again is one

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:33.670
change human activity again is one
 

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:36.420
change human activity again is one

I wish Mark Marco Rubio would keep his

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:40.300
I wish Mark Marco Rubio would keep his
 

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.720
I wish Mark Marco Rubio would keep his
mouth shut until he goes and spends

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:42.730
mouth shut until he goes and spends
 

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:45.000
mouth shut until he goes and spends
about six months or a year really doing

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.010
about six months or a year really doing
 

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.740
about six months or a year really doing
the homework because then he could talk

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:46.750
the homework because then he could talk
 

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:49.230
the homework because then he could talk
a little bit more intelligently about it

01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:49.240
a little bit more intelligently about it
 

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.030
a little bit more intelligently about it
but that is the problem right it really

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040
but that is the problem right it really
 

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.610
but that is the problem right it really
does take that long it does like he I

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:53.620
does take that long it does like he I
 

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.460
does take that long it does like he I
know you I've wanted I meet you at six

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:56.470
know you I've wanted I meet you at six
 

01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:58.380
know you I've wanted I meet you at six
seven years ago something like that yeah

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:58.390
seven years ago something like that yeah
 

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:02.390
seven years ago something like that yeah
and you had already spent decades

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400
and you had already spent decades
 

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.130
and you had already spent decades
observing the effects of climate change

and of asteroid Olymp acts and the

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:08.230
and of asteroid Olymp acts and the
 

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.260
and of asteroid Olymp acts and the
history of these things I mean the

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:10.270
history of these things I mean the
 

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:12.780
history of these things I mean the
amount of time just absorbing the

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:12.790
amount of time just absorbing the
 

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.370
amount of time just absorbing the
information so you can rattle it off

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:14.380
information so you can rattle it off
 

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.410
information so you can rattle it off
like this in a podcast I mean what the

01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:16.420
like this in a podcast I mean what the
 

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.450
like this in a podcast I mean what the
fuck got you into this like the how did

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:18.460
fuck got you into this like the how did
 

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.450
fuck got you into this like the how did
you get down this rabbit hole

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460
you get down this rabbit hole
 

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:24.840
you get down this rabbit hole
well this is an odd rabbit hole right

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:24.850
well this is an odd rabbit hole right
 

01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:26.340
well this is an odd rabbit hole right
it's an odd rabbit hole it's a

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:26.350
it's an odd rabbit hole it's a
 

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:28.260
it's an odd rabbit hole it's a
fascinating rabbit hole I'm so thankful

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:28.270
fascinating rabbit hole I'm so thankful
 

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:30.479
fascinating rabbit hole I'm so thankful
not only that you've gone down but that

01:15:30.479 --> 01:15:30.489
not only that you've gone down but that
 

01:15:30.489 --> 01:15:32.130
not only that you've gone down but that
you're willing to exchange this

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:32.140
you're willing to exchange this
 

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.920
you're willing to exchange this

because it's it's a very different

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:37.420
because it's it's a very different
 

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.520
because it's it's a very different
perspective because I know you're not a

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:38.530
perspective because I know you're not a
 

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:40.020
perspective because I know you're not a
right-wing lunatic you're a very

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:40.030
right-wing lunatic you're a very
 

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.750
right-wing lunatic you're a very
science-based guy but you're you're

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760
science-based guy but you're you're
 

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.190
science-based guy but you're you're
looking at this and the way you're

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:44.200
looking at this and the way you're
 

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.310
looking at this and the way you're
explaining it is incredibly rational and

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320
explaining it is incredibly rational and
 

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.080
explaining it is incredibly rational and
incredibly frustrating to me that

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:49.090
incredibly frustrating to me that
 

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:51.900
incredibly frustrating to me that
there's not that many people that are

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:51.910
there's not that many people that are
 

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:55.110
there's not that many people that are
that are that are saying this well the

01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120
that are that are saying this well the
 

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.390
that are that are saying this well the
upside I think of the whole global

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400
upside I think of the whole global
 

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.190
upside I think of the whole global
warming issue or the climate change

01:15:59.190 --> 01:15:59.200
warming issue or the climate change
 

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.300
warming issue or the climate change
issue is this that if you know the thing

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:03.310
issue is this that if you know the thing
 

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.310
issue is this that if you know the thing
is is I made the point that even if we

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320
is is I made the point that even if we
 

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.190
is is I made the point that even if we
stopped all fossil fuel consumption

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:08.200
stopped all fossil fuel consumption
 

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.530
stopped all fossil fuel consumption
tomorrow the climate is still going to

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:10.540
tomorrow the climate is still going to
 

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.520
tomorrow the climate is still going to
change and it's going to change

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:11.530
change and it's going to change
 

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.200
change and it's going to change
dramatically it's going to change

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:13.210
dramatically it's going to change
 

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:16.709
dramatically it's going to change
sometimes even catastrophic ly what we

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719
sometimes even catastrophic ly what we
 

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.570
sometimes even catastrophic ly what we
need to do from here on out is basically

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:18.580
need to do from here on out is basically
 

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.080
need to do from here on out is basically
think about strategies of adaptability

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:21.090
think about strategies of adaptability
 

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:25.250
think about strategies of adaptability
if as a result of this whole issue even

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260
if as a result of this whole issue even
 

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:28.140
if as a result of this whole issue even
even though I think it's miss based miss

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:28.150
even though I think it's miss based miss
 

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:32.880
even though I think it's miss based miss
you know miss applied if part of it that

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:32.890
you know miss applied if part of it that
 

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.740
you know miss applied if part of it that
comes out of this is that we begin to

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:34.750
comes out of this is that we begin to
 

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:36.840
comes out of this is that we begin to
develop strategies of adaptability that

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:36.850
develop strategies of adaptability that
 

01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:39.570
develop strategies of adaptability that
would be a good thing if however we

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:39.580
would be a good thing if however we
 

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.450
would be a good thing if however we
focus so exclusively on carbon dioxide

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:42.460
focus so exclusively on carbon dioxide
 

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.180
focus so exclusively on carbon dioxide
to the exclusion of everything else that

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.190
to the exclusion of everything else that
 

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.360
to the exclusion of everything else that
could be a bad thing

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:47.370
could be a bad thing
 

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.650
could be a bad thing
because the climate is going to change

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:49.660
because the climate is going to change
 

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.900
because the climate is going to change
no matter what we do or where we go with

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:51.910
no matter what we do or where we go with
 

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:53.430
no matter what we do or where we go with
it the climate is going to change so you

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440
it the climate is going to change so you
 

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.650
it the climate is going to change so you
can put up solar panels until the cows

01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:55.660
can put up solar panels until the cows
 

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.220
can put up solar panels until the cows
come home

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:56.230
come home
 

01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:58.170
come home
the houses that are on the beach in

01:16:58.170 --> 01:16:58.180
the houses that are on the beach in
 

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.640
the houses that are on the beach in
Malibu are still gonna be underwater in

01:16:59.640 --> 01:16:59.650
Malibu are still gonna be underwater in
 

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:01.290
Malibu are still gonna be underwater in
a hundred years well not necessarily

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:01.300
a hundred years well not necessarily
 

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.600
a hundred years well not necessarily
know I'm Sarah Lee so buy real estate in

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:03.610
know I'm Sarah Lee so buy real estate in
 

01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:08.610
know I'm Sarah Lee so buy real estate in
Malibu well see the thing is if you look

01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:08.620
Malibu well see the thing is if you look
 

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.470
Malibu well see the thing is if you look
at the I mentioned earlier that there

01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480
at the I mentioned earlier that there
 

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.479
at the I mentioned earlier that there
was a break in the in the Little Ice Age

01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:12.489
was a break in the in the Little Ice Age
 

01:17:12.489 --> 01:17:15.720
was a break in the in the Little Ice Age
of about 150 years that basically led to

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:15.730
of about 150 years that basically led to
 

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:18.390
of about 150 years that basically led to
the Renaissance right well we've been in

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400
the Renaissance right well we've been in
 

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.140
the Renaissance right well we've been in
a recession of the Little Ice Age an

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.150
a recession of the Little Ice Age an
 

01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:24.120
a recession of the Little Ice Age an
interruption of the Little Ice Age for

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.130
interruption of the Little Ice Age for
 

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:27.600
interruption of the Little Ice Age for
about 150 years and right now you know

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:27.610
about 150 years and right now you know
 

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:29.550
about 150 years and right now you know
and again the IPC one of the things that

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560
and again the IPC one of the things that
 

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.720
and again the IPC one of the things that
frustrates me is that they basically

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:30.730
frustrates me is that they basically
 

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.910
frustrates me is that they basically
exclude solar physicists and solar

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920
exclude solar physicists and solar
 

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.690
exclude solar physicists and solar
scientists

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:33.700
scientists
 

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.640
scientists
are essentially saying that insulation

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:35.650
are essentially saying that insulation
 

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:38.250
are essentially saying that insulation
levels insulation the amount of solar

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:38.260
levels insulation the amount of solar
 

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:40.680
levels insulation the amount of solar
energy penetrating the atmosphere is

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:40.690
energy penetrating the atmosphere is
 

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.320
energy penetrating the atmosphere is
that one of the lowest levels in in

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:43.330
that one of the lowest levels in in
 

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:47.070
that one of the lowest levels in in
thousands of years and I mean there are

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080
thousands of years and I mean there are
 

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.290
thousands of years and I mean there are
our solar physicists that are saying you

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:49.300
our solar physicists that are saying you
 

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.400
our solar physicists that are saying you
know what we could be at the beginning

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:50.410
know what we could be at the beginning
 

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:52.910
know what we could be at the beginning
of another phase of the Little Ice Age

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920
of another phase of the Little Ice Age
 

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.950
of another phase of the Little Ice Age
now if our co2 is helping to ameliorate

01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960
now if our co2 is helping to ameliorate
 

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.320
now if our co2 is helping to ameliorate
somewhat a return to little little ice

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:01.330
somewhat a return to little little ice
 

01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:03.690

getting out of this coal and muscle cars

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560
getting out of this coal and muscle cars

so the chemicals that they used in order
 

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.939
so the chemicals that they used in order

01:21:06.939 --> 01:21:06.949
to break up yeah that was what the issue
 

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:10.030

but I think you know what we'll see is
 

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:42.970

turn out in the end

01:21:51.129 --> 01:21:51.139
turn out in the end
 

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.110
turn out in the end
looking at all this is that nature is

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:09.459
536 and 540 ad that I talked about
earlier may have been triggered by a

we're starting to realize our Eggman's
we're starting to realize how little we

we're starting to realize how little we

we're starting to realize how little we
know about our own history the history

know about our own history the history
 

01:27:56.719 --> 01:27:59.529
know about our own history the history
of this particular species and how it's

environment of Earth and how many times
we've been hit by rocks yeah and see you

01:28:07.839 --> 01:28:07.849
we've been hit by rocks yeah and see you
 

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.339
we've been hit by rocks yeah and see you
know a hundred years ago the assumption

01:28:09.339 --> 01:28:09.349
know a hundred years ago the assumption
 

01:28:09.349 --> 01:28:11.589
know a hundred years ago the assumption
was one of these these images of these

01:28:11.589 --> 01:28:11.599
was one of these these images of these
 

01:28:11.599 --> 01:28:14.620
was one of these these images of these
craters or impacts ah yeah that's that's

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:14.630
craters or impacts ah yeah that's that's
 

01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:16.839
craters or impacts ah yeah that's that's
actually ten years old but it shows now

01:28:16.839 --> 01:28:16.849
actually ten years old but it shows now
 

01:28:16.849 --> 01:28:19.810
actually ten years old but it shows now
all the identified impacts and this is

01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:19.820
all the identified impacts and this is
 

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.580
all the identified impacts and this is
ten years old so since then some new

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:21.590
ten years old so since then some new
 

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:23.859
ten years old so since then some new
ones have oh does a dozens more yeah and

01:28:23.859 --> 01:28:23.869
ones have oh does a dozens more yeah and
 

01:28:23.869 --> 01:28:26.319
ones have oh does a dozens more yeah and
since then has been discovery of this

01:28:26.319 --> 01:28:26.329
since then has been discovery of this
 

01:28:26.329 --> 01:28:28.779
since then has been discovery of this
new clear glass that they've found all

01:28:28.779 --> 01:28:28.789
new clear glass that they've found all
 

01:28:28.789 --> 01:28:32.410
new clear glass that they've found all
over Europe and all over Asia I think

01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:32.420
over Europe and all over Asia I think
 

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.479
over Europe and all over Asia I think
are you referring to the possibly the

01:28:34.479 --> 01:28:34.489
are you referring to the possibly the
 

01:28:34.489 --> 01:28:36.609
are you referring to the possibly the
the thing that Graham was talking about

01:28:36.609 --> 01:28:36.619
the thing that Graham was talking about
 

01:28:36.619 --> 01:28:40.120
the thing that Graham was talking about
the the 13,000 year ago event I think I

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.130
the the 13,000 year ago event I think I
 

01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:41.620
the the 13,000 year ago event I think I
think that's what it is what

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:41.630
think that's what it is what
 

01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:43.120
think that's what it is what
I'm referring to is there was a

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.130
I'm referring to is there was a
 

01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:46.300
I'm referring to is there was a
mainstream report about all these these

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:46.310
mainstream report about all these these
 

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:50.080
mainstream report about all these these
pieces of this very similar material to

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:50.090
pieces of this very similar material to
 

01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:52.090
pieces of this very similar material to
what they find at nuclear blast yes

01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:52.100
what they find at nuclear blast yes
 

01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.340
what they find at nuclear blast yes
and that it was all over the place at

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:54.350
and that it was all over the place at
 

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:56.470
and that it was all over the place at
when they did the core samples around

01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480
when they did the core samples around
 

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.540
when they did the core samples around
12,000 years ago yes then that's exactly

01:28:58.540 --> 01:28:58.550
12,000 years ago yes then that's exactly
 

01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:00.850
12,000 years ago yes then that's exactly
what Graham's talking about yeah and and

01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:00.860
what Graham's talking about yeah and and
 

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.100
what Graham's talking about yeah and and
yes the evidence is getting stronger and

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:03.110
yes the evidence is getting stronger and
 

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:05.560
yes the evidence is getting stronger and
stronger each year that there have there

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:05.570
stronger each year that there have there
 

01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:07.690
stronger each year that there have there
may have been a multiple impact event

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:07.700
may have been a multiple impact event
 

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:10.510
may have been a multiple impact event
that terminated the ice age and this

01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520
that terminated the ice age and this
 

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.850
that terminated the ice age and this
still a very controversial idea because

01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:12.860
still a very controversial idea because
 

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.610
still a very controversial idea because
the gradualists just don't want to go

01:29:15.610 --> 01:29:15.620
the gradualists just don't want to go
 

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.070
the gradualists just don't want to go
there and this is probably what killed

01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080
there and this is probably what killed
 

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.810
there and this is probably what killed
off mass extinction of the woolly

01:29:19.810 --> 01:29:19.820
off mass extinction of the woolly
 

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.310
off mass extinction of the woolly
mammoth mass extinction of the

01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320
mammoth mass extinction of the
 

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.950
mammoth mass extinction of the
saber-tooth Tiger yes and a series of

01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960
saber-tooth Tiger yes and a series of
 

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.170
saber-tooth Tiger yes and a series of
animals that they really have not

01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:26.180
animals that they really have not
 

01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.090
animals that they really have not
figured out why like there's there's

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:28.100
figured out why like there's there's
 

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.340
figured out why like there's there's
been all sorts of theories about why the

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:30.350
been all sorts of theories about why the
 

01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.260
been all sorts of theories about why the
woolly mammoth went extinct and some of

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:32.270
woolly mammoth went extinct and some of
 

01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:34.240
woolly mammoth went extinct and some of
them are ridiculous like that people did

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:34.250
them are ridiculous like that people did
 

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:36.010
them are ridiculous like that people did
it you know I'm glad to hear you say

01:29:36.010 --> 01:29:36.020
it you know I'm glad to hear you say
 

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:37.900
it you know I'm glad to hear you say
that that's ridiculous idea well it's

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:37.910
that that's ridiculous idea well it's
 

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.220
that that's ridiculous idea well it's
ridiculous when you think about what

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:39.230
ridiculous when you think about what
 

01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:41.050
ridiculous when you think about what
kind of people were around 12,000 years

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:41.060
kind of people were around 12,000 years
 

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.460
kind of people were around 12,000 years
ago and what kind of weapons they had

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:42.470
ago and what kind of weapons they had

image and the next one you'll be able to
 

01:31:50.599 --> 01:31:54.669
image and the next one you'll be able to
see yeah this was how the woolly mammoth

01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679
see yeah this was how the woolly mammoth
 

01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:57.939
see yeah this was how the woolly mammoth
was found and so they took photos of it

01:31:57.939 --> 01:31:57.949
was found and so they took photos of it
 

01:31:57.949 --> 01:31:59.229
was found and so they took photos of it
when it was found like this and then

01:31:59.229 --> 01:31:59.239
when it was found like this and then
 

01:31:59.239 --> 01:32:00.669
when it was found like this and then
they left it alone and the wolf's came

01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679
they left it alone and the wolf's came
 

01:32:00.679 --> 01:32:02.350
they left it alone and the wolf's came
and got it this is not this is a

reconstruction guys I believe in the

01:32:04.209 --> 01:32:04.219
reconstruction guys I believe in the
 

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.640
reconstruction guys I believe in the
Leningrad Museum so what they did was

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:06.650
Leningrad Museum so what they did was
 

01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:08.080
Leningrad Museum so what they did was
they took the remains of the woolly

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.090
they took the remains of the woolly
 

01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:10.239
they took the remains of the woolly
mammoth and in taxidermists came in and

01:32:10.239 --> 01:32:10.249
mammoth and in taxidermists came in and
 

01:32:10.249 --> 01:32:13.000
mammoth and in taxidermists came in and
reconstructed but this shows the

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:13.010
reconstructed but this shows the
 

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:14.500
reconstructed but this shows the
position in which he was found sitting

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:14.510
position in which he was found sitting
 

01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:18.819
position in which he was found sitting
on his haunches like that and at the

01:32:18.819 --> 01:32:18.829
on his haunches like that and at the
 

01:32:18.829 --> 01:32:21.040
on his haunches like that and at the
time that the woolly mammoth met his

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.050
time that the woolly mammoth met his
 

01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:23.890
time that the woolly mammoth met his
demise he was eating flowering plants

01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:23.900
demise he was eating flowering plants
 

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.810
demise he was eating flowering plants
right now it's important to keep that in

01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:25.820
right now it's important to keep that in
 

01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:29.049
right now it's important to keep that in
mind his stomach was full of about two

01:32:29.049 --> 01:32:29.059
mind his stomach was full of about two
 

01:32:29.059 --> 01:32:31.689

sedges and things that he had been
 

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:35.830
sedges and things that he had been
munching on up in Siberia at the time

munching on up in Siberia at the time
 

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.370
munching on up in Siberia at the time
that he that he met his death number of

that he that he met his death number of
 

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.350
that he that he met his death number of
interesting things the contents of his

interesting things the contents of his
 

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.250
interesting things the contents of his
stomach had not putrified right now

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:44.260
stomach had not putrified right now
 

01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.719
stomach had not putrified right now
that's mysterious and the fact that his

that's mysterious and the fact that his
 

01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:49.449

his flesh was still edible at least by
 

01:32:49.459 --> 01:32:51.279
his flesh was still edible at least by
wolves you know that the stories about

01:32:51.279 --> 01:32:51.289
wolves you know that the stories about
 

01:32:51.289 --> 01:32:53.770
wolves you know that the stories about
you know the scientists eating mammoth

01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:53.780
you know the scientists eating mammoth
 

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.469
you know the scientists eating mammoth
burgers is probably made up but the

01:32:56.469 --> 01:32:56.479
burgers is probably made up but the
 

01:32:56.479 --> 01:32:58.330
burgers is probably made up but the
wolves definitely were able to eat the

01:32:58.330 --> 01:32:58.340
wolves definitely were able to eat the
 

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.640
wolves definitely were able to eat the
flesh right it was described as still

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:00.650
flesh right it was described as still
 

01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:02.439
flesh right it was described as still
being marbled almost as if it had just

01:33:02.439 --> 01:33:02.449
being marbled almost as if it had just
 

01:33:02.449 --> 01:33:05.969
being marbled almost as if it had just
been frozen you know a week ago but

01:33:05.969 --> 01:33:05.979
been frozen you know a week ago but
 

01:33:05.979 --> 01:33:08.259
been frozen you know a week ago but
since the time that the wooly mammoth

01:33:08.259 --> 01:33:08.269
since the time that the wooly mammoth
 

01:33:08.269 --> 01:33:08.800
since the time that the wooly mammoth
died

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:08.810
died
 

01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:10.570
died
it had its whole carcass and that was a

6-ton wooly mammoth
 

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.980
6-ton wooly mammoth
so it had been frozen for how many

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:14.990
so it had been frozen for how many
 

01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:18.340
so it had been frozen for how many
thousands and thousands of years and so

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:18.350
thousands and thousands of years and so
 

01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:22.360
thousands and thousands of years and so
thoroughly frozen that the contents of

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:22.370
thoroughly frozen that the contents of

haunches right both of his hip bones
 

01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.010
haunches right both of his hip bones
were broken which means that he was

were broken which means that he was

very violently he was also found with an
 

01:35:17.150 --> 01:35:21.010
very violently he was also found with an
erect penis which means that he died by

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:21.020
erect penis which means that he died by
 

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.479

suffocation
 

01:35:22.489 --> 01:35:25.000

which meant that he was entombed

01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:27.980
successful I've been terrified of
 

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.970
successful I've been terrified of
Yellowstone for four years now I watched

01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:30.980
Yellowstone for four years now I watched
 

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.800
Yellowstone for four years now I watched
some late-night documentary was a huge

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:32.810
some late-night documentary was a huge
 

01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:33.310
some late-night documentary was a huge
mistake

01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320
mistake
 

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.870
mistake
one of the things I was about to go to

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880
one of the things I was about to go to
 

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.800
one of the things I was about to go to
bed and I

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:35.810
bed and I
 

01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:37.150
bed and I
just flipping through the channels and

01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:37.160
just flipping through the channels and
 

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.710
just flipping through the channels and
they were going over this thing about a

01:37:38.710 --> 01:37:38.720
they were going over this thing about a
 

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.010
they were going over this thing about a
caldera volcano and Yellowstone I was

01:37:42.010 --> 01:37:42.020
caldera volcano and Yellowstone I was
 

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.450
caldera volcano and Yellowstone I was
like what the fuck's a caldera and then

01:37:43.450 --> 01:37:43.460
like what the fuck's a caldera and then
 

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.130
like what the fuck's a caldera and then
they started talking about how it's what

01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:45.140
they started talking about how it's what
 

01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.080
they started talking about how it's what
was it something like 600 kilometers

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:47.090
was it something like 600 kilometers
 

01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:49.150
was it something like 600 kilometers
wide or something crazy like that which

01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:49.160
wide or something crazy like that which
 

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.060
wide or something crazy like that which
is something like 300 miles and they

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:52.070
is something like 300 miles and they
 

01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:53.350
is something like 300 miles and they
were saying that they didn't even

01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360
were saying that they didn't even
 

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.030
were saying that they didn't even
discover it until they started doing

01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040
discover it until they started doing
 

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.120
discover it until they started doing
satellite imagery of of Earth and then

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:58.130
satellite imagery of of Earth and then
 

01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:01.180
satellite imagery of of Earth and then
they realized that oh this was a giant

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:01.190
they realized that oh this was a giant
 

01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:03.730
they realized that oh this was a giant
volcano that was so violent in its

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:03.740
volcano that was so violent in its
 

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:05.860
volcano that was so violent in its
eruption that it blew the mountain off

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:05.870
eruption that it blew the mountain off
 

01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:08.260
eruption that it blew the mountain off
of it and it became this massive crater

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:08.270
of it and it became this massive crater
 

01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:10.330
of it and it became this massive crater
and that it happens every six to eight

01:38:10.330 --> 01:38:10.340
and that it happens every six to eight
 

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.220
and that it happens every six to eight
hundred thousand years ago and that the

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:12.230
hundred thousand years ago and that the
 

01:38:12.230 --> 01:38:14.920
hundred thousand years ago and that the
last time it happened was six thousand

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:14.930
last time it happened was six thousand
 

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:17.770
last time it happened was six thousand
years ago yeah yeah so hopefully keeping

01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:17.780
years ago yeah yeah so hopefully keeping
 

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.000
years ago yeah yeah so hopefully keeping
our fingers crossed we got another

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:19.010
our fingers crossed we got another
 

01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:20.740
our fingers crossed we got another
hundred thousand years if we're lucky

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:20.750
hundred thousand years if we're lucky
 

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:24.010
hundred thousand years if we're lucky
yeah but see that's another aspect of

01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:24.020
yeah but see that's another aspect of
 

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.440
yeah but see that's another aspect of
this component of the dynamic history of

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:26.450
this component of the dynamic history of
 

01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:28.990
this component of the dynamic history of
planet Earth is these gigantic volcanic

01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000
planet Earth is these gigantic volcanic
 

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.480
planet Earth is these gigantic volcanic
eruptions there's been some interesting

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:31.490
eruptions there's been some interesting
 

01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:34.150
eruptions there's been some interesting
work linking asteroid impacts with giant

01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:34.160
work linking asteroid impacts with giant
 

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.830
work linking asteroid impacts with giant
volcanic eruptions as well and it would

01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840
volcanic eruptions as well and it would
 

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.730
volcanic eruptions as well and it would
it would make sense that um that that

01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:39.740
it would make sense that um that that
 

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.250
it would make sense that um that that
the energy injected into the earth by a

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:42.260
the energy injected into the earth by a
 

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.710
the energy injected into the earth by a
major impact could trigger volcanic

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:44.720
major impact could trigger volcanic
 

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.180
major impact could trigger volcanic
eruptions we know that during the great

01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:49.190
eruptions we know that during the great
 

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:51.400
eruptions we know that during the great
meltdown event of eleven to thirteen

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:51.410
meltdown event of eleven to thirteen
 

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:54.670
meltdown event of eleven to thirteen
thousand years ago that there were

01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:54.680
thousand years ago that there were
 

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.390
thousand years ago that there were
enormous massive volcanic eruptions and

01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400
enormous massive volcanic eruptions and
 

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.360
enormous massive volcanic eruptions and
mount st. Helens for example was was

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:01.370
mount st. Helens for example was was
 

01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:04.870
mount st. Helens for example was was
massively erupting at that time and I

01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880
massively erupting at that time and I
 

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.610
massively erupting at that time and I
have photographed I have felt some

01:39:06.610 --> 01:39:06.620
have photographed I have felt some
 

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.870
have photographed I have felt some
photographs right here I don't know how

01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880
photographs right here I don't know how
 

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.250
photographs right here I don't know how
much time we have to look at some of

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:09.260
much time we have to look at some of
 

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.800
much time we have to look at some of
this but where I have gone out and I've

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:11.810
this but where I have gone out and I've
 

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:15.430
this but where I have gone out and I've
found thick layers of white volcanic ash

01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440
found thick layers of white volcanic ash
 

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.620
found thick layers of white volcanic ash
from Mount st. Helens sandwiched in

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:17.630
from Mount st. Helens sandwiched in
 

01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:21.670
from Mount st. Helens sandwiched in
between these flood layers and and it it

01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:21.680
between these flood layers and and it it
 

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.190
between these flood layers and and it it
shows that and it undoubtedly had have

01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:24.200
shows that and it undoubtedly had have
 

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.080
shows that and it undoubtedly had have
been a response to the fact that you had

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:26.090
been a response to the fact that you had
 

01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:28.510
been a response to the fact that you had
this enormous mass transfer of weight

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520
this enormous mass transfer of weight
 

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.550
this enormous mass transfer of weight
that we were talking about earlier from

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560
that we were talking about earlier from
 

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.500
that we were talking about earlier from
the continents back to the ocean and

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:32.510
the continents back to the ocean and
 

01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:35.140
the continents back to the ocean and
when we go through I mean maybe it's

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:35.150
when we go through I mean maybe it's
 

01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:36.880
when we go through I mean maybe it's
time to go through a few of these images

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:36.890
time to go through a few of these images
 

01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:38.560
time to go through a few of these images
that I brought so you can begin to see

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:38.570
that I brought so you can begin to see
 

01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:42.210
that I brought so you can begin to see
some of the consequences of this melting

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:42.220
some of the consequences of this melting
 

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:44.440
some of the consequences of this melting
and you begin to appreciate that

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:44.450
and you begin to appreciate that
 

01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:47.470
and you begin to appreciate that
yeah there were these just enormous mass

01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480
yeah there were these just enormous mass
 

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.750
yeah there were these just enormous mass
transfers of weight unloading

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760
transfers of weight unloading
 

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.850
transfers of weight unloading
in certain areas loading in other areas

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:51.860
in certain areas loading in other areas
 

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:54.910
in certain areas loading in other areas
this would clearly have a profound

01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920
this would clearly have a profound
 

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.819
this would clearly have a profound
effect on the subterranean stability and

01:39:57.819 --> 01:39:57.829
effect on the subterranean stability and
 

01:39:57.829 --> 01:40:01.120
effect on the subterranean stability and
could easily lead to major eruptions and

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:01.130
could easily lead to major eruptions and
 

01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:04.330
could easily lead to major eruptions and
there was a spasm of major volcanic

01:40:04.330 --> 01:40:04.340
there was a spasm of major volcanic
 

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:07.479
there was a spasm of major volcanic
eruptions globally at the time of the

01:40:07.479 --> 01:40:07.489
eruptions globally at the time of the
 

01:40:07.489 --> 01:40:09.279
eruptions globally at the time of the
the transition out of the Ice Age which

01:40:09.279 --> 01:40:09.289
the transition out of the Ice Age which
 

01:40:09.289 --> 01:40:11.529
the transition out of the Ice Age which
would only have added to the havoc of

01:40:11.529 --> 01:40:11.539
would only have added to the havoc of
 

01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:15.879
would only have added to the havoc of
that transition and why you know half of

01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:15.889
that transition and why you know half of
 

01:40:15.889 --> 01:40:17.290
that transition and why you know half of
the great species of megafauna

01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:17.300
the great species of megafauna
 

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.959
the great species of megafauna
disappeared a megaphone is basically

01:40:19.959 --> 01:40:19.969
disappeared a megaphone is basically
 

01:40:19.969 --> 01:40:23.140

weight which is about a hundred pounds
 

01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:30.850
weight which is about a hundred pounds
right so that would include us and if

01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:30.860
right so that would include us and if
 

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.859
right so that would include us and if
you started thinking about all of the

01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:32.869
you started thinking about all of the
 

01:40:32.869 --> 01:40:34.870
you started thinking about all of the
animals globally worldwide there are

01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880
animals globally worldwide there are
 

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.180

more than a hundred pounds depending on
how you divide up the species there

01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599
how you divide up the species there
 

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:40.060
how you divide up the species there
might be a hundred to twenty a hundred

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:40.070
might be a hundred to twenty a hundred
 

01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:41.620
might be a hundred to twenty a hundred
and thirty different species and I'm

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:41.630
and thirty different species and I'm
 

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:43.750
and thirty different species and I'm
talking about the you know lions and

01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760
talking about the you know lions and
 

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.339

okay let's go back to the Ice Age the

01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320
okay let's go back to the Ice Age the
 

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.709
okay let's go back to the Ice Age the
extinction the loss of species at the

extinction the loss of species at the
 

01:40:56.719 --> 01:40:58.689
extinction the loss of species at the
end of the last ice age was about

01:40:58.689 --> 01:40:58.699
end of the last ice age was about
 

01:40:58.699 --> 01:41:01.839
end of the last ice age was about
equivalent in number the loss of species

equivalent in number the loss of species
 

01:41:01.849 --> 01:41:04.000
equivalent in number the loss of species
of mega mammals was about equivalent in

and the more you said that theory is
 

01:42:20.989 --> 01:42:21.819

that's well see that's based upon more

01:48:42.739 --> 01:48:44.770
happened was you had Charles Lyell play
fair and Hutt James Hutton these three

01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:44.780
fair and Hutt James Hutton these three
 

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:47.740
fair and Hutt James Hutton these three
came along and basically established the

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:47.750
came along and basically established the
 

01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:50.620
came along and basically established the
doctrine of uniformitarianism as it's

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:50.630
doctrine of uniformitarianism as it's
 

01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:53.709
doctrine of uniformitarianism as it's
called a mouthful right and basically

01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719
called a mouthful right and basically
 

01:48:53.719 --> 01:48:55.629
called a mouthful right and basically
the idea of uniformitarianism was this

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639
the idea of uniformitarianism was this
 

01:48:55.639 --> 01:48:58.689
the idea of uniformitarianism was this
is that we look at modern processes to

01:48:58.689 --> 01:48:58.699
is that we look at modern processes to
 

01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:01.990
is that we look at modern processes to
explain ancient processes so if we see a

01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000
explain ancient processes so if we see a
 

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.629
explain ancient processes so if we see a
river eroding its bank moving sediment

01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639
river eroding its bank moving sediment
 

01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:07.600
river eroding its bank moving sediment
creating a sandbar with that if we see

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:07.610
creating a sandbar with that if we see
 

01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:09.700
creating a sandbar with that if we see
like during the the you know early 19th

01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:09.710
like during the the you know early 19th
 

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:11.830
like during the the you know early 19th
century we were in the last phase of the

01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840
century we were in the last phase of the
 

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.350
century we were in the last phase of the
Little Ice Age so glaciers were receding

01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360
Little Ice Age so glaciers were receding
 

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.510
Little Ice Age so glaciers were receding
and these guys could essentially go up

01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520
and these guys could essentially go up
 

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.669
and these guys could essentially go up
there and look on a year-to-year basis

01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679
there and look on a year-to-year basis
 

01:49:18.679 --> 01:49:19.839
there and look on a year-to-year basis
and see what was happening as the

01:49:19.839 --> 01:49:19.849
and see what was happening as the
 

01:49:19.849 --> 01:49:21.910
and see what was happening as the
glaciers were receding right so

01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920
glaciers were receding right so
 

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:23.979
glaciers were receding right so
basically what they then did was

01:49:23.979 --> 01:49:23.989
basically what they then did was
 

01:49:23.989 --> 01:49:26.410
basically what they then did was
extrapolated for modern processes to try

01:49:26.410 --> 01:49:26.420
extrapolated for modern processes to try
 

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.750
extrapolated for modern processes to try
to explain all the ancient processes

01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760
to explain all the ancient processes
 

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.430
to explain all the ancient processes
this is the doctrine of

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440
this is the doctrine of
 

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.620
this is the doctrine of
uniformitarianism okay it's a very

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:32.630
uniformitarianism okay it's a very
 

01:49:32.630 --> 01:49:35.200
uniformitarianism okay it's a very
powerful model for understanding ancient

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:35.210
powerful model for understanding ancient
 

01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:38.950
powerful model for understanding ancient

01:49:44.290 --> 01:49:44.300
as we come right up to the to the
 

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.709
as we come right up to the to the

01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719
threshold of the 20th century it was now
 

01:49:47.719 --> 01:49:50.290
threshold of the 20th century it was now
considered unscientific to try to

01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360
explain anything in the past that we
 

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:57.000
explain anything in the past that we
couldn't see happening today right so as

couldn't see happening today right so as
 

01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:59.770

a traveling minister right he was

01:50:43.330 --> 01:50:43.340
a traveling minister right he was
 

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.189
a traveling minister right he was
traveling around England and he was

01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199
traveling around England and he was
 

01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:46.689
traveling around England and he was
seeing things like the Thames River

01:50:46.689 --> 01:50:46.699
seeing things like the Thames River
 

01:50:46.699 --> 01:50:48.729
seeing things like the Thames River
Valley and he was saying that the Thames

01:50:48.729 --> 01:50:48.739
Valley and he was saying that the Thames
 

01:50:48.739 --> 01:50:51.549
Valley and he was saying that the Thames
flowed in this gigantic channel that was

01:50:51.549 --> 01:50:51.559
flowed in this gigantic channel that was
 

01:50:51.559 --> 01:50:54.700
flowed in this gigantic channel that was
completely outsized relative to the

completely outsized relative to the
 

01:50:54.710 --> 01:50:56.830
completely outsized relative to the

01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:56.840
river that was flowing in it and he says
 

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.540

huge flood well he was a theologian
 

01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:04.990
huge flood well he was a theologian
right so he said Noah's Flood right well

01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000
right so he said Noah's Flood right well
 

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.959
right so he said Noah's Flood right well

geomorphic effects of gigantic floods
all over the planet right we know that

01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760
all over the planet right we know that
 

01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.209
all over the planet right we know that
now right in the 1800s they assumed that

01:51:22.209 --> 01:51:22.219
now right in the 1800s they assumed that
 

01:51:22.219 --> 01:51:24.669
now right in the 1800s they assumed that
if you saw effects of gigantic floods it

01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679
if you saw effects of gigantic floods it
 

01:51:24.679 --> 01:51:27.939
if you saw effects of gigantic floods it
had to have been Noah's Flood well at

01:51:27.939 --> 01:51:27.949
had to have been Noah's Flood well at
 

01:51:27.949 --> 01:51:30.280
had to have been Noah's Flood well at
the same time that you had geological

biological gradualism came along in the

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:35.150
biological gradualism came along in the
 

01:51:35.150 --> 01:51:37.479
biological gradualism came along in the
form of Darwinism and the two sort of

01:51:37.479 --> 01:51:37.489
form of Darwinism and the two sort of
 

01:51:37.489 --> 01:51:40.180
form of Darwinism and the two sort of
complemented each other and mutually

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:40.190
complemented each other and mutually
 

01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:42.310
complemented each other and mutually
supported each other well if we've got

01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320
supported each other well if we've got

infinite time you know millions and

01:51:44.859 --> 01:51:44.869
infinite time you know millions and
 

01:51:44.869 --> 01:51:47.740
infinite time you know millions and
millions of years of gradual geological

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:47.750
millions of years of gradual geological
 

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:50.560
millions of years of gradual geological
change now that allows us millions and

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:50.570
change now that allows us millions and
 

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.689
change now that allows us millions and
millions of years for gradual biological

01:51:52.689 --> 01:51:52.699
millions of years for gradual biological
 

01:51:52.699 --> 01:51:54.879
millions of years for gradual biological
change and these two paradigms were

01:51:54.879 --> 01:51:54.889
change and these two paradigms were
 

01:51:54.889 --> 01:51:57.580
change and these two paradigms were
mutually reinforcing so now we come to

01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:57.590
mutually reinforcing so now we come to
 

01:51:57.590 --> 01:52:00.399
mutually reinforcing so now we come to

right and to vary from that was to be

01:52:10.899 --> 01:52:10.909
right and to vary from that was to be
 

01:52:10.909 --> 01:52:13.000
right and to vary from that was to be
pseudo scientific and you're trying to

pseudo scientific and you're trying to
 

01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:15.640
pseudo scientific and you're trying to
revert back to biblical fundamentalism

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:15.650
revert back to biblical fundamentalism
 

01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:17.580

if you start talking about giant floods
right well what happened was and then it

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:21.110
right well what happened was and then it
 

01:52:21.110 --> 01:52:22.419
right well what happened was and then it
was left to people like Immanuel

01:52:22.419 --> 01:52:22.429
was left to people like Immanuel
 

01:52:22.429 --> 01:52:24.549

see prior to the Apollo moon program it
was believed that most of the craters on

for Joe I have a beautiful example of
scale invariance and this is going to be

02:02:54.630 --> 02:02:54.640
scale invariance and this is going to be
 

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:57.300
scale invariance and this is going to be
similar to what I saw and and when you

02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:57.310
similar to what I saw and and when you
 

02:02:57.310 --> 02:03:01.650
similar to what I saw and and when you
see it that's that's like the 25 images

along with what you were talking about

02:07:11.429 --> 02:07:11.439
along with what you were talking about
 

02:07:11.439 --> 02:07:15.179
along with what you were talking about
earlier that the idea the the ideas of

02:07:15.179 --> 02:07:15.189
earlier that the idea the the ideas of
 

02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:16.859
earlier that the idea the the ideas of
science were that everything had taken

02:07:16.859 --> 02:07:16.869

gradual pace exactly is this the Grand

Canyon as well no I would here's what I

02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119
Canyon as well no I would here's what I
 

02:07:25.119 --> 02:07:27.719
Canyon as well no I would here's what I
would say about the Grand Canyon I think

02:07:27.719 --> 02:07:27.729
would say about the Grand Canyon I think
 

02:07:27.729 --> 02:07:30.029
would say about the Grand Canyon I think
that the Grand Canyon is presently we

02:07:30.029 --> 02:07:30.039
that the Grand Canyon is presently we
 

02:07:30.039 --> 02:07:31.949
that the Grand Canyon is presently we
can observe it that we can observe the

02:07:31.949 --> 02:07:31.959
can observe it that we can observe the
 

02:07:31.959 --> 02:07:34.259
can observe it that we can observe the
Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon

02:07:34.259 --> 02:07:34.269
Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon
 

02:07:34.269 --> 02:07:37.229
Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon
however I think that the erosion of the

02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239
however I think that the erosion of the
 

02:07:37.239 --> 02:07:40.439
however I think that the erosion of the
Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode

02:07:40.439 --> 02:07:40.449
Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode
 

02:07:40.449 --> 02:07:44.219
Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode
ik which means that the Grand Canyon has

02:07:44.219 --> 02:07:44.229
ik which means that the Grand Canyon has
 

02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:46.020
ik which means that the Grand Canyon has
probably been there between two and five

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:46.030
probably been there between two and five
 

02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:48.449
probably been there between two and five
million years because for one thing the

02:07:48.449 --> 02:07:48.459
million years because for one thing the
 

02:07:48.459 --> 02:07:50.100
million years because for one thing the
Grand Canyon wouldn't start eroding

02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:50.110
Grand Canyon wouldn't start eroding
 

02:07:50.110 --> 02:07:52.560
Grand Canyon wouldn't start eroding

02:08:45.579 --> 02:08:45.589
it's compressed

when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm

02:08:55.239 --> 02:08:55.249
when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm
 

02:08:55.249 --> 02:08:57.909
when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm
seeing there is episodes of catastrophic

two extremes those episodes of
 

02:09:19.909 --> 02:09:22.569
two extremes those episodes of

levels on an extreme basis and I think

02:09:35.649 --> 02:09:35.659
levels on an extreme basis and I think
 

02:09:35.659 --> 02:09:38.979

it's that that has created the Grand

it's that that has created the Grand

02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:43.869

Channel I know if you've ever seen Grand

02:09:43.869 --> 02:09:43.879
Channel I know if you've ever seen Grand
 

02:09:43.879 --> 02:09:45.549
Channel I know if you've ever seen Grand
Canyon yes yeah okay there's an inner

02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559
Canyon yes yeah okay there's an inner
 

02:09:45.559 --> 02:09:48.309
Canyon yes yeah okay there's an inner
gorge I could guess that that inner

02:09:48.309 --> 02:09:48.319
gorge I could guess that that inner
 

02:09:48.319 --> 02:09:50.139
gorge I could guess that that inner
gorge is probably less than a hundred

02:09:50.139 --> 02:09:50.149
gorge is probably less than a hundred
 

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:52.149
gorge is probably less than a hundred
thousand years old and probably a lot of

02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159
thousand years old and probably a lot of
 

02:09:52.159 --> 02:09:55.569
thousand years old and probably a lot of
it was cut 13,000 years ago Wow and so

02:09:55.569 --> 02:09:55.579
it was cut 13,000 years ago Wow and so
 

02:09:55.579 --> 02:09:57.250
it was cut 13,000 years ago Wow and so
that's when the Pleistocene ended

02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:57.260
that's when the Pleistocene ended
 

02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:59.169
that's when the Pleistocene ended
somewhere around ten thousand years ago

02:09:59.169 --> 02:09:59.179
somewhere around ten thousand years ago
 

02:09:59.179 --> 02:10:01.270
somewhere around ten thousand years ago
yeah ten to thirteen thousand years ago

02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280
yeah ten to thirteen thousand years ago
 

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:02.199
yeah ten to thirteen thousand years ago
Wow

02:10:02.199 --> 02:10:02.209
Wow
 

02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:03.790
Wow
yeah and that's a that's not a real

02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800
yeah and that's a that's not a real
 

02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:05.290
yeah and that's a that's not a real
picture is it no it seems like an

02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:05.300
picture is it no it seems like an
 

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:08.739
picture is it no it seems like an
artist's rendition yeah I have pictures

02:10:08.739 --> 02:10:08.749
artist's rendition yeah I have pictures
 

02:10:08.749 --> 02:10:10.599
artist's rendition yeah I have pictures
somewhere in there we're still where you

02:10:10.599 --> 02:10:10.609
somewhere in there we're still where you
 

02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:14.369
somewhere in there we're still where you
get a sense yeah now the the

02:10:14.369 --> 02:10:14.379
get a sense yeah now the the
 

02:10:14.379 --> 02:10:16.569
get a sense yeah now the the

02:10:16.569 --> 02:10:16.579

yeah took hundreds of millions of years

02:10:18.609 --> 02:10:18.619
yeah took hundreds of millions of years
 

02:10:18.619 --> 02:10:21.489
yeah took hundreds of millions of years
but that's one process the down cutting

02:10:21.489 --> 02:10:21.499
but that's one process the down cutting
 

02:10:21.499 --> 02:10:23.919
but that's one process the down cutting
the erosion of the Canyon is a different

02:10:23.919 --> 02:10:23.929
the erosion of the Canyon is a different
 

02:10:23.929 --> 02:10:27.579
the erosion of the Canyon is a different
process so again it comes to a matter of

02:10:27.579 --> 02:10:27.589
process so again it comes to a matter of
 

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:29.739
process so again it comes to a matter of

of let me I think you know academically

02:10:34.119 --> 02:10:34.129
of let me I think you know academically
 

02:10:34.129 --> 02:10:38.529
of let me I think you know academically
and you you could sort of explain how

02:10:38.529 --> 02:10:38.539
and you you could sort of explain how
 

02:10:38.539 --> 02:10:41.199
and you you could sort of explain how
all this takes place and explain what's

02:10:41.199 --> 02:10:41.209
all this takes place and explain what's
 

02:10:41.209 --> 02:10:43.959
all this takes place and explain what's
happening but in our minds our our

02:10:43.959 --> 02:10:43.969
happening but in our minds our our
 

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:46.540
happening but in our minds our our
perspective of living a hundred years

02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:46.550

02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.369
perspective of living a hundred years
looking back it's very difficult to go

02:10:48.369 --> 02:10:48.379
looking back it's very difficult to go
 

02:10:48.379 --> 02:10:50.229
looking back it's very difficult to go
back 20 years ago and I remember when

02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239
back 20 years ago and I remember when
 

02:10:50.239 --> 02:10:52.629
back 20 years ago and I remember when
that happened while barely but this is

02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639
that happened while barely but this is
 

02:10:52.639 --> 02:10:54.579
that happened while barely but this is
that ain't shit compared to the earth

02:10:54.579 --> 02:10:54.589
that ain't shit compared to the earth
 

02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:57.429
that ain't shit compared to the earth
the earth the earth is just constantly

the earth the earth is just constantly
 

02:10:57.439 --> 02:10:58.379
the earth the earth is just constantly
changing and

02:10:58.379 --> 02:10:58.389
changing and
 

02:10:58.389 --> 02:11:00.930
changing and
our knowledge of human history we have

02:11:00.930 --> 02:11:00.940
our knowledge of human history we have
 

02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:02.399
our knowledge of human history we have
this sort of static view and

this sort of static view and
 

02:11:02.409 --> 02:11:04.020
this sort of static view and
occasionally we have that meteor that

02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:04.030
occasionally we have that meteor that
 

02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:06.359
occasionally we have that meteor that
flew over Russia recently and blew up in

the sky and everybody's like whoa what's
 

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.100
the sky and everybody's like whoa what's
with that and then it stops and then

Tunguska which blew up in the early

02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520
Tunguska which blew up in the early
 

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:26.720
Tunguska which blew up in the early
1900's 1908 June 30th 1908 which just

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:26.730
1900's 1908 June 30th 1908 which just
 

02:11:26.730 --> 02:11:29.939
1900's 1908 June 30th 1908 which just
flattened thousands and thousands of

02:11:29.939 --> 02:11:29.949
flattened thousands and thousands of
 

02:11:29.949 --> 02:11:32.399
flattened thousands and thousands of
acres oh well let's see it was eight

02:11:32.399 --> 02:11:32.409
acres oh well let's see it was eight
 

02:11:32.409 --> 02:11:35.640

hundred square miles and there 640 acres

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:35.650
hundred square miles and there 640 acres
 

02:11:35.650 --> 02:11:40.379
hundred square miles and there 640 acres
per square mile so it flattened half a

02:11:40.379 --> 02:11:40.389
per square mile so it flattened half a
 

02:11:40.389 --> 02:11:42.720
per square mile so it flattened half a
million acres oh my god million acres

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:42.730
million acres oh my god million acres
 

02:11:42.730 --> 02:11:45.450
million acres oh my god million acres
and that was the energy of that was

02:11:45.450 --> 02:11:45.460
and that was the energy of that was
 

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:48.030
and that was the energy of that was
about equivalent to a 15 Megaton bomb

02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:48.040

next global catastrophe and that's us do
 

02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:20.310
next global catastrophe and that's us do
we rise to that challenge or do we say

02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320
we rise to that challenge or do we say
 

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.600
we rise to that challenge or do we say
well we're gonna let nature run its

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:21.610
well we're gonna let nature run its
 

02:14:21.610 --> 02:14:24.270
well we're gonna let nature run its

which we could be if we had the will and
 

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:43.350
which we could be if we had the will and
the vision and the thing is is that the

02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360
the vision and the thing is is that the
 

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:45.360
the vision and the thing is is that the
most dangerous asteroids that our are

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:45.370
most dangerous asteroids that our are
 

02:14:45.370 --> 02:14:47.040
most dangerous asteroids that our are
out there it's the closer they get to

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:47.050
out there it's the closer they get to
 

02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:49.140
out there it's the closer they get to
the earth the more accessible they are

02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:49.150
the earth the more accessible they are
 

02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:51.780
the earth the more accessible they are
and and you see we already could be

02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:51.790
and and you see we already could be
 

02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:54.030
and and you see we already could be
harvesting the resources laughter I mean

02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040

what does that suggest to you well and

02:15:06.959 --> 02:15:06.969
what does that suggest to you well and
 

02:15:06.969 --> 02:15:10.110
what does that suggest to you well and
and think about this if if I like to

02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:10.120
and think about this if if I like to
 

02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:14.070
and think about this if if I like to
kind of imagine a scenario suppose we

02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:14.080
kind of imagine a scenario suppose we
 

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:16.620

were going to orbit the Sun and come
back and be crossing the orbit of

the earth in three years or ten years or
 

02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.380
the earth in three years or ten years or
twenty years or whatever what would be

twenty years or whatever what would be
 

02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:59.110

our response to it what would we do I

02:15:59.110 --> 02:15:59.120
our response to it what would we do I
 

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.780
our response to it what would we do I
think globally it would be there would

02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:01.790
think globally it would be there would
 

02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:03.330

that have vast technological
 

02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:14.260
that have vast technological
capabilities would probably get together

02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:14.270
capabilities would probably get together
 

02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:15.880
capabilities would probably get together
and have some sort of an agreement I

02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:15.890
and have some sort of an agreement I
 

02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:17.410
and have some sort of an agreement I
would think that that would have to

02:16:17.410 --> 02:16:17.420
would think that that would have to
 

02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:19.450
would think that that would have to
happen and it would fact it would

02:16:19.450 --> 02:16:19.460
happen and it would fact it would
 

02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:23.350
happen and it would fact it would
probably make our petty human conflicts

02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360
probably make our petty human conflicts
 

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.020
probably make our petty human conflicts
pale into insignificance if we were

pale into insignificance if we were

civilization or even possibly our
 

02:16:30.590 --> 02:16:34.510
civilization or even possibly our
species but suppose we discovered it and

02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:34.520
species but suppose we discovered it and
 

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:37.500
species but suppose we discovered it and
it's coming in a couple of years and

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:37.510
it's coming in a couple of years and
 

02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:41.590
it's coming in a couple of years and
there's no time to respond what could we

02:16:41.590 --> 02:16:41.600
there's no time to respond what could we
 

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:45.070
there's no time to respond what could we
do well perhaps if we had a long enough

02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080
do well perhaps if we had a long enough
 

02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:47.710
do well perhaps if we had a long enough
lead time we could actually die Fleck

02:16:47.710 --> 02:16:47.720
lead time we could actually die Fleck

lead time we could actually die Fleck
all we need to do is as an asteroid

02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:50.060
all we need to do is as an asteroid
 

02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:52.420
all we need to do is as an asteroid
that's on a collision course with the

little bit in a direct hit can be a wide
 

02:16:56.810 --> 02:16:58.870
little bit in a direct hit can be a wide
miss see that's all we would have to do

02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880
miss see that's all we would have to do
 

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.370
miss see that's all we would have to do
is just nudge it a little and there's

02:17:00.370 --> 02:17:00.380
is just nudge it a little and there's
 

02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:02.770
is just nudge it a little and there's
various potential technologies whereby

02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:02.780
various potential technologies whereby
 

02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.570
various potential technologies whereby
we could do that but what if we didn't

02:17:04.570 --> 02:17:04.580
we could do that but what if we didn't
 

02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:05.710
we could do that but what if we didn't
have enough lead time and we knew that

02:17:05.710 --> 02:17:05.720
have enough lead time and we knew that
 

02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:07.690
have enough lead time and we knew that
that it was gonna slam into the earth

02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:07.700
that it was gonna slam into the earth
 

02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:12.900
that it was gonna slam into the earth
and for a thousand years gonna be havoc

02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:12.910
and for a thousand years gonna be havoc
 

02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:15.370
and for a thousand years gonna be havoc
what would we do well perhaps we could

02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:15.380
what would we do well perhaps we could
 

02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:18.030
what would we do well perhaps we could
go build a base on the moon or build a

02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040
go build a base on the moon or build a

humans to survive at least until the

humans to survive at least until the
dust settled enough that we could return

dust settled enough that we could return
 

02:17:25.010 --> 02:17:27.520
dust settled enough that we could return

so I know how much work it takes to move

02:18:34.149 --> 02:18:34.159
so I know how much work it takes to move
 

02:18:34.159 --> 02:18:36.700

technology that we've forgotten what
 

02:18:59.019 --> 02:19:03.969
technology that we've forgotten what
that technology is I couldn't say but it

02:19:03.969 --> 02:19:03.979
that technology is I couldn't say but it
 

02:19:03.979 --> 02:19:06.639

would sure seem to me that there would

02:19:06.639 --> 02:19:06.649
would sure seem to me that there would
 

02:19:06.649 --> 02:19:09.580

convenient way of doing it just explain

02:19:17.889 --> 02:19:17.899
convenient way of doing it just explain
 

02:19:17.899 --> 02:19:21.790
convenient way of doing it just explain
how an inconvenient way they could have

02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800
how an inconvenient way they could have
 

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.709

into place and what year it was all done

02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:16.890
into place and what year it was all done
 

02:20:16.890 --> 02:20:21.010
into place and what year it was all done
right that's a one vision of it or a

02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:21.020
right that's a one vision of it or a
 

02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:24.979
right that's a one vision of it or a
picture of it but if you search for

02:20:24.979 --> 02:20:24.989
picture of it but if you search for
 

02:20:24.989 --> 02:20:26.840
picture of it but if you search for
others he is actually a close-up of the

02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:26.850
others he is actually a close-up of the
 

02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:28.789
others he is actually a close-up of the
actual stones themselves and they show

02:20:28.789 --> 02:20:28.799
actual stones themselves and they show
 

02:20:28.799 --> 02:20:31.249
actual stones themselves and they show
people standing next to stone so you get

02:20:31.249 --> 02:20:31.259
people standing next to stone so you get
 

02:20:31.259 --> 02:20:34.639
people standing next to stone so you get
a perspective of it much much taller

02:20:34.639 --> 02:20:34.649
a perspective of it much much taller
 

02:20:34.649 --> 02:20:35.749
a perspective of it much much taller
than a human being

02:20:35.749 --> 02:20:35.759
than a human being
 

02:20:35.759 --> 02:20:38.269
than a human being
in fact like I think 10 or 11 feet tall

02:20:38.269 --> 02:20:38.279
in fact like I think 10 or 11 feet tall
 

02:20:38.279 --> 02:20:41.960
in fact like I think 10 or 11 feet tall
in some places like there's one rock

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:41.970
in some places like there's one rock
 

02:20:41.970 --> 02:20:45.380
in some places like there's one rock
just like fuck remove that but some of

02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:45.390
just like fuck remove that but some of
 

02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:47.179
just like fuck remove that but some of
the stones see that's not a good one

02:20:47.179 --> 02:20:47.189
the stones see that's not a good one
 

02:20:47.189 --> 02:20:49.159
the stones see that's not a good one
Jamie there's there some where you can

02:20:49.159 --> 02:20:49.169
Jamie there's there some where you can
 

02:20:49.169 --> 02:20:53.510
Jamie there's there some where you can
see the massive amount of stone that was

02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520
see the massive amount of stone that was
 

02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.550
see the massive amount of stone that was
in each individual one some of them are

02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560
in each individual one some of them are
 

02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.369
in each individual one some of them are
literally building sized and it's just

02:20:58.369 --> 02:20:58.379
literally building sized and it's just
 

02:20:58.379 --> 02:21:01.219
literally building sized and it's just
an individual stone and yeah there's one

02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:01.229
an individual stone and yeah there's one
 

02:21:01.229 --> 02:21:04.880
an individual stone and yeah there's one
like what the fuck man what the fuck is

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:04.890
like what the fuck man what the fuck is
 

02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:06.769
like what the fuck man what the fuck is
that that is so big

02:21:06.769 --> 02:21:06.779
that that is so big
 

02:21:06.779 --> 02:21:09.769
that that is so big
yeah it's they moved that they cut that

02:21:09.769 --> 02:21:09.779
yeah it's they moved that they cut that
 

02:21:09.779 --> 02:21:12.559
yeah it's they moved that they cut that
quarried it and moved it yeah I mean I

02:21:12.559 --> 02:21:12.569
quarried it and moved it yeah I mean I
 

02:21:12.569 --> 02:21:14.149
quarried it and moved it yeah I mean I
don't know how many people they had to

02:21:14.149 --> 02:21:14.159
don't know how many people they had to
 

02:21:14.159 --> 02:21:17.090
don't know how many people they had to
do that but boy that doesn't seem like

02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100
do that but boy that doesn't seem like
 

02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:19.279
do that but boy that doesn't seem like
something that a society which is really

02:21:19.279 --> 02:21:19.289
something that a society which is really
 

02:21:19.289 --> 02:21:21.739
something that a society which is really
concerned with feeding itself is is

02:21:21.739 --> 02:21:21.749
concerned with feeding itself is is
 

02:21:21.749 --> 02:21:24.019
concerned with feeding itself is is
going to get done right

02:21:24.019 --> 02:21:24.029
going to get done right
 

02:21:24.029 --> 02:21:27.019
going to get done right
what so when you see like the

02:21:27.019 --> 02:21:27.029
what so when you see like the
 

02:21:27.029 --> 02:21:28.760
what so when you see like the
constructions of the great pyramids

02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:28.770
constructions of the great pyramids
 

02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:30.619
constructions of the great pyramids
which is one of the great wonders of the

02:21:30.619 --> 02:21:30.629
which is one of the great wonders of the
 

02:21:30.629 --> 02:21:32.569
which is one of the great wonders of the
world and to this day they're always

02:21:32.569 --> 02:21:32.579
world and to this day they're always
 

02:21:32.579 --> 02:21:34.130
world and to this day they're always
trying to come up with ways that they

02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.140
trying to come up with ways that they
 

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:37.369
trying to come up with ways that they
did it but the sheer size and to put it

02:21:37.369 --> 02:21:37.379
did it but the sheer size and to put it
 

02:21:37.379 --> 02:21:39.409
did it but the sheer size and to put it
into perspective if you cut and I think

02:21:39.409 --> 02:21:39.419
into perspective if you cut and I think
 

02:21:39.419 --> 02:21:42.199
into perspective if you cut and I think
the number is 10 stones a day 2 6 2

02:21:42.199 --> 02:21:42.209
the number is 10 stones a day 2 6 2
 

02:21:42.209 --> 02:21:44.119
the number is 10 stones a day 2 6 2
million three hundred thousand-plus

02:21:44.119 --> 02:21:44.129
million three hundred thousand-plus
 

02:21:44.129 --> 02:21:46.999
million three hundred thousand-plus
stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza and

02:21:46.999 --> 02:21:47.009
stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza and
 

02:21:47.009 --> 02:21:50.630
stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza and
if you cut and place ten a day it would

02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640
if you cut and place ten a day it would
 

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:53.199
if you cut and place ten a day it would
take you six hundred sixty-four years

02:21:53.199 --> 02:21:53.209
take you six hundred sixty-four years
 

02:21:53.209 --> 02:21:57.889
take you six hundred sixty-four years
yeah I you know yeah having seen the

02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899
yeah I you know yeah having seen the
 

02:21:57.899 --> 02:22:00.019
yeah I you know yeah having seen the
Great Pyramid and many of the temples in

02:22:00.019 --> 02:22:00.029
Great Pyramid and many of the temples in
 

02:22:00.029 --> 02:22:02.630
Great Pyramid and many of the temples in
Egypt I'm convinced that they had to

02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640
Egypt I'm convinced that they had to
 

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:05.660
Egypt I'm convinced that they had to
have some means that we've forgotten

02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:05.670
have some means that we've forgotten
 

02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:08.720
have some means that we've forgotten
for transporting these stones you know

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:08.730
for transporting these stones you know
 

02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:11.470
for transporting these stones you know
they may have used fairly primitive

02:22:11.470 --> 02:22:11.480
they may have used fairly primitive
 

02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:16.070
they may have used fairly primitive
methods to quarry the stones but when it

02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080
methods to quarry the stones but when it
 

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:19.011
methods to quarry the stones but when it
comes to transporting the stones you

02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:19.021
comes to transporting the stones you
 

02:22:19.021 --> 02:22:20.240
comes to transporting the stones you
know I mean we could imagine that

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:20.250
know I mean we could imagine that
 

02:22:20.250 --> 02:22:22.100
know I mean we could imagine that
they're putting them on rollers and

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:22.110
they're putting them on rollers and
 

02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:24.410

02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:23.960
destruction of the world by fire Wow and
cataclysmic of water on this stuff is so

02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:23.970
cataclysmic of water on this stuff is so
 

02:26:23.970 --> 02:26:26.690
cataclysmic of water on this stuff is so
unbelievably fascinating because there's

02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:26.700
unbelievably fascinating because there's
 

02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:30.290
unbelievably fascinating because there's
no way that you can attribute all of

02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:30.300
no way that you can attribute all of
 

02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:32.751
no way that you can attribute all of
this stuff I mean these

02:26:32.751 --> 02:26:32.761
this stuff I mean these
 

02:26:32.761 --> 02:26:35.720
this stuff I mean these
all of these ancient structures there's

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:35.730
all of these ancient structures there's
 

02:26:35.730 --> 02:26:38.511
all of these ancient structures there's
no way you can attribute it to what we

02:26:38.511 --> 02:26:38.521
no way you can attribute it to what we
 

02:26:38.521 --> 02:26:40.850
no way you can attribute it to what we
know about their culture we don't know

02:26:40.850 --> 02:26:40.860
know about their culture we don't know
 

02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:42.741
know about their culture we don't know
enough there's just not enough evidence

02:26:42.741 --> 02:26:42.751
enough there's just not enough evidence
 

02:26:42.751 --> 02:26:45.441
enough there's just not enough evidence
there's not enough we don't know enough

02:26:45.441 --> 02:26:45.451
there's not enough we don't know enough
 

02:26:45.451 --> 02:26:49.701
there's not enough we don't know enough
about ancient Egypt or you know or their

02:26:49.701 --> 02:26:49.711
about ancient Egypt or you know or their
 

02:26:49.711 --> 02:26:51.341
about ancient Egypt or you know or their
construction methods there's so much

02:26:51.341 --> 02:26:51.351
construction methods there's so much
 

02:26:51.351 --> 02:26:54.831
construction methods there's so much
there's so much thinking like there's so

02:26:54.831 --> 02:26:54.841
there's so much thinking like there's so
 

02:26:54.841 --> 02:26:58.611
there's so much thinking like there's so
much guesswork it's so much you know

02:26:58.611 --> 02:26:58.621
much guesswork it's so much you know
 

02:26:58.621 --> 02:27:00.801
much guesswork it's so much you know
when you look at these giant structures

02:27:00.801 --> 02:27:00.811
when you look at these giant structures
 

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:02.991
when you look at these giant structures
and you wonder like what what were they

02:27:02.991 --> 02:27:03.001
and you wonder like what what were they
 

02:27:03.001 --> 02:27:04.911
and you wonder like what what were they
doing how did they do this who were they

02:27:04.911 --> 02:27:04.921
doing how did they do this who were they
 

02:27:04.921 --> 02:27:08.361
doing how did they do this who were they
like it's so fascinating I would just I

02:27:08.361 --> 02:27:08.371
like it's so fascinating I would just I
 

02:27:08.371 --> 02:27:10.430
like it's so fascinating I would just I
would love to be able to go back in time

02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:10.440
would love to be able to go back in time
 

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:12.861
would love to be able to go back in time

sphinx you got to remember what the
 

02:27:55.650 --> 02:27:57.711
sphinx you got to remember what the
Sphinx is that originally it was a

02:27:57.711 --> 02:27:57.721
Sphinx is that originally it was a
 

02:27:57.721 --> 02:27:59.961
Sphinx is that originally it was a
yardang which is a which is a limestone

okay there you can really see the ditch
 

02:28:12.811 --> 02:28:14.751
okay there you can really see the ditch
surrounding the Sphinx and the layers

02:28:14.751 --> 02:28:14.761
surrounding the Sphinx and the layers
 

02:28:14.761 --> 02:28:17.631
surrounding the Sphinx and the layers
forming the Sphinx body correspond to

02:28:17.631 --> 02:28:17.641
forming the Sphinx body correspond to
 

02:28:17.641 --> 02:28:20.031

the layers in the surrounding ditch now
 

02:28:20.041 --> 02:28:21.680
the layers in the surrounding ditch now
wanted to me you'll notice the

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:21.690
wanted to me you'll notice the
 

02:28:21.690 --> 02:28:24.140
wanted to me you'll notice the
scaffolding next to the Sphinx they're

02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:24.150
scaffolding next to the Sphinx they're
 

02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:25.821
scaffolding next to the Sphinx they're
there they're undertaking these

02:28:25.821 --> 02:28:25.831
there they're undertaking these
 

02:28:25.831 --> 02:28:27.951
there they're undertaking these
campaigns of rests quote/unquote

02:28:27.951 --> 02:28:27.961
campaigns of rests quote/unquote
 

02:28:27.961 --> 02:28:30.411
campaigns of rests quote/unquote
restoration gross but what they're

02:28:30.411 --> 02:28:30.421
restoration gross but what they're
 

02:28:30.421 --> 02:28:31.941
restoration gross but what they're
actually doing is they're covering up

02:28:31.941 --> 02:28:31.951
actually doing is they're covering up
 

02:28:31.951 --> 02:28:34.251
actually doing is they're covering up
the real message of the Sphinx yeah why

02:28:34.251 --> 02:28:34.261
the real message of the Sphinx yeah why
 

02:28:34.261 --> 02:28:35.511
the real message of the Sphinx yeah why
are they doing now why are they

02:28:35.511 --> 02:28:35.521
are they doing now why are they
 

02:28:35.521 --> 02:28:37.310
are they doing now why are they
bothering to try to rebuild the phone I

02:28:37.310 --> 02:28:37.320
bothering to try to rebuild the phone I
 

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.100
bothering to try to rebuild the phone I
don't know it's so stupid like wait

02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:40.110
don't know it's so stupid like wait
 

02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:42.051
don't know it's so stupid like wait
you're not rebuilding it you're building

02:28:42.051 --> 02:28:42.061
you're not rebuilding it you're building
 

02:28:42.061 --> 02:28:44.841
you're not rebuilding it you're building
new shit yeah you're just refacing it

02:28:44.841 --> 02:28:44.851
new shit yeah you're just refacing it
 

02:28:44.851 --> 02:28:45.140
new shit yeah you're just refacing it
yeah

02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:45.150
yeah
 

02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.750
yeah
with new

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760
with new
 

02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:48.690
with new
stealth so gross but at least nobody is

02:28:48.690 --> 02:28:48.700
stealth so gross but at least nobody is
 

02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:51.000
stealth so gross but at least nobody is
messing with the quarry walls where you

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:51.010
messing with the quarry walls where you
 

02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:54.530
messing with the quarry walls where you
can see the water erosion so effectively

02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540
can see the water erosion so effectively
 

02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:59.519
can see the water erosion so effectively
displayed go to the next slide Jamie now

02:28:59.519 --> 02:28:59.529
displayed go to the next slide Jamie now
 

02:28:59.529 --> 02:29:02.780

what we see here is an abandoned quarry

02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:02.790
what we see here is an abandoned quarry
 

02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:06.210
what we see here is an abandoned quarry
it's hard to tell the scale here because

02:29:06.210 --> 02:29:06.220
it's hard to tell the scale here because
 

02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:08.790
it's hard to tell the scale here because
that opening is like 40 feet high but if

02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800
that opening is like 40 feet high but if
 

02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:10.800
that opening is like 40 feet high but if
you look at you see the striations in

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:10.810
you look at you see the striations in
 

02:29:10.810 --> 02:29:14.250
you look at you see the striations in
the rock wall mm-hmm okay this is where

02:29:14.250 --> 02:29:14.260
the rock wall mm-hmm okay this is where
 

02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:16.349
the rock wall mm-hmm okay this is where
they quarried the blocks right and

02:29:16.349 --> 02:29:16.359
they quarried the blocks right and
 

02:29:16.359 --> 02:29:18.360
they quarried the blocks right and
remove the blocks go to the next slide

02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:18.370
remove the blocks go to the next slide
 

02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:21.870
remove the blocks go to the next slide
Jamie okay this kind of shows the

02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880
Jamie okay this kind of shows the
 

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:23.940
Jamie okay this kind of shows the
methodology that they use they would

02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:23.950
methodology that they use they would
 

02:29:23.950 --> 02:29:26.190
methodology that they use they would
create these separation trenches they

02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200
create these separation trenches they
 

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:30.000
create these separation trenches they
would usually go by the the natural bed

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:30.010
would usually go by the the natural bed
 

02:29:30.010 --> 02:29:32.969
would usually go by the the natural bed
bedding layers of the rock go to the

02:29:32.969 --> 02:29:32.979
bedding layers of the rock go to the
 

02:29:32.979 --> 02:29:35.639
bedding layers of the rock go to the
next slide and you'll see here here's

02:29:35.639 --> 02:29:35.649
next slide and you'll see here here's
 

02:29:35.649 --> 02:29:38.910
next slide and you'll see here here's
the presumed process where they're

02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920
the presumed process where they're
 

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:42.480
the presumed process where they're
cutting a separation trench and there's

02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:42.490
cutting a separation trench and there's
 

02:29:42.490 --> 02:29:44.400
cutting a separation trench and there's
a block about to be quarried there and

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:44.410
a block about to be quarried there and
 

02:29:44.410 --> 02:29:45.420
a block about to be quarried there and
then you can see there would have a

02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:45.430
then you can see there would have a
 

02:29:45.430 --> 02:29:47.309
then you can see there would have a
stack of four blocks there and these

02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319
stack of four blocks there and these
 

02:29:47.319 --> 02:29:49.710
stack of four blocks there and these
blocks are enormous several tons oh yeah

02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720
blocks are enormous several tons oh yeah
 

02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:51.960
blocks are enormous several tons oh yeah
that block there would be looks like

02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:51.970
that block there would be looks like
 

02:29:51.970 --> 02:29:54.590
that block there would be looks like
it's probably about four by eight by

02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600
it's probably about four by eight by
 

02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:59.700
it's probably about four by eight by
probably ten so like 320 cubic feet at

02:29:59.700 --> 02:29:59.710
probably ten so like 320 cubic feet at
 

02:29:59.710 --> 02:30:05.010
probably ten so like 320 cubic feet at
160 per so or 180 so you're looking at

02:30:05.010 --> 02:30:05.020
160 per so or 180 so you're looking at
 

02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:07.590
160 per so or 180 so you're looking at
about fifty seven thousand pounds

02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600
about fifty seven thousand pounds
 

02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.790
about fifty seven thousand pounds
divided by two thousand so yeah but -

02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800
divided by two thousand so yeah but -
 

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.040
divided by two thousand so yeah but -
yeah bout 30 tons see it's about 30 tons

02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:14.050
yeah bout 30 tons see it's about 30 tons
 

02:30:14.050 --> 02:30:16.230
yeah bout 30 tons see it's about 30 tons
for that rock right there now go to the

02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240
for that rock right there now go to the
 

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:19.860
for that rock right there now go to the
next slide 30 tons mmm okay now the

02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:19.870
next slide 30 tons mmm okay now the
 

02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:21.179
next slide 30 tons mmm okay now the

reason I'm showing you this is because
this is the process they would have used

02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:23.380
this is the process they would have used
 

02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:26.690
this is the process they would have used
to quarry the blocks away from the the

02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:26.700
to quarry the blocks away from the the
 

02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:29.880
to quarry the blocks away from the the
surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a

02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:29.890
surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a
 

02:30:29.890 --> 02:30:32.760
surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a
quarry wall well at the time that quarry

02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:32.770
quarry wall well at the time that quarry
 

02:30:32.770 --> 02:30:34.139
quarry wall well at the time that quarry
wall was exposed

02:30:34.139 --> 02:30:34.149
wall was exposed
 

02:30:34.149 --> 02:30:36.150
wall was exposed
it would have been essentially a flat

02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160
it would have been essentially a flat
 

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.040
it would have been essentially a flat
surface with this slightly stepped

right now go to the next slide right so

02:30:44.219 --> 02:30:44.229
right now go to the next slide right so
 

02:30:44.229 --> 02:30:46.050
right now go to the next slide right so
there's now would be a cross-section

02:30:46.050 --> 02:30:46.060
there's now would be a cross-section
 

02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:49.170
there's now would be a cross-section
with all of the blocks removed okay go

02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:49.180

here's a limestone face of a quarry

02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:04.990
here's a limestone face of a quarry
 

02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:07.741
here's a limestone face of a quarry
that's been exposed for 3,200 years and

02:31:07.741 --> 02:31:07.751
that's been exposed for 3,200 years and
 

02:31:07.751 --> 02:31:09.751
that's been exposed for 3,200 years and
seems like they used some sort of a

02:31:09.751 --> 02:31:09.761
seems like they used some sort of a
 

02:31:09.761 --> 02:31:12.390
seems like they used some sort of a
chisel - yeah exactly the the pick marks

02:31:12.390 --> 02:31:12.400
chisel - yeah exactly the the pick marks
 

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:14.331
chisel - yeah exactly the the pick marks
are still visible go to the next slide

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:14.341

okay here's stone pick marks in a quarry

02:31:17.011 --> 02:31:17.021
okay here's stone pick marks in a quarry
 

02:31:17.021 --> 02:31:19.711
okay here's stone pick marks in a quarry
from the early New Kingdom circa 15 so

02:31:19.711 --> 02:31:19.721
from the early New Kingdom circa 15 so
 

02:31:19.721 --> 02:31:22.430
from the early New Kingdom circa 15 so
3500 years ago you can actually

02:31:22.430 --> 02:31:22.440
3500 years ago you can actually
 

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.810
3500 years ago you can actually
determine the type of tool that they

02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:24.820
determine the type of tool that they
 

02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:28.381
determine the type of tool that they
used to quarry the rocks the picks are

02:31:28.381 --> 02:31:28.391
used to quarry the rocks the picks are
 

02:31:28.391 --> 02:31:30.991
used to quarry the rocks the picks are
the chisels go to the next one based on

02:31:30.991 --> 02:31:31.001
the chisels go to the next one based on
 

02:31:31.001 --> 02:31:32.401
the chisels go to the next one based on
the marks that are based on tomorrow's

the marks that are based on tomorrow's
 

02:31:32.411 --> 02:31:34.020
the marks that are based on tomorrow's
yeah and here you see that the chisel

02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:34.030
yeah and here you see that the chisel
 

02:31:34.030 --> 02:31:36.541
yeah and here you see that the chisel
marks made or pick marks made by stone

02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:36.551
marks made or pick marks made by stone
 

02:31:36.551 --> 02:31:39.291

are still visible on the face now go to

02:31:49.531 --> 02:31:49.541
are still visible on the face now go to
 

02:31:49.541 --> 02:31:52.470

the next slide now here's the Sphinx go

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:52.480
the next slide now here's the Sphinx go
 

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:54.991
the next slide now here's the Sphinx go
to the next slide and look at that

02:31:54.991 --> 02:31:55.001
to the next slide and look at that
 

02:31:55.001 --> 02:31:58.041
to the next slide and look at that
quarry wall yeah that's crazy it's crazy

02:31:58.041 --> 02:31:58.051
quarry wall yeah that's crazy it's crazy
 

02:31:58.051 --> 02:32:01.440
quarry wall yeah that's crazy it's crazy
yeah now supposedly this quarry wall is

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:01.450
yeah now supposedly this quarry wall is
 

02:32:01.450 --> 02:32:03.781
yeah now supposedly this quarry wall is
only a few centuries older than that

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:03.791
only a few centuries older than that
 

02:32:03.791 --> 02:32:05.730
only a few centuries older than that
last picture we just saw where we could

02:32:05.730 --> 02:32:05.740
last picture we just saw where we could
 

02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:06.781
last picture we just saw where we could
see the pic marks

02:32:06.781 --> 02:32:06.791
see the pic marks
 

02:32:06.791 --> 02:32:09.060
see the pic marks
does that make sense well the only way

02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:09.070
does that make sense well the only way
 

02:32:09.070 --> 02:32:10.381
does that make sense well the only way
it would make sense as if there was a

02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:10.391
it would make sense as if there was a
 

02:32:10.391 --> 02:32:13.470
it would make sense as if there was a
vastly different type of stone well it's

02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:13.480
vastly different type of stone well it's
 

02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:15.631
vastly different type of stone well it's
not though it's it's the same it's it's

02:32:15.631 --> 02:32:15.641
not though it's it's the same it's it's
 

02:32:15.641 --> 02:32:17.970
not though it's it's the same it's it's
a well indurated limestone Robert can

02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:17.980
a well indurated limestone Robert can
 

02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:20.011
a well indurated limestone Robert can
tell you all about the composition of

02:32:20.011 --> 02:32:20.021
tell you all about the composition of
 

02:32:20.021 --> 02:32:22.381
tell you all about the composition of
that stone the the composition does vary

02:32:22.381 --> 02:32:22.391
that stone the the composition does vary
 

02:32:22.391 --> 02:32:24.571
that stone the the composition does vary
though oh yeah like some of its more

02:32:24.571 --> 02:32:24.581
though oh yeah like some of its more
 

02:32:24.581 --> 02:32:26.011
though oh yeah like some of its more
dense than others and that's you're

02:32:26.011 --> 02:32:26.021
dense than others and that's you're
 

02:32:26.021 --> 02:32:28.861
dense than others and that's you're
conceive of the changes yeah and you can

02:32:28.861 --> 02:32:28.871
conceive of the changes yeah and you can
 

02:32:28.871 --> 02:32:30.751
conceive of the changes yeah and you can
see that that indented layer about

02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:30.761
see that that indented layer about
 

02:32:30.761 --> 02:32:32.491
see that that indented layer about
halfway up is going to be a softer

02:32:32.491 --> 02:32:32.501
halfway up is going to be a softer
 

02:32:32.501 --> 02:32:35.401
halfway up is going to be a softer
limestone absolutely it certainly looks

02:32:35.401 --> 02:32:35.411
limestone absolutely it certainly looks
 

02:32:35.411 --> 02:32:37.470
limestone absolutely it certainly looks

02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:37.480
to the layman and I'm clearly a layman
 

02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:39.720
to the layman and I'm clearly a layman
but it certainly looks like like water

02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:39.730
but it certainly looks like like water
 

02:32:39.730 --> 02:32:43.111
but it certainly looks like like water
fissures like Oh fissures that are even

02:32:43.111 --> 02:32:43.121
fissures like Oh fissures that are even
 

02:32:43.121 --> 02:32:44.970

have tried to attribute this to wind and

02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:53.950
have tried to attribute this to wind and
 

02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:58.741
have tried to attribute this to wind and
sand well again you know Robert has

02:32:58.741 --> 02:32:58.751
sand well again you know Robert has
 

02:32:58.751 --> 02:33:01.081

don't look the same so the only reason

02:33:05.161 --> 02:33:05.171
don't look the same so the only reason
 

02:33:05.171 --> 02:33:08.100
don't look the same so the only reason
to attribute this to wind and sand it's

02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:08.110
to attribute this to wind and sand it's
 

02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:10.501
to attribute this to wind and sand it's
not based on the scientific evidence of

and that's why I showed you those

02:33:20.250 --> 02:33:20.260
and that's why I showed you those
 

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.530

Kingdom quarry that's almost the same
 

02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:27.060
Kingdom quarry that's almost the same
age as this so it's actually really not

02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:27.070
age as this so it's actually really not
 

02:33:27.070 --> 02:33:29.130

jam-band that's good okay so there's the

02:33:54.990 --> 02:33:55.000
jam-band that's good okay so there's the
 

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.780

depth of the of the of the ditch it's
 

02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:59.850
depth of the of the of the ditch it's
about 22 feet and air shows each of the

would have looked like hmm and there's
 

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.530
would have looked like hmm and there's
been an enormous amount of rock

02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:16.540
been an enormous amount of rock
 

02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:19.380
been an enormous amount of rock
limestone rock removed and we know the

02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:19.390
limestone rock removed and we know the
 

02:34:19.390 --> 02:34:20.520
limestone rock removed and we know the
profile would have looked like that

02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:20.530
profile would have looked like that
 

02:34:20.530 --> 02:34:22.410

because the stones that were quarried

02:34:22.410 --> 02:34:22.420

covered that up with this reconstruction

02:34:30.570 --> 02:34:30.580
covered that up with this reconstruction
 

02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.230
covered that up with this reconstruction
well most likely most likely and I think

02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240
well most likely most likely and I think
 

02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:36.210

is a time line thing that folks may or
 

02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.551
is a time line thing that folks may or

because that face is only a few thousand
years old and why it would be

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:38.410
years old and why it would be
 

02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:40.320

02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:22.670
around 5,000 years ago there was an
asteroid impact into the Indian Ocean

02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680
asteroid impact into the Indian Ocean
 

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:25.590
asteroid impact into the Indian Ocean
right that plunged through 2 miles of

02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600
right that plunged through 2 miles of
 

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:29.010
right that plunged through 2 miles of
ocean water and blasted a 12 mile wide

02:45:29.010 --> 02:45:29.020
ocean water and blasted a 12 mile wide
 

02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:30.689
ocean water and blasted a 12 mile wide
hole on the floor of the Indian Ocean

02:45:30.689 --> 02:45:30.699
hole on the floor of the Indian Ocean
 

02:45:30.699 --> 02:45:32.460
hole on the floor of the Indian Ocean
and what year was this this would have

02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:32.470
and what year was this this would have
 

02:45:32.470 --> 02:45:35.820
and what year was this this would have
been about 5000 years ago now how much

02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:35.830
been about 5000 years ago now how much
 

02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:38.399
been about 5000 years ago now how much
of an impact would that have had oh it

02:45:38.399 --> 02:45:38.409
of an impact would that have had oh it
 

02:45:38.409 --> 02:45:41.309
of an impact would that have had oh it
would have created tsunamis well on the

02:45:41.309 --> 02:45:41.319
would have created tsunamis well on the
 

02:45:41.319 --> 02:45:43.080
would have created tsunamis well on the
island of Madagascar on the southern

02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:43.090
island of Madagascar on the southern
 

02:45:43.090 --> 02:45:45.540
island of Madagascar on the southern
island of Madagascar and it should be in

02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:45.550
island of Madagascar and it should be in
 

02:45:45.550 --> 02:45:48.780
island of Madagascar and it should be in
this in this program that we've got open

02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:48.790
this in this program that we've got open
 

02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:53.670
this in this program that we've got open
right here Jamie if you go to slide

02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680
right here Jamie if you go to slide
 

02:45:53.680 --> 02:46:01.679
right here Jamie if you go to slide
number yeah go to slide number 111 it's

02:46:01.679 --> 02:46:01.689
number yeah go to slide number 111 it's
 

02:46:01.689 --> 02:46:06.269
number yeah go to slide number 111 it's
so ironic that today our focus is closer

02:46:06.269 --> 02:46:06.279
so ironic that today our focus is closer
 

02:46:06.279 --> 02:46:09.599
so ironic that today our focus is closer
and closer to the cloud closer and

02:46:09.599 --> 02:46:09.609
and closer to the cloud closer and
 

02:46:09.609 --> 02:46:13.139
and closer to the cloud closer and
closer to chips to solid-state hard

02:46:13.139 --> 02:46:13.149
closer to chips to solid-state hard
 

02:46:13.149 --> 02:46:15.030
closer to chips to solid-state hard
drives all these different things that

02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040
drives all these different things that
 

02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:17.519
drives all these different things that
are just not gonna last right no paper

02:46:17.519 --> 02:46:17.529
are just not gonna last right no paper
 

02:46:17.529 --> 02:46:19.380
are just not gonna last right no paper
no but no-one's carving anything in

02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:19.390
no but no-one's carving anything in
 

02:46:19.390 --> 02:46:22.170
no but no-one's carving anything in
stone you know all the knowledge that we

02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:22.180
stone you know all the knowledge that we
 

02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:24.899
stone you know all the knowledge that we
have is like how much of what what

02:46:24.899 --> 02:46:24.909
have is like how much of what what
 

02:46:24.909 --> 02:46:27.420
have is like how much of what what
everybody has is on hard drives I mean

02:46:27.420 --> 02:46:27.430
everybody has is on hard drives I mean
 

02:46:27.430 --> 02:46:29.160
everybody has is on hard drives I mean
how much of what everybody has is in the

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:29.170
how much of what everybody has is in the
 

02:46:29.170 --> 02:46:31.590
how much of what everybody has is in the
cloud on a you know a server somewhere

02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600
cloud on a you know a server somewhere
 

02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:34.500
cloud on a you know a server somewhere
yeah and who the fuck is going to be

02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:34.510
yeah and who the fuck is going to be
 

02:46:34.510 --> 02:46:35.100
yeah and who the fuck is going to be
able to figure out

02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:35.110
able to figure out
 

02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:36.570
able to figure out
how to read that shit a thousand years

02:46:36.570 --> 02:46:36.580
how to read that shit a thousand years
 

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:38.370
how to read that shit a thousand years
from now yeah just lightning happen to

02:46:38.370 --> 02:46:38.380
from now yeah just lightning happen to
 

02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:38.640
from now yeah just lightning happen to
us

02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:38.650
us
 

02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:39.631
us
yeah just like we're trying to figure

02:46:39.631 --> 02:46:39.641
yeah just like we're trying to figure
 

02:46:39.641 --> 02:46:42.480
yeah just like we're trying to figure
out how to read a Gyptian hi laughs okay

02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:42.490
out how to read a Gyptian hi laughs okay
 

02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:43.921
out how to read a Gyptian hi laughs okay
look at look at slide number hundred

02:46:43.921 --> 02:46:43.931
look at look at slide number hundred
 

02:46:43.931 --> 02:46:47.610
look at look at slide number hundred
eleven now I wish I had my pointer here

02:46:47.610 --> 02:46:47.620
eleven now I wish I had my pointer here
 

02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:50.131
eleven now I wish I had my pointer here
go to the next slide so you can see we

02:46:50.131 --> 02:46:50.141
go to the next slide so you can see we
 

02:46:50.141 --> 02:46:52.650
go to the next slide so you can see we
okay right there you see you see those

02:46:52.650 --> 02:46:52.660
okay right there you see you see those
 

02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:54.780
okay right there you see you see those
Wiggly things it's like dragon scales

02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:54.790
Wiggly things it's like dragon scales
 

02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:59.461
Wiggly things it's like dragon scales
yeah what that is is it's water ocean

02:46:59.461 --> 02:46:59.471
yeah what that is is it's water ocean
 

02:46:59.471 --> 02:47:03.001
yeah what that is is it's water ocean
water that washed on land and washed up

02:47:03.001 --> 02:47:03.011
water that washed on land and washed up
 

02:47:03.011 --> 02:47:04.650
water that washed on land and washed up
and you see it kind of comes to a point

02:47:04.650 --> 02:47:04.660
and you see it kind of comes to a point
 

02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:07.770
and you see it kind of comes to a point
and then it washed back out this is this

02:47:07.770 --> 02:47:07.780
and then it washed back out this is this
 

02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:12.001
and then it washed back out this is this
is a tsunami deposit and those features

02:47:12.001 --> 02:47:12.011
is a tsunami deposit and those features
 

02:47:12.011 --> 02:47:13.230
is a tsunami deposit and those features
that you're looking at they kind of look

02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:13.240
that you're looking at they kind of look
 

02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:13.860
that you're looking at they kind of look
like this

02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:13.870
like this
 

02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:16.650
like this
they're called Chevron's right that's

02:47:16.650 --> 02:47:16.660
they're called Chevron's right that's
 

02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:18.660
they're called Chevron's right that's
what happens when the water washes in

02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:18.670
what happens when the water washes in
 

02:47:18.670 --> 02:47:21.990
what happens when the water washes in
makes deposits of giant ripples and then

02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000
makes deposits of giant ripples and then
 

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.730
makes deposits of giant ripples and then
washes back out what kind of time frame

02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:23.740
washes back out what kind of time frame
 

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:25.410
washes back out what kind of time frame
are you talking about when this happens

02:47:25.410 --> 02:47:25.420
are you talking about when this happens
 

02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:27.150
are you talking about when this happens
I want this to do that

02:47:27.150 --> 02:47:27.160
I want this to do that
 

02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:31.230
I want this to do that
Oh hours so that all happened in hours

02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:31.240
Oh hours so that all happened in hours
 

02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:32.970
Oh hours so that all happened in hours
in hours yeah I mean you could still see

02:47:32.970 --> 02:47:32.980
in hours yeah I mean you could still see
 

02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:34.831
in hours yeah I mean you could still see
it today oh yeah go to the next slide

Jaime we're getting a closer up look

02:47:37.591 --> 02:47:37.601
Jaime we're getting a closer up look
 

02:47:37.601 --> 02:47:39.990
Jaime we're getting a closer up look
here now you see how see how they're

02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000
here now you see how see how they're
 

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.910
here now you see how see how they're
shaped almost V like mm-hmm

02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920
shaped almost V like mm-hmm
 

02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:43.530
shaped almost V like mm-hmm
that's the Chevron like a sergeant

02:47:43.530 --> 02:47:43.540
that's the Chevron like a sergeant
 

02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:46.110
that's the Chevron like a sergeant
stripe almost right okay go to the next

02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:46.120
stripe almost right okay go to the next
 

02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.770
stripe almost right okay go to the next
slide okay here's a cross section of one

02:47:49.770 --> 02:47:49.780
slide okay here's a cross section of one
 

02:47:49.780 --> 02:47:52.470
slide okay here's a cross section of one
of those v-shaped Hills it's 600 feet

02:47:52.470 --> 02:47:52.480
of those v-shaped Hills it's 600 feet
 

02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:56.131
of those v-shaped Hills it's 600 feet
and Heights wow that's incredible now

02:47:56.131 --> 02:47:56.141
and Heights wow that's incredible now
 

02:47:56.141 --> 02:47:57.930
and Heights wow that's incredible now
what so what you're seeing in the back

02:47:57.930 --> 02:47:57.940
what so what you're seeing in the back
 

02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:00.720
what so what you're seeing in the back
then up one more Jaime so those images

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:00.730
then up one more Jaime so those images
 

02:48:00.730 --> 02:48:04.350
then up one more Jaime so those images
right there what we're seeing there it

02:48:04.350 --> 02:48:04.360
right there what we're seeing there it
 

02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:06.900
right there what we're seeing there it
looks like the effects of a river or

02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:06.910
looks like the effects of a river or
 

02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:09.450
looks like the effects of a river or
water or something it is water yeah but

02:48:09.450 --> 02:48:09.460
water or something it is water yeah but
 

02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:11.131
water or something it is water yeah but
then when you go back you see it from

02:48:11.131 --> 02:48:11.141
then when you go back you see it from
 

02:48:11.141 --> 02:48:14.341
then when you go back you see it from
the ground it looks like hills yeah 600

02:48:14.341 --> 02:48:14.351
the ground it looks like hills yeah 600
 

02:48:14.351 --> 02:48:15.921
the ground it looks like hills yeah 600
feet high so you're talking about a

02:48:15.921 --> 02:48:15.931
feet high so you're talking about a
 

02:48:15.931 --> 02:48:18.751
feet high so you're talking about a
massive amount of water we're talking

02:48:18.751 --> 02:48:18.761
massive amount of water we're talking
 

02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:21.390
massive amount of water we're talking
about a tsunami who's minimum run-up

02:48:21.390 --> 02:48:21.400
about a tsunami who's minimum run-up
 

02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:23.220
about a tsunami who's minimum run-up
height is the height the thickness of

02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:23.230
height is the height the thickness of
 

02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:26.280
height is the height the thickness of
these hills 600 feet minimum minimum

02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:26.290
these hills 600 feet minimum minimum
 

02:48:26.290 --> 02:48:29.070
these hills 600 feet minimum minimum
minimum and that's of course massive

02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:29.080
minimum and that's of course massive
 

02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:31.261
minimum and that's of course massive
amount of weight and devastation and

02:48:31.261 --> 02:48:31.271
amount of weight and devastation and
 

02:48:31.271 --> 02:48:32.640
amount of weight and devastation and
this was all five thousand years ago

02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:32.650
this was all five thousand years ago
 

02:48:32.650 --> 02:48:36.980
this was all five thousand years ago
yeah go to the next slide Jaime

02:48:36.980 --> 02:48:36.990
 
 

02:48:36.990 --> 02:48:40.711
 
yeah there's Madagascar location of the

02:48:40.711 --> 02:48:40.721
yeah there's Madagascar location of the
 

02:48:40.721 --> 02:48:42.450
yeah there's Madagascar location of the
Chevron's on the southern edge of

02:48:42.450 --> 02:48:42.460
Chevron's on the southern edge of
 

02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:47.240
Chevron's on the southern edge of
Madagascar let's see go to slides up and

02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:47.250
Madagascar let's see go to slides up and
 

02:48:47.250 --> 02:48:49.219
Madagascar let's see go to slides up and
over on the other side

02:48:49.219 --> 02:48:49.229
over on the other side
 

02:48:49.229 --> 02:48:52.010
over on the other side
at the same age if we look at the

02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:52.020
at the same age if we look at the
 

02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:54.139
at the same age if we look at the
southwestern coast of Australia I think

02:48:54.139 --> 02:48:54.149
southwestern coast of Australia I think
 

02:48:54.149 --> 02:48:55.639
southwestern coast of Australia I think
the next slide we'll get a closer in

02:48:55.639 --> 02:48:55.649
the next slide we'll get a closer in
 

02:48:55.649 --> 02:48:56.149
the next slide we'll get a closer in
view

02:48:56.149 --> 02:48:56.159
view
 

02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:59.479
view
there we go you see that splooge mm-hmm

02:48:59.479 --> 02:48:59.489
there we go you see that splooge mm-hmm
 

02:48:59.489 --> 02:49:01.700
there we go you see that splooge mm-hmm
that's that's the technical scientific

02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:01.710
that's that's the technical scientific
 

02:49:01.710 --> 02:49:05.719
that's that's the technical scientific
term is it really blue JH no I just made

02:49:05.719 --> 02:49:05.729
term is it really blue JH no I just made
 

02:49:05.729 --> 02:49:09.139
term is it really blue JH no I just made
that you bet you see they see the stuff

02:49:09.139 --> 02:49:09.149
that you bet you see they see the stuff
 

02:49:09.149 --> 02:49:11.360
that you bet you see they see the stuff
that's been washed over you can see it

02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:11.370
that's been washed over you can see it
 

02:49:11.370 --> 02:49:14.179

anything close to it but what about on
 

02:50:23.130 --> 02:50:24.679
anything close to it but what about on
the other side of the planet I mean

02:50:24.679 --> 02:50:24.689
the other side of the planet I mean
 

02:50:24.689 --> 02:50:26.960
the other side of the planet I mean
there'd have to be some massive effects

02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:26.970
there'd have to be some massive effects
 

02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:28.639
there'd have to be some massive effects
oh there would be most likely what we

02:50:28.639 --> 02:50:28.649
oh there would be most likely what we
 

02:50:28.649 --> 02:50:29.780
oh there would be most likely what we
would see on the other side of the

mount of people worldwide yes Wow and so

02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840
mount of people worldwide yes Wow and so
 

02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:44.780
mount of people worldwide yes Wow and so
that is probably the most recent one

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:44.790
that is probably the most recent one
 

02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:47.000
that is probably the most recent one
that's probably the most recent ah and

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:47.010
that's probably the most recent ah and
 

02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:49.519
that's probably the most recent ah and
no record of it because people really

02:50:49.519 --> 02:50:49.529
no record of it because people really
 

02:50:49.529 --> 02:50:50.780
no record of it because people really
didn't have many records well I think

02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:50.790
didn't have many records well I think
 

02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:53.389
didn't have many records well I think
the record of it is probably when we see

02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.399
the record of it is probably when we see
 

02:50:53.399 --> 02:50:56.030
the record of it is probably when we see
these stories like Noah's Flood and the

02:50:56.030 --> 02:50:56.040
these stories like Noah's Flood and the
 

02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:58.219
these stories like Noah's Flood and the
rest so that's probably about this one

02:50:58.219 --> 02:50:58.229
rest so that's probably about this one
 

02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:59.929
rest so that's probably about this one
so it's not even about the Holocene one

02:50:59.929 --> 02:50:59.939
so it's not even about the Holocene one
 

02:50:59.939 --> 02:51:02.210
so it's not even about the Holocene one
it's about one 5,000 years after the

yes see that's what we're beginning to
realize now is that these events have

02:51:07.730 --> 02:51:07.740
realize now is that these events have
 

02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:09.650
realize now is that these events have
happened with a much greater degree of

02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660
happened with a much greater degree of
 

02:51:09.660 --> 02:51:12.140
happened with a much greater degree of
frequency than anybody had imagined

02:52:40.671 --> 02:52:40.681
lots and lots of field exploration they
 

02:52:40.681 --> 02:52:43.490
lots and lots of field exploration they
have thousands of images of just awesome

02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:43.500
have thousands of images of just awesome
 

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:45.801
have thousands of images of just awesome
stuff does the sacred geometry have

02:52:45.801 --> 02:52:45.811
stuff does the sacred geometry have
 

02:52:45.811 --> 02:52:47.390
stuff does the sacred geometry have
anything to do with this stuff or is

02:52:47.390 --> 02:52:47.400
anything to do with this stuff or is
 

02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:48.801
anything to do with this stuff or is
that a totally different sacred geometry

02:52:48.801 --> 02:52:48.811
that a totally different sacred geometry
 

02:52:48.811 --> 02:52:51.980
that a totally different sacred geometry
put it this way as we've inherited this

02:52:51.980 --> 02:52:51.990
put it this way as we've inherited this
 

02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:54.320
put it this way as we've inherited this
corpus of ancient knowledge sacred

02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:54.330
corpus of ancient knowledge sacred
 

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:56.301
corpus of ancient knowledge sacred
geometry is one of the keys for

02:52:56.301 --> 02:52:56.311
geometry is one of the keys for
 

02:52:56.311 --> 02:52:58.400
geometry is one of the keys for
deciphering these ancient traditions

02:52:58.400 --> 02:52:58.410
deciphering these ancient traditions
 

02:52:58.410 --> 02:53:01.160
deciphering these ancient traditions
because all of these ancient temple

02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:01.170
because all of these ancient temple
 

02:53:01.170 --> 02:53:03.230
because all of these ancient temple
structures which are the textbooks in

02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:03.240
structures which are the textbooks in
 

02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:05.841
structures which are the textbooks in
stone if you will have several

02:53:05.841 --> 02:53:05.851
stone if you will have several
 

02:53:05.851 --> 02:53:09.460
stone if you will have several
components in in common astronomical and

02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:09.470
components in in common astronomical and
 

02:53:09.470 --> 02:53:11.960
components in in common astronomical and
geometrical being the two predominant

02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:11.970
geometrical being the two predominant
 

02:53:11.970 --> 02:53:13.820
geometrical being the two predominant
and if you understand the geometry you

02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:13.830
and if you understand the geometry you
 

02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:15.921
and if you understand the geometry you
realize the geometry is like a universal

02:53:15.921 --> 02:53:15.931
realize the geometry is like a universal
 

02:53:15.931 --> 02:53:16.420
realize the geometry is like a universal
code

02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:16.430
code
 

02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:19.210
code
by where whereby you can preserve

02:53:19.210 --> 02:53:19.220
by where whereby you can preserve
 

02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:21.779
by where whereby you can preserve
certain types of information because

02:53:21.779 --> 02:53:21.789
certain types of information because
 

02:53:21.789 --> 02:53:23.920
certain types of information because
geometry is universal doesn't matter

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:23.930
geometry is universal doesn't matter
 

02:53:23.930 --> 02:53:25.659
geometry is universal doesn't matter
what your spoken language is the

02:53:25.659 --> 02:53:25.669
what your spoken language is the
 

02:53:25.669 --> 02:53:27.449
what your spoken language is the
principles of geometry are what they are

02:53:27.449 --> 02:53:27.459
principles of geometry are what they are
 

02:53:27.459 --> 02:53:30.250
principles of geometry are what they are
you know the relationship of a of a

02:53:30.250 --> 02:53:30.260
you know the relationship of a of a
 

02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:32.500
you know the relationship of a of a
radius to a circle is the same and it

02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:32.510
radius to a circle is the same and it
 

02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:34.449
radius to a circle is the same and it
doesn't matter what culture you come

02:53:34.449 --> 02:53:34.459
doesn't matter what culture you come
 

02:53:34.459 --> 02:53:35.469
doesn't matter what culture you come
from you see

02:53:35.469 --> 02:53:35.479
from you see
 

02:53:35.479 --> 02:53:39.189
from you see
and so geometry is a critical means of

02:53:39.189 --> 02:53:39.199
and so geometry is a critical means of
 

02:53:39.199 --> 02:53:42.370
and so geometry is a critical means of
deciphering the the knowledge that and I

02:53:42.370 --> 02:53:42.380
deciphering the the knowledge that and I
 

02:53:42.380 --> 02:53:44.920
deciphering the the knowledge that and I
think that the that the predominant way

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:44.930
think that the that the predominant way
 

02:53:44.930 --> 02:53:46.840
think that the that the predominant way
of preserving ancient knowledge is in

02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:46.850
of preserving ancient knowledge is in
 

02:53:46.850 --> 02:53:49.029
of preserving ancient knowledge is in
the temple structures and they have to

02:53:49.029 --> 02:53:49.039
the temple structures and they have to
 

02:53:49.039 --> 02:53:51.250
the temple structures and they have to
be looked at as textbooks in stone and

02:53:51.250 --> 02:53:51.260
be looked at as textbooks in stone and
 

02:53:51.260 --> 02:53:53.319
be looked at as textbooks in stone and
once we begin to realize that then we

02:53:53.319 --> 02:53:53.329
once we begin to realize that then we
 

02:53:53.329 --> 02:53:55.330
once we begin to realize that then we
can go it's like when you go to Egypt

02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:55.340
can go it's like when you go to Egypt
 

02:53:55.340 --> 02:53:57.159
can go it's like when you go to Egypt
it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a

02:53:57.159 --> 02:53:57.169
it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a
 

02:53:57.169 --> 02:53:59.080
it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a
part of it but it's also the geometry

02:53:59.080 --> 02:53:59.090
part of it but it's also the geometry
 

02:53:59.090 --> 02:54:01.479
part of it but it's also the geometry
and the astronomy that's encoded there

02:54:01.479 --> 02:54:01.489
and the astronomy that's encoded there
 

02:54:01.489 --> 02:54:03.849
and the astronomy that's encoded there
and we can see the same astronomy at

02:54:03.849 --> 02:54:03.859
and we can see the same astronomy at
 

02:54:03.859 --> 02:54:05.380
