00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.830
 françois hollande go I think it's 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 a good chair but right now 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.680
 it's not too much the case it's a bit 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.980
 difficult for France from below 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.770
 it was just to tell you that you 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.449
 we have all very disappointed the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.790
 room has changed although you have 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.290
 do it's marriage for everyone then 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.320
 today that's me I voted for 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.489
 you 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.090
 there were plenty of things that were 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.800
 promised I am very disappointed I remain 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 still left but I'm waiting 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.750
 really a radical change is not 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.290
 very interesting not my hair rather 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 comic as president me it will be a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.090
 question about selective immigration 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.430
 that is to say like in canada a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.340
 easing a little bit for that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.750
 avoid that everyone goes back to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.820
 borders something more 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.170
 square gée also highlights that you 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.960
 personal business are quite 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.940
 outrageous she looks at you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.670
 you alone and not spread out in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:42.460
 newspapers only have your friendships 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 besides all the media beast and you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 here he just has us 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.850
 we all voted for him, hoping 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.250
 that there are plenty of things that went 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.170
 change made us hope at home 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 to do nothing he was what makes 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.130
 our country but not ours 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.130
 I love you people are stupid 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:05.470
 understand nothing i love you i repeat 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 ok I'm looking there I think that in 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.360
 does he have nothing to do in power 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.620
 and that we beat nicolas sarkozy and go 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 definitely replace it at next 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.590
 presidential elections 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.239
 we are a student you see our 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.010
 the only wait is to unite studies and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.050
 from sincere strangers 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.220
 we can see that today in France 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.930
 can not afford to succeed 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.590

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.180
 so françois lamy is the brilliant 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.560

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.299

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.970
 courage Mr. President of Courage 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.970
 a lot of things you still have very 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.560
 very little time so I really hope 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.180
 that you will change things for 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.460
 young people in France because it's not 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.900
