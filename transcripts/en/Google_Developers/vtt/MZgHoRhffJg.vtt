TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.489
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.290
This is your TL;DR.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.850
Defer actions until the
user has stable connectivity

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.300
with the new web
API Background Sync.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.330
Check out how with
the link below.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210
It just became a
lot easier to see

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.020
any issues you have
with certificates

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.950
and mixed content with
the Security Panel

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.700
introduced with Chrome 48.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.020
The blog post and video have
details on how to use it.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.960
Learn how to use
JavaScript Promises

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.880
for deferred and asynchronous
computation with this course

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.900
built in collaboration
with you Udacity.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.680
Happy 100th blog
post, Apps Script.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.620
Thanks for helping
developers create add-ons

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.340
for Google Sheets,
Docs, or Forms,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.250
automate their
workflows, integrate

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.810
with external APIs, and more.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.410
Here's a few recent
posts to celebrate.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.480
Tips and best practices for
developing more complex Apps

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.360
Scripts solutions.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.632
A new calendar resource
API that enables

00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:58.090
Google for Work
customers to manage

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.450
their physical resources,
like conference rooms

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.600
and printers, or even nap
pods and tennis courts.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.349
And the latest version
of the Google Drive

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.610
API for a leaner, faster by
default, and more consistent

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.760
interface to Google Drive.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.090
And although not exactly
developer-related,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.020
I just thought this was
a really cool article

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.490
about a group of
doctors that used

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820
Google Cardboard to
visualize the anatomy

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.030
of a four-month-old girl
before a life-saving surgery.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.560
Just a reminder that the stuff
we're all working on together

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.960
can have a real impact
on people's lives.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.020
And finally, Lenovo
and Google recently

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260
announced a partnership
to create a new mainstream

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.030
smartphone with
Project Tango built in.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.770
Which, of course, if
you haven't already,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.526
makes it a great time to
get to know Project Tango.

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:42.150
So we thought for
the rest of the show,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.000
we'd hang out with
the Project Tango

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.436
team at their latest developer
workshop in San Francisco.

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:55.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.690
I'm standing here with
Johnny Lee, who many of you

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.700
may recognize from
his YouTube video--

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.690
the head tracking
with the Wii remotes--

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.526
and now you're the Technical
Program Lead for Project Tango.

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:05.380
JOHNNY LEE: Indeed.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.963
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What
is Project Tango,

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:08.456
and what can it mean for users?

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.410
JOHNNY LEE: Yeah, so if you
think about your ability

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.170
to walk through your house,
to walk to your office,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.530
you have this amazing
ability that you've

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.650
evolved where you
use your eyesight,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.270
and you use some
of your information

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.050
from your inner ear to be
able to get from room to room,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.990
and get to your living
room, walk down the hallway.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.670
And that information is
meaningful to you and to me,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.470
but our devices--
like our phones--

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.020
really don't have that same
sense of physical space.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.210
So what we've been
doing with Project Tango

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.460
is trying to give our tools
this human-scale sense of space

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.560
and motion.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.477
And we do that with a
combination of sensors

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:50.060
and software
[? stacks. ?] So, there's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.720
a special set of
cameras that are built

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.890
into the mobile
device, and we run

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.740
a software library on Android
that does the sensor fusion.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.350
And we get an accurate,
six degree of freedom

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.564
position of the
device in real time.

00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:03.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's huge.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.438
JOHNNY LEE: So you
can almost think of it

00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:07.970
like it's a 3D mouse, right?

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.220
When you move it, it goes
up and down, left and right,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.350
and you can rotate it.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.940
And you can use it to track your
position throughout the room.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.170
And that enables things like
VR and AR applications--

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.670
[? style ?] applications-- but
through a little magic window

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.636
instead.

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:30.039
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Here I am with
Eric Johnson, Head of Business

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.060
Development for Project Tango.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.810
Hi, Eric.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.380
ERIC JOHNSON: Hey, Timothy.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.950
How's it going?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.283
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's going well.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.710
So I wanted to talk to you
about Project Tango, obviously.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.480
We're here in San
Francisco at a developer

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.280
workshop for Project Tango.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.710
Developers are building
really cool applications

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.870
out there, some of which
we'll see in a little bit.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.370
But to start with, what's
the big thing that's

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.200
happened in Project Tango that's
motivating developers the most

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.030
right now?

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.170
ERIC JOHNSON: So last
week we announced

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.380
we have a mass-market consumer
phone coming this summer.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.050
And so that's really the
exciting thing that I think

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.280
has woken up the ecosystem.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.080
People have been aware
of Project Tango,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.590
but now that it's real--
there's real hardware coming--

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.222
developers are much more
excited about building something

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:08.930
for that experience
when the phone ships.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, and I
mean mass-market consumer phone

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.220
sounds like a big thing, but
the practical elements of this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.630
is that developers have been
experimenting and playing

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.480
with Tango.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.570
But now actual users are
going to have actual phones

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.790
in their pockets this summer.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.290
ERIC JOHNSON: That's
right, exactly.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.229
And so what we're
doing in parallel

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.270
is we're hosting developer
workshops every month.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.619
And this is one example, this
one here in San Francisco.

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:33.160
This one happens to be focused
on location-based experiences.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.284
So Tango does a number of
things, one of the things

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.050
that it does is provides
indoor location and navigation.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.222
And so we've got some
awesome brands here.

00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:41.680
We've got some
retail brands, we've

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.430
got Google teams
that are here, we've

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.040
got developers that work in
the location-based environment.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.625
We've got robot companies.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.250
And they're all
collaborating together,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.010
and it's awesome to see the
demos that are coming out

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.802
of these workshops.

00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:53.801
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.421
Now if a developer was really
interested in Project Tango,

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.295
and they wanted to take
it to the next level,

00:04:58.295 --> 00:04:59.950
I hear you have
an app incubator.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.710
Is that right?

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.120
ERIC JOHNSON: That's right.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.828
We just announced that
last week as well,

00:05:02.828 --> 00:05:04.990
when we announced the
Lenovo phone at CES.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.640
And I think you're going
to show the website here.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.140
We encourage people
to go to that website,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.290
check out the app
incubator, read the details.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.970
And that's really
where we're looking

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.001
to go for more of the
deep experience we

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.500
have with our current
app developers

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.620
and broaden that out,
encourage more developers

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.500
to work with us.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.460
And then from that
we're investing in some,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.984
we're inviting
some to workshops,

00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:23.900
we're looking to highlight
some at Google I/O,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.000
we're looking to highlight
some as we launch the phone.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.160
So that's really the
place that people

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.680
want to go to learn about
developing on Project Tango.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.810
All right, Eric.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.410
Well, I think we're
going to talk to Johnny.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.670
We're going to check
out some demos.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.510
ERIC JOHNSON: All
right, sounds good.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.992
Thanks for coming up.

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:41.529
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
think there's a lot

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.350
to be excited about
with Project Tango.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.210
But this is one of
those platforms where

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.543
I wonder if there's some
things where you didn't realize

00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.197
that they would be as cool as
they actually were once you

00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:54.280
actually played with them.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.470
Is there anything like that?

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.230
JOHNNY LEE: We built a lot
of simple code with our SDK,

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.380
or tried to provide as
much sample code as we can.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.070
And so one of our
engineers decided

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.790
to make a little
virtual pet cat.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
I've seen this cat.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.790
This cat is amazing!

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.090
JOHNNY LEE: Yeah, actually
it's disappointingly cute.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.970
Or annoyingly cute,
I'll put it that way.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.350
So it's a little 3D cat, he
runs around on the ground.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.180
But it uses the sensors
to actually detect

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.450
where the floors are.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.060
It can actually jump on your
bed and jump on the table,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.390
and when you get close to the
cat, he'll paw at the screen.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.260
It's really cute,
and you can show it

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.610
to people who are
unfamiliar with technology,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.780
and they get engaged with it.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.201
We picked a friendly cat.

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:47.350
