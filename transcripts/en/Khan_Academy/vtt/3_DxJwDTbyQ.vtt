00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.680
I've written some
example relationships

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.170
between two variables-- in
this case between m and n,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.122
between a and b,
between x and y.

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:08.580
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
is see if we can identify
whether the relationships are

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.140
a direct relationship,
whether they vary directly,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.900
or maybe they vary inversely,
or maybe it is neither.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.450
So let's explore
it a little bit.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.024
So over here, we have
m/n is equal to 1/7.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:24.690
So let's see how we
can manipulate this.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.239
If we multiply both sides by n.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.280
What are we going to get?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.080
And in general, you
want to separate

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.782
them so that the
two variables are

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.240
on different sides
of the equation,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.320
so you can see is
it going to meet,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.040
is it going to be the pattern--
let me write it this way.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.380
m is equal to k times n.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.270
This would be direct variation.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.640
Or is it going to be the pattern
m is equal to k times 1/n?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.392
This is inverse variation.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:49.850
And you see in
either one of these,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.110
they're on different
sides of the equal sign.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110
So let's take this first
relationship right now.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.480
Let's multiply both sides by n.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.210
And you get m, because
these cancel out,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.769
is equal to 1/7 times n.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.350
So this actually meets the
direct variation pattern.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.560
It's some constant times n. m is
equal to some constant times n.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.900
So this right over
here is direct.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.030
They vary directly.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300
This is direct variation.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.315
Let's see, ab is
equal to negative 3.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.440
So if we want to separate
them-- and we could do it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.660
with either variable, we
could divide both sides.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.700
I don't know, let's
divide both sides by a.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.650
We could have done it by b.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.010
If we divide both sides by a, we
get b is equal to negative 3/a.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.910
Or we could also
write this as b is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.930
equal to negative 3 times 1/a.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.040
And once again, this is
this pattern right here.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.230
One variable is equal
to a constant times 1

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.930
over the other variable.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.500
In this case, our
constant is negative 3.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.925
So over here, they
vary inversely.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.480
This is an inverse relationship.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.800
Let's try this one over here.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.590
I'll try to do it in that same
color. xy is equal to 1/10.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.920
Once again, let's try to
separate the variables,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.000
isolate them on either
side of the equation.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.647
Let's divide both sides by x.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.980
You could divide by y, because
you're really just trying

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.260
to find an inverse or
direct relationship.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.700
So divide both sides by x.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.900
You get y is equal
to 1/10 over x,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.410
which is the same
thing as 1/10x, which

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.460
is the same thing
as 1/10 times 1/x.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.970
So y is equal to some
constant times 1/x.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.220
Once again, this is an inverse,
y and x vary inversely.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.580
Let's do this one over here.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.260
9 times m-- I'll go to that same
orange color-- 9 times 1/m is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
equal to n.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.110
So this one's actually
already done for us.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.130
And it might be a
little bit clearer

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.580
if we just flip this around.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.621
If we just flip the left
and the right hand side,

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:57.530
we get n is equal
to 9 times 1/m.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.990
n is equal to some
constant times 1/m.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.750
So n varies inversely
with m, inverse.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.890
And remember, if I say
that n varies inversely

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.460
with m, that also means that
m varies inversely with n.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.910
Those two things
imply each other.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.910
Now let's try it with
this expression over here.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.040
And this one's a little
bit of a trickier one,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.750
because we've already separated
the variables on both hands.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.520
And then we have this
kind of-- if this

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.650
was b is equal to
1/3 times a, then

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.340
we would have direct
variation, then

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.570
b would vary directly with a.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.450
But in this case,
we have 1/3 minus a.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.260
And you say, hey, maybe
they're opposites, or whatever.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.860
And it actually turns
out that this is neither.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.750
This is neither.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.560
And to make that
point 100% clear,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.630
let's look at two
of these examples.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.430
In direct variation,
if you scale up

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.470
one variable in
one direction, you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.190
would scale up the other
variable by the same amount.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.250
So if we have x going--
if x doubles from 1 to 2,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.000
when x is 1-- actually, I
should this with m and n.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.520
So m and n.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.880
So when-- and the way
I've written it here,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.570
although you could algebraically
manipulate it so that one looks

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.060
more dependent than the other.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.310
But in this situation
where n is 1, m is 1/7.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.830
And when n is 7, m
is going to be 1.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.950
So you have the situation
that if n is scaled up by 7,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.250
then m is also scaled
up by 7, or vice versus.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.620
So it's more of a relationship.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.590
I could have expressed
n in terms of m,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.390
but when you scale
one variable up by 7,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.630
you also have to scale up
the other variable by 7.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.267
When you scale it
up by some amount,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.600
you have to scale the other
variable by the same amount.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.300
So this is direct variation.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.600
Let's take the inverse, or when
two variables vary inversely,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.870
this situation right over here.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.010
Let's take a and b.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.464
When a is equal to 1, b
is equal to negative 3.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:08.380
And we could do it
explicitly right over here.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.838
We can even go to
the original one.

00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:12.580
When a is equal to 1, we have
1b is equal to negative 3.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.280
b is equal to negative 3.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.950
Now when a-- if I were to take
a, and if I were to, let's say,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.480
I were to triple it.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.240
So far we're going
to multiply it by 3.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.850
So now a is 3.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.000
We have 1/3 times negative 3.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.980
So now b is negative.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.360
Notice we didn't
multiply b times 3 here.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.380
Now we divided b times 3, or we
divided b by 3, I should say.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.750
Or another way is we
multiplied by 1/3.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.490
So if you scale up a by 3,
you're scaling down b by 3.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.560
So they're varying inversely.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.250
What you're going to
see in this neither

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.333
is that neither of these
are going to be the case.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.100
So let's try it out.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.090
I'll do it in that same
green color, that same green.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.010
So we have a and b.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.910
So when a is-- I don't know,
what a is 1, what is b?

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.310
1/3 minus 1, that's 1/3 minus
3/3, that's negative 2/3.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.360
And then let's
divide just for fun.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.220
Let's divide a by 3.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.620
So if a goes to 1/3, so over
here we're dividing by 3,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.490
or you could say we're
multiplying by 1/3.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.260
So if a is 1/3, then b
is equal to 0, right?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.880
If a is 1/3, b is equal to 0.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.420
So notice, if this
was direct variation,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.580
we would be multiplying this by
1/3 as well-- which, clearly,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.490
we didn't.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.350
And if this was
inverse variation,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.120
if they varied inversely, we
would be multiplying by 3,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.180
which clearly we didn't.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.640
We just got some other number,
which actually ended up

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.310
the scaling actually
didn't matter.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.100
What happens is
that things really

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.560
just got shifted by some amount.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.736
They got shifted by 2/3.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.300
These neither vary
directly nor inversely,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.920
this last one right over here.
