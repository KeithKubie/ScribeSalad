00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.329
Our transpose code is reading 1024 by 1024 elements.

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:11.953
Each element has 4 bytes, and we are both reading and writing them,

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:16.254
so we're going to have to transfer those values across the bus twice.

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.433
That's the total amount of memory.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.124
It's taking 0.67 milliseconds,

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:25.895
which is about 1.25 times 10 to the 10 bytes per second,

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:30.633
or scaled to gigabytes, about 12.5 gigabytes per second.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:34.177
So we're not really coming that close to the theoretical peak bandwidth.

00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:36.200
We can probably do better.
