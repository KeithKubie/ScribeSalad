Physiologically, marijuana increases heart rate, bronchodilation, reddening of

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:11.478
the eyes, and dryness of the throat and mouth. In addition, there's some

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.894
perceptual changes such as difficulty estimating time, sometimes referred to as

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:21.309
time expansion, verbal behavior decreases. Whereas there's an increase in

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:26.496
nonverbal behaviors or interactions. Sometimes people report feeling giddy, but

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:31.120
sometimes people also experience anxiety and its these users who report feeling

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.166
like will not return back to normal. Acute administration of marijuana can

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.856
disrupt cognitive performance including slowed cognitive processing, impaired

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:47.050
short term memory. Impaired inhibitory control. Loss of sustained

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.394
concentration. And impaired visuospatial processing. Medically, marijuana has

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:59.140
been shown to be beneficial for some chronic pain, nausea, and anxiety.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.361
However, medical acceptance of marijuana is still under debate. Now, let's go

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.780
back to Susan for the last class of drugs we're going to be covering in this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.890
lesson.
