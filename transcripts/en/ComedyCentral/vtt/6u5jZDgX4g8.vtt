OKAY?

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.533
MY MOM WAS JUST DIAGNOSED
WITH TERMINAL CANCER!

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.468

NO PROBLEM.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.203

THE SNIFFLES.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.606

W-WE PUT IT IN A PILL,
OR SOMETHING?

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.250
- GOSH, YOU'RE BAD

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.324
- SO--[coughs]
HOW EXACTLY DOES THIS WORK?

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.860
- OKAY, THIS IS--THIS
IS GONNA SOUND INSANE, MOM,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.795
BUT, UH,
CHIEF WINDFEATHER HERE...

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:05.232

TO USE THESE POWERS
TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:15.442
HE HAS TO BE VERY,
VERY CLOSE TO YOU--

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.278
INSIDE OF YOU ACTUALLY,
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.615
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO TO YOU,
IT'S GONNA SEEM A LOT LIKE SEX,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.584
BUT IT'S NOT SEX AT ALL.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:26.286
IT'S JUST
AN ANCIENT, ANCIENT THERAPY

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.957
THAT IS GUARANTEED TO WORK.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.194
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, MOM?

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:36.597

I'LL BE HONEST.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.875
- UH, HOW DO I, UH--

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:51.111
OH, A BOWLING BALL
HAS THREE HOLES IN IT, RIGHT?

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.713
- YES.
- OKAY,

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:56.783
SO IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE
TO BOWL A GOOD GAME

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.520
WITH JUST ONE FINGER.
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.822

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.475
- [laughing] OH, THANK GOD!
THAT'S AMAZING!

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.611

GET CANKER SORES AGAIN!

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.079

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:36.089
- WELL, THE ONLY CURE FOR THAT
IS THE TRIPLE FIST.

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:37.591

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:50.337
- WOW!

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.972
HEY, LISTEN,

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.409
