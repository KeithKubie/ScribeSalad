00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.360
how did you become involved in science

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
how did you become involved in science
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.320
how did you become involved in science
if you go back to thank for me it was it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
if you go back to thank for me it was it
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.750
if you go back to thank for me it was it
was probably goes back to a teacher in

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760
was probably goes back to a teacher in
 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.599
was probably goes back to a teacher in
junior high middle school who is who is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
junior high middle school who is who is
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.279

an outstanding it was an outstanding

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
an outstanding it was an outstanding
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.259

teacher and really started challenging

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269
teacher and really started challenging
 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.880
teacher and really started challenging
me and getting me interested in science

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
me and getting me interested in science
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.669
me and getting me interested in science
and so it continued from there it took

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679
and so it continued from there it took
 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.710
and so it continued from there it took
many different variations along the way

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
many different variations along the way
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.140
many different variations along the way
until I arrived at chemistry but it was

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
until I arrived at chemistry but it was
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.139
until I arrived at chemistry but it was
still always a science science emphasis

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149
still always a science science emphasis
 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.869
still always a science science emphasis
and that's a shock but I've always been

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
and that's a shock but I've always been
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720
and that's a shock but I've always been
curious about things and interested in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
curious about things and interested in
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.169
curious about things and interested in
making things and I still work a lot

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179
making things and I still work a lot
 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.029
making things and I still work a lot
with my hands and woodworking and so on

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
with my hands and woodworking and so on
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.650
with my hands and woodworking and so on
so when I was maybe eight years old my

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660
so when I was maybe eight years old my
 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.770
so when I was maybe eight years old my
second oldest brother Ted gave me what

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
second oldest brother Ted gave me what
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.770
second oldest brother Ted gave me what
we call the proverbial chemistry set and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
we call the proverbial chemistry set and
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.060
we call the proverbial chemistry set and
so that got me interested in chemistry I

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070
so that got me interested in chemistry I
 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.250
so that got me interested in chemistry I
decided to channel my efforts in that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
decided to channel my efforts in that
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.179
decided to channel my efforts in that
direction and never really changed I

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189
direction and never really changed I
 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.429
direction and never really changed I
kept with chemistry more or less sounds

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
kept with chemistry more or less sounds
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.950
kept with chemistry more or less sounds
like then dangerous thing to get the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
like then dangerous thing to get the
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560
like then dangerous thing to get the
chemistry set to put it in the hands of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
chemistry set to put it in the hands of
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.160
chemistry set to put it in the hands of
this child

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
this child
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410
this child
well back then they were they were

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
well back then they were they were
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899
well back then they were they were
pretty good things a lot of stuff no

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
pretty good things a lot of stuff no
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.620
pretty good things a lot of stuff no
accidents I wouldn't say no that's what

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
accidents I wouldn't say no that's what
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.300
accidents I wouldn't say no that's what
keeps you in chemistry as the explosion

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
keeps you in chemistry as the explosion
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.299
keeps you in chemistry as the explosion
is the accidents
