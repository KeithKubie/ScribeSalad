- Vodka.

- There's so many--

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.122

I have a moth infestation.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.957

Good day.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.823
My name is Duncan Trussell...

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.658

<i> This story starts in
 New Jersey with Thomas Edison.</i>

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.900
<i> One of the great
 inventors of the time.</i>

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.902
Known as
"The Wizard of Menlo Park."

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.606
<i> He would get poor geniuses,
 gather them together,</i>

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.441
<i> and he's like </i>
Just make stuff for me.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.910
If it's good I'm gonna say
it's mine. Whatever.

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.179
You're gonna make money,
so just do it.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.255
<i> He managed to take
 a bunch of pictures</i>

<i> of a horse running
 and spin them on a cylinder</i>

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.560
<i> in a way
 that gave it animation.</i>

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:37.063
<i> And Edison's like </i>
You know, great.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start position:0%
A hor--a horse...
running.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.068 align:start position:0%
[chuckles]
Cool invention or whatever. Bye.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.936
<i> And then he's like </i>
We gotta [bleep]ing

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.172
figure this [bleep] out
because people are gonna

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.673
wanna watch this stuff.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.342
We gotta start working
on this [bleep]...

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.345
right [bleep]ing now.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.414 line:0%
And then in 1893
Edison is like

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.817 line:0%
I figured out how to do it,
guys!

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.052
I can--I can photograph

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.455
and make a movie.
We can make movies now.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:05.558
I came up with the very first
camera, the Kinetograph

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.627
and I figured out a way
to look at the strings

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.029
of moving pictures--
a Kinetoscope,

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.932
and it's all my idea.
My idea!

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.800
He has people--
[laughing]

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.336
I'm too drunk.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.739
Why would I take another drink?

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:23.543
<i> So Edison needed content
 for his Kinetoscopes</i>

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.479
<i> and everything he was putting
 out was [bleep].</i>

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:29.382
<i> He's like</i> Let's get
[bleep]ing cats boxing, man,

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.518
and then vaudeville scenes,
people chasing each other.

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:36.422
Let's film a blacksmith's shop.
Everyone's gonna wanna see that.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.258
Right, guys?
Right? Right!

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.660
<i> And they filmed it.</i>

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.396
People were into it, man.
Freaking out.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.464
<i> Everyone's like</i> Have you been
to the Kinetoscope parlor?

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.733 align:start position:0%
Oh, you've got to go.
It's incredible!

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.402
<i> So people came to Edison,
 they're like</i>

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.603
Hey, look what we can do.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:51.904
We can project images
on the screen.

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:52.972
<i> He's like </i>
Wow. That's amazing.

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.574
I can't believe
I invented that.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.443
That's incredible.
I am so [bleep]ing smart!

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:58.945
Let's patent this [bleep].

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.214
<i> Movies take off.
 People love it.</i>

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.416
<i> They went to these places
 called nickelodeons.</i>

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.218
For a nickel
you're in a Greek theatre.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.652
Come on in!

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:07.954
<i> People would sit in those
 theatres and be like</i>

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.622
This is awesome.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.525
<i> So then Edison creates
 an industry town</i>

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:16.062 line:0%
<i> and everyone comes to Fort Lee
 to start making movies</i>

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.364 line:0%
and Edison squeezes
all of them.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.533
<i> He was like </i>
Join me in what we're gonna call

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.169
The Edison Trust
and all of you assholes

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.638
can join together with me
and we're gonna make it so that

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.874
no other mother[bleep]ers
make movies except us.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:32.245
Got it?
Write it down in your notebook.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.813

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.548 align:end position:100%
I don't want you to sue me,
so I'll just agree

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.416 align:end position:100%
to whatever you say
because you're super-rich

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.519 align:end position:100%

So, great.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:42.355 align:start position:0%
Sounds good.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.991
They created a monopoly
on all filmmaking.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.793 line:0%
<i> There was a--a fellow

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.801 align:start position:0%
People are paying a nickel

Why don't we try to make

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.374

he was just eating a turd

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:51.324
- Elon Musk, he's doing
the opposite of what Edison did.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.192
He's giving away his patents

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.161
and it's no accident
that Elon Musk's company

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.762
