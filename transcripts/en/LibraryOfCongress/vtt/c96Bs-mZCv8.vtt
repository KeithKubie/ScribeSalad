[applause]

00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:37.563
&gt;&gt; Good morning 
&gt;&gt;

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:40.675
 Good morning 
&gt;&gt; I'm Leanne Potter.  I

00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:43.803
 direct educational outreach at 
the Library of

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:46.982
 Congress.  I'm so happy that 
all of you are here for

00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.163
 this really terrific event.  
How many of 

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.345
you, and I'm going to ask you 
guys to dim that light for

00:05:54.532 --> 00:05:56.532
 a second so I can see a raise 
of hands.  How many

00:05:57.618 --> 00:05:59.618
 of you have ever tried 
something new?  

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:02.722
 Yeah... I kind of thought so.  

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:05.813
 So... you know how when you try
 something 

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:08.901
new, you're really excited about
 it and then sometimes you get

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.990
 a little scared about it?  You 
know how that 

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.117
is?  Yeah... that happens to all
 of us. 

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.196
 And here at, here, well... let 
me put

00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:21.283
 it this way.  When you're 
excited, and

00:06:22.406 --> 00:06:26.339
 even when you're scared, it 
always helps to have somebody 

00:06:22.406 --> 00:06:24.406
who

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:27.489
 is encouraging you and somebody
 who is as

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:30.617
 enthusiastic and as excited as 
you are about whatever

00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:37.394
 that new thing is, you know?  
And... here at the library, 

00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:35.461
we've been

00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:38.574
 trying a lot of new things 
lately.  We want

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.766
 to make sure that everybody 
knows about

00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:44.852
 this amazing library and its 
incredible

00:06:45.986 --> 00:06:47.986
 collections and how much we can
 learn here

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:51.106
 at the library.  And

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.220
 we're trying a bunch of new 
things, you know, like maybe

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.332
 inviting a superstar wrestler 
actor

00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:00.441
 to come and read a book and 
fortunately for

00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:03.558
 us, we have a librarian

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.639
 of Congress who shares our

00:07:07.732 --> 00:07:09.732
 excitement and encourages and

00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:12.837
 leads us with her energy and

00:07:15.048 --> 00:07:18.981
 her enthusiasm.  So... I'm 
really honored this morning to 

00:07:15.048 --> 00:07:17.048
be the

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:20.157
 one who gets to introduce

00:07:21.244 --> 00:07:23.244
 you to Dr. Karla Hayden.  The

00:07:24.323 --> 00:07:26.323
 14th librarian of Congress.  
She earned

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.447
 her Ph.D. at the University of 
Chicago.  She began

00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:32.556
 her career as a children's 
librarian.  She led

00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:35.647
 the Pratt Library in Baltimore.
  She was the

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:38.756
 president of the American 
Library Association and

00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.831
 she's absolutely aware of the 
power of reading and

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.930
 the magic of a good 

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.848
story.  Dr. Hayden?
[cheering and applause]

00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:51.133
&gt;&gt; So...

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:55.903
 what an exciting day.  
You didn't know all that other 

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.237
stuff she was

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:57.362
 saying when I was here seeing 
how you all 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:00.449
are.  
I'm so excited because this is 

00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:03.526
such a special program.  

00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:07.177
So... 
I'd like you and I got a chance 

00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:06.644
to meet a lot

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.750
 of you, and I'm supposed

00:08:10.852 --> 00:08:12.852
 to say 

00:08:13.934 --> 00:08:15.934
here, it says please hold your 
applause until I introduce

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:19.019
 all the schools, but let's see 
how that works. 

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.124
 I do have to ask you, we have 
young people that

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:25.195
 are not here with us in 
Washington, D.C., so... when we

00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:28.308
 get to them, could you give 
them a big

00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:31.397
 hand?  Because... 
from Washington, D.C.,

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.510
 right here, in the Coolidge 

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.616
Auditorium, we have students 
from

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:40.713
 Capitol Hill Montessori

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:43.026
 school.
[applause]

00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:46.953
bishop

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:50.033
 John T.

00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:53.141
 Walker school

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:56.235
 for boys, Plumber

00:08:57.314 --> 00:08:59.314
 Elementary School,

00:09:00.418 --> 00:09:02.418
 Kimball Elementary

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.511
 School,

00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:14.598
 Landon

00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:17.713
 Elementary School, right

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.790
 here in D.C., we have to also 
welcome and we have

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.889
 students from the Langley 
School in

00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:27.005
 McClain, yay!  

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.102
 And... we have students, like I
 told you from across the

00:09:31.193 --> 00:09:33.193
 country who are watching us 
live on

00:09:34.308 --> 00:09:36.441
 Facebook and YouTube.
[applause]

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:39.421
&gt;&gt; So...

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.510
 let's give a big Washington, 
D.C.,

00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:45.655
 McClain, Virginia welcome to 
the

00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:48.768
 Calverton School in 

00:09:49.884 --> 00:09:52.817
Huntington, Maryland.
[cheering and applause]

00:09:49.884 --> 00:09:51.884
&gt;&gt; We love

00:09:52.982 --> 00:09:54.982
 you.  The

00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:58.085
 Tinmouth Elementary School

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 in Tinmouth

00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:04.242
 Vermont and the John Diaw 
school

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:07.356
 in 

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.436
Englishtown, New Jersey.  
Welcome all of you. 

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:15.523
 As you can imagine, it's an 
exciting day at the library of 

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.523
Congress. 

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:16.606
 We have more events in the next
 few days that you might

00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:19.712
 want to think about.  
On 

00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:22.801
Friday, at 10:30, I'm doing a 
special story time

00:10:23.928 --> 00:10:25.928
 with the one and only

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:29.036
 Paddington Bear.  
He'll

00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:32.136
 be here in person or in bear,

00:10:33.246 --> 00:10:37.046
 taking pictures with children 
that will be there and on 

00:10:33.246 --> 00:10:35.246
Wednesday, next Wednesday, at

00:10:36.327 --> 00:10:38.327
 11:00 a.m., we're going to have
 a holiday

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:41.462
 story time in the Great Hall

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:44.583
 and we'll have a menorah and 
we'll

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.660
 have a good time.  We hope 
you'll join us. 

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:50.766
Now... today, wow.  

00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:53.894
 In September, 1936, the

00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:57.002
 Viking Press published the 
story of

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:00.092
 Ferdinand.  Written by Monroe

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.177
 Lief and illustrated by

00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:06.251
 Robert Lawson.  This book 
became so popular that

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.370
 by 1938, it

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.505
 was already in its eleventh 
printing.  Today... as

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:15.618
 I mentioned a little earlier, 
we have the son of

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.720
 Mr. Lief, Andy 

00:11:19.822 --> 00:11:22.422
Lief so let's give him a welcome
 again.

00:11:19.822 --> 00:11:21.822
[cheering and applause] 

00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:31.031
&gt;&gt; And, as I think you

00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:34.151
 know, later this month,

00:11:35.273 --> 00:11:37.273
 20th Century Fox will be 
releasing a

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 feature-length animated film 
based on the

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.468
 book.  And... the person who is
 joining us

00:11:44.597 --> 00:11:46.597
 today, actor and wrestling 

00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:49.694
superstar, Mr. John Cena

00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:52.789
 will be -- 

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.220
[cheering and

00:11:57.303 --> 00:11:59.303
 applause]
 --  

00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:02.383
will be the voice of

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:05.496
 Ferdinand and... today,

00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:08.582
 yes, today,

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.667
 and as soon as I leave and I'm 
sure you're ready,

00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:16.773
 he'll read the book and he's 
going to talk to us a bit and 

00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:14.773
you'll

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.900
 have a chance to ask him

00:12:19.022 --> 00:12:21.022
 questions.  
So... as he reads, you'll see

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:24.124
 the pages of the book, not just
 the pages of any

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.256
 copy of the book, but

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:30.349
 the pages from the original

00:12:31.437 --> 00:12:33.437
 1936 edition, the actual one, 
that

00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.518
 was submitted to the Library of
 Congress

00:12:37.593 --> 00:12:39.593
 to have a copyright.  And

00:12:40.723 --> 00:12:42.723
 it's right here.  You probably 
know the story of

00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:45.828
 Ferdinand has been translated 
into

00:12:46.944 --> 00:12:48.944
 more than 16 languages and it's

00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:52.065
 included in Time Magazine's 100
 best children's

00:12:53.154 --> 00:12:55.154
 books of all 

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.634
time.  
So... it reminds us that the 

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.234
best version

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.313
 of yourself means helping 
others and that's something that

00:13:02.418 --> 00:13:04.418
 our special guest today, Mr. 
John Cena,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.520
 does all the time.  He's 
actually set the

00:13:08.634 --> 00:13:10.634
 record for Make a Wish

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.720
 granting with over 500 

00:13:14.826 --> 00:13:16.826
wishes.  Please join me in

00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:19.944
 welcoming 16-time world 
champion

00:13:21.022 --> 00:13:23.022
 wrestler, five-time U.S. 
champion

00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:26.131
 wrestler, record-setting

00:13:27.263 --> 00:13:29.263
 Make a Wish granter, star of 
blockbuster 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.340
movies, the man you're here to 
see, Mr.

00:13:33.422 --> 00:13:35.688
 John Cena.
[cheering and applause]

00:13:52.335 --> 00:13:54.335
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.  

00:13:58.468 --> 00:14:00.468
 What a, what a special 

00:14:01.586 --> 00:14:03.586
day.  I'm going to put my 1938 
edition

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.695
 Ferdinand next to the first 
print, 1936 edition. 

00:14:07.822 --> 00:14:09.822
 We're going to look at the 1936
 edition, but not touch

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.910
 it.  It's very, very delicate 
and very

00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:18.957
 important and the people from 
the library of Congress were 

00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:16.957
very thorough in saying 

00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:20.073
like, hey... don't touch the 
first book. 

00:14:21.984 --> 00:14:26.117
 So... I'm going to oblige their
 wishes and we're going to do 

00:14:21.984 --> 00:14:23.984
this 

00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:27.072
thing.  I'm very, very excited 
to be here today.  I'd

00:14:28.163 --> 00:14:30.163
 like to first thank the 

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.271
Lief family for allowing me to

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:38.025
 do something like this.  
Without the creation of this 

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:36.359
story,

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.444
 I wouldn't be here reading to 
you today.  It's a great

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.546
 honor, I'm grateful to be

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.650
 chosen for the movie that's 
coming out. 

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.196
 But it starts with a famous 
story.  

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.730
This story

00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.854
 has an important and powerful 
message, the book has been in

00:14:52.964 --> 00:14:54.964
 publication over 80 years now, 
that means

00:14:56.052 --> 00:14:58.052
 this book is twice as old

00:14:59.163 --> 00:15:01.163
 as I 

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.260
am.
[laughter]

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
&gt;&gt; But I think the reason that 
the

00:15:05.348 --> 00:15:07.348
 message continually gets

00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:10.424
 sent and absorbed year after 
year is because it's easy

00:15:11.503 --> 00:15:13.503
 to digest.  Ferdinand is such a
 large bull,

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.595
 people think he's one thing, 
but the advent

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:20.299
 of him loving flowers humanizes
 him.  

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:19.699
You realize

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:22.821
 that what you see isn't always 
what you get.  It's an

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.920
 important story and certainly a
 story close to my heart

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.010
 as the life that you see that I
 live on

00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:33.119
 WWE television mirrors kind of 
the story of 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.440
Ferdinand.  I go through a lot 
of pressure every day to change 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.240
who I am and

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:39.325
 there's a lot of folks using 
some negative influence out

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.430
 there to try to make me change 
my 

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:45.505
values.  But... it just makes me
 stand up and be proud of who

00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:48.581
 I am and be proud of those 
values and not change to try

00:15:49.693 --> 00:15:51.693
 to please someone else, just be
 proud of who I am.  So...

00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:56.944
 with that said... we have an 
excellent story today, I'm going

00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:54.811
 to

00:15:55.963 --> 00:15:57.963
 read and they said I was going 
to talk after I

00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:01.085
 read, but I already switched it
 up, I already talked,

00:16:03.821 --> 00:16:07.554
 because I want you to have as 
much time as you can for 

00:16:03.821 --> 00:16:05.821
questions afterwards.  I look 
forward to

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.934
 hearing from you after we hear 
from this.  Shall we?  

00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:16.037
 The story of Ferdinand.  

00:16:21.227 --> 00:16:24.560
 my loan agreement from the 
Library of Congress.  

00:16:21.227 --> 00:16:23.227
Promise to return

00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:26.344
 this book, the penalty is quite
 heavy.  

00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:29.422
Once upon a time in  

00:16:34.448 --> 00:16:36.448
Spain there was a little bull 
and his name was

00:16:37.554 --> 00:16:39.554
 Ferdinand.  All the other

00:16:40.637 --> 00:16:42.637
 little bulls he lived with

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:45.752
 run, jumped and

00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:48.871
 butt their heads together, but 
not 

00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.988
Ferdinand.  He liked to sit 
quietly and smell the flowers.  

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.140
Hada favorite spot out in the 
past your

00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:01.246
 under a cork

00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:04.352
 tree.  It was his favorite

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.458
 tree and he'd sit in the shade 
all day 

00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:10.562
and... 
smell the flowers. 

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:13.665
 Sometimes his 

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:16.778
mother, who was a cow, would 
worry about him. 

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.875
 She was afraid he'd be lone 
some and

00:17:20.966 --> 00:17:22.966
 all by himself.  Why don't

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.089
 you run and play with the other
 little 

00:17:27.177 --> 00:17:29.177
bulls?  Skip and butt your head,
 she would say?  

00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:32.256
 Ferdinand

00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:35.355
 would shake his head.  I like 
it better here where I can

00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.469
 sit quietly and smell the 
flowers.  

00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:47.672
 he wasn't

00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:50.785
 lonesome and though she was a

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:53.894
 cow, she let him sit there and 
be 

00:17:54.972 --> 00:17:56.972
happy.  As the years went

00:17:58.053 --> 00:18:00.053
 by, Ferdinand grew and

00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.141
 grew until he was very big and 
very strong.  

00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:09.328
 other bulls who had grown up 
with him in the same pasture

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.416
 would fight each other all 

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:17.785
day.  They would butt each other
 and stick each other with their

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:15.519
 horns.  What

00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:18.624
 they wanted most of all was to 
be picked

00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:21.746
 to fight in the bull fights in 
Madrid.  

00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:24.853
 But not

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:27.973
 Ferdinand.  He still liked

00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:31.071
 to just sit quietly under the

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.150
 cork tree and smell the 
flowers.  One 

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:37.229
day, five men came in very funny
 hats, to pick

00:18:38.312 --> 00:18:40.312
 the biggest, fastest, roughest 

00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:43.397
bull, to fight in the bull 
fights in Madrid.  

00:18:44.484 --> 00:18:46.484
 All

00:18:47.597 --> 00:18:51.463
 the other bulls ran around 
snorting and butting, leaping 

00:18:47.597 --> 00:18:49.597
and

00:18:50.687 --> 00:18:52.687
 jumping so the men would think 
they were 

00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:55.829
very, very strong and fierce.   
And pick them.  

00:18:59.968 --> 00:19:01.968
 Ferdinand knew they wouldn't

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:05.049
 pick him and he didn't care.  
So, he went to his

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:08.166
 favorite cork tree to sit down.

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:11.289
He didn't look where he was 
sitting and instead of

00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:14.411
 sitting in a the nice cool 
grass in

00:19:15.539 --> 00:19:17.539
 the shade, he sat on

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.625
 a bumblebee. 

00:19:21.711 --> 00:19:23.711
and a bull sat

00:19:24.804 --> 00:19:26.804
 on you, what would you do?   
You

00:19:27.883 --> 00:19:29.883
 would sting him and that's 
exactly what this

00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:32.989
 bee did to Ferdinand.  

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.110
 Wow!  Did it hurt. 

00:19:37.198 --> 00:19:39.198
 Ferdinand jumped up with a 
snort, he ran

00:19:40.293 --> 00:19:42.293
 around puffing and snorting, 
butting and pawing the ground

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.398
 as if he was crazy.  

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.486
 The five men saw him and they 
all

00:19:49.569 --> 00:19:51.569
 shouted with joy!  
Here was the largest, and

00:19:52.683 --> 00:19:54.683
 fiercest bull of all!  Just the
 one

00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:57.771
 bull for the fights in Madrid. 

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.860
 They took him away

00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:06.994
 for the bull fight day

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.100
 in a car.  
And what a day it was.  Flags

00:20:11.187 --> 00:20:13.187
 were flying, bands

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.290
 were playing.
All the

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:19.456
 ladies had flowers in their 
hair.  They had

00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:22.581
 a parade into the bull ring.  

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:29.319
 First came the

00:20:34.474 --> 00:20:36.474
banderilleros who had would 
stick him and

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.590
 make him mad.  
Then came the

00:20:40.701 --> 00:20:42.701
 picadores with

00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:45.786
 long spears to stick the bull 
to make him

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:48.869
 madder.  Then came the

00:20:49.981 --> 00:20:51.981
 Matador, the

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:55.056
 proudest of all.  
He was very handsome

00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:58.175
 and bowed to the ladies.  He 
had a red cape

00:20:59.255 --> 00:21:01.255
 and a sword and was supposed to
 stick the 

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:04.346
bull, last of

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:07.467
 all.  Then came the bull, you 
know who that

00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:10.564
 was, don't you? 

00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:16.797
 Ferdinand the Fierce and all 
the

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:22.879
 banderilleros were scared of 
him.  He ran into the

00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:28.306
 middle of the ring and everyone
 shouted and clapped.  They 

00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:26.306
thought he

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:32.550
 was going to fight fiercely and
 buck and snort and stick his 

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:30.417
horns around.  

00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.501
 Not Ferdinand.  
When he got to the middle

00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:39.592
 of the ring, he saw the flowers
 and all the lovely

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.699
 ladies hair.  He just sat down 
and quietly smelled.  

00:21:49.914 --> 00:21:51.914
fierce, no matter what they did.
  He

00:21:53.016 --> 00:21:55.016
 just sat and smelled.  The

00:21:59.203 --> 00:22:01.203
banderilleros were made and the 

00:22:02.303 --> 00:22:04.303
picaderos were madder and

00:22:05.397 --> 00:22:07.397
 the Matador was fierce and 
cried because he couldn't

00:22:08.476 --> 00:22:10.476
 show off his cape and sword.  
So, they had to

00:22:11.587 --> 00:22:13.587
 take Ferdinand home.  And for

00:22:14.696 --> 00:22:16.696
 all I know, he's sitting there

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.795
 still, under his favorite cork 
tree,

00:22:20.869 --> 00:22:22.869
 smelling the flowers just 

00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:25.963
quietly.  And he is very happy. 

00:22:27.077 --> 00:22:29.077
The end.  

00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:53.368
&gt;&gt; What a cool story?  And what

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.470
 an important message?  Being 
different's okay.  We're not

00:22:58.422 --> 00:23:02.155
 all alike and we should be 
proud that even if you look 

00:22:58.422 --> 00:23:00.422
around in this audience,

00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:03.511
 we're all different.  We should
 be okay being

00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:08.222
 different.  Because... 
even if you're different like 

00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:06.622
Ferdinand and

00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:09.752
 you like to smell the 

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:14.822
flowers, as long as you're 
happy, that's cool.   Thank you,

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.889
 guys

00:23:14.006 --> 00:23:16.006
 for listening to a wonderful 
story and if you guys have any

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.110
 questions for me, now's the 
time.  So... fire away.  

00:23:23.192 --> 00:23:25.192
 excellent.  

00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:33.871
 going to do the questions, I 
have four colleagues that are 

00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:31.871
stationed

00:23:33.931 --> 00:23:35.931
 right over here is Abby, over 
here is Katherine, over

00:23:37.008 --> 00:23:39.008
 here is Sasha and I've guilt a 
might. 

00:23:43.103 --> 00:23:45.103
  -- got a mic. 

00:23:46.213 --> 00:23:48.213
 make a big circle, 

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.329
okay?  How about you?  I'm not 
going to hand you the mic,

00:23:52.417 --> 00:23:54.417
 I'm going to hold it.  Speak 
really clearly and the deal here

00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:57.522
 is, we're asking questions.   
Okay...

00:23:58.605 --> 00:24:00.605
 so you can't just say "oh I 
love you." 

00:24:01.722 --> 00:24:03.722
 You can't do that, okay? 
It's gotta

00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:06.825
 be questions, all right? 
&gt;&gt; Here we

00:24:07.912 --> 00:24:09.912
 go 
&gt;&gt; My name is Adrienne

00:24:10.996 --> 00:24:12.996
 and can you tell me how you

00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:16.114
 and Ferdinand connect? 
&gt;&gt; Yeah... that's a good

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:19.222
 question.  How do Ferdinand and
 I 

00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:23.770
connect?  Ferdinand is 
misunderstood.  People think 

00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:22.304
because he

00:24:23.407 --> 00:24:25.407
 looks some way that he should 
be something.  And a lot of 

00:24:26.499 --> 00:24:28.499
times, in WWE, I'm very 

00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:33.736
misunderstood.  There's a lot of
 people out there chanting at 

00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:31.603
the top of their

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:34.707
 lungs for me to do something 
that I really don't want to

00:24:36.507 --> 00:24:38.507
 do, but just like Ferdinand, I 
make sure I stand proud of what

00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:41.783
 I believe in and I'm happy.  

00:24:45.949 --> 00:24:47.949
 When you were a boy

00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:51.069
, did you want to

00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:54.186
 be a wrestler 
&gt;&gt; Say it again

00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:57.275
you want to be a

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:00.359
 wrestler or do what Ferdinand

00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:03.638
 did 
&gt;&gt; When I was first born, I 

00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:03.438
opened my

00:25:04.568 --> 00:25:06.568
 eyes and I was like "what's 
going on?  Wow!  This

00:25:07.657 --> 00:25:09.657
 place is weird, I

00:25:10.768 --> 00:25:12.768
 can't hold

00:25:13.848 --> 00:25:15.848
 my head up."  I'm

00:25:16.951 --> 00:25:18.951
 kidding.  As a young person, I 
was very attracted and taken

00:25:20.055 --> 00:25:22.055
 aback by WWE.  I have an 
imagination, like

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:25.147
 all of you guys and these WWE 
wrestlers really spoke

00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:28.276
 to my imagination.  They were 
larger than life and doing

00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:31.396
 these amazing things and I said
 to myself, as a

00:25:32.501 --> 00:25:34.501
 young person, one day, I'd 
really like to be

00:25:35.593 --> 00:25:37.593
 a world champion and here I am,
 a 

00:25:38.687 --> 00:25:40.687
16-time world

00:25:41.785 --> 00:25:43.785
 champion.  That doesn't mean 
I've

00:25:44.868 --> 00:25:47.401
 lost it 16 times, but I've done
 okay 

00:25:44.868 --> 00:25:46.868
&gt;&gt; What

00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:50.209
 inspired you to be in this 
book? 

00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:49.943
&gt;&gt; Well...

00:25:51.042 --> 00:25:53.042
 the story is very special

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.152
 and... it's been in publication
 for over 80

00:25:57.268 --> 00:25:59.268
 years.  
And I think when you read it,

00:26:00.357 --> 00:26:02.357
 just like we all listened, even
 though sometimes the words

00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:05.471
 can get old, it never gets 
misunderstood.  I think 

00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:10.583
the message is really cool.  I 
was very happy to partner up 

00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:08.583
with

00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:13.533
 the folks making the movie.  
The animators that made the 

00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:11.667
movie

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.780
 are very gifted and once you 
guys see the movie, I think

00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:17.885
 you'll all agree, it was a 
great thing to be part

00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:22.231
 of.  I think you guys are all 
going to enjoy it 

00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:20.965
&gt;&gt;

00:26:22.043 --> 00:26:24.043
 Before we go to my friend over 

00:26:25.138 --> 00:26:27.138
here, I have a question from one
 of the kids in the school

00:26:28.243 --> 00:26:30.243
 watching over live stream 
&gt;&gt; Thank you, guys, on the

00:26:31.353 --> 00:26:33.219
 internet, thanks.
[laughter]

00:26:31.353 --> 00:26:33.353
 &gt;&gt; The name of the student is

00:26:34.442 --> 00:26:36.442
 Trevor.  He's in fourth grade 
at the

00:26:37.556 --> 00:26:39.556
 Calverton School in

00:26:40.673 --> 00:26:42.673
 Huntington, Maryland.  His 
question

00:26:43.774 --> 00:26:45.774
 is, dear John Cena, do you love

00:26:46.864 --> 00:26:50.530
 what you do or do you ever wish
 to do something else? 

00:26:46.864 --> 00:26:48.864
&gt;&gt; This

00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:54.042
 is an important message from 
Ferdinand and if I could leave 

00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:51.976
you

00:26:53.058 --> 00:26:55.058
 with one bit of information.  I
 know we'll talk a lot today

00:26:56.172 --> 00:26:58.172
 so sometimes your attention 
span will go away, you may

00:26:59.253 --> 00:27:03.453
 want to look at your phone or 
something, take this with you, I

00:26:59.253 --> 00:27:01.253
 promise

00:27:02.336 --> 00:27:04.336
 you, you have a long road 
ahead.  Make sure

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.440
 you do what you love.  

00:27:08.574 --> 00:27:10.574
 Because... 
you asked if I would want to do

00:27:11.683 --> 00:27:13.683
 anything else?  No, I want to 
be right here, right now, with

00:27:14.775 --> 00:27:16.775
 all of you, reading a wonderful

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.860
story, preparing to release a 
wonderful movie to the world and

00:27:20.966 --> 00:27:22.966
 then, hopefully, if I get what 
I want for Christmas, go back

00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:26.056
 to my WWE family and do what

00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:29.163
 I love.  So... it's, it's

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:32.282
 okay, through life you'll have 
pressures around you of

00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:37.508
 people trying to make you do 
certain things.  If you do what 

00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:35.375
you

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.460
 love, you never call it work.  
Because... right now,

00:27:39.544 --> 00:27:42.077
 we're having fun and it ain't 
work.  

00:27:39.544 --> 00:27:41.544
I'm doing exactly what

00:27:42.674 --> 00:27:45.340
 I'd like to do.  It's a great 
question 

00:27:42.674 --> 00:27:44.674
&gt;&gt;

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:47.769
 My name is Michael and

00:27:48.888 --> 00:27:51.688
 I wonder, do you like being in 
the ring? 

00:27:48.888 --> 00:27:50.888
&gt;&gt;

00:27:51.979 --> 00:27:53.979
 Do I like being in the

00:27:55.061 --> 00:27:56.061
 ring? 
&gt;&gt; Yes 

00:27:55.061 --> 00:27:57.061
&gt;&gt; When I'm doing 

00:27:58.153 --> 00:27:59.153
well.
[laughter]

00:27:58.153 --> 00:28:00.153
&gt;&gt; It's all so exciting that the
 crowd noise is

00:28:01.256 --> 00:28:05.389
 fantastic and the lights are 
amazing and the fans are great, 

00:28:01.256 --> 00:28:03.256
but

00:28:04.407 --> 00:28:06.407
 there are those times when you 
let's say, finish second

00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:09.511
 place.  And those are, those 
are tough times, but... it

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.588
 keeps you wanting to get better
 and come back for more.  

00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:21.816
 Jay and one question,

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.951
 actually two questions 
&gt;&gt;

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:31.067
 Excellent 
&gt;&gt; What's your

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.160
 favorite book as a kid? 
&gt;&gt; My

00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:37.245
 favorite book was called Cars 
and Trucks

00:28:38.344 --> 00:28:40.344
 and Things that Go. 

00:28:41.423 --> 00:28:43.423
 I'll give you a spoiler alert 
why,

00:28:44.538 --> 00:28:46.538
 because I love cars and trucks 
and

00:28:47.648 --> 00:28:49.648
 things that go.
[laughter]

00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:52.721
&gt;&gt; 

00:28:53.835 --> 00:28:55.835
Okay, second part? 
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite thing

00:28:56.954 --> 00:28:58.954
 to do on Smackdown

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:02.642
 Live? 
&gt;&gt; Oh... I think the easiest way

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:02.042
 to put that

00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:05.145
 is be a part of Smackdown 

00:29:06.223 --> 00:29:08.223
Live.  Because folks like you 
are entertained by 

00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:11.607
it, thank you, two good 
questions 

00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:11.341
&gt;&gt; Is it hard being a

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:14.418
 wrestler and being an actor at 
the same time?  

00:29:18.638 --> 00:29:20.638
No.  Because you just get to be 
imaginative.  You get to create

00:29:21.715 --> 00:29:23.715
 and you get to have fun and 
it's tough,

00:29:24.828 --> 00:29:26.828
 it's a lot of hard work, but 
it's fun

00:29:27.928 --> 00:29:29.928
 to do both.  Good question.   
&gt;&gt;

00:29:31.024 --> 00:29:33.024
 My name is Ima.  I

00:29:34.154 --> 00:29:36.154
 want to know, when

00:29:37.228 --> 00:29:39.228
 you

00:29:43.338 --> 00:29:45.338
 started your career?  When did 
you start your

00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:49.049
 career? 
&gt;&gt; When did I start?  Well... 

00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:48.449
I'll answer that question,

00:29:49.577 --> 00:29:51.577
 with a question.  How old are

00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:53.679
 you? 
&gt;&gt; Nine 

00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:54.679
&gt;&gt;

00:29:55.766 --> 00:29:57.766
 Nine.  It might have been

00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:01.091
 well before you were born, 
so...

00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:00.891
it's been

00:30:02.014 --> 00:30:04.014
 awhile.  Uh... I started my 
career in 2002

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.110
 on television, 

00:30:08.195 --> 00:30:10.195
so... it's been about 15 years. 

00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:16.285
 I see a lot of

00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:19.368
 hands, this is great 
&gt;&gt; We have a question, also,

00:30:20.497 --> 00:30:22.497
 from our friends who are 
watching remotely and this one's

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.580
 from a fourth

00:30:26.677 --> 00:30:28.677
 grader.  Did you listen

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:31.788
 to the story as a child and did
 you relate to it 

00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:35.465
then? 
&gt;&gt; Well... as a child, I knew of

00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:34.932
 the story,

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:38.068
 growing up, I knew of the 
story, amazingly 

00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:41.171
enough, the first time I read 
the book from cover to cover

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:44.274
 was for this.  And it was 
because I wanted to make sure

00:30:45.353 --> 00:30:47.353
 it was really important to send
 the message of Ferdinand. 

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:50.572
 So... 
like you guys, I'm being 

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:50.439
introduced to

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:53.559
 such a famous book and I can 
see now why it's been

00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:56.639
 around for so long and touched 
so many generations.  

00:31:00.737 --> 00:31:02.737
people like

00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:06.331
 Peyton Manning? 
&gt;&gt; Well...

00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:09.415
 I was very thankful that I 
didn't

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.530
 have to play football against 
Peyton Manning, but yes,

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.650
 he was funny and goofy and I 
thought he did an excellent

00:31:16.737 --> 00:31:18.737
 job in the movie.  

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.930
 name is Xavier, were you ever 
scared when you first

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:28.017
 got in the ring? 
&gt;&gt; Ooh!  Was I ever scared when

00:31:29.102 --> 00:31:33.035
 I first got in the ring?  I'm 
scared all the time.  I was 

00:31:29.102 --> 00:31:31.102
scared

00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:36.447
 behind the door to come out and
 talk to you guys, but it's your

00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:34.181
 ability

00:31:35.295 --> 00:31:39.428
 to understand that you're doing
 something awesome and you're 

00:31:35.295 --> 00:31:37.295
going

00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:40.397
 to be nervous and you're going 
to 

00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:43.483
doubt yourself at times, just 
like when I'm in the ring, but

00:31:44.584 --> 00:31:46.584
 that's kind of what life is 
about.  It's kind of

00:31:47.673 --> 00:31:49.673
 overcoming your fears and being
 able to take

00:31:50.782 --> 00:31:52.782
 chances to do some cool stuff. 
 Yes... I was 

00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:56.364
nervous.  
I'm always nervous.  But I 

00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:55.898
always do my best to

00:31:57.021 --> 00:31:59.021
 go out there anyway.   
&gt;&gt; What

00:32:00.117 --> 00:32:02.583
 was your favorite sport before 
WWE? 

00:32:00.117 --> 00:32:02.117
&gt;&gt;

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 What is my --
&gt;&gt; Favorite sport before

00:32:06.307 --> 00:32:08.307
 the WWE? 
&gt;&gt; Say it again, I'm

00:32:09.403 --> 00:32:12.003
 sorry 
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite sport 

00:32:09.403 --> 00:32:11.403
before

00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:14.847
 WWE? 
&gt;&gt; I played football in high 

00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:14.514
school,

00:32:15.647 --> 00:32:17.647
 I played football in college.  
I'll have to say football.  

00:32:21.842 --> 00:32:23.842
 is Cassandra and

00:32:24.953 --> 00:32:26.953
 I'm in first

00:32:31.085 --> 00:32:33.085
 grade 
&gt;&gt; Say that again.  

00:32:40.327 --> 00:32:42.327
 is Cassandra and I'm in

00:32:43.416 --> 00:32:45.416
 first grade.  Ferdinand likes 
to look at flowers, what do you

00:32:46.498 --> 00:32:49.498
 like to do? 
&gt;&gt; Ferdinand likes flowers, what

00:32:46.498 --> 00:32:48.498
 do

00:32:49.579 --> 00:32:51.579
 I like to do?  I also

00:32:52.676 --> 00:32:54.676
 like flowers, my favorite flour

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:57.759
 -- flower

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.870
 is the rose, and little known 
fact about me. 

00:33:01.992 --> 00:33:03.992
 like to

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.116
 sit, and relax and just like 

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:10.735
Ferdinand, sit and smell the 
flowers 

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:10.269
&gt;&gt; We have another

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.056
 question from somebody watching
 live.  

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.390
This time,

00:33:14.482 --> 00:33:16.482
 they're asking a question

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:19.562
 via Twitter. 

00:33:20.678 --> 00:33:24.544
 If you were to do another 
animated movie, what character 

00:33:20.678 --> 00:33:22.678
would you

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:25.759
 like to voice? 
&gt;&gt; The

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.840
 animated UN

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.950
 -- universe is

00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:36.999
 great, you can start with 
nothing and build a short story 

00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:35.066
about

00:33:36.178 --> 00:33:38.178
 it.  So I guess it depends on 
the powerful subject

00:33:39.298 --> 00:33:41.298
 matter. 
This was easy.  They asked me if

00:33:42.415 --> 00:33:44.415
 I wanted to be Ferdinand and I 
was in.  The subject matter is 

00:33:45.548 --> 00:33:47.548
great, I knew the people making 
the movie were great, I

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:52.425
 knew they'd create a wonderful 
universe.  I don't know, 

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.625
hopefully I

00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:53.705
 get to do it again, we'll see 
what happens.  

00:33:57.917 --> 00:33:59.917
 Maximo.  Would you like to

00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:03.044
 continue your wrestling streak 
or just smell the flowers?  

00:34:07.134 --> 00:34:09.134
&gt;&gt; Well...

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.783
 one is a little less 
physically-demanding, so there 

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.250
are

00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:15.328
 times when I'd rather smell the
 flowers, but I do like being

00:34:16.414 --> 00:34:18.414
 able to perform for audiences, 
as you can tell.  I enjoy

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.500
 being here with you guys and 
there's nothing more exciting 

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.500
than being

00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:24.609
 in a WWE ring, so I think I'll 
go with that one.  

00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:30.701
 by the way 
&gt;&gt; My

00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:33.833
 name is Milo. 

00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:38.589
 What is your favorite part in 
the story of Ferdinand? 

00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:36.923
&gt;&gt;

00:34:38.029 --> 00:34:40.029
 Okay... that's a good

00:34:41.103 --> 00:34:43.103
 question.  I was peculiar why 
the five men

00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:47.414
 had funny hats.  
Because... if you look at the 

00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:46.214
picture,

00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:49.331
 they do have really, really 
funny hats.  And... in the 

00:34:50.424 --> 00:34:52.424
story, I think that's a nice 
little detail that the men had

00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:55.509
 funny hats.  But... my favorite
 part is

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.630
 when Ferdinand runs out into 
the middle of the

00:34:59.735 --> 00:35:03.868
 arena and everybody thinks he's
 going to fight really fierce 

00:34:59.735 --> 00:35:01.735
and it's

00:35:02.844 --> 00:35:04.844
 because he sees all the flowers
 and it reminds him of 

00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:07.923
home, he sits down and is just

00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:11.009
 enjoyably happy smelling the 
flowers.  

00:35:15.129 --> 00:35:17.129
about

00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:20.259
 you which is wrong? 
&gt;&gt; Ooh!  Okay.  That's a great

00:35:21.354 --> 00:35:23.354
 question.  What do people often
 think about

00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:27.911
 me which is wrong?  
That, I always kind of like to 

00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:26.445
be

00:35:27.527 --> 00:35:29.527
 what you see on television.  
I

00:35:30.697 --> 00:35:32.697
 truly enjoy my time in the WWE,
 but... I also

00:35:33.797 --> 00:35:35.797
 enjoy a lot of other stuff.  
And... even

00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:38.917
 if some people think it doesn't
 make me

00:35:40.003 --> 00:35:42.003
 look cool or seem tough, it 
doesn't mean that I don't enjoy 

00:35:43.117 --> 00:35:45.117
it.  So I guess people think I'm
 a big tough guy

00:35:46.238 --> 00:35:48.238
 all the time and that's wrong. 

00:35:55.464 --> 00:35:57.464
 to know how you think, how you

00:35:58.566 --> 00:36:00.566
 think you would be the best

00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:03.661
 part as Ferdinand when you two 
or so 

00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:06.564
different? 
&gt;&gt; Say it again 

00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:06.764
&gt;&gt;

00:36:07.894 --> 00:36:09.894
 How would you think you

00:36:10.986 --> 00:36:12.986
 were the best part as Ferdinand
 in the 

00:36:14.093 --> 00:36:16.693
movie? 
&gt;&gt; Okay... so, this is going to 

00:36:14.093 --> 00:36:16.093
sound weird.  I think

00:36:17.201 --> 00:36:19.201
 the best part in Ferdinand the 
movie

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.443
 is played by the calming goats.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.310
Here

00:36:23.399 --> 00:36:25.399
 I am, I'm Ferdinand, this is

00:36:26.507 --> 00:36:28.507
 great, but my favorite 
character in the movie is

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:31.619
 a calming goat named Lupe. 

00:36:32.703 --> 00:36:36.236
 When he shows up, you'll 
understand why.  That's my 

00:36:32.703 --> 00:36:34.703
favorite

00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:37.795
 character 
&gt;&gt; This is the question from

00:36:38.914 --> 00:36:40.914
 Cameron in the fifth grade in 

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:45.532
Huntington.  How would you 
explain why reading is so 

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:43.999
important for

00:36:45.113 --> 00:36:47.713
 children? 
&gt;&gt; Well... what a wonderful 

00:36:45.113 --> 00:36:47.113
building to be in to

00:36:48.198 --> 00:36:50.198
 answer that question. 

00:36:51.319 --> 00:36:53.319
 There is a small

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.430
 hallway with a tile fixture 
that's extremely small above the

00:36:57.508 --> 00:36:59.508
 arches.  In brilliantly laid 
tile

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:02.589
 simply says knowledge is power 
and that couldn't be more

00:37:03.728 --> 00:37:05.728
 correct.  And in a place with 
almost 

00:37:06.812 --> 00:37:10.412
unlimited knowledge, as the 
books keep pouring in and 

00:37:06.812 --> 00:37:08.812
materials

00:37:09.919 --> 00:37:11.919
 keep pouring in, it's certainly
 important to be sharp

00:37:13.011 --> 00:37:15.011
 and be educated, because with 
knowledge comes power. 

00:37:16.136 --> 00:37:18.736
 So... 
that's why reading is important.

00:37:19.254 --> 00:37:21.254
&gt;&gt; My name

00:37:22.363 --> 00:37:24.363
 is Emily and how long

00:37:25.453 --> 00:37:27.453
 have you been

00:37:28.564 --> 00:37:30.564
 auditioning? 
&gt;&gt; Man, it

00:37:31.656 --> 00:37:33.656
 was tough.  They had me talk a 
lot.  No... I'm

00:37:34.741 --> 00:37:36.741
 just kidding. It was very fun 

00:37:37.854 --> 00:37:39.854
because... amazingly enough, the
 people that 

00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:42.971
animate, the people that draw, 
they're like big 

00:37:44.064 --> 00:37:48.064
kids.  They're so fun to be 
around.  They want to make these

00:37:44.064 --> 00:37:46.064
 crazy

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:49.167
 things and these wild and

00:37:50.269 --> 00:37:52.269
 imaginative things happen. 

00:37:53.357 --> 00:37:55.357
 The audition was easy.  I'm 
like a big kid

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.440
 too.  They're like, let's make 
this movie and we did it.  

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:08.501
Ferdinand? 
&gt;&gt; Well... I think Ferdinand's 

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:07.701
really 

00:38:08.807 --> 00:38:10.807
cool.  

00:38:11.902 --> 00:38:13.902
Because, in the book, you can 
see he doesn't want

00:38:15.017 --> 00:38:17.017
 to do what the other bulls do. 
 His mom worries about him

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.100
 a lot.  Once she takes the time
 to talk with Ferdinand,

00:38:21.217 --> 00:38:23.217
 she's like "he's going to be 
okay."  So, I think it's

00:38:24.307 --> 00:38:26.307
 really important that it's, 
even if you do

00:38:27.423 --> 00:38:29.423
 something different, that a ton
 of people don't do,

00:38:30.513 --> 00:38:34.513
 even when they're pressuring 
you to do it, it doesn't mean 

00:38:30.513 --> 00:38:32.513
you

00:38:33.588 --> 00:38:35.588
 can't be happy.
I thought that was a fun

00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:38.719
 and important message to send. 

00:38:42.926 --> 00:38:44.926
 Alex.  Who is your enemy in

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.010
 WWE? 
&gt;&gt; Ooh!  There's

00:38:49.208 --> 00:38:51.208
 an old saying that you are your
 own worst

00:38:52.315 --> 00:38:54.315
 enemy, so it's probably me at 
some times.  You 

00:38:55.395 --> 00:38:57.395
know, I don't really have any 

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:02.435
archenemies, I'd say.  It's 
really just a very competitive 

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.502
environment

00:39:01.622 --> 00:39:03.622
 where we all want to be 
champion, 

00:39:04.711 --> 00:39:08.511
so... I guess with me giving you
 that answer, whoever is 

00:39:04.711 --> 00:39:06.711
champion.  

00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:12.823
my name is 

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:15.936
Jayden, who is your favorite 
wrestler in the 

00:39:17.024 --> 00:39:19.024
WWE? 
&gt;&gt; Whoo!  My favorite

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:24.307
 wrestler of all time?  That's a
 good question.  I know when I 

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:22.107
was

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:25.227
 your age, I really liked

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:28.334
 Hulk Hogan.  I thought he was 
larger

00:39:29.428 --> 00:39:31.428
 than life and a super hero, 
nowadays, this is going to

00:39:33.395 --> 00:39:35.395
 sound weird.  I'd say my 
favorite of all time is the tie

00:39:36.523 --> 00:39:38.523
 between two people.  One, Vince

00:39:39.618 --> 00:39:43.751
 McMahon, because I think he's 
one of the greatest performers 

00:39:39.618 --> 00:39:41.618
ever in

00:39:42.699 --> 00:39:44.699
 WWE, two and I'd say a tie, I'd
 say

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:47.789
 a tie is The

00:39:48.923 --> 00:39:50.856
 Rock.
[cheering and applause]

00:39:52.054 --> 00:39:54.054
He's just got an

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.150
 electricity like no other. 

00:39:58.235 --> 00:40:00.235
 And the eyebrow

00:40:04.342 --> 00:40:06.342
 thing 
&gt;&gt; My name is

00:40:07.454 --> 00:40:09.454
 Naomi.  I wanted to ask, do you
 do

00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:12.581
 your own stunts? 
&gt;&gt; Actually, it's

00:40:13.692 --> 00:40:15.692
 a very elaborate process.  When
 we film a 

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.415
WWE event.  I do all the talkie 
talkie and when we have

00:40:20.497 --> 00:40:22.497
 a chance to do action, we stop 
and

00:40:23.583 --> 00:40:25.583
 a guy who looks like me comes 
in and we

00:40:26.678 --> 00:40:28.678
 do all my own stunts.  
It'd be easier if

00:40:29.787 --> 00:40:31.787
 -- yes, I do my own stunts.  I 
knew that wasn't

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.860
 going to hold up for more than 
two seconds

00:40:35.952 --> 00:40:37.952
Summer.  What

00:40:39.058 --> 00:40:42.058
 do you imagine yourself doing 
in ten years? 

00:40:39.058 --> 00:40:41.058
&gt;&gt; I just

00:40:42.144 --> 00:40:44.144
 hope that I can continue to, to
 tell

00:40:45.271 --> 00:40:47.271
 stories and actually call it 
work.  This is

00:40:48.387 --> 00:40:50.387
 the greatest thing to be able 
to do, to

00:40:51.477 --> 00:40:53.477
 be able to work hard, but at 
the end of the day, do something

00:40:54.592 --> 00:40:56.592
 you love.  So... if ten years 
from now I can continue to

00:40:57.725 --> 00:40:59.725
 keep doing this, it's

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.840
 going to be

00:41:06.976 --> 00:41:08.976
 great 
&gt;&gt; My name is

00:41:10.053 --> 00:41:12.053
 Charlotte, my brother loves 
your story

00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:21.251
 Thank you.  It

00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:26.167
 was about time we had a 
statement instead of a question.

00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:24.367
That

00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:27.481
 was a very good one 
&gt;&gt; My name is

00:41:28.564 --> 00:41:30.564
 Devon and why did you quit WWE?

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.658
 Why did you quit 

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:40.097
WWE? 
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.  I 

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:39.764
don't know why anybody would

00:41:40.895 --> 00:41:42.895
 quit WWE.  I'm... I mean, I'm 
going to give

00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:47.104
 you a spoiler alert.  I'm still
 there.  So... 

00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:45.971
here's

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:49.079
 the thing, here's the low down,
 very interesting 

00:41:50.173 --> 00:41:52.173
question, because I'm not there 
right now, so... what happens

00:41:53.292 --> 00:41:55.292
 is, I got this full-time job 
with 

00:41:56.362 --> 00:41:58.695
WWE.  
And then the phone rings and 

00:41:56.362 --> 00:41:58.362
somebody's like, hey 

00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:01.484
man, you want another job.  I 
say "yeah, but

00:42:02.564 --> 00:42:04.564
 I can't let this one go" and 
they're like "take

00:42:06.373 --> 00:42:08.373
 a break and come back."  I'm 
like

00:42:09.484 --> 00:42:12.350
 "really?" 
Yeah!  Cool!  I'm doing two jobs

00:42:09.484 --> 00:42:11.484
 at once.  

00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:23.673
 is Shawn.  I was thinking, when
 you were a kid -- 

00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.801
 did you ever think you were 
going to make it into the 

00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:33.123
WWE? 
&gt;&gt; Not for a second.  I was 

00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:32.923
like, 

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
man, there's no way I could ever
 do that, but that was

00:42:37.091 --> 00:42:39.091
 when I was a little kid.  I 
always kept

00:42:40.184 --> 00:42:42.184
 it in my mind, if I worked 
hard, maybe I'd

00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:45.281
 have a chance.  When a got a 
chance, I wasn't a

00:42:46.381 --> 00:42:48.381
 superstar overnight.  
It was a lot of -- I swung and

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:51.463
 missed a lot, but through hard 
work and not giving

00:42:52.575 --> 00:42:54.575
 up, I eventually took a very 
long time when I eventually

00:42:55.672 --> 00:42:59.738
 became a WWE superstar.  As a 
young kid, I didn't think I'd 

00:42:55.672 --> 00:42:57.672
make it.  

00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:03.763
question. 

00:43:04.845 --> 00:43:06.845
 How do you make a connection 
with 

00:43:07.951 --> 00:43:10.684
Ferdinand? 
&gt;&gt; How do I make a connection 

00:43:07.951 --> 00:43:09.951
with Ferdinand? 
&gt;&gt;

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.088
 Here's the cool thing

00:43:14.201 --> 00:43:16.201
 about Ferdinand.  I think 
everybody in this room can make

00:43:17.312 --> 00:43:19.312
 a connection with Ferdinand.  
We all interact with a bunch of

00:43:20.868 --> 00:43:22.868
 people every day if you look 
around.  We

00:43:24.058 --> 00:43:26.058
 all look around in the room and
 everybody's different.  At one

00:43:27.177 --> 00:43:29.177
 point or another, probably 
everybody in this room

00:43:30.893 --> 00:43:32.893
 has been misunderstood and if 
you've been

00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:36.031
 misunderstood for even one 
second, whether

00:43:37.143 --> 00:43:39.143
 you know it or not, you have a 
connection with Ferdinand.  

00:43:43.302 --> 00:43:45.302
Devon, a fifth grader.  What 
children's book did you

00:43:46.407 --> 00:43:48.407
 enjoy as a child that touched 
your heart like

00:43:49.524 --> 00:43:51.524
 Ferdinand? 
&gt;&gt; Well... we've

00:43:52.617 --> 00:43:54.617
 talked about mechanical 
obsession that

00:43:55.705 --> 00:43:57.705
 I had, I'll even say again that
 I, aside

00:43:58.818 --> 00:44:00.818
 from cars and trucks and things
 that go, I

00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:03.938
 gravitated towards a lot of the
 works of Dr. Seuss.  I thought

00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:07.045
 Dr. Seuss was a

00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:10.156
 wonderful way of telling 
stories and

00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:13.274
 his world were so bizarre and 
imaginative, as

00:44:14.372 --> 00:44:16.505
 a kid, I gravitated towards Dr.

00:44:14.372 --> 00:44:16.372
Seuss

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:20.089
 as well 
&gt;&gt; My name is Delaney, do you 

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:19.489
know why

00:44:20.581 --> 00:44:22.581
 they decided to film Ferdinand 
this year?  

00:44:26.754 --> 00:44:28.754
 to make Ferdinand this year? 

00:44:29.898 --> 00:44:31.898
 Well... 
believe it or not, the guy who

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:34.999
 directed Ferdinand, the studio 
that made Ferdinand

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.110
 started on this movie in 2010, 
seven years ago, so...

00:44:39.203 --> 00:44:41.203
 it took seven years to make the
 movie and

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.330
 why they waited until

00:44:45.414 --> 00:44:47.414
 2010, I have no idea.  This is

00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:50.525
 also a fact about the movie. It
 was an animated movie

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.610
 way back in the day, it was 
about six minutes long

00:44:54.703 --> 00:44:56.703
 and very well-received. It won 
a

00:44:57.786 --> 00:44:59.786
 bunch of awards.  I think maybe
 because it was a

00:45:00.895 --> 00:45:02.895
 shorter animated movie, is why 
they

00:45:04.009 --> 00:45:06.009
 waited so long to make it an

00:45:07.136 --> 00:45:09.136
 animated movie 
&gt;&gt; My name is Naomi,

00:45:10.216 --> 00:45:12.216
 I want to know, do you think 
you'll

00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:15.338
 carry a legacy?  

00:45:19.536 --> 00:45:21.536
 I think I'll carry a legacy?  
That's for

00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:24.651
 you guys to decide.  Whether I 
do or not, I'm having a fun time

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.789
 and doing what I enjoy and 
that's most important.  

00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:33.971
 Komani.  What's the

00:45:35.088 --> 00:45:37.821
 hardest challenge or struggle 
you face? 

00:45:35.088 --> 00:45:37.088
&gt;&gt; Not enough

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:41.597
 hours in the day. 
I want to do all this cool stuff

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:40.197
 and then the

00:45:41.308 --> 00:45:44.441
 day just runs out. 
So... maybe if there was a 

00:45:41.308 --> 00:45:43.308
little

00:45:44.424 --> 00:45:46.424
 more time in the day.  I could 
be

00:45:47.525 --> 00:45:49.525
 able to do more fun stuff.  
But... for the most 

00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:52.641
part, it's all pretty cool.  
Just not enough time.  

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.887
 Hi... my name is 

00:45:59.979 --> 00:46:01.979
Tyrese.  
Where do

00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:05.109
 you practice at for WWE? 
&gt;&gt; I practice

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.062
 at my trash talk.
[laughter]

00:46:09.276 --> 00:46:11.276
&gt;&gt; Keep that real sharp in case 
somebody

00:46:12.386 --> 00:46:14.386
 trash talks against you.  
Practice on my 

00:46:15.528 --> 00:46:17.528
fitness.  
Make sure I'm real 

00:46:18.637 --> 00:46:21.370
strong.  
Sometimes you have to be strong 

00:46:18.637 --> 00:46:20.637
and one more thing.  This is 
something

00:46:21.731 --> 00:46:23.731
 I practice on and you guys can 
watch WWE

00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:26.838
 and know that I'm not kidding. 
 I practice

00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:29.961
 on my tolerance. 

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:34.854
 Because the audience is 
everybody from around the world.

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:33.054
  There are some

00:46:34.152 --> 00:46:37.885
 groups of the audience that 
like me and there are some 

00:46:34.152 --> 00:46:36.152
groups

00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:39.259
 of the audience that don't like
 me.  When those groups

00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:42.352
 that don't like me yell really 
loud that I'm not any 

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:45.434
good, I don't turn around and 
say "you can't say 

00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:50.745
that" because they can say that.
  So... it's actually, believe 

00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:48.545
it or not, my

00:46:49.629 --> 00:46:51.629
 time in the WWE has made

00:46:52.717 --> 00:46:56.650
 me have a greater appreciation 
for all of you out there.  

00:46:52.717 --> 00:46:54.717
That's

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.840
 the thing I practice the most 
is tolerance.  

00:46:58.953 --> 00:47:00.953
fourth 

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.080
grader.  How did you come up 
with the phrase "you

00:47:05.204 --> 00:47:07.204
 can't see me?" 
&gt;&gt; Ooh!  How did

00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:10.281
 I come up with the phrase "you 
can't see 

00:47:11.399 --> 00:47:13.399
me"?  
I can't take credit for it.  My

00:47:14.505 --> 00:47:16.505
 youngest brother Shawn who 
doesn't go by

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.601
 the name Shawn.  
He goes by Boog.  He dared

00:47:20.683 --> 00:47:22.683
 me to do it on television.  The
 very first time I

00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:25.761
 played my theme song, he heard 
it and was like 

00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:28.861
"that's awesome."  He started 
dancing, doing something

00:47:29.987 --> 00:47:31.987
 like this.  I was like "you

00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:35.101
 look ridiculous" and he said 

00:47:36.225 --> 00:47:38.225
"ridiculous enough for you to do
 it on

00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:41.311
 TV?"  I was 

00:47:42.411 --> 00:47:44.411
like... of course.  Back then, I
 thought nobody was

00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:47.521
 paying attention.  
I've got a

00:47:48.608 --> 00:47:50.608
 guy now saying you can't see 
me.  I've been doing it

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:53.718
 15 years and nobody can see me.
  I'm actually invisible.  

00:47:57.881 --> 00:47:59.881
 name is Lily and my question

00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:03.005
 is, how did you get into 
starting -- 

00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:06.124
how did you like... why did you 
want to start wrestling?  

00:48:13.358 --> 00:48:15.358
 because I've always been pretty
 strong

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.470
 and in good

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.570
 shape.  I really enjoy it. 

00:48:22.656 --> 00:48:24.656
 I like to watch the programs, I
 like to keep up on the 

00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:27.781
superstars.  It's something that
 I enjoy even though

00:48:28.863 --> 00:48:30.863
 I'm not involved.  So... 
it's essentially like

00:48:32.057 --> 00:48:34.057
 a dream come

00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:43.152
 true 
&gt;&gt; My name

00:48:44.265 --> 00:48:46.265
 is Jackson.  I wonder if you 
ever got

00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:49.358
 bullied at school before? 
&gt;&gt; Yes.  

00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:52.472
 Yes I diet not only in

00:48:53.642 --> 00:48:55.642
 school and as a young man, I 
was bullied a lot

00:48:56.734 --> 00:49:00.734
 because I didn't look like 
everybody else, because I didn't

00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:58.734
 talk like everybody

00:48:59.829 --> 00:49:03.495
 else.  It was some very 
difficult times.  Bullying is 

00:48:59.829 --> 00:49:01.829
very

00:49:02.918 --> 00:49:04.918
 difficult to deal with, but... 
here's the thing, I

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:08.010
 get bullied every day.  With 
the advent of social

00:49:09.107 --> 00:49:11.107
 media and everyone that can 
comment on your page, a

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.215
 lot of people tell me that I'm 
really not any 

00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:19.397
good, I've been called pretty 
much everything, but... like I 

00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:17.331
said,

00:49:18.426 --> 00:49:20.426
 my experience with all of you

00:49:21.537 --> 00:49:23.537
 guys over the years is great 
tolerance.  The

00:49:24.668 --> 00:49:27.734
 best advice I can give you for 
all of that.  

00:49:24.668 --> 00:49:26.668
Don't pay

00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:30.904
 it any mind.  
Certainly tell someone about it,

00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:29.771
 but

00:49:30.876 --> 00:49:32.876
 don't sweat it.  Those people 
really are just

00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:35.967
 wasting their time anyway.  
Chances are, more often than 

00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:41.219
not, they're going through some 
issues that they can't really 

00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:39.086
deal with.  
So...

00:49:40.187 --> 00:49:42.187
 yes, I was bullied then, I'm 
bullied 

00:49:43.283 --> 00:49:45.283
now, but I don't pay it any mind
 at all.  

00:49:55.504 --> 00:49:57.504
 you like doing

00:49:58.593 --> 00:50:00.593
 animated movies? 
&gt;&gt; I like doing

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.698
 animated movies, because I'm 
not very animated with

00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:06.789
 my own body.  
Kidding.  I enjoy

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.920
 both and everyone often asks 
me, what

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:13.039
 do you like

00:50:14.148 --> 00:50:16.148
 more?  Animated

00:50:17.254 --> 00:50:19.254
 movies or Ferdinand movies? 

00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:22.351
 It's like one day paint inning 
paint and

00:50:23.465 --> 00:50:25.465
 the next with pen, you get to 
make

00:50:26.552 --> 00:50:28.552
 art or clay, but it's just 
different forms.  

00:50:32.675 --> 00:50:34.675
that

00:50:35.761 --> 00:50:37.761
 you accomplished?   
&gt;&gt; Have

00:50:38.837 --> 00:50:40.837
 I ever had a dream that... 
&gt;&gt; You

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:43.950
 accomplished? 
&gt;&gt; 

00:50:45.071 --> 00:50:47.071
Oh!  I mean, every single day.  
I'm able to live a

00:50:48.185 --> 00:50:50.185
 dream every single day. 

00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:53.264
 Although... I had this

00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:56.399
 one weird dream.  I'll talk 
about that later.  That's 

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.510
okay.
[laughter]

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.510
&gt;&gt; This is a question from 
Robert, fifth 

00:51:00.618 --> 00:51:02.618
grader.  As a kid,

00:51:03.705 --> 00:51:05.905
 did you ever get peer 
pressured?

00:51:03.705 --> 00:51:05.705
If so, what did

00:51:06.802 --> 00:51:08.802
 you do?  If you saw someone 
else being teased,

00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:11.883
 what did you do? 
&gt;&gt; I was peer pressured a lot

00:51:12.985 --> 00:51:14.985
 as a kid.  I'm peer

00:51:16.058 --> 00:51:18.058
 pressured a lot as an adult as 
well.  We go to

00:51:19.168 --> 00:51:21.168
 school with a bunch of people 
and there are groups of kids we

00:51:22.275 --> 00:51:24.275
 want to be with and groups of 
kids we don't mesh so well with

00:51:25.365 --> 00:51:27.365
 and we always kind of try to 
find out who we are and where

00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:30.476
 we're going to go in life.  And
 sometimes, we let people make

00:51:31.557 --> 00:51:33.557
 those decisions for

00:51:34.768 --> 00:51:36.768
 us. 

00:51:38.993 --> 00:51:40.993
 Every single time I've let 
those folks make a decision for 

00:51:42.089 --> 00:51:45.822
me, it's really wound up 
disastrous.  I guess my advice 

00:51:42.089 --> 00:51:44.089
when

00:51:45.224 --> 00:51:49.357
 it comes to peer pressure is 
just listen to everything around

00:51:45.224 --> 00:51:47.224
 you and be

00:51:48.322 --> 00:51:50.322
 aware of everything around you 
and make your own

00:51:51.418 --> 00:51:54.218
 choice.  
Because... then at least you'll 

00:51:51.418 --> 00:51:53.418
be happy with it at the

00:51:54.527 --> 00:51:56.527
 end of the day.  

00:52:00.715 --> 00:52:02.715
 you do 1,000 push-ups? 
&gt;&gt; I can, I can

00:52:03.805 --> 00:52:05.805
 easily do 1,000 push-ups if I

00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:08.916
 start now and end in 2020.  

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.030
 But

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.120
 I'm not going to start now.  
We're just going to

00:52:16.226 --> 00:52:19.159
 speculate that I can do the 
1,000 push-ups 

00:52:16.226 --> 00:52:18.226
&gt;&gt; All right...

00:52:19.308 --> 00:52:23.441
 we're going to take one last 
round of questions.  So... this 

00:52:19.308 --> 00:52:21.308
is

00:52:22.411 --> 00:52:24.411
 my last question here and then 
we'll head over there, there

00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.521
 and back, okay? 
&gt;&gt; My name

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:30.625
 is Leslie.  And... 
what does it feel like to be

00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:34.868
 a role model out of the ring 
and in the ring? 

00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:33.735
&gt;&gt;

00:52:34.815 --> 00:52:36.815
 That's, that's very kind 

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.921
words.  That's a, I owe you a 
thank you,

00:52:41.021 --> 00:52:43.021
 sir.  That means, for someone 
like you

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.100
 to say that, means and a bunch 
of people

00:52:47.208 --> 00:52:49.208
 around you are actually paying 
attention to what I do and...

00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:55.379
send.
And... it means more than you

00:52:56.474 --> 00:52:58.474
 know.  I mean it when I say 
thank you, that's

00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.583
 very cool of you 
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is

00:53:02.703 --> 00:53:04.703
 Nigel and I'm in the fifth 
grade.  When did you think that

00:53:05.804 --> 00:53:07.804
 you were very famous?   
&gt;&gt;

00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:10.881
 When did I find out I was very 
talented?  

00:53:11.976 --> 00:53:13.976
&gt;&gt;

00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:17.096
 So you're saying I'm 

00:53:18.208 --> 00:53:20.208
talented?  I think we just 
became best

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:23.359
 buds.  Thank you so much.  I 
don't know,

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:26.434
 man.  I just... I try to work

00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:29.512
 really hard and do the best I 
can

00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:32.589
 every time I get a chance, but 
I'm still looking for that

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.680
 talent.  
Maybe one day I'll find it.  

00:53:45.913 --> 00:53:47.913
Angel.  What is your favorite 
thing in the whole wide 

00:53:49.003 --> 00:53:51.536
world? 
&gt;&gt; Favorite thing in the whole 

00:53:49.003 --> 00:53:51.003
wide world

00:53:52.108 --> 00:53:54.108
 besides ice cream and pizza, 
you 

00:53:55.221 --> 00:53:57.221
ask?  That's a great question.  
I love making people happy,

00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:00.318
 man.  It's a really good 
feeling when you can

00:54:01.399 --> 00:54:03.399
 do something and put a smile on
 somebody's face. 

00:54:04.485 --> 00:54:06.485
 I guess that's why I, I do all 
the stuff that I

00:54:07.588 --> 00:54:09.588
 do.  I like, I really like 
making people happy.  

00:54:10.701 --> 00:54:12.701
Cameron in

00:54:13.797 --> 00:54:15.797
 fifth 

00:54:16.887 --> 00:54:18.887
grade.  Did you have a childhood
 nickname and how did it make

00:54:19.975 --> 00:54:21.975
 you feel? 
&gt;&gt; Yeah... so my childhood

00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:25.072
 nickname was John Cena, which 
in the world

00:54:26.193 --> 00:54:28.193
 of WWE with these awesome 
performers like

00:54:29.287 --> 00:54:31.287
 Stone Cold and Hulk

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:34.402
 Hogan and The Rock and the

00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:37.522
 Undertaker.  They

00:54:38.636 --> 00:54:40.636
 wanted to use my name, and I'm 
John Cena.  I

00:54:42.426 --> 00:54:44.892
 should have planned that one 
better 

00:54:42.426 --> 00:54:44.426
&gt;&gt; The very last question 
&gt;&gt; My

00:54:45.508 --> 00:54:47.508
 name is Antoinette, did

00:54:48.615 --> 00:54:51.281
 you count how many matches 
you've won? 

00:54:48.615 --> 00:54:50.615
&gt;&gt; Say it again

00:54:54.788 --> 00:54:56.788
 matches you've won? 
&gt;&gt; How many matches you 

00:54:57.883 --> 00:54:59.883
won? 
&gt;&gt; Could I -- I'm sorry 

00:55:00.993 --> 00:55:03.326
what? 
&gt;&gt; How many matches have you 

00:55:00.993 --> 00:55:02.993
won? 
&gt;&gt;

00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:06.091
 How many matches have I 

00:55:07.198 --> 00:55:09.198
won? 
&gt;&gt; Well... I've won at least

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.280
 16.  Because I have 16

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.086
 championships.
[applause]

00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:21.531
&gt;&gt; And just keep in mind, in the
 whole

00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:24.615
 winning and losing thing, in 

00:55:25.743 --> 00:55:27.743
baseball, if you only get a hit 
three times out of 

00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:33.081
ten, you're doing okay.  Going 
by that model, I'm doing okay 

00:55:29.015 --> 00:55:31.015
&gt;&gt; You

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:34.128
 guys, your questions were 
absolutely fabulous, let's

00:55:35.226 --> 00:55:38.426
 give him one more round.
[cheering and applause]

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you,

00:55:41.419 --> 00:55:43.419
 everybody.  

00:55:47.512 --> 00:55:49.512
 I just want

00:55:50.598 --> 00:55:52.598
 to say thanks, not only for 
your 

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:55.730
questions, but everybody being 
patient

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:58.853
 and although I am here now, I'm
 going to step over 

00:56:00.846 --> 00:56:03.646
there, so... 
legitimately in the count of 

00:56:00.846 --> 00:56:02.846
three,

00:56:03.956 --> 00:56:05.956
 you can't see me.  

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.270
could just stay

00:56:20.415 --> 00:56:22.415
 in your seats for a minute, 
John wanted to take a picture

00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:25.544
 with all of you. 

00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:28.621
So... my colleagues over here

00:56:29.746 --> 00:56:31.746
 are handing out -- please 
listen.  

00:56:35.844 --> 00:56:37.844
 Shh!  Thank you.  My colleagues
