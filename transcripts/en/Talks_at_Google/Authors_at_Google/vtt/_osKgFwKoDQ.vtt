SPEAKER 1: Hello, everybody,
and welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.770
Our guest today
describes himself

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.720
as an unshakeable
optimist who believes

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.680
in a bright future and our
ability to build it together.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.670
A trained ethnographer
and author

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.860
of three bestselling
books, he has

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.620
discovered some
remarkable patterns

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.900
that help leaders
around the globe

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.970
make an impact on
their organizations.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.792
Thank you for coming, and
please welcome Simon Sinek.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:40.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.240
SIMON SINEK: Thanks.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.390
So I thought I'd share with
you some new stuff that I'm

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.600
working on because it's
fun, and then we'll

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.650
spend most of the
time just doing Q&amp;A

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.282
because that's also fun.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.240
So I'm working on a new
book, and I've recently

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.990
become completely smitten
by game theory, specifically

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.150
finite and infinite games.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.830
In game theory,
there are two types

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.690
of games-- finite
and infinite games.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.860
A finite game is defined as
known players, fixed rules,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.707
and an agreed upon
objective, like baseball.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.790
We all agree to the rules.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.340
We all agree that whoever has
more runs at the end of nine

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.070
innings is the winner, and the
game ends and we all go home.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.990
Nobody ever says, if we can
just play three more innings

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.823
and then we can come
back from this deficit.

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:26.560
It doesn't happen that way.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.710
An infinite game is defined
as known and unknown players.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.310
The rules are changeable,
and the objective

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.240
is to keep the game in play
to perpetuate the game.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.515
When you pit a finite player
versus a finite player,

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:43.390
the system is stable.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.610
Baseball is stable.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.120
When you hit an infinite player
versus an infinite player,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.650
the system is also stable,
like the Cold War was stable

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.850
because there cannot be a winner
and there cannot be a loser.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.020
So we just try and
keep the game in play.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.730
And in infinite
games, because there

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.890
are no winners and
losers, what happens

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.990
is players drop out
of the game when

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.610
they run out of the will or the
resources to continue to play.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.940
So technically, the United
States didn't win the Cold War.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.980
The Soviets dropped out
because they ran out

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.860
of the resources or the
will to continue to play.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.780
Problems arise,
however, when you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.532
pit a finite player
versus an infinite player,

00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:24.490
because one is playing
to win and the other one

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.530
is playing to keep playing.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.440
So invariably, what happens is
the finite player will always

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.600
find themselves in a quagmire.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.970
So this was the United
States and Vietnam.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.370
The United States
was fighting to win,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.340
and the North Vietnamese
were fighting to survive--

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.830
very different set of standards.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.230
This was the Soviet
Union in Afghanistan.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.670
The Soviets were fighting
to beet the Mujaheddin,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.480
and the Mujaheddin would fight
for as long as is necessary.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.790
And invariably, what
happens is the finite player

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.206
will find themselves
in a quagmire

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.359
until they drop out of the
game and leave the game,

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.400
because they run out of
the will or the resources

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.800
to stay in the game.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.240
So this gets me thinking.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.970
Let's look at business.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.790
The game of business
is an infinite game.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.070
It obeys all the rules.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.870
There are known and
unknown players.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.690
You don't know all the
competitors, necessarily,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.610
in one industry to another.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.690
The rules are changeable.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.820
We haven't all agreed
what the rules are,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.507
and there is no winning
the game of business.

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:26.590
The game just perpetuates.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.150
In fact, the game
of business has

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.090
existed longer than every single
company on the planet today,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.750
and it will outlast every single
company on the planet today.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.720
If you look at the Dow Index,
the 30-something-odd companies

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.690
that make up the Dow Index,
something like 70% or 80%

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.850
of those companies are
35 years or younger.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.620
So it gets me thinking, if
you listen to the language

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.030
that companies use, they don't
know what game they're in.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.955
They talk about being
number one, talk

00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:00.580
about beating their
competition, based

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.370
on what agreed upon
criteria, based

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.410
on what agreed upon time frame?

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.840
Is it market share?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.680
Is it profits?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.890
Is it revenues?

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.610
Square footage?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.960
Number of employees?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.460
Over what?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.044
One month, five months, six
months, a year, five years,

00:04:14.044 --> 00:04:15.460
10 years, the life
of the company?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.500
I haven't agreed to those rules.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.019
And so companies can
arbitrarily declare themselves

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.560
number one in anything they
want if they set the standards

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.391
and the time frames.

00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:26.890
And the only reason we do these
things on annualized basis--

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.220
we tend to compare ourselves
to other organizations

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.029
annually-- is only because
we pay taxes annually.

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.570
If we pay taxes
every 18 months, that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.170
would be sort of the standard.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.520
But again, we still haven't
agreed what the metrics

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.470
are to be number one.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.360
That means that companies that
are playing the infinite game

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.110
are playing against
most of the others who

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.660
are playing the finite game
means those finite companies

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.600
find themselves in a quagmire.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.240
Almost every single
bankruptcy-- not almost every,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.040
every single
bankruptcy-- is a company

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.750
that's run out of the will
or the resources to play.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.833
They drop out of the game.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.180
The game will persist.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.770
Another company will
fill their space.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.970
It's not like the business
stops or the industry ends.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.300
And the companies that are
playing the infinite game

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.270
will frustrate those finite
players, which I absolutely

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.560
adore.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.594
So I spoke at an education
summit for Microsoft.

00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:21.510
I also spoke in an
education summit for Apple.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.390
Now, I would say about 70%
to 80% of the executives

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.730
at Microsoft spent
about 70% to 80%

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:35.250
of their PowerPoints talking
about how to beat Apple.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.040
At the Apple summit,
100% of the executives

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.400
spent 100% of their
presentations talking

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.970
about how to help teachers teach
and how to help students learn.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.060
One was obsessed with their
journey, with their vision,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.887
with their cause.

00:05:48.887 --> 00:05:50.970
The other one was obsessed
with their competition.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.620
Guess who's stuck in quagmire?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.102
Guess who's frustrated
by their competition?

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:58.560
So at the end of my talk at
Microsoft, they gave me a gift.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.630
They gave me the new
Zune, when it was a thing.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.120
And I have to tell
you, this was one

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.400
of the most remarkable,
beautiful pieces of technology

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.450
I've ever used.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.310
The UI was gorgeous.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.120
The design of the actual
hardware was beautiful.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.720
It was logical in the
way I could use it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.494
It was intuitive.

00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:21.660
It was absolutely fantastic.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.610
Now, it didn't work with iTunes,
which means I couldn't use it.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.193
That's a different
problem altogether,

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:27.640
but this was a magical
piece of technology.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.790
So at the end of
my talk at Apple,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.420
I'm sharing a cab with one of
the senior Apple executives,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.400
sort of an employee
number 12 kind of guy,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.029
and I decide to stir the pot.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.570
So I turned to him and I said,
you know, I spoke at Microsoft

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.090
and they gave me the new
Zune and it is so much

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.810
better than your iPod Touch.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.360
And he turns to me and
he says, I have no doubt.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.820
Conversation over.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.130
Because the infinite
player understands

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.860
sometimes your product is
better and sometimes it's not.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.650
Sometimes you're ahead and
sometimes you're behind.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.080
The goal is not to
beat your competitor.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.850
The goal is to outlast
your competitor.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.200
What you find is that the
infinite players don't actually

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.790
compete against
their competition.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.422
They compete against themselves.

00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:11.880
The finite players
are the ones who

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.530
wake up every day trying
to beat somebody else.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.730
The infinite
players the ones who

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.850
say, how can we be a better
version of ourselves,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.600
how can we advance our
metrics, how can we

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.060
make our product more
refined, more beautiful

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.010
than they were last week.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.345
It's totally fine to
study our competition.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.720
Tactically, there's
nothing wrong

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.830
with knowing what our
competitors are doing.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.490
But the number of companies
that study their competition

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.770
strategically blows my mind.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.720
They look at what their
competition is doing,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.120
and they make sudden,
sharp left and right turns

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.710
to change the course
of their company,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.930
based on the movement
of their competition.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.010
That's the point.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.435
That's what wastes resources,
the constant changing

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.560
of your mind, the constant
going in this direction,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.430
that direction, based on the
wind of your competition--

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.860
assuming that they know
what they're doing.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.930
I find that fascinating.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.850
And the number of
companies that play finite

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.419
is the vast, vast,
vast majority.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:03.960
So it begs the
question, how does one

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.270
play the infinite game?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.690
How does one build an
organization constructed

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.160
for the infinite game?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.100
So up here, you have
the infinite game.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.780
This is where the why exists.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.240
I talk about the why-- the
purpose, cause, or belief--

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.330
about the organization.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.720
This is where our values lie.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.400
These are never-changing.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.540
They are permanent.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.420
They will outlast all of us,
and they should outlast--

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420
they've been here from
the birth of the company,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.679
and they should last the
length of the company.

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:33.929
The infinite stuff, the why
stuff and the value stuff,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.980
is inherently intangible,
and it's inherently difficult

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.840
to measure.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.240
Now, down here you
have the finite game,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.540
and this is where
our interests lie.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.294
This is where what I would
call your "whats" lie.

00:08:51.294 --> 00:08:53.460
This is where our products
lie and things like that.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.990
It is inherently tangible
and inherently very easy

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.130
to measure.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.840
Now, the goal is to run all
decisions through our values,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.300
through our purpose or
cause first, and then

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.410
through our interests.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.120
So what is a
values-based decision?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.050
What does that even look like?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.290
So here's a
values-based decision.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:20.470
When our military goes into
battle and we shoot a bad guy,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.930
we will take their injured body.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.150
We will send our medics
onto the battlefield

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.610
to rescue the injured
body of our enemy.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.130
We will put them
on our helicopters,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.520
fly them to our hospitals,
put them in our hospital beds.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.230
Our doctors will
use our medicine

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.060
to nurse them back to health.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.400
That is not in our interest.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.050
However, that's
kind of who we are.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.610
It's what defines us.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.710
In other words, we're
wasting our resources

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.070
because our values are
more important than saving

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.000
those resources, doing something
purely in our interests.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.470
It's like torture.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.080
The reason torture
was done offshore

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.140
and the reason we tried
to keep it a secret

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.304
is because everybody kind of
knew it violated our values.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.970
Because if we were
totally fine with it,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.469
everybody would be like, just
do it here, it's totally fine.

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:09.780
Why not somewhere in Wyoming?

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:13.770
And that's the point.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.340
So great organizations are
making values-based decisions

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.317
all the time, and then our
interests come into play.

00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:23.400
But the problem is when
you're playing the finite,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.740
these things get ignored,
and every time we

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.920
make a decision we decide
what we do in a vacuum.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.170
So your competitor comes
out with a new product.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.980
How do we react?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.869
Quickly, come out with
something similar.

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:37.410
What's going on with
the marketplace,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.310
and make some other reaction.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.110
What's going on in this
particular country?

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.660
And every single decision
we make in a vacuum

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.590
seems perfectly good.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.982
We're making rational decisions
based on our interests.

00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:48.690
The problem is when
we pull back and look

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.220
at all of the decisions,
all the people we've

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.678
hired, this is what happens
when you only hire people based

00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.900
on their resumes, for example.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.840
Smart guy-- get that
person on board.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.030
When you pull back,
your culture is a mess,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.580
and nobody knows
what you stand for.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.280
The whole idea of making
values-based decisions

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.690
is we can look at almost
all of the decisions.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.754
Every now and then
one can go sideways.

00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:11.170
But we look at all
the decisions--

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.750
the people you hire,
the things you do,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.291
the things you believe in, the
things you stand for, anything

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:15.870
tangible--

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.820
and we can say of you
or your organization,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.140
I know what you stand for.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.880
I believe what you believe.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.280
I would like to be a part
of your organization.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.905
I'd like to buy from
your organization.

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.150
This is where loyalty lies.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.760
But the only way we can judge
each other is down here.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.410
It's like human beings.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.370
We want our friends to act and
speak and do the things based

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.037
on who they are.

00:11:39.037 --> 00:11:41.536
We want our friends to be-- you
know that word that's always

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:43.950
thrown about-- authentic,
which means saying and doing

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.380
the things we actually believe.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.910
That's what we mean.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.030
And the reason is because we
want to know who they are.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.910
We want them to be predictable.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.676
I can't see anybody.

00:11:55.676 --> 00:11:58.570
Can we turn the lights back on?

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.340
Was that better for you?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:00.960
Oh, sorry.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.490
But now you can fall
asleep, because I can't see.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.660
But that's the idea.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.560
That's the idea.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.849
So this is what I'm doing.

00:12:11.849 --> 00:12:13.890
I've become fascinated by
this game theory stuff,

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.620
and I'm running it through
all kinds of scenarios.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.170
I'm looking at relationships,
I'm looking at business,

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.950
I'm looking at politics, I'm
looking at war and nation

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.950
states and how this plays
out in the real world.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.180
Because the game is the game.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.554
We don't get to
change the rules.

00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:27.300
Of course, there are
always finite games

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.860
within the infinite.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.920
It's the difference between
a goal and a vision.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.025
A goal is 26.2 miles.

00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:35.400
Count the metrics,
count the mile

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.880
markers, and when you reach
the goal the game ends.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.910
It's over.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.710
The vision is having a crystal
clear sense of what the finish

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.140
line looks like far
from the distance,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.300
but having no idea
how far away it is--

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.320
so far away that for
all practical purposes

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.550
we'll never get there.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.100
Take the United States, the
Declaration of Independence.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.440
Here is a nation who declared
why we needed our own country.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.410
And it didn't start off
by complaining or griping

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.120
about the King
and Great Britain.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.060
It started off with an ideal.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.535
We believe that all men are
created equal, that all of us

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:13.410
are endowed with certain,
unalienable rights,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.780
amongst which include
life, liberty,

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.110
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.140
We'll never actually
get there, but the goal

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.760
is that we will die trying.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.040
And within that
infinite contest,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.840
there are many
finite games that we

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.900
hope to advance that
infinite contest or even

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.650
little infinite games within
that, like civil rights.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.240
We've never actually
reached the point

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.260
where we have
perfect civil rights,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.810
but we'll continue to get
better and better and better.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.710
That's the point.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.790
It's constant refinement.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.020
It's kaizen.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.279
It's no matter how good we
do, we can always do better.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.820
But the goal is we
have a North Star.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.695
We have a thing to point
us in the direction.

00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:47.706
It's not random.

00:13:47.706 --> 00:13:49.580
So in the United States,
we have civil rights

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.460
or women's suffrage or
gay rights or education

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.740
for everyone or health
care for everyone.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.950
What form it takes,
it's our way of trying

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.980
to get closer and closer
and closer to the ideal

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.500
upon which the
nation was founded.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.590
I wish all organizations-- they
don't have to be nation states.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.030
I wish all organizations did
the same thing-- operated not

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.712
just in their
interests, but also

00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:16.920
have a sense of code or
values and a sense of purpose

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.650
and vision.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.460
It matters.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.180
Because we want to
stand for something.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.090
We want to work for something.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.670
We want all of our hard work,
the products we produce,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.580
everything, we want it to
count towards something,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.820
not simply be against
something or make something

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.290
in the short term.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.840
I see this so often
with senior executives,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.014
with people who are making more
money than they've ever made.

00:14:39.014 --> 00:14:40.430
They have more
power and influence

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.610
than they've ever had.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.620
And yet later on
in their careers,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.730
they don't feel as
successful as they

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.970
did when they were a junior.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.902
When we're junior, the
first promotion we get,

00:14:46.902 --> 00:14:48.860
the first raise we get,
the first bonus we get,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.550
the first client we
win, whatever it is,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.860
it's all very exciting.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.110
We're living down here and
everything's very exciting.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.400
But after you've had
a bunch of bonuses

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.450
and you've won a
bunch of clients

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.200
and you've had a bunch
of product releases

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.511
and a bunch of promotions,
it's exciting for a little bit.

00:15:01.511 --> 00:15:03.260
Go out for a nice
dinner with your family.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.960
That's about it, and
then it wears off.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.540
And so what starts to
happen is our work no longer

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.120
feels like it has
any sense of purpose,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.114
and so we default back
to when we were young.

00:15:13.114 --> 00:15:15.530
We thought, well, when I won
the client, win more clients.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.030
And when I reach
$1 million dollars,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.274
get more millions of dollars.

00:15:18.274 --> 00:15:19.940
That gave me the
feeling the first time.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.356
You'll get with
the feeling again.

00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:22.070
It doesn't.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.724
That's like winning
one marathon,

00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:25.640
thinking it's amazing.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.320
You keep running marathons
for the rest of your life,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.400
and at some point
you're like, why am

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.810
I running all these marathons?

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.700
They have to contribute
to something.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.540
They have to contribute
to something.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.540
So I'm fascinated by
the companies that

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.960
play the infinite game,
because inherently they

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.310
frustrate their competition.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.070
For years, Apple frustrated
Microsoft, especially when

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.430
it was run by Steve Ballmer.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.450
He was a guy who ran the
company based on interests alone

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.060
versus competing against
an organization that

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.520
was doing something bigger--

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.160
Costco versus Wal-Mart,
Southwest Airlines

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.300
versus everybody, organizations
that seem to not care about

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.610
what Wall Street thinks about
the quarter of the year.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.220
And when you listen to
the language of people

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.799
like Jim Senegal, who's the
founder of Costco, he says,

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.090
I don't care about Wall Street.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.330
Wall Street's worried about
how my company does in a month

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:11.937
or in a year.

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:14.270
I care about what my company
does for the next 50 years.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.310
That's the company I'm building.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.260
You listen to the language--

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.230
ones who are focused on
teaching kids how to learn

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.630
and helping teachers
how to teach,

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.372
versus how to beat
our competition.

00:16:26.372 --> 00:16:28.080
It makes for a much
more fulfilling life,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.350
and it makes for a much
more realistic existence.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.016
When your competition
is slightly ahead,

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.730
you think that's OK.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.340
I can't stay ahead forever
based on some arbitrary

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.080
metrics, anyway.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.410
So that's what I'm working on.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.118
I think it's fun.

00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:42.270
I think it's interesting.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.770
We made some changes
even in the way

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.230
we do business based on this.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.360
We become more
infinitely organized,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.870
which means we are much
more interested in trends

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.310
than we are in absolutes.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.765
Because absolutes exist
down here, but ongoing

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:55.390
exists up here.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.806
So for example,
let's say you will

00:16:56.806 --> 00:17:00.110
get a bonus if you hit a certain
target by a certain date.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.790
That target is arbitrary.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.190
That date is arbitrary.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.599
Somebody made it up.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.810
That's how most of our
bonus structures are built--

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.000
on arbitrary numbers
on arbitrary dates.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.640
And let's say that that
person is doing good work

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.210
and building good systems,
but they miss the target.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.069
They miss the number.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.810
But if you were to pull back and
look at how they've been doing,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.200
and you see this
beautiful steady line,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.170
we can see that they're
doing good work, that they're

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.580
building good systems.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.530
There's huge stability there.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.140
They just miss the arbitrary
number on the arbitrary date.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.084
Give that person a
bonus, because we

00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:37.250
want that person to continue
building those systems.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.030
And the odds are
they're probably

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.980
at the number two or
three months later, which

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.229
is totally fine because then
it's going to grow, grow,

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:44.780
and grow, versus the person
who stabs people in the back,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.954
plays politics.

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:47.370
Their performance
looks like this.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.260
There's no stability.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.310
It's all over the place.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.169
They happen to meet the
number on an arbitrary date.

00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:53.210
Give that person a bonus?

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.110
Why?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.390
They're breaking the
company along the way.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.730
The point is the finite
player only looks

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.170
at these discrete
moments in time,

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.870
and the infinite player
is much more preoccupied

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.104
with the trend of things.

00:18:05.104 --> 00:18:06.770
So in our business,
we become absolutely

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.974
preoccupied with the trend.

00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:09.390
There are some
projects that we've

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.110
wanted to implement
that I wish took a year

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.970
and they took years.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.871
And it doesn't matter
how much I say,

00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:17.120
I want it done at the end of--

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.170
we missed it.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:18.920
But you know what?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.753
We were building good
systems along the way.

00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:22.784
We just missed a prediction.

00:18:22.784 --> 00:18:25.200
And the result is we have much
better systems, much better

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.770
product, and much
more motivated by it

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.540
because nobody was penalized
for missing arbitrary numbers

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.680
on arbitrary dates.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.490
So I'm learning how
to build and run

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.990
a business for the infinite.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.510
When somebody asked me
recently in an interview

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.190
about my competition,
like how do I

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.860
compete against the people in
my space, the answer is, what--

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.440
competing against what?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.699
What am I competing for?

00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:52.740
Like, am I going to compare
how many views on TED

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.710
or how many book sales or how
much my personal income is

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.270
or how much my
corporate income is?

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.650
What's the arbitrary standard?

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.890
Because I can be ahead on some
metrics and behind on others.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.540
I can drive myself crazy or it
can be really proud of myself.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.620
Worse, I'm choosing who
my competitive set is.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.880
But the competitor set is way
larger than I can imagine.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.010
I love it when the
networks declare

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.521
that they're number one.

00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:19.520
You do realize they're
only comparing themselves

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.140
to the few other
networks that they

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.264
want to compare themselves.

00:19:22.264 --> 00:19:25.110
NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox compare
themselves to each other.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:34.260
They ignore Netflix, Hulu, HBO,
YouTube, and the rest of them.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.810
But that's the point.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.220
If you can make your
own competitive set,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.410
you will be number one.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.390
Everybody will have
their day in the sun.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.539
I get a kick out of that.

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:44.580
I get a kick out of that.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.764
So especially for an
organization like YouTube,

00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:48.430
the question is, who's
your competition?

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.070
The competition is yourself.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.557
Wish everybody the best of luck.

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:52.890
Let them make their own metrics.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.180
Let them declare
themselves number one.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.930
Who cares?

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.596
They'll fall out of
the game before you.

00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:57.870
That's the goal.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.440
That's the goal.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.189
Should we do some questions?

00:20:02.189 --> 00:20:03.730
AUDIENCE: I think
everything you just

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.220
said is really
interesting, and it

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.761
hits on something
I've been wondering

00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:08.260
about for a long time.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.570
Here at Google, we have a
phenomenal set of benefits,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.700
and I think it's no
argument that we're

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.460
looked to as a leader in
kind of creating the utopian

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.530
workplace for the
smart, creative,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.932
or whatever terms you
want to apply to it.

00:20:19.932 --> 00:20:21.640
And it seems congruent
in a lot of ways--

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.890
the original founders' message
with this infinite game

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.320
and everything
you're describing.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.730
But I wonder, is
this a luxury that we

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.100
happen to have because
we're such a phenomenally

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.010
profitable company
that we can provide

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.170
all these luxurious benefits
and all these things?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.780
And you look at some of these
other companies that maybe

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.930
don't have the luxury of those
of these thick profit margins,

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.320
and they can't afford to
play the infinite game.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.607
And they're focused
on being tactical.

00:20:46.607 --> 00:20:48.190
SIMON SINEK: No, no,
they can't afford

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.620
to play a strong finite game.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.426
They can absolutely
play the infinite game.

00:20:52.426 --> 00:20:53.800
So if it was based
on your logic,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.211
every single company
that's under-resourced

00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.210
would never make it, which
is just not the case.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.550
And people aren't
loyal to free lunch.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.070
I mean, some people are.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.600
And you see this
in the tech space

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.660
so much, which is
people claim, oh, I

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.950
want to work for a place with
purpose and make a difference.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.720
They claim they're
looking for this,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.070
but the reality is they
really like free lunch.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.510
And the other company
didn't have free lunch,

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.470
so I'm going to take this one
because they have free lunch.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.147
In other words, they went
for the rich company,

00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:31.480
which may last if the company's
also an infinite player.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.770
But if they're just
a finite player,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.150
it's going to run
out at some point.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.983
Because when the company
starts to struggle,

00:21:35.983 --> 00:21:38.520
guess what things
they'll start cutting?

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.470
And like you have, we have
friends in tech companies

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.440
who don't work here
who get free lunch--

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.430
and beautiful offices, flat
screen TVs in every hallway,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.300
gorgeous.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.730
And yet they were like--

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.320
you know?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.861
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think you're kind

00:21:54.861 --> 00:21:57.070
of cherry-picking a few
different very simple

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.880
of those benefits.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.860
I think a lot of the
things that people herald

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.830
are, for instance,
long maternity benefits

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.190
or anything associated with
childcare and things like that.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.110
Maybe if you run a
construction company

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.750
and you have to have people
show up and lift a heavy thing,

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.330
and it's potentially dangerous
and you can't give people

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.663
flexible work arrangements
where they can work from home

00:22:15.663 --> 00:22:18.010
and take their kids to daycare
because you have to have

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.220
the guy driving the crane--

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.819
I begin to wonder,
is it easy for us--

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:27.860
you, me, all of us in here
that sit here and say,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.140
oh, we want to focus
on these ideals

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.980
because the industry
we happen to work in

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.170
makes it easy to provide
for those ideals?

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.880
SIMON SINEK: Let us
not confuse feeling

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.550
like we belong and cushy.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.220
I'm not cherry-picking.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.197
There are many people
who enjoy the benefits.

00:22:46.197 --> 00:22:47.280
We all enjoy the benefits.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.210
Why wouldn't we?

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.720
But does that mean that if
the benefits weren't there

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.820
we would immediately quit?

00:22:55.962 --> 00:22:56.920
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.350
I mean, I just--

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.670
SIMON SINEK: And so take
a company like WD-40.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.650
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.410
SIMON SINEK: Much smaller
than Google, does very well.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.991
Their offices are
kind of a dump.

00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:13.240
The benefits they offer,
they're nice to their people,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.740
and where they can, they
offer all kinds of stuff

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.270
in education, maternity
stuff, and all of that stuff.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.940
But it's not as cushy as large,
huge tech companies that have

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.190
huge amounts of extra cash.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.574
And the people who work
there love working there

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.240
and will come in
everyday full of gusto,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.940
because it's the people we work
with, not the stuff we get.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.670
The stuff we get, the very
point to the stuff we get, is it

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.780
runs out.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.290
It's finite.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.870
You have to keep injecting it.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.960
The people we work with,
that's the relationships

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.930
and the infinite
component of the company.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.700
So if you love working here, I
would say that if you're loyal

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.340
and you really love it--

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.700
not like it, but love it--

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.180
I would argue that you love
the people with whom you work.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.210
And if some of the benefits were
taken away for whatever reason

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.700
that you would still come
to work loyally and still

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.160
love it because of the
people you work with.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.410
And if there were only people
who chased benefits from

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.243
benefits to benefits--
and there are people;

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:07.010
that's like chasing salaries--

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.230
then there's never loyalty
and there's never love.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.580
AUDIENCE: Well, I certainly
do agree with everything

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.470
you just said, but when
you're talking about,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.260
for instance, these
trend lines and being

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.000
able to miss the
arbitrary number--

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.010
if you're a smaller,
scrappier company,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.640
maybe you can't afford to miss
these numbers, whereas we have

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.830
the luxury of this
big war chest of money

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.560
that if the goal is missed
by a quarter or two quarters,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.110
or in your case these projects
that took additional years,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.110
I mean, isn't that
sort of you are

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.220
able to provide for that
kind of flexible timeline

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.310
because you have the
tail-end of success?

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.060
SIMON SINEK: There are
always finite games

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.810
within the infinite.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.310
Of course.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.857
Of course.

00:24:42.857 --> 00:24:44.690
AUDIENCE: That's what
I was wondering about.

00:24:49.737 --> 00:24:51.820
AUDIENCE: So my wife and
I are both military vets,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.990
and we work here at Google.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.556
SIMON SINEK: Which force?

00:24:54.556 --> 00:24:55.180
AUDIENCE: Army.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.420
Army officers.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.449
And I wanted to talk to
you upon your example

00:24:58.449 --> 00:24:59.240
about the military.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.240
In one of your other
talks, you talk about Medal

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.930
of Honor recipients.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.360
And basically, they do
these heroic things,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.250
and they say, why did you do it?

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.310
You say in your talk, because
they would have done it for me.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.080
So that mentality
is my question.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.420
You also mentioned
in military we're

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.751
willing to sacrifice ourselves
for the gain of others,

00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:18.500
but in business we're
willing to sacrifice

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.240
others for our own gain.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.970
How do you build
that military mindset

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.590
in companies like here
or other companies?

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.060
SIMON SINEK: Leadership.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.862
I mean, leadership
creates an environment.

00:25:28.862 --> 00:25:30.320
And I mean, this
is what I learned.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.140
The whole concept of
leaders in those lessons

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.580
that I learned from spending
time with folks in uniform--

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.712
it was born out of
my own experience.

00:25:39.712 --> 00:25:41.420
I was going through
a point in my career,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.740
as my career was growing--

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.380
all of a sudden you
have new friends

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.690
that I didn't have before.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.362
And that's wonderful, and
then I learned the hard way

00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:50.570
that they weren't my friends.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.890
They were playing me.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.060
They wanted access or
a deal or something.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.829
And I learned it the hard way.

00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:57.620
And so I retreated.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.000
I was like, I want to be
friends with nobody else

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.083
but the people I knew way
back when, which is also

00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:02.482
not a good way to live.

00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:04.190
And yet simultaneously,
I'm spending time

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.714
with tons of folks
in the military.

00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:08.630
In business, we have
colleagues and coworkers.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.260
In the military, you have
brothers and sisters,

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.570
and that's a different
kind of relationship.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.999
And as you know, I have
hugged more people in uniform

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:15.290
than I've ever hugged in suits.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.090
I've cried with more
people in uniform

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.620
than I've ever
cried with in suits.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.870
I've stood in the audience
and listened to officers

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.090
give talks, and I've sat
in the audience and cried.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.084
I've never cried with any
CEO that gave a speech ever.

00:26:27.084 --> 00:26:29.000
So there's a different
nature of relationship.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.839
And my original conclusion
was they're better people,

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:34.880
that the reason you get
a disproportionate amount

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.450
of these kinds of behaviors is
because they're better people

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.864
and better people are
drawn to a life of service

00:26:40.864 --> 00:26:43.280
in the military, which is why
we find a disproportionately

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.202
high number of them there.

00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:46.910
And the more I started
to learn, the more

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.050
I realized I was
completely wrong.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.545
It's the environment.

00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:51.420
It's the environment.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.470
And when the leader creates
an environment in which people

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.960
feel that someone
has my back, they

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.380
will do extraordinary things.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.440
And what I learned is
that courage is not

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.860
this deep down
internal fortitude.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.480
It comes externally.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.250
It's like a trapeze
artist would never

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.910
try a brand new, death-defying
act unless they had a net.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.310
The courage didn't come
from the trapeze artist;

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.900
the courage came from the net.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.871
And it's the same in the
military, especially when

00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:19.370
you're in life and
death situations,

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.612
when you're in theater.

00:27:22.612 --> 00:27:25.070
People you don't like, you
still rely on to save your life,

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.111
and the reason it works
is because you don't have

00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:28.520
to look behind your shoulder.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.800
And that mentality--
and you know better

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.010
than anybody, which is
when you are deployed

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.270
into dangerous places,
nobody loves deployment

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.830
but people have warm
feelings towards deployment,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.990
which is really strange.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.920
And suicides rarely happen
in combat situations.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.710
They usually happen back home.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.410
And it's the intensity
of the relationships that

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:56.030
create that warmth and the sort
of weird enjoyment of really

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.720
bad, uncomfortable, and
dangerous circumstances.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.660
It's because we're human
beings and human beings,

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.530
as social animals,
feel our safest

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.970
when we trust each other.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.250
And good leaders are
capable of producing that.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.910
So great businesses
look very much

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.017
like well-run military
organizations.

00:28:17.017 --> 00:28:19.100
There's poorly run military
organizations as well.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.710
But great businesses look
exactly the same, where

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.830
the leaders give the glory.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.290
They distribute authority.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.660
They push it down the ranks,
let people make decisions.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.322
If they screw up, there's
no risk of getting fired.

00:28:32.322 --> 00:28:34.280
If the company misses
its arbitrary projections

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.350
on its arbitrary date,
we do not use the people

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.580
to balance the books.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.080
We figure out other
ways, or we even

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.090
invite the people to
help solve the problems.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.381
These are the things that
produce that circle of safety

00:28:43.381 --> 00:28:47.000
that produces the exact same
outcome, where people will

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.040
love each other,
cry for each other,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.150
sacrifice for each other.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.300
You see it in business
plenty, but it always

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.410
boils down to leadership.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.430
I mean, I can't help
but talk about it.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.914
Let's look at United Airlines,
what just happened, shortly.

00:28:59.914 --> 00:29:00.830
It's going to come up.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.400
Usually, when things
like that happen,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.180
that is a red flag that they
have a leadership problem.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.060
It's very rare that you
have something like that

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.720
just show up out of nowhere.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.620
What that probably
is is an environment

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.300
in which people are operating
in a fear-based culture, where

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.179
if you don't follow the rules
exactly as we've told you

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:27.470
you're going to get in trouble.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.150
And the rule book says,
offer them an incentive.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.960
And then it says, if that
didn't work, it says,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.190
randomly pick people.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.270
And then it says, if that
doesn't work, call security.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.990
I'm just following the rules.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.455
There's no discretion, where
everybody knows that's stupid.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.530
Like when the CEO announced
that we're no longer going

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.410
to forcibly remove--

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.976
like, why was that
ever a policy?

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:55.350
That's like food companies
saying, now with no chemicals.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.940
It's like, wait, wait, wait,
why were there ever chemicals?

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.030
But that's the point, which
nobody has discretion.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.610
So I was boarding a flight--

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.510
I've told this story.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.160
I was boarding a
flight, and the scene

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.220
played out in front of me,
where one of the passengers

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.070
attempted to board the plane
before their group number was

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.960
called.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.900
And the gate agent
literally berated him.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.804
Sir, step aside.

00:30:18.804 --> 00:30:19.970
I haven't called your group.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.740
Please step aside and wait
until I call your group.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.660
So I spoke up and
said, why do you

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.960
have to talk to us that way?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.050
Why can't you talk to us
like we're human beings?

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.520
And she looked me
in the eye and said,

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.645
if I don't follow the rules,
I could get in trouble

00:30:31.645 --> 00:30:33.274
or lose my job.

00:30:33.274 --> 00:30:35.440
All she revealed to me is
that she doesn't feel safe

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.947
in her own company,
and her leaders

00:30:36.947 --> 00:30:38.780
do not trust her to do
the job for which she

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.790
has been trained to do.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.830
And guess who suffers?

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.670
Us and the company.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.830
The reason we love
flying Southwest Airlines

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.270
is because the
company trusts them

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.310
to do the job they have
been trained to do,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.870
and they use discretion.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.790
We don't trust people
to follow the rules.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.010
We trust people to know
when to break them.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.990
And the problem is, in
a fear-based society,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:01.000
people fear for their own
jobs more than common sense.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.060
That was a perfect
scenario of what

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.190
happens when somebody
in the company

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.000
is too afraid to break the
rule, break the policy,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.410
use discretion to
find another way--

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.080
so almost predictable that
something will happen,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.300
something will
break at some point.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.110
Thanks.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.302
How you doing?

00:31:21.302 --> 00:31:23.260
AUDIENCE: So for some
industries that we're in,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.520
I feel like we're
doing a really good job

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.600
of playing the infinite game.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.058
We have a set of
values that I feel

00:31:27.058 --> 00:31:29.110
like we're very much
trying to follow

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.810
as we come up with new
products and new features.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.582
My question is, after
that's played out

00:31:35.582 --> 00:31:37.540
for five, 10 years in
some of these industries,

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.550
it's clear we're reaching
some sort of maximum,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.380
where following
those values is only

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.970
going to get us so
much of the market.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.580
And even though we might
not be reactively looking

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.380
to competitors to see
what they're up to,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.570
we can't help but notice that
they have most of the pie--

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.310
and even though we've stuck
to our guns for as far

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.380
as we can get without
doing something different.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.420
So it's of course very
tempting at that point

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.122
to change and start
emulating what

00:31:58.122 --> 00:32:00.580
other people are doing to get
that bigger piece of the pie.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.410
So how much
flexibility do you see

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.714
when you're playing the
infinity game to change course?

00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:06.130
SIMON SINEK: Depends
on the reason

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.290
you want to increase
the slice of pie.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.350
Just because, or because
you have a message

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.350
and you know that if you
can get more of the pie

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.410
that message will reach
and help more people?

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:21.720
Is it nobly pursued, or
is it selfishly pursued?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.380
And who says the time
frame has to be now?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.090
The women's suffrage movement--

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.590
pretty important.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.820
Get the women the vote--

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.330
pretty good idea.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.620
You know that almost all
the founders of the suffrage

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.270
movement died before the
first woman ever voted?

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.870
Because that's how long it took.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.920
Took more than a lifetime
for them to get it.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.620
But the point was the pursuit,
the pursuit, the pursuit.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.953
Would they like to have had
it happen in their lifetime?

00:32:48.953 --> 00:32:50.400
Of course, of course.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.650
Were they more preoccupied
that it happened?

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.815
Absolutely.

00:32:53.815 --> 00:32:54.690
And that's the point.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.060
You build legacy, you build
people who take that torch

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.470
and carry it without you.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.610
So the problem is
that I think vision--

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.460
here's a thing that's
always boggled my mind.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.400
Why is it unbalance, unbalance--
not always, but unbalance?

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.930
Why is it that
small companies tend

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.480
to be more innovative
than big companies?

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.880
Small companies that
are under-resourced

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.020
can't necessarily get
the best and brightest.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.270
They're going to go out
of business any day,

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.310
and yet they come up
with brilliant ideas.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.990
And big companies
full of resources,

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.810
full of amazing people buy
the little companies that

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.020
come up with the good ideas.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.770
That's usually how big
companies innovate.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.880
They buy the smaller ones.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.840
Why is that?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.191
Why is it that the
most-resourced companies

00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:37.690
tend not to?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.270
And I think it's a
question of reality,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.760
and what I mean by that
is small companies,

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:49.390
their vision is more
distant than their grasp.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.250
They have delusions of grandeur.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.090
We're going to change the world,
change industries, reinvent

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.300
this, reinvent that.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.490
We have no money and
no people, but so what?

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.315
My point is the grasp is
shorter than the vision.

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:03.940
And I think what happens is, as
companies get bigger and bigger

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.850
and bigger, with more and more
resources, what they start

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.780
to do is one of two things.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.190
Either their visions become
well within their grasp

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.147
and they don't
readjust the vision,

00:34:14.147 --> 00:34:15.730
or they actually
bring the vision back

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.610
to put within their grasps.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.024
Make things very achievable--
difficult, but achievable.

00:34:22.024 --> 00:34:23.440
For a vision to
truly be a vision,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.783
it should feel unachievable.

00:34:24.783 --> 00:34:26.949
When a small business gets
together and says, here's

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.510
our vision, everybody
goes like this.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.697
How are we going to do that?

00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:35.280
In big business,
see, here's a vision.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.699
Everybody goes, all
right, no, yeah, got it.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:38.815
We'll do a back plan.

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:40.300
We got that.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.360
And I firmly believe
that innovation

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.650
is born out of the struggle.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.050
Innovation is born out
of the resourcefulness

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.150
that you are forced
to figure out

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.050
because, literally, the vision
is way beyond your grasp.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.600
Regardless of how many
resources you have,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.046
it should always feel
overwhelming and impossible.

00:34:59.046 --> 00:35:00.920
Take a group of people
with tons of resources

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.740
to give the vision,
they're going to go, OK.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.360
So I think that's part of it.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.443
I think that's part of it.

00:35:09.443 --> 00:35:12.440
So you've been at it for five
years, you've achieved a lot.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.150
Congratulations.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.260
So the question is, well, was
the vision not big enough,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.110
or you want more
piece of the pie?

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.920
Or why not just
stay in the game?

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.090
We have an obsession in America
with growth, not stability--

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:26.650
size.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.650
We want size and growth.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.969
We have lists of fastest
growing companies.

00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:31.760
We have Fortune lists
of biggest companies.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.220
We don't have lists of
most stable companies--

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.770
Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Lehman
Brothers, big companies--

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.980
Arthur Andersen, Circuit City.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.070
Remember that one?

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.630
Right Poof, not like whoo--

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.860
like pfft.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.994
Big, not stable.

00:35:51.994 --> 00:35:53.410
Fast growth-- we
love fast growth.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.680
We put people's pictures
on covers of magazines

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.120
and say, look, it's Groupon.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.230
Remember that one?

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.240
Does anyone really care
about Groupon anymore?

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.350
It was like copy Groupon.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.130
They're the future-- for now.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.720
And that's the point.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.610
For some reason, we're
obsessed with growth.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.943
And again, it goes back to this.

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:16.210
Growth to what end?

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.720
Here's how I understand growth.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.297
So you see your neighbor
packing up his car

00:36:22.297 --> 00:36:24.130
across the street from
me, and you say, hey,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:24.963
where are you going?

00:36:24.963 --> 00:36:26.830
And he says, vacation.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.170
Cool, where are you going?

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.410
He says, vacation.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:34.120
You go, awesome;
where are you going?

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.417
He says, vacation.

00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:39.250
So you go, well, how
you going to get there?

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.500
He says, I'm going
to take Route 95,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.760
and my goal is to drive
150 miles an hour.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.070
That's the same as growth.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.236
Why does your company exist?

00:36:47.236 --> 00:36:47.900
Growth.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.650
Awesome-- to what end?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.260
Well, we're a business to grow.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.430
Love it.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.760
How are you going to do it?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.991
Growth.

00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:55.490
Good.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.864
What route are
you going to take?

00:36:56.864 --> 00:36:59.730
Our goal is to increase top
line revenues by 20% every year,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.070
duh.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.600
To what end?

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.800
And so you get on vacation.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.612
Everybody is so
proud of themselves

00:37:05.612 --> 00:37:07.070
and smacking each
other on the back

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.750
because we drove 150 miles.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:09.770
We drove 180 miles.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.640
We're above goal.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.590
In what direction?

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.791
And we see opportunities
that actually aren't good.

00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.790
Somebody offers you a
ride in their private jet.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.331
You're like, ooh,
quicker than a car.

00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:21.710
Yes, except they're flying
in that direction, as opposed

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.180
to somebody who
knows their vision.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.696
I want to get to California.

00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:25.820
How you going to get there?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.732
Route 95.

00:37:26.732 --> 00:37:27.440
What's your goal?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.764
150 miles a day.

00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:31.430
And what happens if you drive 30
miles a day towards California?

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.940
That's OK.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.470
We're going to find out how
we can take better routes.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.310
Well, what if the
highway is blocked?

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.480
So you're forced to
go slower, but it's OK

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.090
because you know the
direction you're going in,

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.760
as opposed to firing off
in all other directions.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.843
And when somebody says,
hey, I, got a private jet,

00:37:45.843 --> 00:37:47.840
you want to fly, you
go, where are you going?

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.500
Calgary.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.752
Not interested,
thank you very much.

00:37:51.752 --> 00:37:52.460
You get my point.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.543
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:37:53.543 --> 00:37:54.506
That's very helpful.

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:55.047
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:55.047 --> 00:37:57.800
I just wondered about Apple.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.540
You talked about how Apple
beat Microsoft at the time.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.390
What's your observation
of Apple now

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.540
they're under the leader
Tim Cook after Steve Jobs?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.290
What value do you observe,
or do you still believe

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.622
that they have--

00:38:13.622 --> 00:38:15.080
SIMON SINEK: I
figure that if I let

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.280
you keep talking I don't have
to answer, which is good.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:25.120
So I tend not to
comment on companies--

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.480
wait for it-- where the founder
leaders are still there.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.420
Because people ask me
about these companies,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.960
and the answer is, we don't
really know the kind of culture

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.440
they've built until the
founder leaders have left.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.890
Because the founder leaders
tend to be the personifications

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.230
of the cause, of the values.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.540
And you can really
test the quality

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.390
of the culture of a company
and its stick-with-itness

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.900
and whether they truly have
imbued into the company

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.460
the values first after
the founder goes.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.600
So Wal-Mart is a great example.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.080
Wal-Mart used to be an
amazing company that

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.210
was all about this, and
then Sam Walton died.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.490
And the first CEO took over.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.907
Grew up with Sam, so
he kind of got it.

00:39:10.907 --> 00:39:12.990
And then all of a sudden
it started to go sideways

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.000
because they became
preoccupied with this

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.450
and they completely
forgot about that.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.410
You see their tagline?

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.170
Their tagline is save
money, better life.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.040
That's actually in
the wrong order.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.770
It should be better
life, save money.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.900
That would be a
values-based decision--

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.340
one of the pieces.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.710
So we see this all the time.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.020
Bill Gates left, and so
Microsoft went a little bit

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.850
sideways.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:40.750
Then to Ballmer, but Ballmer was
obsessed with this over this.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:46.680
So this happens also very often
when CEOs leave and replace

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.080
themselves with
their CFO or COO,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.960
because we have a flawed
hierarchy in business.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.230
We think CFO or COO
is the number two job,

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.080
and many CFOs or
COOs see themselves

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.139
as in line for the big job.

00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:01.680
The problem is, it's
not one and two;

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.830
it's one and A. They're
completely separate skill sets.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.390
And it's the
combination-- the mom

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.330
and the dad, the visionary
and the operator,

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.647
the person who sees
far and the person who

00:40:11.647 --> 00:40:13.230
knows how to get
there, the person who

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.610
sees the forest, who
lives above the trees,

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.960
and the person who's
down in the trenches

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.251
trying to figure out their
way through the trees-- it's

00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:21.540
that magical combination
that makes the business grow.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.760
But too often, we
take a visionary

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.220
and we replace them
with an operator.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.480
It happens all the time.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.910
Mike Dell left Dell.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.175
Mike Dell had to come back.

00:40:30.175 --> 00:40:32.550
Howard Schultz left Starbucks,
replaced himself by a COO.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.750
Howard Schultz had to come back.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.079
Bill Gates left.

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:38.620
And there was sort of talk of
Bill coming back after Ballmer.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.570
Satya was a little
more like Bill.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.690
So Tim Cook was the COO.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.119
So the problem is we
judge COOs based on what

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.160
they've done in the past.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.380
We judge CEOs, a good
visionary, based on how far they

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.220
can see in the future.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.370
And if you look at the
titles that we give people--

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.840
CMO, CIO, CTO, CEO, CFO--

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.510
in their title it says what
their responsibility is.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.780
Finance, operations, marketing.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.350
What the hell is an executive?

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.490
Chief executive officer.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.500
It's the only job that literally
doesn't have job specs,

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.690
and it doesn't get away.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:20.480
It should be CVO, chief
visionary officer.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.150
Because like I said, we
judge somebody like that

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.211
by how far in the
future they can see,

00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:26.960
and we want them to
work with somebody who

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.230
knows how to get them there.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.280
These things work
together, not separately.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.790
So I have concerns
about Apple, because it

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.790
is run by an operator--
good guy, smart guy who

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.140
believes in the vision.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.810
But the problem is
he sees problems

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.910
more than he sees future.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.520
These people are
huge risk takers.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.550
These people are
calculated risk takers.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.321
And so I think we're
starting to see cracks.

00:41:52.321 --> 00:41:53.570
Does it mean the end of Apple?

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.650
No.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.500
But we're starting to
see some of the cracks.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.420
They don't seem to be
leading markets anymore.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.140
They don't seem to be defining
product categories anymore.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.980
In fact, a few times
they've been the followers.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.725
So I make this little joke,
like, your phone doesn't work.

00:42:11.725 --> 00:42:13.350
You're like, eh, ever
since Steve died.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:13.850
You know?

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.720
There's politics playing
out in the company.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.167
It's weirdness.

00:42:21.167 --> 00:42:22.000
Is the end of Apple?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.708
I don't think so.

00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:26.111
Of course not, but definitely
it makes me interested.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.795
AUDIENCE: I'm a weird 21st
century case of somebody

00:42:32.795 --> 00:42:36.480
for whom Google is my first
and only full-time employer.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.800
And we often-- I
work in marketing--

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.890
sort of copy and paste the
company's value statements

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.130
into briefs that we
write in a way that

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.104
feels very mechanical
and not really like,

00:42:48.104 --> 00:42:49.520
to your earlier
point, I came here

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.830
and I signed up to
work for this value.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:55.040
Can you speak to, at
the value setting stage,

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.110
what are the kinds
of questions that you

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:59.034
ask when you're
sitting down to think

00:42:59.034 --> 00:43:00.200
what do we really stand for?

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.510
How do I put a few words
to these larger ideas?

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.480
SIMON SINEK: I'll
wax philosophical.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.480
There's no sort of answer.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.110
So we're obsessed in our
business with the movement.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.960
We obsess about the movement.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.600
We never ask ourselves--
literally it never comes up--

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.920
is that good for the company?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.300
It just doesn't come up.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.190
It does secondarily,
but we want to know

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.120
if a decision we're
about to make,

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.610
a product we're about
to develop, something

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:29.490
we're about to sell--

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.620
whatever it is, we always say,
is it good for the movement?

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.300
So what it does is
it forces everybody

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.630
to put first the movement,
this vision that we all

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.670
share in our organization.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.862
We believe, we imagine
a world in which

00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:44.320
the vast majority
of people wake up

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.585
every single morning inspired
to go to work, feel safe

00:43:46.585 --> 00:43:48.460
when they're there, and
return home fulfilled

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.520
at the end of the day.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.240
Our goal is to get
closer to that,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.610
stand as a beacon that
points towards that,

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.090
and offers the tools we can and
inspire others to help us build

00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.920
tools to get to that world.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.500
That's what we mean
by the movement,

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.810
and we're obsessed with it.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.240
Even when we talk
about our P&amp;L, we

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.440
don't actually have a line
on our P&amp;L that says profit.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.521
It says freedom.

00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:14.770
Because none of us are
motivated by the abstract thing

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.120
called profit.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.860
We absolutely are
motivated by freedom.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.390
Because the more
money we make, it

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.520
allows us to stay in the game--

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.182
fuel for the drive.

00:44:23.182 --> 00:44:24.640
It allows us to
get our message out

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.080
to a bigger, broader audience.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.640
It allows us to
say yes to things

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.040
that don't pay and say
no to things that do pay,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.490
but we don't like the people
who are calling us up.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.190
It gives us discretion to give
money away to people we like,

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.050
and it gives us
opportunities that

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.922
give benefits to the question
before and give freedom.

00:44:41.922 --> 00:44:44.380
So you're damn right I want to
have more freedom this month

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.370
than I had last month.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.030
Right So I think it comes from
an obsession from leadership--

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.782
and not just me, at all levels.

00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:52.240
And sometimes that
leadership comes

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.460
from bottom up, where
we catch each other

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.870
and we remind each other.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:59.410
Because it is tempting
to put all this first,

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.180
because we can
demonstrate and measure

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.030
how we can improve or
draw on some metric?

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:06.480
And the question I
ask is, to what end?

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.220
And I don't mean rationalizing.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.560
I mean, explain to me in hard
words how this advances that,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.650
not some back-pedalling, which
is very often what happens--

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.810
and so clearly that
everybody else in the room

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.080
is going, mhm, not
whatever, if you say that.

00:45:26.051 --> 00:45:27.800
That's the funny thing
about these things.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.320
We all know what the
right thing to do is,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.620
but we like to
rationalize sometimes.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.560
So I think there has to be
an obsession with the cause

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.912
to advance the cause.

00:45:37.912 --> 00:45:39.620
And it doesn't have
to be the top person.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.330
It can be somebody
who signed up for it.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.580
Guys, guys, guys, remember
why we all signed up for this?

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.930
It's like the military example.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.150
Everybody has the same
flag on their shoulder.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.465
And if you're in the Marines,
Army, Air Force, or Navy,

00:45:52.465 --> 00:45:53.840
when you're in a
combat situation

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.860
the uniform disappears.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.440
The only thing that matters
is this and each other.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.100
We all signed up
for the same thing.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.300
Do you believe in it, or
do you not believe in it?

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.057
Do you want to advance
this cause or not?

00:46:02.057 --> 00:46:04.140
Do you care about changing
the way the world works

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.426
and making it into something
better, or do you not?

00:46:06.426 --> 00:46:09.050
What can we do in our sphere of
influence-- marketing, product,

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.650
whatever?

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.160
What can we do in our
sphere of influence?

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.020
What little bit can we do?

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.561
What piece of the
jigsaw puzzle do we

00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:16.430
have to put down to help build
the picture that's on the box?

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:20.090
But somebody has to be pointing
to the picture on the box,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.740
and that's the job of the
leader, whether they have rank

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.798
or not.

00:46:25.798 --> 00:46:27.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.357
AUDIENCE: So I
manage a team here.

00:46:30.357 --> 00:46:31.190
I enjoyed your talk.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.231
SIMON SINEK: Lead a team.

00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:33.384
Nobody wants to be managed.

00:46:33.384 --> 00:46:34.300
People want to be led.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:34.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.330
Very helpful.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.960
I've got a group
of finite players

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.425
from a personal situation and
definitely infinite players.

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:42.690
So they don't need more money.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.898
They're here for the purpose.

00:46:43.898 --> 00:46:45.550
It's wonderful.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.530
How do I get a team
dynamic, and how do I

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.920
get the infinite players
aligned on the vision?

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.500
They view part of their role
here as to set that mission?

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.440
SIMON SINEK: So there is vision
at the Google or Alphabet

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.650
level.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.780
And all of the companies
within Alphabet

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:12.930
should be working in cones
to advance the bigger vision.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.750
And within that, there
should be nested-wise,

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.960
we would call it, that advance,
whatever-- it all goes up.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:27.430
So ideally, your question is,
what did they sign up for?

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.372
Do they believe
in the big vision?

00:47:29.372 --> 00:47:30.580
And can they help advance it?

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.340
And I love that
they're big thinkers,

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.560
and you want to combine big
thinkers with big doers--

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.970
good teams.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.620
I love that.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.510
What if, going, ooh,
I could do that--

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.672
somebody else goes,
I can do that.

00:47:42.672 --> 00:47:44.380
But if they see
themselves as the one who

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.213
has to come up with the
vision, the question

00:47:46.213 --> 00:47:49.240
is, but at what point
do we start building?

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.250
This happens very often
with entrepreneurs--

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.670
and entrepreneurs are in
big businesses and not;

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.740
it has nothing to do with
owning a small business--

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.960
where it's shiny
object syndrome.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.630
Every shiny object is
something they want to pursue.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.090
And at some point you're
going to have to pick one.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.590
This is one of the
things I actually

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.180
admire in the Marine Corps.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.400
If you go to OCS at the
Marine Corps in Quantico

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.850
where they select
their officers,

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.535
they have something called the--

00:48:16.535 --> 00:48:20.560
I forgot the term they call it--
but it's basically a leadership

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.480
reaction course, the LRC.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.200
Basically it's a mini,
little obstacle courses,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.560
like 20 of them,
10 wet, 10 dry--

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.460
things like take these three
planks of different sizes

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.250
and lay them on the telephone
poles sticking out of the water

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.400
and get all of your
people and this ammunition

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.660
across the water.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.360
Figure it out.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.090
And they give them
a time constraint.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.506
And they have to run it twice,
when they assign the leader

00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:46.360
and when they don't.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.150
So one of the things that I'm
fascinated by in the LRC, which

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.270
is they are looking
for the leader

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.150
to take input from
everybody and then make

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.630
a decision on the strategy of
how we're going to get across.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.517
But they're also looking
to the followers,

00:49:00.517 --> 00:49:02.350
because what they find
is the best followers

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.600
take advice and then
make a decision.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.820
And the best followers
will give advice,

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.470
but once the
decision is made want

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.870
to see their
leaders successful--

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:18.027
and never, never work
to sabotage or stand

00:49:18.027 --> 00:49:20.110
on the sidelines because
they didn't get their way

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.170
or enjoy the
failure because they

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.640
say I told you so,
but work tirelessly

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.580
to see whatever direction
was set is highly successful.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.810
So I hope that's
happening here, too.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.580
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.746
SIMON SINEK: You're welcome.

00:49:32.746 --> 00:49:33.544
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:33.544 --> 00:49:34.210
SIMON SINEK: OK.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.560
It's very egalitarian.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.270
AUDIENCE: Hello, Simon.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.630
Thanks for the talk.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.920
My question is, so
what's the worst

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.845
thing happening in your life?

00:49:44.845 --> 00:49:48.004
I'm very interested
in your life story.

00:49:48.004 --> 00:49:49.920
SIMON SINEK: With regards
to what-- my career?

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.130
My family?

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.335
AUDIENCE: Your career
or your life in general.

00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:02.190
SIMON SINEK: I mean,
I stubbed my toe.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:05.190
That was pretty bad.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.470
So my whole journey,
this whole why thing,

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.410
was born out of pain.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.540
I owned a small
marketing business

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.935
and I had lost my
love for my work,

00:50:14.935 --> 00:50:17.310
and people gave me stupid
advice, like, do what you love,

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.430
follow your passion.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.970
What am I supposed
to do with that?

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.011
I'm doing the same thing.

00:50:22.011 --> 00:50:23.070
I don't love it anymore.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.110
And it was a very,
very dark place for me,

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.000
where I spent all of
my energy pretending

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.333
that I was happier, more
successful, and more in control

00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:30.240
than I felt.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.330
I was lying, hiding, and
faking every day of my life.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.759
And it's debilitating,
quite frankly.

00:50:35.759 --> 00:50:37.800
And it wasn't until a
friend came to me and said,

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.465
I'm worried about you, that gave
me this courage, the strength

00:50:40.465 --> 00:50:42.090
to admit that I was
struggling and then

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:43.530
to look to find a solution.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.820
And that journey pointed me
to the concept called "why."

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.570
I knew what I did and
I knew how I did it,

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:50.487
but I didn't know why.

00:50:50.487 --> 00:50:52.403
And it's the biology of
human decision making,

00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:54.540
and I realized there's
a major piece missing.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.570
And so the pain of
that, which I never

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.720
want to go back to but
I'm glad it happened,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.180
profoundly changed the
course of my life and career.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.210
And it's why I'm here now,
is because of the pain

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:07.689
that I went through back then.

00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:08.730
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.730
You opened up this framework
with very notable examples

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.110
from politics--

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.870
Cold War, Afghanistan, Vietnam.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.466
And then we transition
to business.

00:51:17.466 --> 00:51:18.840
And it makes sense
that you don't

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.850
have to focus on
the competition,

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.900
but politics, sometimes
you don't have that luxury,

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.660
especially if it's
a zero sum game

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.600
kind of geopolitical warfare.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.500
So if you are facing
opposition that leads with why,

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.140
has an infinity outlook,
and is intrinsically

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:37.050
motivated on that process,
how do you combat them?

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:43.170
Is it as simple as you
last longer, more infinity,

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:44.340
if there is such a thing?

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.250
Or is it a certain point where
to engage or not to engage

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.475
is a more important question?

00:51:48.475 --> 00:51:50.100
SIMON SINEK: It's
such a good question,

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.010
and the answer makes me
really uncomfortable.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.200
Because I'm looking at
what the criteria are,

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.930
actually going through
the necessities of what

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.890
elements are required to
play an infinite game.

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.580
That's what I'm
working on right now.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.140
And I'm uncomfortable
with the fact,

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.430
but I think the fact is you
have to have opposition.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.090
And one of the reasons
is having opposition,

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.890
having an adversary actually
allows for a game to exist,

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:15.640
because you can't play
a game by yourself.

00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:19.870
Even if you're playing
like Solitaire,

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.870
you're still playing
against the cards.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.980
There's an opposition.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.600
And so as uncomfortable as I
am, even in the old Apple days,

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.100
they still wanted
to take down IBM,

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.849
and then they want to
take down Microsoft.

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:34.360
But having an opposition
on the infinite level

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.360
makes it easier for us to know
what we stand for, because we

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.400
can see what we're against.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.920
So even if, in
the United States,

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.230
we struggle to put
our vision into terms,

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:48.700
we could look at the Soviet
Union and say, not that.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.337
But you still have
to have the "for."

00:52:50.337 --> 00:52:52.420
It's still going to be
there, because when players

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.420
drop out and are replaced, you
still stand for the same thing.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.910
Because if you're only against
whatever anybody else is,

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.330
then you're not going anywhere.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.120
So you still have
to have the for.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.710
So the Romans debated on
the floor of the Senate

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.300
for 50 years whether
they should just

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.110
flatten Carthage, which
was their not-that,

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.110
their Soviet Union.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:12.630
And they finally
decided to do it,

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:13.990
and they flattened Carthage.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.200
And then the Roman Empire
quickly went into decline.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.059
That's interesting to me.

00:53:19.059 --> 00:53:20.350
So I think you need opposition.

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:23.650
I think Apple needed Microsoft.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.030
George Lucas talks about this.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.655
He says, what do you
do when you become

00:53:26.655 --> 00:53:28.750
the thing that you hate--

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.780
the hated?

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.950
And I think an
adversary at this level,

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.100
another infinite
adversary, is important.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.180
Now, it's not like
more infinity.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.935
You have to keep
the game in play,

00:53:41.935 --> 00:53:43.810
because we never know
when it's going to end.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.226
Nobody could predict
that the Cold

00:53:45.226 --> 00:53:46.470
War would end when it ended.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.220
In fact, it caught
most people by surprise

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.511
when the Berlin Wall came down.

00:53:49.511 --> 00:53:51.400
It sort of happened
very quickly.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.190
The point is you have to
maintain a good business so you

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:56.680
can maintain resources, so
that you can stay in the game.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.180
You have to run
efficiently, but you

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:03.790
want to keep people
ideologically invested.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.019
You want to find allies.

00:54:06.019 --> 00:54:07.560
You want to be an
ideological export.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.800
You want to preach your
cause, preach you cause,

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.510
preach your cause, preach your
vision, preach your vision,

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.070
so that others will go, me, too.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.160
And you get allies, other
companies or partners,

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.139
or vendors, or employees who go,
I'm in, I believe, I'm loyal.

00:54:20.139 --> 00:54:21.430
I'm never going to abandon you.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.510
I'm in.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.245
So the adversary makes
all that very easy.

00:54:25.245 --> 00:54:26.620
The reason we
stand for something

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.970
is when one adversary drops out.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.850
While we're waiting for a new
adversary, which will show up,

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.470
we have to know
what we stand for.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.428
And if you really want
to get into geopolitics,

00:54:34.428 --> 00:54:35.950
that was the single
biggest mistake

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:38.530
that the United States
made after the Cold War--

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:39.580
we're really going here--

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.002
which is we declared
ourselves the winner.

00:54:42.002 --> 00:54:43.210
But that's not what happened.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:44.500
The other guy dropped out.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.770
And then we imposed our will on
the world for about 11 years.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:48.010
Turns out the rest of
the world didn't like it,

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:49.634
and new adversaries
started to show up.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.710
Soviet-style communism-- we were
both ideological exporters--

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.859
was replaced by
Islamic extremism.

00:55:00.859 --> 00:55:02.400
The nuclear power
of the Soviet Union

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.930
was replaced by North
Korea, Pakistan, maybe Iran.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.635
The economic tension
with the Soviets Union

00:55:12.635 --> 00:55:14.050
is replaced by China.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.310
The problem is now it's
diffuse, now it's separated,

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:19.110
but the Cold War
is alive and well--

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:21.330
Cold War 2.0.

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:25.290
And we're still battling life,
liberty, pursuit of happiness.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:29.340
It's more complicated now,
but we foolishly gave up

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.669
what we stood for for a while.

00:55:30.669 --> 00:55:31.710
So I think you need both.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:33.126
And I'm uncomfortable
by the fact,

00:55:33.126 --> 00:55:34.530
but I think you
need adversaries.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.830
You need to have a not-that.

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.020
We're clear what we
stand for because we know

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.622
we don't ever want to be that.

00:55:43.622 --> 00:55:45.330
Thanks very much for
your time, everyone.

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:45.930
Appreciate it.

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.130
Thank you.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.980
