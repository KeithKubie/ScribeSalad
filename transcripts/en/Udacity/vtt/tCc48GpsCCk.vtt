00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.010
So to see the impact of virtual
to physical translation and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.340
performance let's do a quiz about that.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.300
In a processor the data single cycle to
compute a virtual address for a load or

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.740
store instruction.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.730
Needs one cycle to access
the cache on a hit.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.700
Takes 10 cycles to access memory.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.358
For example when we have a cache miss.

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:25.170
Has a 90% hit rate for
data it is trying to accesses.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.870
And the page table entries it's going to
need to access cannot be in the cache,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.250
so we need to access memory directly for
them.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.270
So how many cycles do we need for

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.690
our load instructions such as this, if
we are using a three level page table?
