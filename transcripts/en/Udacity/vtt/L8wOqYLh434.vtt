00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we're almost there. We've defined the problem.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've defined how the game works,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we're ready to write the optimal strategy--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the best possible strategy for Pig, and I'll let you finish it off.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We'll call this function "max_wins"--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the strategy function that maximizes the number of wins--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
--at least the number of expected wins--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and go ahead and write your code there,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and you can write it in terms of the functions we've defined above

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and in terms of a call to best action.
