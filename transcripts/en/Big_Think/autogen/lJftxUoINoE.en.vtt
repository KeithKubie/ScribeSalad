dead it was a very promising way to
 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.350
dead it was a very promising way to
think about this solution for a

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360
think about this solution for a
 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.090

that kind of piqued my curiosity about
 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.610
that kind of piqued my curiosity about
it and then I started looking at online

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620

registering myself and looking at other
people and then I said let me ask some

people and then I said let me ask some
 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.670
people and then I said let me ask some
of my friends to enroll so I didn't ask

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680
of my friends to enroll so I didn't ask
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.049
of my friends to enroll so I didn't ask
them to really enroll I just took the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059
them to really enroll I just took the
 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.030
them to really enroll I just took the
profile sheets and I asked people could

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040
profile sheets and I asked people could
 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.799
profile sheets and I asked people could
you fill those out but without your name

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809
you fill those out but without your name
 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.350
you fill those out but without your name
and I took people that I liked more and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360
and I took people that I liked more and
 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.420
and I took people that I liked more and
I liked less and I took your profile I

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430
I liked less and I took your profile I
 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.950
I liked less and I took your profile I
tried to figure out could I tell the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960
tried to figure out could I tell the
 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.139
tried to figure out could I tell the
difference you know and imagine you did

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149
difference you know and imagine you did
 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.029
difference you know and imagine you did
this imagine you went to 50 people you

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039
this imagine you went to 50 people you
 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.800
this imagine you went to 50 people you

really like in 50 people you only like
so-so and you ask all of them to fill

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210
so-so and you ask all of them to fill
 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.730
so-so and you ask all of them to fill
this profile then you took these hundred

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
this profile then you took these hundred
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.980
this profile then you took these hundred
profiles and you try to sort them out in

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990
profiles and you try to sort them out in
 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.140
profiles and you try to sort them out in
two piles terms that were terrible at

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150
two piles terms that were terrible at
 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.870
two piles terms that were terrible at
this right so this is kind of an initial

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
this right so this is kind of an initial
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.670
this right so this is kind of an initial
observation is that something is going

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680
observation is that something is going
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.370
observation is that something is going
wrong in this in this market and then

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
wrong in this in this market and then
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.770
wrong in this in this market and then
went a step further did some studies

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780
went a step further did some studies
 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.390
went a step further did some studies
with online daters about how much they

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400
with online daters about how much they
 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.950
with online daters about how much they
enjoyed it and what they were getting

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
enjoyed it and what they were getting
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.010
enjoyed it and what they were getting
from it until the final stage we I

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020
from it until the final stage we I
 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.810
from it until the final stage we I
figure out I thought I knew what was

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820
figure out I thought I knew what was
 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.480
figure out I thought I knew what was
going on which is that online dating

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490
going on which is that online dating
 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.850
going on which is that online dating
site assume that people are easy to

site assume that people are easy to
 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.789
site assume that people are easy to
describe on searchable attributes they

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799
describe on searchable attributes they
 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.170

think that we're like digital cameras

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180
think that we're like digital cameras
 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.359

that you can describe somebody by their

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369
that you can describe somebody by their
 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.890
that you can describe somebody by their
height and weight and political

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900
height and weight and political
 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.109
height and weight and political
affiliation and so on but it turns out

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
affiliation and so on but it turns out
 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.940
affiliation and so on but it turns out
people are much more like wine that when

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
people are much more like wine that when
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649
people are much more like wine that when
you taste the wine you could describe it

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
you taste the wine you could describe it
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.120
you taste the wine you could describe it
but it's not a very useful description

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
but it's not a very useful description
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.219
but it's not a very useful description
but you know if you like it or don't

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
but you know if you like it or don't
 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.370
but you know if you like it or don't
it's the complexity and the completeness

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380
it's the complexity and the completeness
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.350
it's the complexity and the completeness
of the experience it tells you if you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
of the experience it tells you if you
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.569
of the experience it tells you if you
like a person or not and this is

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579
like a person or not and this is
 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.160
like a person or not and this is
breaking into attributes turns out not

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
breaking into attributes turns out not
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.080
breaking into attributes turns out not
to be very informative so in the last

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
to be very informative so in the last
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.090
to be very informative so in the last
stage of this process we created a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
stage of this process we created a
 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.830
stage of this process we created a
different website and that different

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
different website and that different
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.170
different website and that different
website allow people to experience other

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
website allow people to experience other
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.569
website allow people to experience other
people without all of these attributes

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579
people without all of these attributes
 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.650
people without all of these attributes
and we show that this is a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
and we show that this is a
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.420
and we show that this is a
really much better and would lead to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
really much better and would lead to
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.060
really much better and would lead to
much more much high probability of going

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
much more much high probability of going
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.190
much more much high probability of going
on a second on the real date afterwards

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
on a second on the real date afterwards
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.870
on a second on the real date afterwards
so so it kind of goes from an

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
so so it kind of goes from an
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.570
so so it kind of goes from an
observation to a little study to a bit

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580
observation to a little study to a bit
 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580
observation to a little study to a bit
more details and finally proposing some

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
more details and finally proposing some
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.200
more details and finally proposing some
kind of solution of something that I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210
kind of solution of something that I
 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.030
kind of solution of something that I
think would actually work better so the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040
think would actually work better so the
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.000
think would actually work better so the
site basically looks at real days and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
site basically looks at real days and
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.010
site basically looks at real days and
think about what real dates are they are

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020
think about what real dates are they are
 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.110
think about what real dates are they are
not about sitting in the room and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
not about sitting in the room and
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.390
not about sitting in the room and
interviewing each other about question

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400
interviewing each other about question
 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.310
interviewing each other about question
they're often about experiencing

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320
they're often about experiencing
 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.770
they're often about experiencing
something together in the real world and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780
something together in the real world and
 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.090
something together in the real world and
I think it's because if you and I went

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100
I think it's because if you and I went
 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000
I think it's because if you and I went
out and we went somewhere I would look

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010
out and we went somewhere I would look
 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.830
out and we went somewhere I would look
at how you react to the outside world

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840
at how you react to the outside world
 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.990
at how you react to the outside world

people what do you do in the restaurant
and through all these kind of non

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
and through all these kind of non
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.590
and through all these kind of non
explicit aspects I will learn something

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600

virtual space in which you could explore
 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.260
virtual space in which you could explore
it and you could see lots of stuff there

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270
it and you could see lots of stuff there
 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.300

and you could go and when you came to
another little avatar you could start

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209
another little avatar you could start
 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.060
another little avatar you could start
chatting and you would chat about

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070
chatting and you would chat about
 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.780
chatting and you would chat about
something

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790
something
 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.400
something
it wasn't about interviewing when you

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
it wasn't about interviewing when you
 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.260
it wasn't about interviewing when you
went to school and what's your religion

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270
went to school and what's your religion
 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.940
went to school and what's your religion
it was about talking about something

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950
it was about talking about something
 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.560
it was about talking about something
else and it turns out it gave people

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570
else and it turns out it gave people
 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.120
else and it turns out it gave people
much more information about each other

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130
much more information about each other
 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.860
much more information about each other
and they were much more likely to want

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
and they were much more likely to want
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.780
and they were much more likely to want
to meet each other for a first date and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
to meet each other for a first date and
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.870
to meet each other for a first date and
for for a second date

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
 
 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.180
 
so so I think that online dating is an

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
so so I think that online dating is an
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.250
so so I think that online dating is an
incredibly unsatisfying experience in

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
incredibly unsatisfying experience in
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.890
incredibly unsatisfying experience in
fact when we do surveys to understand

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900
fact when we do surveys to understand
 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.140
fact when we do surveys to understand
what people do they the basic trade-off

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
what people do they the basic trade-off
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.810
what people do they the basic trade-off
is for each six hours of searching for

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
is for each six hours of searching for
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.480
is for each six hours of searching for
people and emailing them you get one cup

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490
people and emailing them you get one cup
 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.430
people and emailing them you get one cup
of coffee and it's not as if people

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440
of coffee and it's not as if people
 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.500
of coffee and it's not as if people
enjoy online dating it's not as if they

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
enjoy online dating it's not as if they
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.260
enjoy online dating it's not as if they
have fun searching people in writing

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270
have fun searching people in writing
 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.220
have fun searching people in writing
blurbs for them

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230
blurbs for them
 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.870
blurbs for them
I mean imagine that you basically to

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
I mean imagine that you basically to
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.480
I mean imagine that you basically to
drive six hours three hours each way to

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
drive six hours three hours each way to
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.040
drive six hours three hours each way to
have coffee with somebody and you know

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050
have coffee with somebody and you know
 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.900
have coffee with somebody and you know
coffee usually ends up with just coffee

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
coffee usually ends up with just coffee
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.700
coffee usually ends up with just coffee
it's an incredibly unsatisfying

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710
it's an incredibly unsatisfying
 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.130
it's an incredibly unsatisfying
experience so I I think it's a really

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140
experience so I I think it's a really
 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.400
experience so I I think it's a really
bad it's a really bad system on top of

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
bad it's a really bad system on top of
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.310
bad it's a really bad system on top of
that there's another thing is which

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320
that there's another thing is which
 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.720
that there's another thing is which
imagine I gave you these search criteria

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730
imagine I gave you these search criteria
 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.000
imagine I gave you these search criteria
which asked you to search by height and

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
which asked you to search by height and
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.470
which asked you to search by height and
weight and income and all of those

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
weight and income and all of those
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.240
weight and income and all of those
things you're going to use it that's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250
things you're going to use it that's
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.500
things you're going to use it that's
what I give you to search you're going

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510
what I give you to search you're going
 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.820
what I give you to search you're going
to use it there's a million people out

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830
to use it there's a million people out
 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.040
to use it there's a million people out
there you want to limit them to 3,000

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050
there you want to limit them to 3,000
 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.960
there you want to limit them to 3,000
that's what we're going to that's what

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970
that's what we're going to that's what
 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.610
that's what we're going to that's what
you're going to use and because of that

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620
you're going to use and because of that
 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.110
you're going to use and because of that
I think actually people become much more

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120
I think actually people become much more
 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.450
I think actually people become much more
superficial than we think they are so

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460
superficial than we think they are so
 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.520
superficial than we think they are so
here's an example it turns out women

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
here's an example it turns out women
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.850

really care about men's height I'm five
nine if I want it to be as attractive as

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410
nine if I want it to be as attractive as
 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.730
nine if I want it to be as attractive as
somebody who is 510 right another inch I

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740
somebody who is 510 right another inch I
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.950
somebody who is 510 right another inch I
would have to make about thirty five

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
would have to make about thirty five
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.270
would have to make about thirty five
forty thousand dollars more a year

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280
forty thousand dollars more a year
 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.510
forty thousand dollars more a year
that's a lot of money for one inch and

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520
that's a lot of money for one inch and
 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.490
that's a lot of money for one inch and
at the same time it turns out that men

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500
at the same time it turns out that men
 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.950
at the same time it turns out that men
care a lot about women's BMI in fact

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
care a lot about women's BMI in fact
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.510
care a lot about women's BMI in fact
they want women to be slightly on the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
they want women to be slightly on the
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.010
they want women to be slightly on the
wreck circuit like eighteen and a half

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020
wreck circuit like eighteen and a half
 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.870
wreck circuit like eighteen and a half
and you look at women's attractiveness

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880
and you look at women's attractiveness
 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.510
and you look at women's attractiveness
it goes really up it low BMI and really

it goes really up it low BMI and really
 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.600
it goes really up it low BMI and really
drops below that now people online look

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610
drops below that now people online look
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.820
drops below that now people online look
incredibly superficial they look at hair

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830
incredibly superficial they look at hair
 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.380
incredibly superficial they look at hair
color and they look at height and they

color and they look at height and they
 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.600
color and they look at height and they
look at income and that's basically it

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610
look at income and that's basically it
 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.150
look at income and that's basically it
an attractiveness of course and you can

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160
an attractiveness of course and you can
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.040
an attractiveness of course and you can
ask it because that's all people care

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050
ask it because that's all people care
 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.020
ask it because that's all people care
about or is that because that's what the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030
about or is that because that's what the
 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.450
about or is that because that's what the
system is giving them to search for and

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
system is giving them to search for and
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.220
system is giving them to search for and
I think it's because of combination

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230
I think it's because of combination
 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.530
I think it's because of combination
right sure we are so professional we do

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540
right sure we are so professional we do
 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.510
right sure we are so professional we do
care about attractiveness and in height

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520
care about attractiveness and in height
 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.650
care about attractiveness and in height
and income and these are these are

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660
and income and these are these are
 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.470
and income and these are these are
features for us but I think they're

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480
features for us but I think they're
 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.880
features for us but I think they're
exaggerated by the way the system is

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890
exaggerated by the way the system is
 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.740
exaggerated by the way the system is
created

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750

imagine you were looking for something

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470
imagine you were looking for something
 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.220
imagine you were looking for something
else imagine you were looking for

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230
else imagine you were looking for
 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.230
else imagine you were looking for
digital cameras and imagine that I only

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
digital cameras and imagine that I only
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.469
digital cameras and imagine that I only
allow you to search on megapixels and

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479
allow you to search on megapixels and
 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.380
allow you to search on megapixels and
the f-stop for the lens right these

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390
the f-stop for the lens right these
 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.730
the f-stop for the lens right these
things will become incredibly

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740
things will become incredibly
 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.490
things will become incredibly
right and if I drop some things from the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500
right and if I drop some things from the
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.810
right and if I drop some things from the
search they will become as if they're

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820
search they will become as if they're
 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.760
search they will become as if they're
not important or much less important so

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
not important or much less important so
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.540
not important or much less important so
I think part of the problem is that the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
I think part of the problem is that the
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.190
I think part of the problem is that the
systems don't give us the right

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.350
right I'm not the only guy in the world
okay so so it was kind of a very

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360
okay so so it was kind of a very
 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.300
okay so so it was kind of a very
difficult concept for me to think about

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
difficult concept for me to think about
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.970

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.640
my space all of the time and I was
trying to understand how these social

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.650
trying to understand how these social
 

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.440

dance happen and how we find our place
 

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.269
dance happen and how we find our place
and I was really wondering about where

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279
and I was really wondering about where
 

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.130
and I was really wondering about where
would I find my own mate where would I

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.140
would I find my own mate where would I

fit in this in this scale and there's a

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720
fit in this in this scale and there's a
 

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.600
fit in this in this scale and there's a
lot of kind of a personal complexities

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.610
lot of kind of a personal complexities
 

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.170
lot of kind of a personal complexities
with it but eventually it led me to a

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.180
with it but eventually it led me to a
 

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.270
with it but eventually it led me to a
study and the study was really asking

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.280
study and the study was really asking
 

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.210
study and the study was really asking
the question of how do we make sense of

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:00.220
the question of how do we make sense of
 

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.640
the question of how do we make sense of
what we fit in there in the hierarchy

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:02.650
what we fit in there in the hierarchy
 

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.710
what we fit in there in the hierarchy
and they're basically kind of multiple

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720
and they're basically kind of multiple
 

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.390
and they're basically kind of multiple

people and you decide you rank them on a
 

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.470
people and you decide you rank them on a
scale from zero to ten about how

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480
scale from zero to ten about how
 

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.660
scale from zero to ten about how
attractive they are and then you see how

now the question is the people who are

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560
now the question is the people who are
 

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.230
now the question is the people who are
providing the rating they're people who

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240
providing the rating they're people who
 

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.120
providing the rating they're people who
are really attractive that are providing

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130
are really attractive that are providing

unattractive providing the rating and
 

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.980
unattractive providing the rating and
the first thing you can ask is do they

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:04.990
the first thing you can ask is do they
 

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.530
the first thing you can ask is do they
have different ratings are the people

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:07.540
have different ratings are the people
 

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.110
have different ratings are the people
who are inherently unattractive do they

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120
who are inherently unattractive do they
 

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.510
who are inherently unattractive do they
see beauty differently and the answer is

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:12.520
see beauty differently and the answer is
 

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.570
see beauty differently and the answer is
no we all see beauty in the same way the

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:15.580
no we all see beauty in the same way the
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.440

beauty now you could say so maybe they
 

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.660
beauty now you could say so maybe they
don't adjust at all maybe they don't

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:27.670

it's not just reading it's about also
thinking about the probability that you

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:47.500
thinking about the probability that you
 

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.519
thinking about the probability that you
will be accepted or turn down and it's

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:50.529
will be accepted or turn down and it's
 

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:53.460
will be accepted or turn down and it's
not so an embarrassing to be turned

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.470
not so an embarrassing to be turned
 

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.720
not so an embarrassing to be turned
online but it's still a little bit

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.730
online but it's still a little bit
 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.370
online but it's still a little bit
embarrassing so the question is the

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:56.380
embarrassing so the question is the
 

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.079
embarrassing so the question is the
people who are nine will they approach

00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:58.089
people who are nine will they approach
 

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.460
people who are nine will they approach
different people than the people who are

00:12:59.460 --> 00:12:59.470
different people than the people who are
 

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.650
different people than the people who are
four and the answer is absolutely yes

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:01.660
four and the answer is absolutely yes
 

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.540
four and the answer is absolutely yes
the people who are four basically

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.550
the people who are four basically
 

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.100
the people who are four basically
approach people who are four or five the

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.110
approach people who are four or five the
 

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.480
approach people who are four or five the
people who are nine approach people who

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.490
people who are nine approach people who
 

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.100
people who are nine approach people who
are nine or ten people are a little

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.110
are nine or ten people are a little
 

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.689
are nine or ten people are a little
optimistic they approach a little too

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:09.699
optimistic they approach a little too
 

00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:11.939
optimistic they approach a little too
high but they basically know the range

00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:11.949
high but they basically know the range
 

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:14.129
high but they basically know the range
so what happened is people know the

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:14.139
so what happened is people know the
 

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:15.449
so what happened is people know the
range they know where they are in the

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:15.459
range they know where they are in the
 

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.449
range they know where they are in the
social hierarchy but the same time they

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:18.459
social hierarchy but the same time they
 

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.129
social hierarchy but the same time they
see Beauty at the same thing so what

00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:20.139
see Beauty at the same thing so what
 

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.780
see Beauty at the same thing so what
happens so how people solve it do they

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:21.790
happens so how people solve it do they
 

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.360
happens so how people solve it do they
wake up every morning feeling bad or do

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.370
wake up every morning feeling bad or do
 

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.250
wake up every morning feeling bad or do
they solve it in some way so the last

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.260
they solve it in some way so the last
 

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.590
they solve it in some way so the last
step we did a speed-dating event we got

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600
step we did a speed-dating event we got
 

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.420
step we did a speed-dating event we got
people to do a speed-dating event and we

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:30.430
people to do a speed-dating event and we
 

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.400
people to do a speed-dating event and we
asked them to rate other people are lots

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.410
asked them to rate other people are lots
 

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.410
asked them to rate other people are lots
of attributes not just attractiveness

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.420
of attributes not just attractiveness
 

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.630
of attributes not just attractiveness
but all kinds of other things and what

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:36.640
but all kinds of other things and what
 

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.130
but all kinds of other things and what
we saw was the people who were very

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:38.140
we saw was the people who were very
 

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.800
we saw was the people who were very
attractive

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:39.810
attractive
 

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.840
attractive
cared more about attractiveness this is

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:42.850
cared more about attractiveness this is
 

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.790
cared more about attractiveness this is
like one of the dominating criteria they

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800
like one of the dominating criteria they
 

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.439
like one of the dominating criteria they
want to date somebody who is attractive

00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:46.449
want to date somebody who is attractive
 

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:48.470
want to date somebody who is attractive
well the people who are unattractive

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480
well the people who are unattractive
 

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.610
well the people who are unattractive
basically say we don't care so much

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:50.620
basically say we don't care so much
 

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.889
basically say we don't care so much
about attractiveness we want people who

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:52.899
about attractiveness we want people who
 

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.870
about attractiveness we want people who
are kind and have a good sense of humor

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880
are kind and have a good sense of humor
 

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.639
are kind and have a good sense of humor
so what happened is that the way people

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:56.649
so what happened is that the way people
 

00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:59.790
so what happened is that the way people
adapt the people at the low end of the

00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800
adapt the people at the low end of the
 

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.090
adapt the people at the low end of the
scale is by changing their priorities

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:03.100
scale is by changing their priorities
 

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.430
scale is by changing their priorities
and office and saying I want people with

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440
and office and saying I want people with
 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.460
and office and saying I want people with
different set of attributes I don't care

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:08.470
different set of attributes I don't care
 

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.960
different set of attributes I don't care
so much about beauty I want somebody

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:09.970
so much about beauty I want somebody
 

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.210
so much about beauty I want somebody
who's kind good-hearted with a good

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.220
who's kind good-hearted with a good
 

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.740
who's kind good-hearted with a good
sense of humor and that's actually the

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:13.750
sense of humor and that's actually the
 

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.240
sense of humor and that's actually the
story for the petition so that's the

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.250
story for the petition so that's the
 

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.850
story for the petition so that's the
story of how we are coming into a social

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:17.860
story of how we are coming into a social
 

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.280
story of how we are coming into a social
hierarchy in a certain place and based

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.290
hierarchy in a certain place and based
 

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.040
hierarchy in a certain place and based
on our circumstances come to understand

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.050
on our circumstances come to understand
 

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.840
on our circumstances come to understand
differently what we want and don't want

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:24.850
differently what we want and don't want
 

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.670
differently what we want and don't want
and how we view the world in a way that

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680
and how we view the world in a way that
 

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680
and how we view the world in a way that
is compatible with where we are in the

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:28.690
is compatible with where we are in the
 

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.389
is compatible with where we are in the
social hierarchy

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399
 
 

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.619
 
so I don't know if you've had the

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:33.629
so I don't know if you've had the
 

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:35.960
so I don't know if you've had the
experience of going to a Kia but I I go

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:35.970
experience of going to a Kia but I I go
 

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.369
experience of going to a Kia but I I go
from time to time and the last thing I

00:14:37.369 --> 00:14:37.379
from time to time and the last thing I
 

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:40.280
from time to time and the last thing I
did was I built a toy chest for my for

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:40.290
did was I built a toy chest for my for
 

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.439
did was I built a toy chest for my for
my kids and when I got home with this

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:42.449
my kids and when I got home with this
 

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:45.799
my kids and when I got home with this
box actually set of boxes and I start

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:45.809
box actually set of boxes and I start
 

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.199
box actually set of boxes and I start
assembling them for me the instructions

00:14:48.199 --> 00:14:48.209
assembling them for me the instructions
 

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:50.269
assembling them for me the instructions
were very unclear and I kept on screwing

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279
were very unclear and I kept on screwing
 

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.949
were very unclear and I kept on screwing
things and screwing them wrongly and had

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959
things and screwing them wrongly and had
 

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.480
things and screwing them wrongly and had
to disassemble and put it back together

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:53.490
to disassemble and put it back together
 

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.970
to disassemble and put it back together
and so on by the end of the day I I

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980
and so on by the end of the day I I
 

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.009
and so on by the end of the day I I
worked a lot it was not a particularly

00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019
worked a lot it was not a particularly
 

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:00.319
worked a lot it was not a particularly
beautiful piece of furniture but I was

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:00.329
beautiful piece of furniture but I was
 

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:02.480
beautiful piece of furniture but I was
actually quite attached to it I think

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.490
actually quite attached to it I think
 

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.100
actually quite attached to it I think
that's kind of the interesting idea is

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.110
that's kind of the interesting idea is
 

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.259
that's kind of the interesting idea is
that when you put a lot of yourself into

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:06.269
that when you put a lot of yourself into
 

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:08.989
that when you put a lot of yourself into
it some sweat and energy and anger never

00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:08.999
it some sweat and energy and anger never
 

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:11.989
it some sweat and energy and anger never
even frustration you end up loving the

00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:11.999
even frustration you end up loving the
 

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:15.980
even frustration you end up loving the
end product a bit more so we try to do

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:15.990
end product a bit more so we try to do
 

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.079
end product a bit more so we try to do
this with experiments and we got people

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.089
this with experiments and we got people
 

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:20.360
this with experiments and we got people
to build their Legos and origamis and

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.370
to build their Legos and origamis and
 

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.249
to build their Legos and origamis and
all kinds of things and the first thing

00:15:22.249 --> 00:15:22.259
all kinds of things and the first thing
 

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:23.420
all kinds of things and the first thing
we found was that if there was an

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:23.430
we found was that if there was an
 

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.280
we found was that if there was an
origami that you build in origami that

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.290
origami that you build in origami that
 

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.960
origami that you build in origami that
somebody else built you think that yours

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:26.970
somebody else built you think that yours
 

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.389
somebody else built you think that yours
is much much more beautiful not only is

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399
is much much more beautiful not only is
 

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.710
is much much more beautiful not only is
it more beautiful you're willing to pay

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720
it more beautiful you're willing to pay
 

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.170
it more beautiful you're willing to pay
much more for it right now the question

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180
much more for it right now the question
 

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.299
much more for it right now the question
is why you can imagine I build in

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:35.309
is why you can imagine I build in
 

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.460
is why you can imagine I build in
origami that is uniquely good for me and

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.470
origami that is uniquely good for me and
 

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.379
origami that is uniquely good for me and
you the other origami is not so it's

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:39.389
you the other origami is not so it's
 

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:41.600
you the other origami is not so it's
unique to me it's not about the fact

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:41.610
unique to me it's not about the fact
 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.329
unique to me it's not about the fact
that I kind of wrongly evaluated you

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339
that I kind of wrongly evaluated you
 

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:45.439
that I kind of wrongly evaluated you
just let me have some features that I

00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:45.449
just let me have some features that I
 

00:15:45.449 --> 00:15:48.230
just let me have some features that I
particularly like so we asked people to

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240
particularly like so we asked people to
 

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.910
particularly like so we asked people to
predict how other people would pay for

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920
predict how other people would pay for
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.949
predict how other people would pay for
it and it turns out people are really

00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959
it and it turns out people are really
 

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.960
it and it turns out people are really
wrong with it not only do we like more

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:53.970
wrong with it not only do we like more
 

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.579
wrong with it not only do we like more
the origami we make we think other

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:55.589
the origami we make we think other
 

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:58.040
the origami we make we think other
people would love them as well and you

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.050
people would love them as well and you
 

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.040
people would love them as well and you
can think about kids like this right I

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.050
can think about kids like this right I
 

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.689
can think about kids like this right I
have two wonderful kids I love them

00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699
have two wonderful kids I love them
 

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:05.239
have two wonderful kids I love them
dearly I think they're amazing when we

00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:05.249
dearly I think they're amazing when we
 

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:07.129
dearly I think they're amazing when we
go to a party and they dance or do

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139
go to a party and they dance or do
 

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:09.230
go to a party and they dance or do
something I can't believe that any of

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240
something I can't believe that any of
 

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.669
something I can't believe that any of
the parents would want to do anything

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:10.679
the parents would want to do anything
 

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.069
the parents would want to do anything
but look at my kids right and that's the

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079
but look at my kids right and that's the
 

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:14.749
but look at my kids right and that's the
issue right there my kids I think they

00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759
issue right there my kids I think they
 

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.090
issue right there my kids I think they
are wonderful but not only that I think

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100
are wonderful but not only that I think
 

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.530
are wonderful but not only that I think
that other people should see them as

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540
that other people should see them as
 

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.989
that other people should see them as
wonderful as I see them and the same

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:20.999
wonderful as I see them and the same
 

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:22.249
wonderful as I see them and the same
thing happening with origami or with

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:22.259
thing happening with origami or with
 

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:25.009
thing happening with origami or with
everything we make not only do we over

00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019
everything we make not only do we over
 

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:27.049
everything we make not only do we over
value it we think that everybody will

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:27.059
value it we think that everybody will
 

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:32.150
value it we think that everybody will
share our our perspective and and this

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160
share our our perspective and and this
 

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.970
share our our perspective and and this
of course creates both opportunities for

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980
of course creates both opportunities for
 

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.220
of course creates both opportunities for
better things and opportunities for

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.230
better things and opportunities for
 

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.559
better things and opportunities for
mistakes right so if you're if you're a

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:39.569
mistakes right so if you're if you're a
 

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:41.269
mistakes right so if you're if you're a
company and you can create things that

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279
company and you can create things that
 

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.009
company and you can create things that
people would actually put something of

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019
people would actually put something of
 

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:45.049
people would actually put something of
themselves into it and actually value it

00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:45.059
themselves into it and actually value it
 

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:45.740
themselves into it and actually value it
more

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:45.750
more
 

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.470
more
that's a great thing to do right there's

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480
that's a great thing to do right there's
 

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.240
that's a great thing to do right there's
lots of opportunities for tailoring and

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.250
lots of opportunities for tailoring and
 

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.749
lots of opportunities for tailoring and
custom-made and user design on on the

00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759
custom-made and user design on on the
 

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.699
custom-made and user design on on the
web it's also about cooking for yourself

00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:55.709
web it's also about cooking for yourself
 

00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:58.759
web it's also about cooking for yourself
and doing your own garden and fixing

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:58.769
and doing your own garden and fixing
 

00:16:58.769 --> 00:17:00.679
and doing your own garden and fixing
things yourself because we might not

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:00.689
things yourself because we might not
 

00:17:00.689 --> 00:17:02.090
things yourself because we might not
understand it if we do something

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100
understand it if we do something
 

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.590
understand it if we do something
ourselves we would like it more but the

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600
ourselves we would like it more but the
 

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.980
ourselves we would like it more but the
fact is we we likely would do the same

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:06.990
fact is we we likely would do the same
 

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.529
fact is we we likely would do the same
thing but of course there's the downside

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:09.539
thing but of course there's the downside
 

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:10.819
thing but of course there's the downside
and the downside is if we create

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:10.829
and the downside is if we create
 

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.860
and the downside is if we create
something we end up loving it perhaps

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:12.870
something we end up loving it perhaps
 

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.539
something we end up loving it perhaps
too much we don't see it an objective

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:14.549
too much we don't see it an objective
 

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:16.399
too much we don't see it an objective
way and as a consequence we can make

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:16.409
way and as a consequence we can make
 

00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:18.470
way and as a consequence we can make
mistakes as well that's actually a

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480
mistakes as well that's actually a
 

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.360
mistakes as well that's actually a
general comment about rationality and

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.370
general comment about rationality and
 

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.689
general comment about rationality and
irrationality rationality or

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:22.699
irrationality rationality or
 

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:24.770
irrationality rationality or
irrationality is not always bad it's not

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780
irrationality is not always bad it's not
 

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.809
irrationality is not always bad it's not
always that the irrational person is

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819
always that the irrational person is
 

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.730
always that the irrational person is
better than irrational it's a mixture

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740
better than irrational it's a mixture
 

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.890
better than irrational it's a mixture
right it's really wonderful that we can

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900
right it's really wonderful that we can
 

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.960
right it's really wonderful that we can
love our kids so much that's that's why

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:32.970
love our kids so much that's that's why
 

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.090
love our kids so much that's that's why
we think they actually get to live and

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100
we think they actually get to live and
 

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.830
we think they actually get to live and
we we care about them but at the same

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840
we we care about them but at the same
 

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.680
we we care about them but at the same
time our blindness to them to them or to

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:39.690
time our blindness to them to them or to
 

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.919
time our blindness to them to them or to
the weaknesses can actually create some

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:41.929
the weaknesses can actually create some
 

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:46.730
the weaknesses can actually create some
negative consequences as well

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740
 
 

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.320
 
so I think the world would actually be

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.330
so I think the world would actually be
 

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.880
so I think the world would actually be
quite terrible if everybody would be

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:49.890
quite terrible if everybody would be
 

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.039
quite terrible if everybody would be
would be perfectly rational and you know

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:52.049
would be perfectly rational and you know
 

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:52.909
would be perfectly rational and you know
when you ask people this question

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919
when you ask people this question
 

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:54.260
when you ask people this question
initially they say oh yes I want

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:54.270
initially they say oh yes I want
 

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.940
initially they say oh yes I want
everybody to be rational but the fact is

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:55.950
everybody to be rational but the fact is
 

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.830
everybody to be rational but the fact is
that I pick the title the upside of

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840
that I pick the title the upside of
 

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.330
that I pick the title the upside of
irrationality because I think there's a

00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340
irrationality because I think there's a
 

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.880
irrationality because I think there's a
lot of wonderful things about

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:00.890
lot of wonderful things about
 

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.380
lot of wonderful things about
irrationality I'll give you two examples

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.390
irrationality I'll give you two examples
 

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.899
irrationality I'll give you two examples
the first one is imagine that you left

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:05.909
the first one is imagine that you left
 

00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:08.210
the first one is imagine that you left
your wallet on your desk and you went

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220
your wallet on your desk and you went
 

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.029
your wallet on your desk and you went
out for lunch what are the odds that

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039
out for lunch what are the odds that
 

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.610
out for lunch what are the odds that
somebody will steal it right and now

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620
somebody will steal it right and now
 

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.899
somebody will steal it right and now
think about what are the odds that

00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:14.909
think about what are the odds that
 

00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:16.490
think about what are the odds that
somebody would steal it if everybody you

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500
somebody would steal it if everybody you
 

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.139
somebody would steal it if everybody you
worked with was perfectly rational if

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:18.149
worked with was perfectly rational if
 

00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:19.970
worked with was perfectly rational if
everybody was continuing the

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980
everybody was continuing the
 

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.490
everybody was continuing the
cost-benefit analysis if that's all what

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500
cost-benefit analysis if that's all what
 

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.930
cost-benefit analysis if that's all what
people were doing they would pass by

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940
people were doing they would pass by
 

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.460
people were doing they would pass by
your desk they would say hey nobody is

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:25.470
your desk they would say hey nobody is
 

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.620
your desk they would say hey nobody is
here nobody is looking I can steal this

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:27.630
here nobody is looking I can steal this
 

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.870
here nobody is looking I can steal this
and have no chance of being caught let

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880
and have no chance of being caught let
 

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.720
and have no chance of being caught let
me do that right in fact if we lived in

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:32.730
me do that right in fact if we lived in
 

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.340
me do that right in fact if we lived in
a society where everybody was just

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.350
a society where everybody was just
 

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.470
a society where everybody was just
maximizing their own self-interest all

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480
maximizing their own self-interest all
 

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.659
maximizing their own self-interest all
the time it would be quite a terrible

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:38.669
the time it would be quite a terrible
 

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:40.669
the time it would be quite a terrible
place to live here's another example

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679
place to live here's another example
 

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:43.730
place to live here's another example
imagine a game we call the trust game

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740
imagine a game we call the trust game
 

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.810
imagine a game we call the trust game
and then I'll tell you about the trust

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820
and then I'll tell you about the trust
 

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.820
and then I'll tell you about the trust
game with revenge so imagine two players

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:46.830
game with revenge so imagine two players
 

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.340
game with revenge so imagine two players
player a and player B and the trust game

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:49.350
player a and player B and the trust game
 

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.289
player a and player B and the trust game
looks like this we tell player a hey

00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299
looks like this we tell player a hey
 

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:53.360
looks like this we tell player a hey
player you have $20 you could do two

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.370
player you have $20 you could do two
 

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.730
player you have $20 you could do two
things you can either go home or you can

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740
things you can either go home or you can
 

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.500
things you can either go home or you can
give your money to player B and you

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.510
give your money to player B and you
 

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.760
give your money to player B and you
don't know who player B is and you'll

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:58.770
don't know who player B is and you'll
 

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.740
don't know who player B is and you'll
never meet them if you send your money

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:00.750
never meet them if you send your money
 

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.110
never meet them if you send your money
to player B player B will get $80 the

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120
to player B player B will get $80 the
 

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.760
to player B player B will get $80 the
money would quadruple magically on their

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:04.770
money would quadruple magically on their
 

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.010
money would quadruple magically on their
way and now play a big we decide to do

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020
way and now play a big we decide to do
 

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.049
way and now play a big we decide to do
two things they could go home with $80

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059
two things they could go home with $80
 

00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:10.340
two things they could go home with $80
in which case you will get nothing or

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.350
in which case you will get nothing or
 

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.580
in which case you will get nothing or
they could send you back half the money

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.590
they could send you back half the money
 

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.080
they could send you back half the money
now think about this situation imagine

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:15.090
now think about this situation imagine
 

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.669
now think about this situation imagine
your player a and you ask yourself what

00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679
your player a and you ask yourself what
 

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:19.399
your player a and you ask yourself what
would player B do if player B was

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:19.409
would player B do if player B was
 

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.409
would player B do if player B was
perfectly rational what would they do

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419
perfectly rational what would they do
 

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:23.120
perfectly rational what would they do
they will go home with all the money

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.130
they will go home with all the money
 

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.350
they will go home with all the money
right they will maximize the

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360
right they will maximize the
 

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.419
right they will maximize the
self-interest why would they give you

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:26.429
self-interest why would they give you
 

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:28.519
self-interest why would they give you
back any money so if you thought that

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:28.529
back any money so if you thought that
 

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:30.409
back any money so if you thought that
player B was perfectly rational would

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419
player B was perfectly rational would
 

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.450
player B was perfectly rational would
you send them the money of course not

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460
you send them the money of course not
 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.760
you send them the money of course not
right so the rational prediction is that

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:34.770
right so the rational prediction is that
 

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.529
right so the rational prediction is that
player B will never send the money back

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539
player B will never send the money back
 

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:38.539
player B will never send the money back
and because of that player a will never

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:38.549
and because of that player a will never
 

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:40.820
and because of that player a will never
trust him to start with turns out people

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:40.830
trust him to start with turns out people
 

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.260
trust him to start with turns out people
are much nicer than economic theory

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:42.270
are much nicer than economic theory
 

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.850
are much nicer than economic theory
predicts there's a good chance that

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860
predicts there's a good chance that
 

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.380
predicts there's a good chance that
player a will send them money and a good

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:45.390
player a will send them money and a good
 

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.360
player a will send them money and a good
chance of player B will send half the

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.370
chance of player B will send half the
 

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.639
chance of player B will send half the
money back and if you were player B you

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:49.649
money back and if you were player B you
 

00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:51.470
money back and if you were player B you
can just imagine imagine you just got in

what happened would you send the money

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.230
what happened would you send the money
 

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.139
what happened would you send the money
back or not right most people would do

living on a desert island and imagine I
had the mango and you wanted my mango

had the mango and you wanted my mango
and imagine I kind of looked I was away

for a minute and you could steal my
 

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.930

and run far away enough he will do the

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:33.540
and run far away enough he will do the
 

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.480
and run far away enough he will do the
cost-benefit analysis he will decide not

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:35.490

to chase me not to find out what
happened he'll just go and get a new

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:37.890
happened he'll just go and get a new
 

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.460
happened he'll just go and get a new
mango and under those circumstances a

mango and under those circumstances a
 

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.460
mango and under those circumstances a
good chance you'll take my mango away

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:42.470
good chance you'll take my mango away
 

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.500
good chance you'll take my mango away
but what if I was a revengeful type what

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:45.510
but what if I was a revengeful type what
 

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.870
but what if I was a revengeful type what
if you knew that if you stole my mango I

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880
if you knew that if you stole my mango I
 

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.880
if you knew that if you stole my mango I
will not sleep and I will not rest I

will hunt you down it doesn't matter how
 

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.590
will hunt you down it doesn't matter how
long it will take me and how far I have

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600
long it will take me and how far I have
 

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.020
long it will take me and how far I have
to run and how many nights I will not

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.030
to run and how many nights I will not
 

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.150
to run and how many nights I will not
sleep I will hunt you down I'll take my

00:21:59.150 --> 00:21:59.160
sleep I will hunt you down I'll take my
 

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.010
sleep I will hunt you down I'll take my
mango and all your bananas and your goat

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020
mango and all your bananas and your goat
 

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.590
mango and all your bananas and your goat
and your whatever whatever it is under

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600
and your whatever whatever it is under
 

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.730
and your whatever whatever it is under
that condition you will probably not

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740
that condition you will probably not
 

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.500
that condition you will probably not
start with me to start with right you

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:06.510
start with me to start with right you
 

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.150
start with me to start with right you
will not take anything with me so the

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:08.160
will not take anything with me so the
 

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.840
will not take anything with me so the
way to understand it is that trusting is

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:11.850
way to understand it is that trusting is
 

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.180
way to understand it is that trusting is
irrational but we do it revenge

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.190
irrational but we do it revenge
 

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.540
irrational but we do it revenge
is irrational but we do it and we do it

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:17.550
is irrational but we do it and we do it
 

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.340
is irrational but we do it and we do it
because trust and revenge are actually

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:19.350
because trust and revenge are actually
 

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.920
because trust and revenge are actually
two sides of the same coin

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:20.930
two sides of the same coin
 

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.570
two sides of the same coin
Trust is incredibly important for

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580
Trust is incredibly important for
 

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.150
Trust is incredibly important for
society imagine how we would live in a

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.160

then if we pay 5% more other people

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:35.850
then if we pay 5% more other people
 

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.950
then if we pay 5% more other people
would start doing it but the real

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960
would start doing it but the real

and become more productive and be
happier at their work and the answer is

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200
happier at their work and the answer is
 

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.350
happier at their work and the answer is
not simply that more money is better

but it's also the question of how do you

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.050
but it's also the question of how do you
 

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.620
but it's also the question of how do you
give that money you give it a bonus you

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:54.630
give that money you give it a bonus you
 

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.330
give that money you give it a bonus you
give it as a fixed salary and you give

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340
give it as a fixed salary and you give
 

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.420

it as part of the benefits maybe you

Rwanda in Darfur right and the question
 

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.669
Rwanda in Darfur right and the question
is why why does this happen and and why

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679
is why why does this happen and and why

is the research on what's called the
 

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.700
is the research on what's called the

question is if you have how many lives

00:26:40.009 --> 00:26:40.019
question is if you have how many lives
 

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:42.740
question is if you have how many lives
are at stake and how much do we care you

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:42.750
are at stake and how much do we care you
 

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.480
are at stake and how much do we care you
would expect that as more lives are at

would expect that as more lives are at
 

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.370
would expect that as more lives are at
stake we would care more maybe in a

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380
stake we would care more maybe in a
 

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.259
stake we would care more maybe in a
linear relationship or maybe we would

00:26:48.259 --> 00:26:48.269
linear relationship or maybe we would
 

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:49.490
linear relationship or maybe we would
care more in the beginning and they'll

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500
care more in the beginning and they'll
 

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.169
care more in the beginning and they'll
be kind of a diminishing return like we

00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179
be kind of a diminishing return like we
 

00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:52.340

negative association that now everybody
 

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.110
negative association that now everybody
who had cancer even if it was not

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120
who had cancer even if it was not
 

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.240

cancer survivor and because of that

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520
cancer survivor and because of that
 

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.430
cancer survivor and because of that
everybody who knows them and everybody

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440
everybody who knows them and everybody
 

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.810

who cares about them start caring about
about cancer now you know it's kind of

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:45.030
about cancer now you know it's kind of
 

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.100
about cancer now you know it's kind of
interesting because they've basically

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.110
interesting because they've basically
 

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.470

very strong fear about about cancer and
 

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.520
very strong fear about about cancer and
in caring about it and they basically

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:58.530
in caring about it and they basically
 

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.020
in caring about it and they basically
get a lot of money and if you look at

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.030
get a lot of money and if you look at
 

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.660
get a lot of money and if you look at
them as a non-for-profit they are an

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:01.670
them as a non-for-profit they are an
 

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.340
them as a non-for-profit they are an
incredibly wealthy not-for-profit in

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:04.350
incredibly wealthy not-for-profit in
 

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.990
incredibly wealthy not-for-profit in
fact they other not-for-profits feel

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000
fact they other not-for-profits feel
 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.370
fact they other not-for-profits feel
that the Cancer Society is getting so

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380
that the Cancer Society is getting so
 

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.049
that the Cancer Society is getting so
much money that people just don't give

00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059
much money that people just don't give
 

00:31:09.059 --> 00:31:10.549
much money that people just don't give
to other causes because they give so

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559
to other causes because they give so
 

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.680
to other causes because they give so
much to that cause and now there's all

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:12.690
much to that cause and now there's all
 

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.230
much to that cause and now there's all
kinds of movements to basically stop

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240
kinds of movements to basically stop
 

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.090
kinds of movements to basically stop
their statuses and on for profit because

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100
their statuses and on for profit because
 

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.560
their statuses and on for profit because
they're so wealthy and they spend so

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:18.570
they're so wealthy and they spend so
 

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.140
they're so wealthy and they spend so
much money on salaries and and so on but

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.150
much money on salaries and and so on but
 

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.330
much money on salaries and and so on but
but in a sense of understanding human

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340
but in a sense of understanding human
 

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:30.080
but in a sense of understanding human
psychology they're the top basically

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.090
 
 

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.060
 
lots of lot of behavior like this so the

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.070
lots of lot of behavior like this so the
 

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.690
lots of lot of behavior like this so the
basic essence is the trade-off between

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700
basic essence is the trade-off between
 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.600

interferon said why don't you try why

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:10.770
interferon said why don't you try why
 

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.230
interferon said why don't you try why
don't you try this I was very happy to

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240
don't you try this I was very happy to
 

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.940
don't you try this I was very happy to
try it because you know who would want

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:13.950
try it because you know who would want
 

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.659
try it because you know who would want
to die from liver cirrhosis and I

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:17.669
to die from liver cirrhosis and I
 

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:19.220
to die from liver cirrhosis and I
basically got these injections I had to

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:19.230
basically got these injections I had to
 

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.460
basically got these injections I had to
inject myself three times a week for a

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:22.470
inject myself three times a week for a
 

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.830
inject myself three times a week for a
year and a half and these injections

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840
year and a half and these injections
 

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.810
year and a half and these injections
basically symbolize for me they kind of

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820
basically symbolize for me they kind of
 

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.510
basically symbolize for me they kind of
the essence of the human condition here

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520
the essence of the human condition here
 

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.190
the essence of the human condition here
was an injection that could potentially

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200
was an injection that could potentially
 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.820
was an injection that could potentially
be very useful for me thirty years later

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:33.830
be very useful for me thirty years later
 

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.529
be very useful for me thirty years later
but what happened is that he also had

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539
but what happened is that he also had
 

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:38.659
but what happened is that he also had
very bad side effects so every time I

00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:38.669
very bad side effects so every time I
 

00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:39.860
very bad side effects so every time I
would take an injection it would be sick

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:39.870
would take an injection it would be sick
 

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.870

terrible compared to liver cirrhosis but

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.190
terrible compared to liver cirrhosis but
 

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:51.169

would make them behave as if they care
 

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.849
would make them behave as if they care
about the things that they're doing for

00:36:08.849 --> 00:36:08.859
about the things that they're doing for
 

00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:11.790
about the things that they're doing for
so why do people go to the gym right

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800
so why do people go to the gym right
 

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.430
so why do people go to the gym right
do they really wake up every morning

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440
do they really wake up every morning
 

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.720
do they really wake up every morning
worrying about how they will look feel

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:15.730
worrying about how they will look feel
 

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.830
worrying about how they will look feel
like 30 years from now

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:16.840
like 30 years from now
 

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.290
like 30 years from now
probably not but can we get them to do

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:19.300
probably not but can we get them to do
 

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.359
probably not but can we get them to do
some of these about the moment that

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:21.369
some of these about the moment that
 

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:23.550
some of these about the moment that
actually get them to behave because they

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560
actually get them to behave because they
 

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.010
actually get them to behave because they
do something that makes them care about

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020
do something that makes them care about
 

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.060
do something that makes them care about
behaviors if they care about something

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.070
behaviors if they care about something
 

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.250
behaviors if they care about something
else and I think that reward

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:29.260
else and I think that reward
 

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.859
else and I think that reward
substitution actually provides a general

00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:31.869
substitution actually provides a general
 

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:34.410
substitution actually provides a general
answer to lots of problems in in human

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:34.420
answer to lots of problems in in human
 

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.840
answer to lots of problems in in human
behavior we just need to find out what

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:36.850
behavior we just need to find out what
 

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.530
behavior we just need to find out what
these rewards can be

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:41.540
 
 

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.520
 
absolutely so if you think about the

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:43.530
absolutely so if you think about the
 

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.930
absolutely so if you think about the
question of trust and revenge that's a

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940
question of trust and revenge that's a
 

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.730
question of trust and revenge that's a
great example right the fact is that we

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740
great example right the fact is that we
 

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.350
great example right the fact is that we
live in a society we're inherently

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:48.360
live in a society we're inherently
 

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.670
live in a society we're inherently
social animals unlike some other species

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680
social animals unlike some other species
 

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.650
social animals unlike some other species
and because of that we need things that

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660
and because of that we need things that
 

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.680
and because of that we need things that
kind of connects us in a social way so

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:57.690
kind of connects us in a social way so
 

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.330
kind of connects us in a social way so
we have this social utility in which we

00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.340
we have this social utility in which we
 

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.370
we have this social utility in which we
just care about other people now let's

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380
just care about other people now let's
 

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.740
just care about other people now let's
created lots of problems for example if

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:03.750
created lots of problems for example if
 

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.260
created lots of problems for example if
you do a favor to me I like you more and

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.270
you do a favor to me I like you more and
 

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.080
you do a favor to me I like you more and
then it might put me in such in conflict

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.090
then it might put me in such in conflict
 

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.910
then it might put me in such in conflict
of interest because I would want to

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920
of interest because I would want to
 

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.270
of interest because I would want to
reciprocate in some way or you know

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280
reciprocate in some way or you know
 

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.710
reciprocate in some way or you know
trust and revenge and all of those

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720
trust and revenge and all of those
 

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.930
trust and revenge and all of those
things so the fact is that there are

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940
things so the fact is that there are
 

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.970
things so the fact is that there are
some things that we are irrational and

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980
some things that we are irrational and
 

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.850
some things that we are irrational and
we would have liked to fix it but

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:22.860
we would have liked to fix it but
 

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.590
we would have liked to fix it but
there's something who are irrationality

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:24.600
there's something who are irrationality
 

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.240
there's something who are irrationality
is actually what allows us to live in a

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:26.250
is actually what allows us to live in a
 

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.180
is actually what allows us to live in a
society and if we lived as individual

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:29.190
society and if we lived as individual
 

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.550
society and if we lived as individual
organisms that basically had no social

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560
organisms that basically had no social
 

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.350
organisms that basically had no social
ties and we're just working each one of

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:33.360
ties and we're just working each one of
 

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.720
ties and we're just working each one of
us separately it'll be a very different

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:34.730
us separately it'll be a very different
 

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.490
us separately it'll be a very different
social structure but we might want to

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500
social structure but we might want to
 

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.530
social structure but we might want to
actually have different strategies for

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540
actually have different strategies for
 

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.030
actually have different strategies for
decision making but because we're

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040
decision making but because we're
 

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.160
decision making but because we're
inherently social animal there's all

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.170
inherently social animal there's all
 

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.350
inherently social animal there's all
kinds of things that make that are

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:45.360
kinds of things that make that are
 

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.570
kinds of things that make that are
irrational from the perspective of

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:47.580
irrational from the perspective of
 

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.250
irrational from the perspective of
thinking that everybody is a social

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260
thinking that everybody is a social
 

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.640
thinking that everybody is a social
Daisy is a selfish Maximizer but

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.650
Daisy is a selfish Maximizer but
 

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.620
Daisy is a selfish Maximizer but
nevertheless makes sense when you think

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:54.630
nevertheless makes sense when you think
 

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.840
nevertheless makes sense when you think
about people as social animals the other

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:56.850
about people as social animals the other
 

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.250
about people as social animals the other
thing of course is about processing

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260
thing of course is about processing
 

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.650
thing of course is about processing
information so the fact is that we have

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660
information so the fact is that we have
 

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.450
information so the fact is that we have
a limited brain you know we're kind of

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460
a limited brain you know we're kind of
 

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.030
a limited brain you know we're kind of
limited physically in many ways right we

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040
limited physically in many ways right we
 

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.080
limited physically in many ways right we
can't jump very high

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.090
can't jump very high
 

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.870
can't jump very high
we can't sustain cold or heat I mean

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880
we can't sustain cold or heat I mean
 

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.520
we can't sustain cold or heat I mean
think about all the stuff in the world

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:10.530
think about all the stuff in the world
 

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.780
think about all the stuff in the world
that we do to make yourself more

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:11.790
that we do to make yourself more
 

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.060
that we do to make yourself more
comfortable we have chairs and clothes

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.070
comfortable we have chairs and clothes
 

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.670
comfortable we have chairs and clothes
and glasses and headphones I mean lots

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680
and glasses and headphones I mean lots
 

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.340
and glasses and headphones I mean lots
and lots of stuff it turns out our brain

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.350
and lots of stuff it turns out our brain
 

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.900
and lots of stuff it turns out our brain
is also not perfect right in the same

is also not perfect right in the same
 

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.609
is also not perfect right in the same
way that our bodies are not perfect that

way that our bodies are not perfect that

way that our bodies are not perfect that
we can't do everything we would like to

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880
we can't do everything we would like to
 

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.630
we can't do everything we would like to
we're not Superman our brain is also not

we're not Superman our brain is also not
 

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.400
we're not Superman our brain is also not

that's what gives us that the brain
