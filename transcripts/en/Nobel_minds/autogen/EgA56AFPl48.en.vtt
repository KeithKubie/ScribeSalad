hello Davey bros my name is David

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979
hello Davey bros my name is David
 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.830
hello Davey bros my name is David
Eagleman and here's my question to you

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
Eagleman and here's my question to you
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.829
Eagleman and here's my question to you
if you imagine that the progress of

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
if you imagine that the progress of
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.290
if you imagine that the progress of
science has brought us some distance to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
science has brought us some distance to
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.150
science has brought us some distance to
understanding the entirety of science

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
understanding the entirety of science
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.660
understanding the entirety of science
how far would you say that distance is

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670
how far would you say that distance is
 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.359
how far would you say that distance is
do we understand 5% of all of us science

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
do we understand 5% of all of us science
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.679
do we understand 5% of all of us science
50% 80% that's my question to you

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689
50% 80% that's my question to you
 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.540
50% 80% that's my question to you
hi David Eagleman that's a great

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
hi David Eagleman that's a great
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.269
hi David Eagleman that's a great
question in certain areas of science one

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
question in certain areas of science one
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.740
question in certain areas of science one
might perhaps not me but experts in a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
might perhaps not me but experts in a
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.910
might perhaps not me but experts in a
given area could tell you how far

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
given area could tell you how far
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.350
given area could tell you how far
they're along in completing all of the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
they're along in completing all of the
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630
they're along in completing all of the
interesting questions in that limited

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
interesting questions in that limited
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090
interesting questions in that limited
area of science but for science as a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
area of science but for science as a
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580
area of science but for science as a
whole of course we have no idea how far

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
whole of course we have no idea how far
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830
whole of course we have no idea how far
along we are we're not even sure that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
along we are we're not even sure that
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.319
along we are we're not even sure that
the answer isn't nowhere arbitrarily

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
the answer isn't nowhere arbitrarily
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.619
the answer isn't nowhere arbitrarily
small it could be that the realm of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
small it could be that the realm of
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.160
small it could be that the realm of
questions and the areas of science that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
questions and the areas of science that
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.850
questions and the areas of science that
we do not yet understand as infinite in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
we do not yet understand as infinite in
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.570
we do not yet understand as infinite in
size and in the knowable

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
size and in the knowable
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.480
size and in the knowable
in fact it often appears to be the case

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
in fact it often appears to be the case
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219
in fact it often appears to be the case
because the more we learn the more we

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
because the more we learn the more we
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.999
because the more we learn the more we
seem to realize that we don't understand

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
seem to realize that we don't understand
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.960
seem to realize that we don't understand
the more questions we have this is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
the more questions we have this is
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.749
the more questions we have this is
especially true in fundamental areas of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
especially true in fundamental areas of
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.719
especially true in fundamental areas of
science where we're exploring new laws

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
science where we're exploring new laws
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.069
science where we're exploring new laws
and new forms of matter and it's not at

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
and new forms of matter and it's not at
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.020
and new forms of matter and it's not at
all clear that we'll ever exhaust the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
all clear that we'll ever exhaust the
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390
all clear that we'll ever exhaust the
vast amount of ignorance that we're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
vast amount of ignorance that we're
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910
vast amount of ignorance that we're
aware of not to speak of the vast amount

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
aware of not to speak of the vast amount
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609
aware of not to speak of the vast amount
of ignorance that were not aware of so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
of ignorance that were not aware of so
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.990
of ignorance that were not aware of so
it could be very small but equally well

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
it could be very small but equally well
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.620
it could be very small but equally well
it could be that the amount of science

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
it could be that the amount of science
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.850
it could be that the amount of science
or knowledge to absorb is finite that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
or knowledge to absorb is finite that
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.990
or knowledge to absorb is finite that
might be the case there are no

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
might be the case there are no
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.859
might be the case there are no
indications of that so I think in many

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
indications of that so I think in many
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959
indications of that so I think in many
areas of science and certainly in the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
areas of science and certainly in the
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.680
areas of science and certainly in the
areas that I work in

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690
areas that I work in
 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.470
areas that I work in
particle physics what we know is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480
particle physics what we know is
 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.720
particle physics what we know is
probably a very small part of what we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
probably a very small part of what we
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.660
probably a very small part of what we
have yet to learn
