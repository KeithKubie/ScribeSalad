00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.050
In the video where I give an
overview of American history

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.260
through the Civil War, I
commented that it's unfortunate

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.770
that Abraham Lincoln
is assassinated shortly

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.302
before the end of the Civil War.

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:13.760
And although that is technically
correct, what I want to do

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.570
is clarify that comment a
little bit in this video.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.000
Because in actuality by the
time he was assassinated,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.060
Lincoln knew that the Union
was very, very, very likely

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.100
to win the war, that the major
Confederate armies had already

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.000
surrendered to the Union.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.509
Although it wasn't
formally done,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.140
there was still
some fighting going

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.050
on in some parts of the South.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.060
So if we go back
to April 9, 1865

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.480
you have the battle at
Appomattox Courthouse,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.510
and after that battle
the Confederate army

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.430
is essentially routed.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.670
It has to surrender.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.640
This right here
is Robert E. Lee.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.050
And on April 9, 1865
after that battle,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.500
he surrenders to
Ulysses S. Grant.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.310
And one point of confusion
some people often have, and I

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.280
had this the first
time I learned it,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.420
is that Appomattox Courthouse
is the name of the city,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.640
that the surrender
actually did not take place

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.932
in the courthouse in that city.

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:15.806
And I actually shouldn't
even call it a city.

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.100
It's like a little town
with a handful of buildings.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.510
It took place in this
gentleman's house,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.360
Wilmer McLean.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.840
And I'm showing
his image because,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
his set of circumstances or how
he is tied to the Civil War,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710
is frankly fascinating.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.640
Because in 1861 the first
battle of the Civil War

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.650
occurred on his property
in Manassas, Virginia.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.740
This is in northern Virginia.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.970
He was sympathetic with
the Confederate army.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.810
He did not like that
northern Virginia was

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.140
so close to the
North-South border.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.290
So he picks up his
bags and his family,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800
and he moves them
down to the small town

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.610
of Appomattox Courthouse,
which is in central Virginia.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.880
So the very first major
land battle of the Civil War

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.590
literally occurs on
this guy's property.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.419
And the last major or
really the major surrender

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.680
of the Civil War occurs
inside this guy's house

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.329
after he moves.

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.370
And it's all coincidence.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.740
He just happens to
have the nicest house

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.410
near the battlefield
where everyone

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.990
felt that it was appropriate
to have this kind of major end

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.980
to a major war.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.480
But regardless, that
happens on April 9, 1865.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.070
The major Confederate army
surrenders to the Union army.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.590
The reason why this is not the
formal end of the Civil War

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.880
is that you still had 175,000
Confederate troops other places

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.992
in the south
continuing to fight on.

00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:45.450
You have to remember
that we didn't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.450
have a telephone at
this point in time,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.860
so we didn't have
instant communication.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.390
So these people who were
fighting, many of them

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.770
did not even know that the
Confederate army had already

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.770
surrendered to the Union.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.170
But to some degree
this major surrender

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.500
is what leads to
Lincoln's assassination.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.730
Because for most
people this tells you,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.430
hey, there's a 99.9% chance
that the Union has won.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.989
It just has to,
either these people

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.280
need to find out that their
major army has surrendered,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.740
or the Union has to go
and essentially force

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.700
all of the rest of the
armies to surrender.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.660
So you go to April 14, 1865.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.840
Lincoln already knows
that Robert E. Lee's army

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.570
has surrendered.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.450
He knows that
victory is imminent.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.960
But you have this gentleman
right over here, John Wilkes

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:46.580
Booth, who is sympathetic
to the Confederate cause.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.150
And in his mind all
is not lost yet.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.990
He does see this as a major
blow to the Confederate cause,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.650
and he thinks that they need
to do something desperate

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.550
if they want to have any chance
of being able to come back,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.060
being able to maintain their
independence from the Union.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.150
So he coordinates with
a couple of his buddies.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.160
And he says, hey
our only chance is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.130
if we assassinate not only
Abraham Lincoln, but also

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.959
Andrew Johnson who's the vice
president, and Ulysses S Grant,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.890
and we assassinate Seward, who
was the Secretary of State.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.490
And the idea there is if
you assassinate everyone

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.680
who is in line to
become president,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.300
then it would just throw
the entire Union leadership

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.770
in disarray, and maybe it would
give these characters over here

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.170
a fighting chance to
maintain their independence

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.730
or maybe come back
against the Union Army.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.540
Unfortunately for
John Wilkes Booth,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.250
or I guess well you
could take it either way,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.710
the other three people were
not able to fully execute

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.940
on their plan.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.300
Seward was injured.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.540
He actually did get stabbed
in the face and all that,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.000
but he was not assassinated.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.080
And John Wilkes Booth
was the only person

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.110
who was able to carry
out his assassination.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.450
So you have on April 14, 1865
shortly after 10:00 PM Abraham

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.880
Lincoln is watching a
play at Ford's Theater.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.300
And his booth, the guy who was
supposed to guard the booth,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.120
was out drinking
with his buddies.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.600
So I guess the Secret
Service really, the security

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.990
was not back then what it is
now, hopefully what it is now.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.000
And John Wilkes
Booth, who actually

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.110
used to act at this theater,
he picked a time in the play

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.860
where everyone would
laugh and clap.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.930
And he said, hey, I'll
just shoot right then.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.710
People will think it's part
of the play or something,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.418
or they wouldn't notice
as much, and then

00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:35.590
I'll be able to run out.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.430
And so he is able to, right in
that moment shortly after 10:00

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.090
PM, shoot Abraham Lincoln
and assassinate him

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.950
on April 14, 1865.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.040
But the whole point here
is to just understand

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.530
that Lincoln did know that
Robert E. Lee's army had

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.560
surrendered at the time
of his assassination.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.960
So he at least
was feeling pretty

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.640
good about the
course of the war.
