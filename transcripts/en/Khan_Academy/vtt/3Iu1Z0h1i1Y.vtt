00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.183
- Welcome to Pixar In A Box

00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:04.459
a collaboration between
Pixar Animation Studios

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.263
- and the Khan Academy.

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:08.516
- I'm Fran, I work here on
the technical side of things.

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:09.816
- And I'm Alex, I work here

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.565
on the art and story side of things.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.081
- (Fran) Pixar In A Box will introduce you

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.257
to some of the fundamental
skills we use to make our movies.

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:17.319
- (Alex) There's examples
of real life film challenges

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.152
that show how an artist's idea can create

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.979
a tidal wave of technical creativity.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.767
And how technical advances can inspire

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.367
artists to think of new
ideas to bring to the screen.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.875
You'll meet artists, scientists,

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.001
animators, coders, sculptors,

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.590
all kinds of different people.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.609
- And the thing is, most of them use

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.712
skills you may already
be learning in school.

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:37.825
But here in the Box, you can see how

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.296
we use those skills to make cool stuff.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.736
Before you dive into these lessons,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.865
you should see how it all
fits together inside Pixar,

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:44.917
the real Pixar.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:45.780
Come on, check it out.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.589
(light, flittering music)

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.464
- At Pixar on any given day

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:54.888
we're working on various
stages of many films.

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:59.102
- But it all begins with an idea.

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:02.134
For example, "Toy Story" started with the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.900
notion that when kids leave the room
their toys come to life.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:09.949
And, honestly, I was convinced that my toys did that.

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:16.770
(scampering instrumental music)

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.478
- Our films start in story,

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.122
along with the director and the writer

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.662
we figure out what happens
using simple drawings.

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:25.337
- (Fran) It's kind of like a comic book.

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:27.594
- (Alex) Exactly, and while we're drawing,

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:29.359
production designers and their team start

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.640
designing the world and the characters.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.592
(smooth, cheerful orchestral music)

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.198
While they're painting
and drawing and scultping

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.195
our storyboards go to editorial,

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.518
where they string together all

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:45.167
the drawings that we've created.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.448
- We time them out, add music,
dialogue and sound effects.

00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:49.029
(clicking)

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.979
- He's the only one who
knew what the heck was going

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.061
aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.517
- And as these shots go through
each stage in production,

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:57.164
we'll update the scene
over and over again.

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:59.765
And this is where the
science and the math come in.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:00.741
- Who knew what the heck was going

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.436
aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:05.364
(mischevious music)

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.477
- What's next?

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:10.240
Pipeline, we're ready to start
making the film you'll see

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.771
in the theater and this
happens in a particular order.

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.931
It's time for our technical
artist to figure out

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:16.934
how we're going to create
the movie in the computer.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.408
- I've been here for nine
years and I still have no idea

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:22.032
how you guys turn our drawings
into the finished film.

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:25.097
- To be honest, something
stumps us on every movie.

00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:26.165
- Hey Galyn.

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:26.745
- Hey.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.463
- You've been here since Toy Story,

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:29.666
what's been hard on each film?

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.450
- Well on Toy Story everything.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.576
Here let me show you.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.595
On Toy Story we were inventing

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:38.288
the entire process from scratch.

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:41.121
Monsters Incorporated, fur and clothing.

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.211
On Cars, reflective metal surfaces.

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.762
On every new film there's
a new technical challenge.

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.280
On Inside Out we had to
deal with a character

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.827
made of glowing particles and it took lots

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:54.876
of people to figure out
just that one thing.

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:56.524
- (Alex) Whoa, what is she made of?

00:02:56.524 --> 00:03:00.239
- Her shape will be made of
points and particles of light.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.965
She was tough, this is the 17th version.

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:06.604
- And the characters have to move,

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.277
so someone has to add
controls to the model.

00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:10.652
- Like a puppet, right?

00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:12.572
- Yes, except instead of strings,

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.503
our animators will use a computer program

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:15.935
to move the characters in a digital world.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:17.653
(bemused music)

00:03:17.653 --> 00:03:19.409
Next in the pipeline, sets.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.582
(playful music)

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:23.667
- (Alex) So for Cars 2 you
built the entire city of London?

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.687
- We needed a huge chunk of the city

00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.753
because Mayor and
McQueen speed through it.

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:29.959
So we figured out to grow buildings

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.250
with enough variation
for them to look real.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.643
- (Fran) And we move through that set

00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:37.128
with our virtual cameras.

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.753
Next up, animation.

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:40.433
- I do know what the animators do.

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.894
They bring the characters to life.

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:44.154
- (Fran) You see how she's moving but

00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:45.657
her clothes and hair are missing?

00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:47.846
Adding and moving those
elements is going to be

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:49.697
someone else's job
further down the pipeline.

00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:52.144
And by somebody else, I mean me

00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:54.698
and about 20 other
simulation technical artists.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:57.700
Where are you getting all these shirts?

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.627
We have to build everything you see,

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:01.111
including the textures and surfaces

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:03.850
which help make the world
and characters believable.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.567
Next stop, lighting.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.197
- Ironically it's really dark
in the lighting department.

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:10.531
(playful music)

00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:12.424
So when you start, there are no lights?

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:14.798
- No any source of light is something

00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:16.751
we have to add into the scene.

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.765
In this shot alone there are 230 lights.

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.762
- (Fran) Last stop, the Renderfarm.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.571
- A film is really a
series of images or frames.

00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.274
There's 24 of them every second.

00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:28.864
(light, moving music)

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:30.544
- (Fran) This is where we make the frames.

00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:31.841
Everything comes together here,

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.302
all the art, math and science.

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:38.040
A single frame can take more
than 24 hours to render,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.805
and that's just one frame,

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:41.662
and that's assuming we
don't run into any snags.

00:04:41.662 --> 00:04:43.377
- Whoa! (thuds)

00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:49.069
(soaring orchestral music)

00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:53.486
- Wow, it's incredible seeing final shots.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:56.130
And now that I know how
they're made, even cooler.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.907
- So that's the tour, our next step is to

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.896
jump back into the Box
and choose a lesson.

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.447
What do you want to try?

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:03.838
- Well this one on building
robots using combinatorics,

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.440
that looks pretty cool.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.251
- What about the one on sets and staging?

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.543
- Yeah or the one on
animating The Incredibles.

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.935
- (Fran) Awesome, I
always wanted to animate.

00:05:11.935 --> 00:05:13.739
(silly trumpet music)
