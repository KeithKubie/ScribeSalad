00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.650
The answer is that different form factors typically

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.600
need to be taken advantage of differently. An ideal

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.630
interface for a phone scenario, will really be pretty

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.800
different than an ideal desktop presentation that's designed for

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.760
a large screen. You need designs that adapt to

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.100
the general scenario of device, like phone or tablet

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.970
or desktop. And then use re flow and fluid

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.470
layout techniques to adjust for smaller differences between devices

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.720
in those scenarios like, different models

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.950
of tablet's with slightly different screens.
