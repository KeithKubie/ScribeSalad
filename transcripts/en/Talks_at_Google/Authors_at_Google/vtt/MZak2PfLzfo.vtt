00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:09.270
MALE SPEAKER: I'd like to
welcome Phil Warburg back

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.560
to Google to talk about his
book called "Harness the Sun".

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.200
He was here earlier to talk
about "Harvest the Wind"

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.390
and now we're on to
"Harness the Sun".

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
As you see he's very interested
in alternative energy

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.020
and how it can help
save the climate

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.020
and why it's the future of
energy in the United States.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.440
Without further
introduction, I'd

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.110
like the invited Phil up to
talk to us about his new book.

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.950
PHILIP WARBURG: It's
great to be back at Google

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.216
talking about my
favorite subject.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:44.840
I can't think of a
better place to talk

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.850
about technological
transformation than Google.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.140
I want to start by
asking how many of you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.440
have solar on your homes today?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900
And how many of
you have neighbors

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.660
with solar on their homes?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.860
OK, and I want to see
those hands together.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.470
So that really says something
to me about solar power today.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.170
And that is that it's really
become part of our lives

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.780
whether we've invested
in it individually

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.010
or whether we're part of
a broader community that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.090
has decided that solar is
a worthwhile investment.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.050
And by worthwhile I
mean a number of things.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.380
For some people, that is simply
lowering their electric bills

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.990
now and thinking about future
fuel prices and stability

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.870
going forward in terms
of their electric bills.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.800
For some, there's
satisfaction in trimming

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.000
at least a bit of
their carbon footprint

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.110
by generating at least part,
or a substantial part of,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.510
their power from
renewable sources.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.110
And for others
there's a satisfaction

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.410
in taking charge of at
least some of the power

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.900
that we consume in
our daily lives.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.030
And that latter concept
of taking charge

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.540
is one that I found
particularly intriguing

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.330
as I traveled the
country talking

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.580
to different people about
their own commitment

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.110
to moving solar power forward.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.250
One would expect
progressive politicians

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.180
like former congressman
Henry Waxman

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.330
to be avid solar proponents--
he wrote a wonderful blurb

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.100
on the back of my book-- former
Head of the Energy and Commerce

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.150
Committee in the
House, dedicated

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.560
to environmental issues.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.710
Sea solar as part of
broader panoply of necessary

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.370
measures we have
to take to address

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.800
the overwhelming challenge
of climate change.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.020
But what was more
surprising to me

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.630
was finding that there
is strong support

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.550
for solar power among at
least a contingent of very

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.440
right-wing libertarians.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.610
People like former congressman
Barry Goldwater Jr.,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.930
he was Congressman
from California

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.910
for a number of years,
he now is the chair

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.420
of something called
TUSK-- Tell Utilities

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.530
Solar Won't Be Killed.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.000
And what that group does is it's
a representation of homeowners

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.150
and business owners who
want to generate solar

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.660
on their properties and
who want fair compensation

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.180
for the surplus power that they
generate and they are fighting

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.600
major utilities, such as
Arizona Public Service, which

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.680
wants to cut back on the
net metering benefits that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.700
are provided to solar homeowners
and solar business owners.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.500
I don't know if this
is enough to bridge

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.120
the gaping political chasm
that exists in America today,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.720
but at least it's a sign that
there is a common language

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.300
that we can talk across
the political spectrum

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.945
in looking at some of our
renewable energy opportunities.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.560
Back in 2012 when I was just
wrapping up my book on wind

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.060
power, people often
asked me, so will

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.310
your next book the about solar?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.210
And my kind of flip and
dismissive comment at the time

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.770
was that if I ever wrote
a book about solar,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.040
I have to call it "Dim Sun".

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.090
And the reason I said that
was because at the time,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.570
it just struck me that
solar was pricing itself out

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.920
of the market and was not on the
verge of becoming a mainstream

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.050
power producer.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.120
Thankfully, and fairly
quickly, I was proven wrong.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.905
Between the first
quarter of 2012

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:33.020
and the first quarter
of 2015 the price

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.840
of residential and utility-scale
solar came down about 46%.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.900
And the price of
non-residential,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.980
as in commercial and public
building related solar,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.050
came down about 52%.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.620
So a very dramatic drop in
a very short period of time.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.140
And another powerful indicator
of just where solar is today

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.180
can be found in the first half
of this year's new generation

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.250
capacity installations.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.380
Solar, during the first
half of this year,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.690
accounted for 39% of all new
power generation capacity

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.100
nationwide.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.197
Wind accounted for about 36%.

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:16.780
So if you add the
two of those, you're

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.690
looking at 75% of our new
electric generating capacity

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.460
in the first half of this year
coming from renewable sources.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.600
You know we all hear
about natural gas

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.810
as the cheaper, more
convenient, accessible options--

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.480
and with fracking
ever more accessible.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.030
Gas accounted for
about 21.4% percent

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.060
of new generated capacity
during that same period.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.030
So those are all pretty
powerful signs to me

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.160
that solar's time
really has arrived.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.320
My own solar journey
began in March of 2013

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.000
when my wife and
I decided to put

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.490
solar on our own home's roof.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.020
And we actually found ourselves
just a few days after one

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.600
of Massachusetts' many
heavy snow storms,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.160
not the likes of which we
saw last year, but 2013

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.620
had it's share as well--
and we weren't at all sure

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.620
that the installers from
Sunlight Solar Energy

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.930
were going to show up
at all, but they did.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.350
And one member of their crew was
a guy named Liam [? Madden. ?]

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.500
He was a former Marine
Expeditionary Unit

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.780
member in Iraq--
tough guy-- but when

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.300
he got out of the gleaming
white Sunlight Solar Energy van

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.420
and looked up at our
roof, he kind of blanched.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.110
And I said, what's-- is
something the matter?

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.340
Have you not installed solar
on a roof this steep before?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.570
And he said well, actually not.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.330
Our room has a 55 degree slope.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.920
And he and his teammates
climbed the roof

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.380
and in utter silence roped
to the peak of the roof,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.420
they installed our solar array.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.480
Thankfully, no one was
hurt and thereafter we've

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.270
gotten about 75% of our total
electricity needs from the sun

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.180
and that includes
the nightly charging

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.240
of a plug-in electric
hybrid vehicle.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.530
So we feel good about what we're
doing and we're by no means

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.500
alone in doing this.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.220
There are about 750,000
homeowners and businesses

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.630
in America today
who have installed

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.350
solar on their rooftops.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.380
During 2014, that
amounted to about one

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.060
new solar installation
every 2.4 or 2.5 minutes.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.750
So we're really
again, seeing solar

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.330
penetrate the marketplace.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.790
And one thing I should just
mention, which many of you,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.990
given your work in this
particular industry I'm sure

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.350
know from electronic appliances,
solar photovoltaics actually

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.930
work better in colder weather.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.987
So some people say
well gee, solar

00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:50.570
isn't a great match
for Massachusetts,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.450
it's a cold climate,
snowy climate, et cetera.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.040
As long as our solar
panels are clear,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.060
we actually get
better productivity

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.210
from the sun during
the winter months

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.490
than during the summer months.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.400
Not overall, but at any given
moment, because of the factor

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.505
of colder operating conditions.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.906
But we're not just seeing solar
on our homes this I'm sure

00:08:15.906 --> 00:08:17.780
is a familiar sight to
you, the Mountain View

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.160
headquarters of
Google, where you

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.420
have 30% of your peak
electric demand coming

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.260
from solar energy, which is
pretty impressive given what

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.799
must go on at that complex.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.039
And that might be expectable
because again, you're

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.820
a high tech company,
cutting edge, et cetera.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.450
But what's interesting
to me is seeing

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.930
how companies like Kohl's,
like Ikea, like Walmart,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.240
are going solar.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.770
Walmart now has solar
on 250 of its buildings

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.630
and its goal is to have solar
on 1,000 of its buildings

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.700
in the coming years.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.380
They want to be 100% reliant
upon renewable energy

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.840
at some point in
the near future.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.600
Walmart isn't exactly
on the cutting edge

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.740
of environmentalism or
energy enlightenment,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.700
but in fact, it is working
toward the right ends

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.800
in this particular respect.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.530
We're also seeing solar in some
perhaps somewhat unpredictable

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.080
places the NFL has made a
commitment to solar there

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.860
six NFL stadiums that
either have solar today

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.790
or are having it installed
on their facilities.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.290
Gillette Stadium is
one of those places.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.130
I went to witness that
particular facility and I

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.300
went-- the first time I went
it was four a Taylor Swift

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.500
concert with my two daughters.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.200
I think I was the only
person among the crowds who

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.530
was more interested in the solar
arrays than in the performer.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.090
But this particular
facility you're seeing here

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.390
is FedEx Field which is
the home of the Redskins.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.550
And this installation
faced a particular problem

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.400
and I wonder if any of you
could guess what it might be.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.304
Any guesses?

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:03.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.011
PHILIP WARBURG: Well,
I'll give you a hint.

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:06.800
What's that?

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.360
Very close.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.172
Why tailgating?

00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:10.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
on top of the roof.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.790
PHILIP WARBURG: Well, close.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.300
What do people do
at tailgate parties?

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.900
They toss footballs.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.960
And so the guy who is
responsible for designing

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.940
this facility had to calculate
the arc of a football

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.410
when tossed by an
amateur, but still tossed,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.320
to make sure that the
solar parking canopies were

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.640
sufficiently above that
arc that footballs wouldn't

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.290
come crashing down on the solar
panels on a regular basis.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.530
Not that they probably would
have broken the panels, but not

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:46.890
a real wise idea to have that
constant collision happening.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.050
And beyond the power that
these facilities generate,

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.330
those parking canopies are now
the most desired parking spots

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.500
at FedEx Field.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.450
On a more practical
level, large warehouses

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.780
are beginning to install
solar on their roofs.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.210
New Jersey is a great example.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.950
New Jersey does not have a
huge amount of open space.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.590
It does have a huge amount of
factory space and warehouse

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.310
space.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:19.100
This particular building is
a food storage warehouse.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.530
It's a quarter of a mile long
and it has a huge electric bill

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.875
because of the cooling and
refrigeration and freezing

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:29.827
that has to go on
inside this building.

00:11:29.827 --> 00:11:31.660
And this building because
of the solar array

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.500
now gets 90% of its total
power needs from the sun.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.490
And then if you kind of get
into the real gritty aspects

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.510
of solar power's potential, you
have to look at brownfields.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.200
Brownfields for those of you who
are not familiar with the term

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.470
are either contaminated or
potentially contaminated

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.810
industrial properties.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.830
They could be
former mining areas,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.440
they could be former
factories, they

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.710
could be former landfills
or hazardous waste dumps.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:08.750
And the EPA has a department
called Repowering America's

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.860
Land and they have done
a survey of over 100,000

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.900
brownfield sites in
America and according

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.810
to their calculations,
if we were

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.140
to tap the solar potential
on those brownfield sites

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.420
we could be getting three
times our total power

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.790
needs nationwide.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.640
Now, there are other
challenges in terms

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.290
of developing these sites.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.487
You have to rehabilitate
them to a certain degree,

00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:34.320
as you can see from
this particular picture.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.860
You're not necessarily
inheriting pristine properties.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.170
But that just bespeaks how
profound an impact solar

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.470
could have if we were
to choose hidden and not

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.020
so hidden opportunities
for its development.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.900
This particular facility
is on the south side

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.775
of Chicago in the West
Pullman neighborhood.

00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:55.650
A very crime-ridden area.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.880
Once a big industrial
zone, now largely abandoned

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.300
and a site of some pretty
serious local crime.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.370
And Exelon along
came in in 2008,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.750
looked at this plot of land--
it had been an International

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.300
Harvester assembly plant
that had been abandoned

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.260
in the early 1980s--
and Exelon decided this

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.680
would be a good site for solar.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.390
So they installed the
Exelon city solar plant

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.510
in the midst of the West
Pullman neighborhood.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.050
They now generate
enough electricity

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.930
for about 1,500 households.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.650
I wish I could say
that this it had

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.890
some positive impact on
crime in the neighborhood,

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.600
unfortunately the major
source of panel breakage

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.630
is stray bullets
falling from the sky.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.200
But it did create a
lot of local jobs.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.000
There was a local
metal shop for example

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.180
that made all of
the posts on which

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.220
these many, many, many thousands
of panels were suspended.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.150
And it turned what
was a safety hazard

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.170
and an environmental
hazard and an eyesore

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.155
into an economic and
environmental amenity.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.330
We often talk about
solar in terms

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.230
of the individual sites that
are prime prospects for solar.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.310
But what's happening is that
entire cities, entire counties

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.170
are beginning to look at
solar as a serious strategic

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.570
opportunity.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.490
And it would be easy to talk
about a place like Marin

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.970
County right across
the Golden Gate Bridge

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.120
from San Francisco--
generally upscale.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.050
Marin County developed
something called the Marin Clean

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:45.830
Energy, which is a self-defined
entity that has broken away

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.250
from Pacific Gas and Electric
and now purchases power

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.480
and sells power
to its customers.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.340
It has a light green option
which is 50% renewable.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.010
It has a dark green option
which is 100% renewable.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.280
It's called community
choice aggregation

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.410
and this actually
happens in Massachusetts,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.280
it happens in a number of
localities in California,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.380
and it's happening in
various other states.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.350
So that's, again, the kind of
predictable story about solar.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.960
The less predictable story
about solar I found in a city

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.340
called Lancaster, California.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.965
How many of you have
heard of Lancaster?

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:24.290
That's what I thought.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.200
It's a community of about
160,000 people in the middle

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.900
of the Mojave Desert.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.750
It was long known as a
center for gang violence

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.170
until 2008 when a man named
Rex Paris was elected mayor.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.360
Paris came out of a class-action
litigation background.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.720
Real hard nosed, right wing,
law and order guy, and he

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.490
came in saying, I'm going
to clean up this city.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.790
And he proudly told
me that under his rule

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.560
20,000 gang members
were put behind bars.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.830
And as he said to me, I don't
care about the Constitution

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.890
once you join a gang.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.990
So not exactly warm, fuzzy,
progressive politician.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.380
Thankfully though, that
same dogged determination

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.450
that he has applied to
crime-fighting in Lancaster,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.100
he's applied to developing
solar energy in the same city.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:25.020
Several years ago, he went
to a conference in China

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.080
and was sitting
amidst dignitaries

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.160
from a number of major
metropolitan centers

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.640
and he had his staff with him.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.130
And at a certain
point he felt he

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.500
needed to say his own
peace before this crowd,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.940
stood up and declared that
his city was going to become

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.320
the solar capital of the world.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.040
And I think his staff's
mouths kind of dropped open

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.120
because they weren't quite
prepared for this declaration.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.940
And people kind of
shrugged their shoulders

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.050
because who had
heard of Lancaster?

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.180
But he came back to California,
the staff set to work,

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.990
and over the course
of several years,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.839
Lancaster has developed solar
on most of its public buildings.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.619
It's encouraged local
businesses, such as this Toyota

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.400
dealership, to invest in solar.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.750
The local ball field has solar.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.200
Many of the farmlands on
the outskirts of the city

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.599
have now built utility-scale
solar facilities.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.790
And every new residential
unit built in the city today

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.430
has to either have
solar on its roof

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.280
or has to have
off-site solar that

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.680
provides at least a
portion of the electricity

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.620
for that particular
residential unit.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.580
Paris expects that Lancaster
will be a net solar energy

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.890
exporter within the
coming years and I

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.410
think he's probably right.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.070
There are plenty of
opportunities for solar

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.080
within our built environment.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.590
There are also some
constraints and I encountered

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.130
some of those constraints when
I visited my daughter, Maya,

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:05.220
at George Washington University
in the heart of Washington DC.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.040
She took me to what she
regarded as the only evidence

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.410
of solar photovoltaics on the
George Washington University

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.640
campus and that was this solar
table, which is good enough

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.600
to charge a laptop or two or
maybe a few iPhones, but not

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.000
much else.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.520
And she wasn't very
impressed with this.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.220
I was less impressed with it.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.000
And we were even
more discouraged

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.370
when George Washington
University opened

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.600
its brand new high
tech engineering

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.540
center-- $300 million LEED
gold certified building.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.710
Solar on the roof?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.040
No.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.150
Why?

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.370
Well, the answer I got was
that the District of Columbia

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.500
has very strict height limits.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.339
And if they were to put
solar panels on the roof,

00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:51.880
they would exceed
those height limits

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.370
and they'd have to
knock a floor off

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.578
of this very expensive
building, which obviously they

00:18:55.578 --> 00:18:57.260
were not willing to do.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.890
So that even impressed
my daughter and me less.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.530
But then came the really
interesting and encouraging

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.170
news and that was that
in the spring of 2014,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.260
George Washington
University announced

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.140
that it, together with the GW
Medical Center and American

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.520
University, would be buying
all the solar output from three

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.820
utility-scale solar
farms in North Carolina.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.510
With that purchase, and when
those plants go online in 2017,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.330
GW will be getting over half
of its total power needs

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.470
from the sun.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.040
There are lots of other
examples like that.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.750
On the cover of my book and
in the opening to this talk

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.350
you saw a picture of
Tempe, Arizona, which

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.140
is where Arizona
State University has

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.030
about 80 different solar
arrays on its roofs

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.920
and it gets 31% of its peak
energy demand from solar power.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.250
And it's a campus that
serves 60,000 commuters.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.744
So again, pretty impressive
solar contribution.

00:19:57.744 --> 00:19:59.160
I'm sure various
of you have heard

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.720
about the divest of
fossil fuels movements

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.220
that have been sweeping
various university campuses.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.430
I think that these universities
are great examples of how they

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.810
could-- universities can be
investing in sound alternatives

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.547
to fossil fuels, as well as
raising the question about what

00:20:17.547 --> 00:20:19.130
their universities
should be investing

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.495
in by way of their endowments.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.740
The three North Carolina
solar farms that I mentioned

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.940
are examples of utility-scale
solar built on open space.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.840
That open space can
be farmland or it

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.960
could be natural open space.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.600
The facility you see here is the
California Valley Solar Ranch.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.260
It is a facility
that now generates

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.420
enough electricity for
100,000 California households.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.260
It sits in an area called
the Carrizo Plain, which

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.740
some refer to I think,
somewhat generously,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.920
as California's Serengeti.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.440
It does have some wildlife
that the developers

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.030
of the California
Valley Solar Ranch

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.510
have taken great
pains to protect.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.520
Before constructing the solar
fields at this facility,

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.630
a team of biologists
came in and documented

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.840
what were the local wildlife
that needed to be protected.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.930
And among them, was
the San Joaquin kit

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.510
fox and the giant kangaroo rat.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.840
I have to say I had not
heard of either before I went

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.670
to the California
Valley Solar Ranch,

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.300
but these are valued species.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.680
And what they did was
they removed these species

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.870
from the solar field areas.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.080
They built what they
call temporary condos

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.670
for the giant kangaroo rats
and they built temporary dens

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.120
for the kit fox and once
the facility was complete,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.420
they allowed these creatures
to re-inhabit the area.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.610
They also built
migratory corridors

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.290
so that antelope and elk
could traverse the facility

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.720
and not be harmed
and not be disrupted

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.330
in their traditional patterns.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.080
And they set aside 12,000
acres in conservation lands

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.510
in perpetuity.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.460
So it's an example of a
very large solar facility.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.230
It sits on about
1,400 acres of land,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.130
the solar fields themselves.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.040
But a solar facility
that generates

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.530
a lot of power for a lot of
people and where great pains

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.030
were taken to protect
wildlife values.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.450
In another community,
the Moapa Paiute

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.580
are a tribe in the
southwestern-- southeastern

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.830
section of Nevada.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:39.990
And they had built a large solar
facility, again enough capacity

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:44.260
for about 100,000 households,
and what they encountered

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.650
was the desert tortoise.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.820
The desert tortoise is a
threatened species under the US

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.340
Endangered Species Act.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.580
That's one level below
being endangered,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.620
but it's worthy of protection.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.970
There about 100,000 of these
creatures left in the southwest

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:05.200
and what the Paiute did was they
collected 75 of these tortoises

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.540
from the 2,000 acres where they
were building a solar farm,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.610
fitted them with
tracking devices,

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.980
and then relocated them to a
6,000 acre conservation area

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.080
10 miles from the facility.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.090
I talked to the chair of the
Moapa Paiute very recently

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.280
and he said so far
they've lost one tortoise

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.990
and that was to a coyote attack
and that coyote attack could

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.870
have happened in the habitat
that these tortoises inhabited

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.950
beforehand.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.200
So good examples of great
pains taken to protect wildlife

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.980
values on large, open
spaces solar facilities.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.410
How many of you have heard
of concentrating solar power?

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.840
So concentrating
solar power relies

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.590
upon the thermal properties
of the sun as opposed

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.900
to the light
properties of the sun.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.000
And this particular facility
is called Crescent Dunes.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.190
It sits on the
high desert plateau

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.610
outside of a former
silver mining town

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.560
called Tonopah, Nevada.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.770
It generates enough
electricity for I

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:18.210
think 80,000 or so households
and it uses molten salt

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.710
as the vehicle for
capturing the heat that

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.330
is focused on the receiving
tower you see there.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.110
It's a 640-foot receiving tower.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.790
That molten salt is heated to
about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:36.430
and then it is pumped into
storage vessels, giant storage

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.770
vessels, where it is held
until the optimal time

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.520
to actually use that power.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.130
So what this actually allows
this solar plant to do

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.300
is surmount one of the
weaknesses of solar power,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.060
and that is its intermittency.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.690
So they can generate lots
of solar-generated heat

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.560
during the daylight
hours and then they

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.900
can use that
electricity at night

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.750
by converting the
molten salt's heat

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.360
into steam which drives a
conventional turbine much

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:10.480
as you use in a gas fired
power plant, for example.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.600
One of the challenges, however,
with concentrating solar power

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.740
facilities is that there
is a lot of heat generated

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.050
and focused on a very specific
point at the upper end

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.790
of this 640-foot tower.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.820
And what happens,
unfortunately, is

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.440
that birds that
fly through what's

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.960
called the flux-- the very
hot zone-- get killed.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.650
And this is an issue in
Riverside County where

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.540
one of these facilities, it's
called [INAUDIBLE] is located.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.660
At the Crescent
Dunes facility, which

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.034
is just about to go
into full operation,

00:25:48.034 --> 00:25:49.450
they don't expect
the same problem

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.450
because there's very little bird
life at that very high plateau

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.330
level.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.260
But it's a real issue
and it will be an issue

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.690
as we hear about more of
these facilities being

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.410
built in the future.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.590
One way to mitigate
the damage to birds

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:07.330
from thermal facilities,
concentrating power facilities,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:13.110
is to use parabolic troughs
and concentrate the solar heat

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.900
on a glass pipe that
you can see there that

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.420
runs just a few feet
above the parabolas

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.200
and therefore you have a heat
zone where birds are very, very

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.160
unlikely to be damaged.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.250
And this is a facility
called Abengoa Solana

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.094
in Western Arizona.

00:26:31.094 --> 00:26:32.510
These kinds of
facilities are also

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.980
being built across the West.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.470
But there are
challenges that we face

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.550
as we begin to develop
solar in open spaces.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.720
There are some of the
environmental community who

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.290
believes that we need
to go to great lengths

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.940
to wean ourselves
off of fossil fuels

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.520
and if we're going to do
that using solar energy,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.860
we're going to have to
generate prodigious amounts

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.680
of solar power And that is going
to mean that we're not just

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.850
going to use solar
in our built areas

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.690
but we're going to build
solar in open spaces.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.230
There are land
conservationists who

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.080
say, no way, we don't want to
industrialize our landscape.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.630
So that tension is going to grow
in the coming years and decades

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.280
as we ramp up solar power and
we see more pressure placed

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.910
upon our open spaces.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:23.040
Which brings me back to talk
about what can we achieve

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.820
within our towns and cities?

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.030
And the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.530
which is the
government's laboratory

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.752
to invest in renewable
energy, did a study

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.210
and it's estimated
that we could be

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.630
getting a fifth of our total
power needs from rooftop solar

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.200
alone.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.120
That's a prodigious
amount of electricity.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.360
That's more than we get today
from nuclear power for example.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.990
Not all homes are
created equal, however.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.980
This is our next
door neighbor's home

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.230
and as you can see it's
very heavily shaded

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.170
and there isn't much free roof
space where you'd actually

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.360
be putting solar panels.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.340
So there are those
kinds of constraints.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.490
And there are also
constraints facing renters.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:12.100
Boston renters constitute about
60% of the city's households

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.400
and on a statewide basis,
renters are about 38.5%

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.680
of all households.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.840
Renters don't have
access to their roofs,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.430
or at least they
can't install what

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.630
they wish on their rooftops,
so that is a real constraint.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.330
There are other
constraints on rooftops,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.620
such as air conditioning units,
such as in this particular case

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.450
a running track on a roof.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.860
So you can't assume
that a roof, even

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.250
if it is a substantially
sized roof,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.350
is going to be available
for solar power.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.550
One way to surmount this
particular constraint

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.560
is to build what's called
community solar facilities

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.930
or shared solar facilities.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.870
These were really
pioneered in Colorado.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.490
This particular facility is
the Venetucchi solar farm.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.010
It has 600 members
who buy shares

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.840
in the output of this facility.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.900
Some might buy a share
equivalent to one solar panel,

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.930
some might buy a share
equivalent to 10 solar panels.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.560
They in turn get a
proportionate share

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.780
of the output of this
facility deducted

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.050
from their electric bill.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.520
So this is a great way to
surmount the constraints

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520
that people might
face if they can't

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.050
put solar on their own homes.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.710
And we're seeing this
happen in a number of states

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.560
and we're seeing it happen a
number of different contexts.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.950
I was in Seattle
a few weeks ago,

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.580
and I visited the
Seattle Aquarium

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.660
where a rooftop
solar array serves

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.810
as a community solar facility.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.850
There are also plans
to develop solar

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.170
in Massachusetts
and community solar

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.000
so we'll be seeing these kinds
of facilities become available

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.250
here in the near future.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.484
There's one other
community that I

00:29:54.484 --> 00:29:56.150
want to make sure we
touch upon and that

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.190
is low-income communities.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.000
How do we bring solar power
to low income households?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.980
And this is where we haven't
seen enough progress.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.520
California is in the
lead in this area

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.210
as it is in so many other
areas regarding solar energy.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:15.960
It has required that utilities,
the three big utilities,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.250
spent $300 million
installing solar power

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.000
on low-income households,
like the household I

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.400
visited in the Bay View
district of San Francisco.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.060
The Wang family was a
recent family-- family

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.700
of recent Chinese
immigrants and they

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.020
qualified for the
low-income solar program.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.590
A group of volunteers
from Salesforce

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.250
came in under the supervision
of a nonprofit called

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.810
Grid Alternatives and spent the
day installing a solar array

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.730
on the rooftop of this home.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.980
And today, the Wang family
gets 90% of its electricity

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.150
from the sun, which is
a huge benefit in terms

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.450
of its electric bills.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.770
And a big benefit to all of us
in terms of the reduced carbon

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.395
footprint of that
particular household.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.980
Just to give you a sense of the
raw potential of solar power

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.760
this is a map that was created
using data from the National

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.710
Renewable Energy Laboratory.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.510
It was created by
Environment America.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.950
And the states that appear
in red, there 19 of them,

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.220
have 100 times or more--
or more than 100 times

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.010
the current
electricity consumption

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.660
in that state available
as solar potential.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.280
The orange states have
between 25 and 100

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.750
times current consumption
available as solar potential.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.640
Massachusetts doesn't quite
stack up in that regard.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.550
We have about two times our
total current consumption

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.360
that would be
available from the sun.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.820
But we should all be proud
that in fact Massachusetts

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.980
is doing very well
compared to other states.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.710
It's a small state, but
we're generate-- we're

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.680
number five in the nation.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.150
And we-- as you can see,
are in the winner's circle

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.810
with California,
Arizona, New Jersey--

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.270
again industrial state, but
making ample opportunity--

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.700
ample use of the
built environment

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.620
to install solar power--
and North Carolina.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.180
I should mention, by the way,
that some people again think,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.280
well Massachusetts
isn't prime for solar.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.600
The top solar producer
in the world is Germany.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.410
Germany gets about 7% of its
total power needs from the sun

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.320
and it is a cloudy, rainy
climate by and large.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.140
It has an average of 1,500
sunlight hours per year.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.150
Boston gets about 2,600--
more than 2,600 hours

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.000
of sunlight per year.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.330
So we have a lot of
potential that we

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:54.530
could tap as part
of a broader attempt

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.870
to move away from fossil fuels
and toward renewable energy.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.340
We have a number of pro-solar
solar policies in the state.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.423
I'm not going to go through
all of them right now,

00:33:03.423 --> 00:33:07.110
but we can discuss them
in the Q&amp;A if you'd like.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.770
But I think what we
have to recognize is

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.630
that solar potential is huge.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.760
Opposition to
solar is also huge.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.760
Utilities are very nervous
about solar penetration

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.170
for a variety of reasons.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.110
They're particularly
concerned about distributed

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.920
solar generation, because
they make their money

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.840
by selling kilowatt hours.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.900
And that's a fairly
simplistic model.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.370
You build a coal plant,
you turn on a coal plant,

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.870
you generate electrons, you
sell the kilowatt hours.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.510
What is being
demanded of them today

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:44.110
is that they become much
more flexible energy services

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.390
providers that might be involved
in storing energy, that might

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.880
be involved in various kinds
of smart metering, energy

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.900
efficiency.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.510
And if they don't want to go
the route of Kodak and Polaroid,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.970
they're really going to have to
become much more nimble, much

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.510
more diversified
energy providers.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.970
Fossil fuel companies
are fighting hard

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.760
against pro-solar policies
at the federal level

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.750
and at the state level.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.630
So we've got to reckon
with them as well.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:17.409
But I think that we all need
to look at the bigger picture

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:21.630
and embrace the opportunities
that solar presents.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.610
Reckon with some of the
legitimate questions

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.449
that are being raised.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.150
But the profundity
of the transformation

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.900
that we're going
to have to undergo

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.060
is going to involve
some trade offs.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.409
There is no such
thing as clean energy.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.469
There's cleaner energy
and dirtier energy.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.550
And solar offers some
huge opportunities,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.540
some huge
environmental benefits,

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.510
and some personal
satisfaction, such

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.214
as I described
earlier in my talk.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.570
I just wanted to invite
you to join my family

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.050
in reading "Harness the Sun".

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.920
I call this picture
"Harnessing the sun while

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.840
sitting in the shade".

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.310
Thank you all for coming
and happy hear comments

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.980
and questions.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.230
Yeah?

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.966
AUDIENCE: So looking
around the room,

00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:10.340
I think I'm one
of the few people

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.600
[INAUDIBLE] marketing
side of Google.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.494
But I actually [INAUDIBLE]
marketing problem.

00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:20.420
I get ads all the time
from natural gas groups

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.430
and frequently see
a lot in the market

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.031
for an uninformed
consumer, letting

00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:26.656
them know about other
alternatives that

00:35:26.656 --> 00:35:27.656
aren't related to solar.

00:35:27.656 --> 00:35:31.014
And I'm wondering what you're
opinion is on why that may be.

00:35:31.014 --> 00:35:33.934
Why there isn't being more
done from just a pure marketing

00:35:33.934 --> 00:35:36.796
standpoint to show off the
benefits of solar and the cost

00:35:36.796 --> 00:35:38.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.810
PHILIP WARBURG:
You're saying, who

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.300
are the marketers per say,
you mean the telemarketing

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.110
that we're getting?

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.651
AUDIENCE: No,
literally, I'll see ads

00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:47.010
on TV or on YouTube for
why natural gas is great.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.700
It's probably lobbyist, I'm not
sure what groups are behind it.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.960
You don't-- all the benefits
that we know about--

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.460
how much cheaper it can be and
all the different things like

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.620
that don't come out for
something like solar.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.890
PHILIP WARBURG: Well, first
the fossil fuel industry

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.460
has huge resources to draw
upon in terms of marketing.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.680
They've been doing
it for decades.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.600
One of the advantages
they have is

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.230
that they have a fairly
unquestioned panoply

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.320
of federal and state subsidies
that they've been getting

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.336
for decades and decades.

00:36:18.336 --> 00:36:19.960
And I think what's
happening with solar

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.100
is it's the new entrant onto the
scene, along with wind power,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.660
and everyone is scrutinizing it.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.520
So the incentives for solar,
the incentives for wind,

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.100
are questioned and become
political footballs in Congress

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.830
in a way that the
subsidies for oil and gas

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.800
and nuclear and coal do not.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.100
I think that's a
serious problem.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.040
I think solar marketers
are getting more and more

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.100
proactive, more and more.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.200
Sophisticated I have to say,
and we were talking over lunch,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.320
I get several calls a week
from solar companies wanting

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.580
to put solar on my
roof and I politely

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.590
tell my have solar on my roof.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.935
And Jason was saying that he
gets calls from solar companies

00:37:00.935 --> 00:37:03.310
and he politely tells them he
can't put solar on his roof

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.520
because it's too shaded.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.450
I think that we're seeing a
fairly robust, competitive,

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.682
climate right now for solar.

00:37:10.682 --> 00:37:12.390
One of the interesting
things about solar

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.640
is that there are lots
and lots of players.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.870
There are small players,
like Sunlight Solar Energy

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.210
which installed our
facility, very small company.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.370
It has annual revenues of
about $10 million a year

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.250
on up through SolarCity.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.580
And it's a very,
very new industry.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.090
As I said, I myself
wasn't convinced in 2012

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.330
the solar was something
to be taken seriously.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.080
Three years later,
solar is a buzz

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.680
in all kinds of
technology circles.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.330
We're seeing the
technology itself

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.220
improve very dramatically.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.770
And I think it needs
some smart marketing

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.250
acumen applied but I think it
really is beginning to happen.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.878
AUDIENCE: I guess I was thinking
more about the branding of it.

00:37:55.878 --> 00:37:59.895
So not of individual-- someone
saying I want to install it,

00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:03.148
but just the
concept of it, which

00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:06.777
it may just be a resources
thing or industry [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:06.777 --> 00:38:08.860
PHILIP WARBURG: I think
some of the bigger numbers

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.600
need to get out there so that
people recognize it's not just

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.630
at the margins.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.270
So for example, the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.156
does great research.

00:38:17.156 --> 00:38:18.530
That research
doesn't necessarily

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.686
get the circulation it should.

00:38:20.686 --> 00:38:23.060
One of their studies that I
find particularly interesting

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.620
is called Renewable
Electricity Futures

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.950
and it came out in 2012.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:30.440
And projected that using
technology that is commercially

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.750
available today,
we could be getting

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.110
half of our total
powered needs by 2050

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.050
from the wind and the sun alone.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.660
So that kind of
statistic says to me,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.620
these are serious part-- these
are serious technologies that

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.190
could really transform the way
we think about the energy we

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.360
use and the energy we produce.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.529
And I think people have to
be attuned to those messages

00:38:54.529 --> 00:38:55.570
when they do get covered.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.890
They do get covered probably
in the higher brow media, maybe

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:02.150
not in the broader
maybe, I'm not sure.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.090
I think solar has one advantage
and that is its immediacy

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.710
and that people can
relate to the fact

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.160
that solar is happening again by
just looking at their neighbors

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.660
roofs.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.770
It's not some remote
concept out there

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.220
that they don't
really understand.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:22.190
It's palpable and it is within
our reach quite literally.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.342
Yes?

00:39:23.342 --> 00:39:27.310
AUDIENCE: What might you say to
someone like Jason or others--

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.195
my roof I have slate
and doesn't quite

00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:31.278
point the right direction.

00:39:31.278 --> 00:39:32.766
There's lots of challenges.

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:34.750
A community-based one
that you had mentioned

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.726
might be great for
something like that.

00:39:37.726 --> 00:39:39.875
But how do you-- are
there groups that

00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:41.607
are helping to initiate that?

00:39:41.607 --> 00:39:42.190
To find space?

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.629
To help provide the
funding mechanisms-- Again,

00:39:46.629 --> 00:39:48.920
PHILIP WARBURG: It is just
starting up in Massachusetts

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.010
so I think you will be
hearing a lot more about it

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.920
in the next year.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.880
And if you ask where
it's happening,

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.395
you might just find that there
is a community solar facility

00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:58.560
that you can invest in.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.640
There is a problem in that
again, between 22% and 27%

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.020
of residential roof tops
are well suited to solar.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:12.020
You happen to be in that other
majority which is unfortunate,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.530
but there are opportunities.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.310
What's happening prospectively
I think is interesting.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.960
Our building stock turns over
on average every 42 years.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.450
So we're not just talking about
how do we introduce solar today

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.980
and tomorrow and next year.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.980
We're talking about how do
we create a wholly different

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.000
orientation-- and I
mean that both literally

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.970
and figuratively-- so
that we incorporate solar

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.310
much more fully into our lives.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:40.050
Madison, Wisconsin is an
example of a city that

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:46.350
requires that new
residential areas be designed

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:50.760
on an east-west north-south
grid so that houses can be

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.740
built that will be solar-ready.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.670
They're not yet saying
you must build solar,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.010
but they're saying
that the overall layout

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.322
of new communities has
to be amenable to solar.

00:41:01.322 --> 00:41:02.780
And we're seeing
that kind of thing

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.420
happen in a lot of
different localities.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.460
In some localities
they are actually,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.080
as I said, mandating
that solar be installed.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.840
I think with some older
houses that have slate,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.390
with houses that are
shaded, there are trade offs

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.130
that one has to consider.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.590
When is your roof
going to be replaced?

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.890
Is that tree a tree that
you cherish or is it

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:28.530
a tree that you would rather
sacrifice to the solar cause?

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.667
And there are great
advantages to shade trees

00:41:30.667 --> 00:41:33.250
in the summertime so you don't
want to be foolish and cut down

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.087
a tree only to
generate solar power

00:41:35.087 --> 00:41:37.670
to fuel the air conditioning you
have to use because you don't

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.836
have a shaded house anymore.

00:41:38.836 --> 00:41:41.080
So those are the kinds
of considerations

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.864
that I think you have to weigh.

00:41:42.864 --> 00:41:44.155
Did I see another hand in here?

00:41:44.155 --> 00:41:45.105
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was wondering what

00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:46.938
your thoughts are on
needing to store energy

00:41:46.938 --> 00:41:48.627
to make solar [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:48.627 --> 00:41:50.210
PHILIP WARBURG: I
think that goes back

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:55.020
to the question of what is the
function that our utilities

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.420
play today and what function
do we play in generating

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.420
power and storing power.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.250
I'm sure you've all been hearing
about the power wall that

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.230
is being proposed or already
being marketed on a household

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.440
level, on a business level.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.440
One can begin to store
solar power on those levels.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.240
There are also much larger
means of storing solar power.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.290
For example, pumped
hydro storage

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:27.810
is a great way to capture a
lot of surplus electricity

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.280
when let's say
the sun is shining

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.720
or when you have major
wind farms producing

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.360
huge amounts of wind power
in the middle of the night

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.920
when no one needs that power.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.260
So if you can pair
those facilities

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.130
with a pumped storage facility,
pump the water into a storage

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.180
reservoir, release that water
when the power is needed,

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.700
you have a great
storage resource.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.470
I think we also have to
just get much, much smarter

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:55.060
about how we manage
our own use of energy

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.760
and that has to do with
the lights in this room,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.690
has to do with computers
in our household,

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.620
it has to do with
industrial refrigeration,

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.030
it has to do with
heating and cooling,

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.660
where utilities could be playing
a much more significant role,

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.490
where Google I'm sure we'll be
playing a much more significant

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.050
role in helping us manage our
energy use in a wiser and more

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.320
energy-conserving
and better timed way

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.050
so that it actually does sync
with the power resources that

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.330
are available.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.610
One other resource I
should mention, by the way,

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.320
is car batteries.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:36.410
If we had a fleet of tens of
millions of electric vehicles

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.980
your average car is driven
let's say 20-- an hour

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.050
a day, half hour day,
hour and a half a day.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.250
So you have the vast
majority of the day

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.930
when your car is sitting
idle and that battery could

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:56.810
be used to charge
your car or it could

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.190
be used to de-charge
and in fact fill in some

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.990
of the bumps in the
electric power grid

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.480
if there was a well-integrated,
smartly coordinated use

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.931
of that battery resource.

00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:10.430
The great thing
about that is you're

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.450
not just creating
battery as storage,

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.860
you're creating
battery as mobility

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.700
and it also serves
a storage function

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.380
when the car isn't being
used for mobility purposes.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.010
So again, I think
there's no single answer

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.550
and I think we've
got to move away

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:28.240
from the kind of monofix
that is going to solve

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.217
our future energy problems.

00:44:30.217 --> 00:44:32.300
There isn't a monofix It's
going to be a much more

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.599
complex environment,
a smarter environment,

00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:36.390
and one hopefully that
is much more reliant

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.641
upon renewable resources.

00:44:39.641 --> 00:44:40.140
Yes?

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.640
Is there still aggressive
tax subsidization

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.640
of installation in
public technologies

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.140
the way there was we were
seeing three, four, five

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.140
or is that largely [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.660
PHILIP WARBURG: There is a
federal investment tax credit.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.140
I wouldn't use word aggressive.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.307
I would say perhaps,

00:44:58.307 --> 00:44:59.390
AUDIENCE: --Massachusetts.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.470
PHILIP WARBURG: --robust.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.865
OK.

00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:04.240
First, on the
federal level there

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.450
is an investment tax credit.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:13.220
A 30% tax credit available
for solar installers and that

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.200
can be at the
utility level, it can

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.510
be at the non-residential
level, and it can

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.880
be at the residential level.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.890
That tax credit is slated
to sunset at the end of 2016

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.780
entirely for
residential properties

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.380
and it will drop
from 30% percent

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:32.300
to 10% for non-residential
and utility scale solar.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.410
That will have a very,
very serious impact

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.490
on the solar industry.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:41.570
In a number of states there
are a number of incentives

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.820
that are being phased back.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.240
There used to be much
higher solar rebates

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.180
for example in Massachusetts.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.220
They had been phased
way down and that's

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.910
true in a lot of other states.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.160
There are tradeable credits
called solar renewable energy

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.700
certificates that
are still in effect,

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.490
although the Massachusetts
legislature is considering ways

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.090
to phase them out
in future years.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:11.490
I think any energy technology
requires an incentive

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.570
to get it off the ground.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.950
And I think what troubles me
when people hyper scrutinize

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.200
the solar subsidies
is they're not again,

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.590
looking at the playing field
that solar has to play on.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:26.467
We're talking about royalties
on mineral extraction

00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:28.550
in America that are among
the lowest in the world.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.640
We're talking about all
kinds of depletion allowances

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.110
and other benefits
to the oil industry.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.820
We're talking about an act
called the Price-Anderson Act

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.590
Act that allows nuclear
reactors basically

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.760
to function in this country.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:48.320
It sets a cap of half a billion
dollars per reactor accident

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.194
as the liability limit for a
reactor owner and operator.

00:46:52.194 --> 00:46:54.110
The rest is covered by
the federal government.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:58.360
Without that cap, civilian
nuclear would go nowhere.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.780
And so we're not talking
about a level playing field

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.620
and we are talking
about creating

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.590
some incentives to jump start
an industry, which is really

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.110
in its infancy.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:16.220
And we have to think about why
we're so interested in moving

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.620
a sustainable energy
technology forward

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.049
and build from
there toward well,

00:47:21.049 --> 00:47:23.590
what are the steps we need to
take to integrate it more fully

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.266
into our economy?

00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:27.010
Yeah?

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.260
AUDIENCE: Just to add to the
point that you just made,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.010
the [INAUDIBLE] published
study a couple of months ago

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:36.120
which said that G20 countries
pay over $1,000 per citizen

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.851
in fossil fuel subsidies
and in the United States

00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:42.075
it's $2,000 per
citizen which I think

00:47:42.075 --> 00:47:45.160
dwarfs any of the
solar subsidies.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.054
PHILIP WARBURG: That's
a great example.

00:47:47.054 --> 00:47:48.720
There is a lot of
debate right now about

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.340
whether solar
homeowners are cross--

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.280
are being cross-subsidized
by average rate payers.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.550
And there may be some
of that going on.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.300
There's a lot of
studying going on

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:05.820
as to whether there needs to be
some adjustment in net metering

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.990
pay regime.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.450
And we'll see adjustments
being made going forward

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.860
but I think it's very
important, again, to give people

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.780
an incentive to go into
a frontier technology

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.260
that people might have
apprehensions about

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.610
and where you break down
some of that resistance

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.430
by helping people recognize
some of the economic benefits

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.256
of moving towards solar energy.

00:48:28.256 --> 00:48:28.756
Yeah?

00:48:28.756 --> 00:48:30.995
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a sense of the chance

00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:33.120
that the federal [INAUDIBLE]
is going to be renewed

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.550
or is it gone?

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.110
PHILIP WARBURG: My
guess is that what

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:43.340
we might see is a more graduated
phasing out of the-- right now

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.740
it's a pretty radical 30% to
zero for residential solar

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.030
and 30% to 10% for the others.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.360
I would hope we'd at least see
a more gradual phasing down

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.660
of that incentive, but
the whims of Congress

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.790
are a little hard to predict.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:02.290
Yes?

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.720
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.890
One of the early slides
if you could have shown--

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.212
the cost of installing
is going down

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:10.670
for residential
and non-residential

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:11.640
on the utility scale.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.065
With that in mind, is it
much more cost-efficient

00:49:14.065 --> 00:49:17.945
to invest in community
solar than to have everybody

00:49:17.945 --> 00:49:19.387
put it up on their own?

00:49:19.387 --> 00:49:21.720
PHILIP WARBURG: One of the
advantages of community solar

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.820
is you can choose
an optimal site.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.910
And because you're
building a larger

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:31.090
scale per installed
panel, it is cheaper.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:36.160
So yes, there are
cost benefits there.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.320
Utility scale is also-- is
cheaper still, much cheaper

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:39.950
still.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.720
You have the issue of
transmission right?

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.090
Because if you're building
one of those large facilities

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.010
like the California
Valley Solar Ranch,

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.240
you've got to transmit
that power from that ranch

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.950
into the grid and
to, in that case,

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.180
I think it's the LA
Department of Water and Power

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:58.840
where that power is ultimately
going to be consumed.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.160
So larger scale does allow
for more efficient citing.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.430
One of the things that is--
we're waking up to a little bit

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.430
is we're not just
talking about what are

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:09.820
called the hard cost of solar.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.986
We're not just talking about
the cost of the panels,

00:50:11.986 --> 00:50:13.320
or of the inverters.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.410
We're talking about the
soft costs, marketing costs,

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.030
the permitting costs.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.740
And what we have found
is that Germany-- one

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.640
of the reasons German solar
is cheaper per installed watt

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.970
than American solar is
because the soft costs are

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.120
a fraction-- they're about
10% percent of our soft costs

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.800
because they've gotten very,
very effective about marketing

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.180
and very expedited about their
permitting of solar facilities.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.740
So there are opportunities
to economize on solar they

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.260
we're just beginning to tap.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.806
AUDIENCE: Do you see--
you put up also the map

00:50:48.806 --> 00:50:50.240
of the red and yellow states.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.228
Do you see one of these
red states just coming

00:50:52.228 --> 00:50:54.713
forward and doing what
the mayor of Lancaster did

00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:56.701
and saying we're just
going to export solar

00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:57.695
to the whole country.

00:50:57.695 --> 00:51:01.512
And Nevada has basically
an eastern border

00:51:01.512 --> 00:51:03.970
and a western border and there's
not a whole lot in between

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:04.470
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:09.575 --> 00:51:11.950
PHILIP WARBURG: That's to some
degree happened with wind.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.640
Where if you look at Iowa,
Iowa now generates about 28%

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.990
of its total power from wind.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:21.090
It has decided that wind is an
important export commodity, as

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.610
well as a commodity that's
being used within its borders.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.160
Same thing with Wyoming.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.800
In the case of
solar, my guess is

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.050
we're going to see a more even
distribution across a variety

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.430
of different contexts.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:39.990
I think that that tension that
I described between open spaces

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:44.760
protection and
solar exploitation

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.570
will lead us to rely
upon farmland-based solar

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.300
much more than on natural
spaces based solar.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.950
And if you look at
our country-- I'm

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.390
sure you've all flown
across the country--

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.930
and you see the grid
of farmed America,

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.860
there are huge, huge parts
of the country that it would

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.880
be very hard to call natural.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.530
And so I think if you're talking
about converting a soy field

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:12.320
or corn field or an
alfalfa field to solar,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.140
you're talking about a very
different kind of wildlife

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.030
versus renewable
energy trade off

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.800
than you are if you're
talking about open desert land

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.950
where there are species
that people are very

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:24.390
concerned about protecting.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.120
One opportunity I think
it's in California where,

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.930
as of 2013-- I couldn't
find the number for 2014--

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:35.280
but as a 2013, more than a
quarter of a million acres

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.760
were still in
cotton cultivation.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.440
Cotton is a water
intensive crop.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.070
It's not an essential food crop.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.570
It's expensive to
grow in California.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.620
There's one huge
solar opportunity

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.610
and the rate of solarization in
California is terrific as well.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.490
So I think if we
look at farmlands--

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.160
and we're seeing
farmlands developed

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.570
in places like
Maryland, for example--

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.340
one of the advantages, by the
way of solar photovoltaics as

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.030
compared to concentrating
solar power is

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:08.470
that you can locate solar
fields that are not necessarily

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.110
immediately adjacent
to one another.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:13.950
So if you have scattered
corn fields with forest land

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.090
in between you could build
the solar on those cornfields

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.550
and protect the forest lands.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.930
You can't really do that with
concentrating solar power

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:24.030
because you need a
very large area where

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:28.030
you are focusing all of that
heat energy on the receiving

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:29.340
tower.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.160
So I think plenty
of opportunities.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.840
More likely on what you
could call degraded lands,

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.780
as in farmlands
or, again, looking

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.780
at brownfield properties
than on natural open spaces.

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.550
Maybe one more question.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.020
AUDIENCE: The place that I
see would be ideal for putting

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:49.936
these is parking lots.

00:53:49.936 --> 00:53:51.580
Like you were saying
at the stadium,

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.413
it's a great place to
park-- it can give you

00:53:53.413 --> 00:53:54.849
shade and protection from rain.

00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:55.765
PHILIP WARBURG: Right.

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.470
AUDIENCE: Any chance of
developing those more?

00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:59.511
PHILIP WARBURG: Yeah, I
mean they are developing.

00:53:59.511 --> 00:54:03.070
The cover my book has
a large parking garage

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:07.200
at the Tempe Campus at
Arizona State University.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.740
Rutgers University at
its Livingston Campus

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.050
has major parking
canopies built as well.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.620
The NFL stadiums are
using that same approach.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.260
It's a great opportunity.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.929
It is more expensive
per unit for example

00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:22.470
than ground-mounted
solar because you

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.450
have to build the
superstructure which

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.410
is a larger superstructure
than simply building the row

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.240
after row of solar panels.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.910
But it's certainly
a huge opportunity.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.785
And a lot of people for example,
when they look at New Jersey,

00:54:33.785 --> 00:54:35.160
and they say,
look, we don't want

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.890
to encroach upon our farmland,
we have little enough of it

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:41.720
left, they say, look
at parking lots.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.680
And look at warehouse
roofs and those

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.840
are certainly opportunities
that we could exploit.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.670
Thank you all very
much for coming.
