1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,220
All right. Good people or the
Internet, sorry for the delay, right.

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:18,221
They're joining me today is a professor
of marketing at Concordia University,

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,370
an author and a behavioral scientist.
But most importantly,

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,850
I believe officially right now the most
returning guests to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,770
Dr Gad said,
welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,790
So kind of retaught me again to put
up with me yet again. All right,

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,720
well I thought we do this just one
more time. Let's just finish this.

8
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,900
You know what I mean?
This every couple of months.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,100
It's been 16 months since my last
appearance. It's been 16 months,

10
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:50,060
I think it was in August, 2017 so it's
been awhile. Well, it's sort of fitting.

11
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:52,970
So this is actually my
last taping of the year.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,150
We've taped where you have a couple more
shows coming out that we taped earlier

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,290
this week because of my travel schedule.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,580
But I thought it's kind of fitting that
you're in my last show of 2018 because

15
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,650
you were the first of the first.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,680
You did our first test show or a
TV in August of 2015 that's right.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,990
So over three years ago,
about three and a half years ago.

18
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:15,650
That feels like freaking lifetime.
Look at you now. You're like,

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,660
are you the most famous person
in the world? Now? Third
Most Lady Gaga, Pewdie Pie.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,330
Pretty Pioneer. And there you go. But
it does seem like a lifetime ago. And I,

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,830
more than anything else,
I want to cover a ton of new ground today.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,530
That's what I want to do.
Got a lot of new ground right here.

23
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:33,860
And I know you're working on all sorts
of things and you got a new book coming

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,790
and everything else.

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,530
But first I thought because you also are
on Patrion and this happens to be the

26
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:42,370
topic that everyone's talking
about at the moment. Uh,

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,380
I want to just talk a little bit
about censorship and platforming and D

28
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:47,660
platforming and the rest of it.
Um,

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,480
do you want to lay out quickly what
happened to Sargon or do you want me to do

30
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:52,040
it? Uh, no, you go ahead and do it. So,

31
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:56,600
just very briefly for people that don't
know a Sargon of Akkad who is a popular

32
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,080
Youtuber,

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,950
he was one of the first sort of from the
classical liberal space when I was kind

34
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,680
of waking up to what was going on with uh,

35
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,820
with the left related to free
speech and sort of the SJW hysteria.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,880
Everyone said you gotta
talk to Sargon of a cod.

37
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,570
I didn't even know if it was a real
person or who the hell this guy was. Um,

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,930
he was booted off Patrion
a couple of days ago, uh,

39
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,990
with no recourse with no warning because
10 months ago in February on another

40
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:25,370
channel,
not his own channel,

41
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:30,371
that's very tiny youtube channel with
4,000 subscribers on an audio interview

42
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,230
show with the Non English native speaker,

43
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:36,650
which I only mentioned
because the conversation was
a little stilted because of

44
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:37,430
the language.

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,930
He said the n word and he said
it not to be racially pejorative,

46
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,620
but he said it because he was sort of
using the language of the alt right

47
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,620
against themselves.
Patriot heard him say this,

48
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:52,070
they don't think about or look
into context and they booed him.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,880
And this is actually a pretty
big thing in our space.

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,560
I usually don't like talking to this much
at the beginning of a show and I hand

51
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:00,881
it to you.

52
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,000
What do you make of what's going on with
platform and [inaudible] platform and

53
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,780
we are both on Patrion et cetera.
Well, I'll just say that, uh,

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I mean I was heavily hit but
my pi of the big Patrion yeah,

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,000
my slice of the pie is very small.

56
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,980
I had maybe 600 patrons and I think I
checked last maybe a day and a half ago

57
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,520
and I had lost more than a hundred
out of 600 or so. That's a lie.

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,880
So that's a lie. It's not a lot of money
that I'm making under the platform,

59
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:32,080
but it still hurts. Uh, I
really think that it stems from,

60
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,870
and I think it might be one of the
things that you had on the list for us to

61
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:39,760
talk about. You know, oftentimes people
pit these binaries against one another.

62
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,710
You're either thinking person or in
multiple person, you either, uh, you know,

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,510
it's either rational or emotional.

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,760
I think one of the things
that you're writing about,

65
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm writing about this in the book,
right?

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Because I want to explain this very quick
trigger of our treasure arises in many

67
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,280
contexts in universities and companies
and when they deep platform people,

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,230
so I think people use these fast and
frugal you eristics oftentimes is uris

69
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,100
sticks work well.

70
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,220
But on other other cases where you miss
apply an emotional reaction in a context

71
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:14,650
where it would require a
bit more cognitive effort,

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,510
this is where you get
some of these problems.

73
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,800
So can you give me an example of first,

74
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,140
when does a heuristic that just
is like the immediate reaction?

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,420
If I'm walking down,
uh,

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,020
taking a shortcut to go home and I
see three young men that look quite

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,670
suspicious, uh, my heart starts
racing, I start maybe sweating a bit,

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,460
uh,
my blood pressure goes up.

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,610
So I'm getting a emotional reaction that's
physiological based precisely because

80
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,970
it makes sense at that moment for
this autonomic reaction to take place.

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,280
If I'm trying to solve a calculus
problem than calling all of my emotional

82
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,380
system into action might
not be the right thing.

83
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:58,381
So the argument is that it's not that we
are either rational or emotional being,

84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,070
it's that you should trigger,
forgive the term. Yeah,

85
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,890
he should activate the correct
system at the appropriate time.

86
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,400
And I think what happens with a lot of
these social justice warrior types is

87
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:14,401
that they're very much driven by the
emotional system in the wrong context.

88
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,800
And that's what you get the kinds of
situations like with Sargon. Yeah.

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,030
So to live life as a functioning human,
you need a little push and pull on that.

90
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,140
Right? Right, exactly.

91
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,350
You need the emotive stuff and
then you need the cognitive stuff.

92
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,580
Why do you think this is
happening at these platforms?

93
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,980
Why do you think they are bowing?
I mean,

94
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,710
they're really just bowing
to the mob every time.

95
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,790
And the reason I'm so concerned about it
is not only just because of how I feel

96
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,130
about free speech, but
we're watching. I mean,

97
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,270
we're just in slow motion watching
those lines. They're coming both ways,

98
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:51,250
but mostly it's coming. Let's say from
the SJW left, so I'll use this hand.

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,470
It's moving really fast this way,

100
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,560
where it's going to be that everybody
is going to be on the outs because if a

101
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,500
guy like are,

102
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,090
who as far as I can tell is just an
old school liberal and you know he's a

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,860
provocateur. I'm going
to show twice. Yeah.

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,980
And he never said anything
that struck me as unreasonable.

105
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,980
He seems like a very reasonable, fair guy.
Yeah. And look, he's a bit of a troll.

106
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,230
He's a bit bit of a provocateur,
all of those things.

107
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,680
But the point is that if a guy like Carl,
Carl Benjamin, that's his real name,

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,380
if he can't be on a platform,

109
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:22,340
then half the people that we
know and maybe that includes us,

110
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,630
can't be on these platforms.

111
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,450
So what do you think is happening
at the high levels of that?

112
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,910
Of what I mean it's a
combination of many things.

113
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:33,140
I think one of the things is that
this, this the, the I call it,

114
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,460
or in my Canadian Senate in 2017
when I went to talk about bill,

115
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:41,000
she's 16 lovely boat tonight.
Thank you very much. Oh, I
thank you for remembering.

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,050
Uh, I talked about the, I'm a victim,
therefore I am ethos, right? Uh,

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,090
it used to be out. I think
therefore I am now is I'm a victim.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,860
So to, to, to stay true
to a victimology ethos,

119
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,620
you have to be outraged.
You have to be indignant,

120
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:00,810
you have to self flagellate at
the altar of progressivism and,

121
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,550
and people are cognitive misers. In
other words, they're cognitively lazy.

122
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,850
And now I've got this autonomic system
that where I can draw on my emotional

123
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:13,280
indignation to navigate through the world.
Well,

124
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,960
for the social justice warrior types,

125
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,810
it's easy to fall prey to the hyper
activation of the emotional system.

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,070
Right? As you said, it's not
that we are this or that. And I,

127
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,520
I think I emailed you yesterday,

128
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:29,330
one of the concepts that I'm developing
in my book is this idea of what I call

129
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,880
epistemological.
They Kowtow mania at diff,

130
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,210
seeing the world as sort
of opposing binary's.

131
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,270
We are rational and we are emotional.

132
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,720
They are very clear evolutionary reasons
why we've evolved the capacity to think,

133
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,610
but also very clear evolutionary
reasons why anger and envy and shot than

134
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,980
farther and compassion have also evolved.

135
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,850
So we're both just triggered the
right system at the right time.

136
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,730
So do you think part of it is just
that the speed of the Internet,

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,510
the fact that you can be on Twitter so
quickly releasing this stuff that you can

138
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,910
learn more faster now?
Right?

139
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:05,450
You can listen to podcasts in double
speed and that you can take in so much

140
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,620
inflammation and shoot out so much
information that that maybe is triggering

141
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,720
your word, some of the, the
hyperactive emotional stuff. Yeah,

142
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,880
I mean as opposed to using a
more rational, logical, although,

143
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,670
or you're not succumbing to that.
Right? So, so what's wrong with me?

144
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,510
So it is really an interaction perhaps of
the environment that you're describing,

145
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,730
but it has to be the right personality.

146
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:29,570
Who succumbs to that hyper
active emotional system.
You're not succumbing to it.

147
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm not succumbing to it.
And so I'd like for people to develop if,

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,740
I don't know if this is the right term
or a good term, but at mental hygiene,

149
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:40,220
right? In the same way that
we develop personal hygiene.
I mean stop for a minute,

150
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:44,320
think about it that, what's the
context under which Sargon you know,

151
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,470
uttered that particular world word and
now that there is so much information

152
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:52,220
that suggests that there was a context,
why can't you reverse it?

153
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,640
Why can't you set it correctly? Well, it's
because it's very, for people to admit,

154
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,960
Mia Culpa,
I was wrong.

155
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,260
And so then they anchor in their position
and nothing's going to move them from

156
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,700
them. It's very bad business. You know,

157
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,250
it's interesting because
I do find there are times,

158
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,650
especially lately I've
really been trying to,

159
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,830
not that I was ever like over the
top hostile to people on Twitter,

160
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,240
but I used to go in and attack people
more and or, or not attack people,

161
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,350
but usually attack ideas.

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,070
But now I do find a lot of times I
write a draft and I kind of just take a

163
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:21,720
breath and I'm like,
you know what?

164
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,721
Maybe just let this go because I sense
there's a growing feeling and maybe it's

165
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,561
only online.

166
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:32,580
I hope it's only online that people
really want to burn everything down. Yeah.

167
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,190
Do you sense that, I mean, as
someone that studies behavior,

168
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,960
you studied behavior that, that
people who live in the West, you know,

169
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,370
I live in the United States,
you wouldn't kind of,

170
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,670
we live in two of the freest
countries in the history of the world.

171
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,500
You can wake up if you live in America
or Canada and basically do what ever you

172
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,870
want. It doesn't mean you're
going to be successful at it,

173
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,190
but you can try at least.

174
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,700
And yet there is this growing feeling
that we got to just tear this whole thing

175
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:00,430
down. Yeah. It's unbelievable.
I mean, one of the, the, the,

176
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,500
the things that people tell me when
they meet me in person, as I said, well,

177
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:09,090
you know, I've seen you brawl with people
on Twitter and yet in the rest of your

178
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,180
interactions, you seem to be so
lovely and jovial and friendly.

179
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,890
While the reality is that Twitter brings
out the worst in all of us right? It,

180
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,720
I analogize it,

181
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:23,010
it's akin to two guys brawling
in an alley. Right? But they,

182
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,710
you oftentimes,
those who criticize you will,

183
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,140
will commit what's called the
fundamental attribution error,

184
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,680
the fundamental attribution error. If I
may just stay society, it's where you,

185
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,820
you missed the here to teach
me [inaudible] kind of APP.

186
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,710
You miss attribute something
dispositionally to the
person when it should have

187
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:44,760
been attributed to the situation.
Right? So when I am brawling,

188
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,090
usually with a smile on my
face with someone on Twitter,

189
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,040
it's the situation that's at hand
that's causing me to be combative.

190
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,720
That's not my disposition.
When I,

191
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,510
when I tuck my children
to bed and I kissed him,

192
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,450
I don't troll them and call them
customer at all. Right? But,

193
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,710
but somehow people attribute that to you.

194
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:08,190
Dispositionally you're a combative person,
then they meet you and say, my God,

195
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,300
you're so warm and smiley and so on.
Uh,

196
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,760
so I think there are all sorts of really
interesting psychological processes

197
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:18,540
that are causing us to behave in ways
on Twitter that otherwise we wouldn't

198
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,590
behave that way.
It would be interesting.

199
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,210
I don't know if you know
anything about this specifically,

200
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:24,690
but just because of the way you've
studied behavior to show that when other

201
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,390
technologies came out over
the course of human history,

202
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,510
if they so quickly change the
way we behave with each other,

203
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,600
so say when the printing press came out
and now more people that information did

204
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:37,320
that immediately mean that people are
yelling at each other more or something

205
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,190
like that. I wonder if there is some, I
don't know about that, but what I can say.

206
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,750
Do you know what is the one industry
that is always at the cutting edge of

207
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:49,410
technology? Yes. My friend.
It's porn. Very good.

208
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,800
Look at nights I saw, I'm
looking at exact says, you know,

209
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,230
we're not going to do this. It's
unbelievable. Guys are moving to tape.

210
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm going to do this on film. And yeah,
but so what's the purpose there? Well,

211
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,760
it's just that they're always trying
to find the new ways to deliver that

212
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,000
consumer story experience to
you and therefore they are at,

213
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,670
they're not just creating pornography,

214
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,040
which is not very difficult to explain
from an evolutionary perspective.

215
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,660
They are really at the,

216
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,630
at the front of finding new technologies
to deliver these systems. So,

217
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,920
which speaks to another point
that I was going to talk about.

218
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,480
Oftentimes I get emails from people.
Why did you choose to apply, you know,

219
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,920
all your biological, uh, knowledge, your
psychological knowledge to marketing?

220
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,630
And the answer to that for me is that
marketing and consumer behavior is the

221
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,220
perfect place to study human nature.
Short of my breathing,

222
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,470
the thing that I do most is consume,

223
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,950
but I don't just consume Coca Cola
and Starbucks. I consume friendships,

224
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,890
we consume ideas, we consume
religious narratives. We,

225
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,570
so everything is conservatory.

226
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,560
So the reason why I love marketing so
much because people think of the term

227
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:01,210
marketing in a colloquial sense. You're
trying to market the next HIP party,

228
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,760
right? So they think I sit
there and I design, uh, Ma, uh,

229
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,110
restaurant menus as my job.
Well, if that was true,

230
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,020
you probably have a lot more money.
If you had mastered that,

231
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:14,980
what the Hell would you be teaching
for? Exactly? Marketing is really,

232
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,010
so some marketers or marketing professors
are anthropologists who study the,

233
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,710
the,
the ethnography of consumption.

234
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,880
Others are psychologists who study the
psychological basis of consumption.

235
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,170
Others are applied mathematicians on
the same way that a climatologist uses

236
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:36,910
mathematical models to study climate
systems, applied mathematicians,

237
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,140
study marketing systems.

238
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,260
So people have to understand that there's
a different term that's being used.

239
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,740
When you think about marketing as a
colloquial term versus marketing as a

240
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,610
scientific discipline.

241
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,210
Marketing as a scientific discipline
is simply the application of cognitive

242
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,710
disciplines for the study of
the marketing realm. Okay,

243
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,380
so if we want to bring
this back then to the,

244
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,830
to the first question about the
platforming, as a behavioral scientist,

245
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,580
perhaps we're not doing something right
as consumers of of these platforms were

246
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,640
really the product,
but as the users of these platforms,

247
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,060
is there a behavioral modification we
should be doing to get these companies to

248
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,890
behave differently towards us?

249
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,700
I think as long as there are no direct
consequences to their behaviors.

250
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,910
I mean really when, when people,
boycotts Patriot, I mean,

251
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,650
yes they're sending a message to patron,

252
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,480
but the most immediate effect that
is felt as by you and me. Right?

253
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,380
And so I did this live stream last night
and I said, and this is completely true,

254
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,290
that I've lost about 500 some
odd patrons we've lost about,

255
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,360
I think it's around 5,000
bucks a month already.

256
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,790
But as I'm watching the number drop,

257
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,350
I honestly truly yet I'm inspired in
a way like, because it's like, oh,

258
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:53,300
people are standing up for
themselves. So it's like, and yeah,

259
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:56,120
and a lot of them were finding me on
my website now and doing it there.

260
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,070
So it's not like I'm taking
a complete financial hit,

261
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,220
but people are messaging me and saying
I'm not going to take it anymore.

262
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,870
And for that I'm like,
so it's weird.

263
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm like kind of inspired on one hand and
then my business is this. Dave is like,

264
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,170
Oh shit. But I have to agree
with you because one of the,

265
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,080
one of the sort of the signature
things that I sign off with,

266
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:16,700
oftentimes as I tell people don't sit
idly. You have a voice, get engaged.

267
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,350
And so it's difficult to then get upset
at people for getting engaged simply

268
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,830
because you take a financial hit.
Right? Right. So in the bigger picture,

269
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,380
I agree with you, I understand their
frustration and I hope that Jack Conti is,

270
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,263
is watching this.

271
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,910
What do you make of the behavior of people
that live in free societies that are

272
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,670
afraid to actually be free?
Because you know,

273
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:41,690
I just traveled the world all year with
Jordan and the amount of people that I

274
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,820
met,
especially in the Scandinavian countries,

275
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,710
but all over the world
and including American,

276
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,720
we did probably 15 stops in Canada.

277
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,410
People that live in freezes identities
that actually are afraid to speak.

278
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
It drives me absolutely crazy.

279
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,660
I respect jihadists more than I respect
people in free societies who refuse to

280
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,990
speak because the jihadis at
least are really committed.

281
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:05,150
They wake up every morning
and they have a goal.

282
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:08,270
It's a goal that you and I might
find it to be x, x, a credible,

283
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,460
but they are committed. Those who sit
quietly while you know the, the ugly,

284
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:16,520
the tsunami of lunacy is coming upon us.
Uh,

285
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,650
I have nothing but the stain for
them and it really isn't. She is.

286
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,730
So what is that behaviorally?
What is that?

287
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:27,560
Is that just a function of our excess
in the West? We've done it right.

288
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,330
Basically, we're basically free. We
got playstation, we got Coca Cola,

289
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:37,100
we got Nike, and we've been
lulled into nothing. Then I
think it's many things. Uh,

290
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,023
number one,

291
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,060
I truly believe that those who come from
societies that weren't free Ion Hirsi

292
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,750
Ali, myself, uh,

293
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,480
we really do understand what magical
reality the west is and the whole totality

294
00:16:55,341 --> 00:17:00,341
of societies that have ever existed in
the compendium of societies in the world.

295
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,070
We're nothing but a small bleep.
We've really done something right.

296
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,250
I think most Westerners don't
know that there is, I mean,

297
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,040
maybe sort of the abstract,

298
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,940
they know that there are some
really bad places out there,

299
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,070
but they take things for granted
there. But, um, uh, Regan had said,

300
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,430
I'm going to paraphrase, I don't
remember the exact quote. You know,

301
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
every single generation you have to be
standing at the gate defending freedoms

302
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,540
because every generation's,

303
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,530
there's going to be intrusions of some
really in the various characters trying

304
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:34,370
to take away those freedoms. And so
maybe in your book, maybe in mind,

305
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,070
we have to find ways to come
up with prescriptions to
get the silent majority of

306
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,350
speak. Do you know what the
secret is to get them to speak?

307
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,530
I don't know what the secret is other
than you've got to keep telling them that.

308
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,920
That's the answer like there,

309
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,190
because that's the question I probably
get more at any Q and a that I do than

310
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:56,700
anything else is I want to get involved,
but I don't know what to do.

311
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,400
And it's like you don't have to
make a youtube channel tomorrow.

312
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,920
Although I tell people, get on all of
these platforms and do those things.

313
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,030
But just in your own life, don't be
afraid of having these conversations.

314
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:09,330
If you're truly afraid that you're going
to say I'm for a low taxes and your

315
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,950
cousin's going to tell
you you're a racist,

316
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,590
that's not going to magically get better.
You know what I mean?

317
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,690
It's gonna actually,
it'll magically get worse.

318
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,840
So I think it's just on you
person watching this now to do it.

319
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,810
Uh,

320
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,810
earlier today I was at Bible Island and
Newport beach with my family and we ran

321
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:31,070
into an older gentleman, I think he's
80 years old. We had seen him around,

322
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,150
we were often in California and we love
the stock. He's got a Shetland shepherds.

323
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,430
So we stopped to pet the dog and we
ended up talking at one point, you know,

324
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,470
so I guess he's finding
out what I do and so on.

325
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,740
And he tells me with a lot of hesitation
as if there's going to be this great

326
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,390
repercussion on him. He admits to
me this very, very dark, a secret.

327
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,590
He's a Trump supporter. And I said, Oh,

328
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,440
why do you say that with
such hesitation when I,

329
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,910
so here's an 80 year old gentlemen,

330
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,130
we'll live supposedly in the most free
society sitting on a Free Street in

331
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,110
Newport beach.

332
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Yet he felt sufficiently tepid about
simply saying that he supports the current

333
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:19,110
sitting US president that captures it all.
That that's it.

334
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:23,820
I mean, to be free and to be, well
you're your own hostage at some level.

335
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,030
The other thing I that I find
very interesting is that,

336
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,190
so I was speaking actually with
Jordan and a few others at an event.

337
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,630
This was the event in 2017 where we were
going to speak about the stifling of

338
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:39,370
free speech on university campuses
that will shut down, shut down.

339
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,190
And then there was the rescheduled.
Yeah. So in the Q and a, uh,

340
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,430
someone asks who, who is of each of
the people who were in the panel,

341
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,920
who is your, uh, sort of freedom
hero? And my answer was, well,

342
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:57,600
it's all the people who do what we do,
but they do it in the Middle East, right.

343
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,500
Where the repercussions on them as they
might be taken in the middle of the

344
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,540
night and you'll never
hear from them again.

345
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,620
Now what upsets me is that if
you ask people in the West,

346
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,050
as you were saying earlier than that,
who are too afraid to speak well,

347
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:14,880
what are you afraid of? It's
unbelievable. The banality of their fears.

348
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,540
Well, I'm so if they're a professor,
well I'm afraid that might,

349
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,100
the chair of my department might
give me my core slowed on Tuesdays,

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,640
but he knows that on Tuesdays
my son has soccer practice.

351
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,570
That's what you're basing the whole
edifice of your defense of freedom on the

352
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:33,300
fact that he might screw
around with your teaching. So,

353
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,620
so there is a misalignment
between what people fear. I mean,

354
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,000
I get a million death threats. That's,
that's real, right? Yeah. I use,

355
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:46,830
I had last semester by though and that
last one I started in fall 2017 I had to

356
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,390
be escorted on my
university with security.

357
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,720
I had to file a police report
with the Montreal police.

358
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,270
I mean that's a lot worse than you.

359
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:58,790
They didn't give me the right schedule
to teach on Tuesday because my,

360
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,240
but that's the banality of their fears.
Their unfounded, just speak up. Yeah.

361
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,730
I always ask a lot of my
more courageous guests this.

362
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,440
But what do you think it is about you?

363
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:11,590
Do you think it's just because of what
happened to you in Lebanon growing up?

364
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,240
I mean, it is, if people
don't know the story,

365
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,330
they absolutely should check out our
other interviews. Cause your, your,

366
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,580
your life story is incredible. Do
you want me to summarize it? Yeah.

367
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,470
If you want to do that. I mean we're,
we're Lebanese Jews who lived in Lebanon.

368
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:24,840
I mean all my parents might,

369
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:27,370
siblings are much older than me and
myself were all born in Lebanon.

370
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,300
We were part of the last group of
Lebanese Jews who were still in Lebanon.

371
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,200
The civil war broke out into the mid
seven in the mid seventies where it was no

372
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:39,760
longer possible to be Jewish in Lebanon.
And so we have to leave, you know, very,

373
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:44,200
very quickly. Uh, so in my
personal history of course,

374
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,470
uh, is as part of the
reasons why I do, I do.

375
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,650
But I really think it's the unique random
combination of genes that makes who

376
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:57,580
got side is, which is, I'm genuinely,
and I say this without any hyperbole,

377
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,940
I'm genuinely offended by bs.
Yeah.

378
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,650
So sometimes my wife will see me,
I have my head in my hand and I'm like,

379
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,210
oh my God, what did somebody write? And
it will be something that I just read. Uh,

380
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,240
there is a retreat in Costa Rica
where whites are not allowed. Yeah.

381
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,300
This was like the hot thing that
vice was tweeting it. Exactly. Yeah.

382
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:21,970
And then I watched it. I went
absolutely berserk. I said,

383
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,720
how could it be that the same society
that created Martin Luther King,

384
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,640
this is not 4,000 years ago. This is
within, well not maybe you being alive,

385
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,370
but I was maybe two, three
years old. Yeah. This,

386
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,640
the same society that created
a Martin Luther King, 40,

387
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:41,410
50 years later is the same
society that rejoices, right.

388
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:43,780
Vice news was not saying,
look at these idiots.

389
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,630
There's how progressive
it is that there is a,

390
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,040
a American woman who has started to
retreat where whites are not allowed,

391
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,910
where they take breaks from white
people. Well, just look at my toe now.

392
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,830
It upsets me now possibly because I also
come from the society where I come from,

393
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,930
where I know what real hatred is.

394
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,470
There is no such hatred in the u s stop
pretending that there is such a thing.

395
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,510
Yeah,
well we're looking for it all the time.

396
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,740
We're looking at if you want to find
racism everywhere and bigotry everywhere,

397
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,310
guess what, you will find it. And if you
don't, you'll just make it up. So exactly.

398
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,900
What's it been like for you?

399
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:19,420
So you just mentioned having to
be escorted off campus. So in the,

400
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,980
in the couple times that we've done this,

401
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:25,660
obviously your public profile has grown
and you're extremely outspoken. Um,

402
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,650
what's it been like just on
campus in general? Holly Eggs?

403
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,830
I'm guessing you probably
get a lot of silence,

404
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:34,320
support and probably not a lot
of public support. I mean it's,

405
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,150
it's the same old story with everybody.
That's the,

406
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,060
that's the either depressing or at some
level inspiring part of this that maybe

407
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,140
there are many more of us,
which would be inspiring.

408
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,950
But the depressing is it's
like you're just a man. Yeah.

409
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,350
You're just one guy doing what you think
is right. How you have about four hours.

410
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,550
So let me summarize a few of the things
that have happened over the past year.

411
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,290
Yeah. Uh, so my university, I,

412
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,820
I'm not saying this not to be diplomatic,
but there are many,

413
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,140
many great things about my university.

414
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,190
They truly have given me an environment
to flourish. They don't get in my way.

415
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,440
They've never come and said,
don't say this and don't say that.

416
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,790
But I think my public profile now is
scaring them. So I know for a fact,

417
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,130
for example, that the media
department at my university,

418
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,720
I used to be their hero every five
seconds they used to call me. I mean,

419
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,830
I won the president's award,

420
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,460
the president of the university's
award for the guy who gets the most

421
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,200
international media coverage. That
was in 2015. Well from 2015 to now,

422
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,440
my profile has grown,
grown about 13th trillion times.

423
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,580
So if I want it in 2015 you would
think that I'm certainly up there.

424
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,690
I've completely become invisible to the
university so they don't actively come

425
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:43,190
and stop me from saying something,

426
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,370
but it's as if they want to hold that I
go away and I've spoken to a few senior

427
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:51,740
administrators and it's kind of relates
back to what we talked about earlier,

428
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,540
this kind of emotional mechanism.

429
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Some of them are upset at the fact that
I called someone schmuck on Twitter.

430
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,820
So all of Lord never called anybody ish.
Exactly. And I've actually had some odds,

431
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,560
I'll tell you another quick story.

432
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,490
There was a gentleman with whom I was
communicating on Twitter around them

433
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,410
person,
I have no idea who this person is.

434
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,900
And at one point I called them
a degenerate retarded schmuck.

435
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,460
Okay. Twitter banned me. I found
out it's because I used the r word.

436
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,930
I get a call from a university,

437
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,080
a human resources person after hours to
to discuss the fact that a complaint had

438
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:35,780
been filed against me.
Now I was thinking, oh,

439
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,200
this must be in the context of my
job as a professor in the university.

440
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,060
And there's absolutely
no way that they could,

441
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,420
anybody could have any reproach against
me because I, I conduct myself in a very,

442
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:48,270
very austere, you know,
professional, professorial
manner. There's no, no, no, it's,

443
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,350
they were referring to that interaction
with a random person on Twitter to which

444
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:56,180
I answered,
I told the person who I was speaking to,

445
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,260
so let me just make sure that I get
this straight so that when I repeated on

446
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,900
high profile platforms,
I don't get it wrong.

447
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,240
You think that it is within the purview
of the university to contact a professor

448
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:13,510
and determine what he or she can or can't
say using which tone on Twitter when

449
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,670
they're engaging another
person as a private citizen.

450
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,230
So if I were to hear you
speaking to your daughter,

451
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,280
coming out of the pharmacy in a tone
that I decided that I didn't approve of,

452
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,290
can I report you to the university?

453
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,360
The conversation ended
very quickly after that.

454
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,140
So the fact that the
universities are even in Bolden,

455
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,190
that they have the reflex to feel that
it is okay for them to be questioning

456
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:40,220
which word you use on
Twitter is a problem.

457
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,670
And the fact that you fought back boldly
probably made them scatter very quick

458
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,100
because they don't expect
anyone to [inaudible]. Right.

459
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:52,101
So why do you think universities have a
different responsibility when it comes

460
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:54,690
to speech? So of course in the United
States where we have the first amendment,

461
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,670
which is about the government
coming for your speech,

462
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,480
I think is being now confused with
generally your right to free speech.

463
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:04,710
Anyone can say whatever they want with
the very limited exceptions of fire in a

464
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,110
crowded theater, et Cetera,
et cetera. Um, but you know,

465
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:09,380
something like Marc Lamont
Hill a couple of weeks ago,

466
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,150
he gave that that
insanely over the top and,

467
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,360
and truly racist to the Cedar River,

468
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,990
to the sea power should be
free from the rivers. He,

469
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,280
that is literally what Hamas says.
I mean, it is a call for genocide.

470
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:24,930
Everyone knows what it is now. In
my view, the school, Temple and CNN,

471
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,650
his network can do whatever they want.
They can associate or not associate,

472
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,410
but I know there's a little bit
of a, an egg. And I say that as a,

473
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,080
as a free speech guy,
it's like he can say what he wants,

474
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,060
the school can associate
with who they want.

475
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,090
I don't want the government forcing
him to stay or forcing him to go.

476
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,450
But that to me is what freedom is.
It's the messy exchange of freedom.

477
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:44,790
But do you think in a case like that,

478
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,150
do you think universities have an extra
responsibility to protect free speech

479
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,110
when it's speech that they
don't, uh, agree with? Uh,
so the way I would answer it,

480
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,030
I'll, and I'll, although I'm
very conflicted about it,

481
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,430
I don't think that temple should find,

482
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:03,090
I say this as a Jewish person who has
a lot of family in Israel. I don't,

483
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,520
despite the fact that I don't
agree with what he said,

484
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,130
and he is aping the exact slogan of Hamas,

485
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,990
I don't think that they should fire him.

486
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,280
I think the only thing that should make
you bet should a fireable offense is

487
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:18,630
that within your role as a
professor in the university,

488
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,870
if you do things that violate the
dictums of your job as a professor.

489
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,300
Yeah. Short of that, I'm a
free speech absolutist. See,

490
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,790
that's the irony of where we're
at with the platforms too.

491
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,220
Because you could also argue,
well wait a minute, so are gone,

492
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:36,630
did something off platform and he's
getting banned. You know, they said,

493
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,110
they said it's only if you
do it on platform. Now he
did something off platform.

494
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:44,310
So that's why all of these things
are so confusing and intertwined.

495
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,400
Can I share one other story?
Not Mine,

496
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,590
although I want to maybe
mention one other example.

497
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,740
I'll mention my story first and
then I'll mention another guy. Uh,

498
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,880
another thing that struck,

499
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:56,310
cause you're asking what's happening
on universities and in my personal

500
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:56,970
experience,

501
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,970
so now the equity and diversity stuff
is spreading like wildfire across all

502
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:07,980
institutions in Canada because we have,
you know,

503
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,530
Justin Trudeau who's really
pushing this everywhere, right?

504
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,710
And so they're not happy.
Well, I can't say they,

505
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,550
but I did about 15 shows this year
in Canada and they're not on time.

506
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:20,530
I mentioned Trudeau people would move.
Do you know how many,

507
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,600
he was the punchline of all my
jokes and it was that, that,

508
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,970
that a Trudeau and everyone goes nuts.

509
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,360
Do you know how many people
have written to me now saying,

510
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,100
I wish we would have hated your
warnings about Trudeau in the past?

511
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,260
So yes, Stephen Harper is looking
pretty good these days. Although I,

512
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,100
my prediction, regrettably,
I think he'll win again,

513
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,890
but because there isn't anybody who is,
uh,

514
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,000
oh and beat him on the charisma factor,

515
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,930
I think the current guy is not going to
do it. I've seen Bernay coming in. Do you?

516
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,990
Okay, very nice. Uh, but so, so
the equity and diversity stuff, uh,

517
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,200
the Canadian government,

518
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:56,200
now they endow this thing called
the Canada research chairs,

519
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,380
which is the highest chaired professorship
that the Canadian government can

520
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,450
bestow on a professor.
Now,

521
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,020
equity and diversity is essential
metric that is looked at.

522
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,260
So in the context where meritocracy
should beat the defining ethos of

523
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,600
everything, right? I mean when
you run the hundred meters dash,

524
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,840
there is no equity in diversity. Who
crosses the line? The furthest, right?

525
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,280
The size of my CV.

526
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,960
And how many people consume the
material in that CV are the metrics? No,

527
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:27,370
it's equity. Diversity. So I've
been a chaired professor, I hold it,

528
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,430
I held a university wide chair for 10
years and again I got this year in 2008

529
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:37,120
where my dose would have been much,
much less than what it is today. Sure.

530
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,960
I now applied for the next chair.
I lost it.

531
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,980
The person to whom I lost it.
Let me just do this is her CV.

532
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,480
This is my CV.

533
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,680
I don't obviate suddenly this case.

534
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,860
Perhaps it had something to do with the
fact that she's a woman. So your uh,

535
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,170
even though you're a
refugee and an immigrant and
technically look just nice and

536
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:05,380
bronze, you are Brown. I guess
Brown, you're from the Middle East.

537
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,960
I mean it's right. All of those
things get thrown out the window.

538
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,980
You don't play that
card. Exactly. Exactly.

539
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,430
When it comes to those particular
identity politics, calculus,

540
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,880
the one that matters right
now is that one, I mean,

541
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,730
or if you were indigenous or something
like that, but uh, being brown,

542
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:26,650
being escaping the capitation, the Lebanon
is not as important as observation.

543
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,720
Yeah. I think you're going to be
writing a little bit about this as well,

544
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,670
but what do you make about
what's going on right now?

545
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:35,430
There seems to be like a gender war
starting or something [inaudible] well,

546
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,980
just that there's this weird tension
suddenly between men and women.

547
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,870
I think that seems to be
bubbling up everywhere.

548
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,820
That obviously is somehow connected to
this new version of feminism. Ah, well,

549
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,541
I mean, listen, I've been,

550
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,720
I've been dealing with this even before
all the social justice warrior is just

551
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,600
the fact that I've been
trying to Darwin eyes, uh,

552
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,200
the behavioral sciences in general
and consumer behavior in particular,

553
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,840
that itself was heretical idea.

554
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,960
So that was thought of this excess
basically because men and women like

555
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,190
different products, it's just that
men and women have different, look,

556
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,050
there are many things that
make men and women similar.

557
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,060
There are many things that
make men and women different.

558
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,690
And the only framework that explains
the cataloging of similarities and

559
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:17,370
differences is evolutionary psychology.
And there is no other game in town. Right.

560
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,620
But the fact that you even recognize
that men and women might have evolved

561
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:27,580
sexual dimorphism, that itself is
heritable in much of the social sciences.

562
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,780
So even before the sort of cultural
wars that you hear about just in science

563
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,130
itself, uh, you know,

564
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,430
I'm an interesting guy in terms of my
academic background and that I really do

565
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:39,100
straddle the natural sciences
and the social sciences. Yeah.

566
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,700
So I could say the exact same sentence.
If it's heard by natural scientists,

567
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,780
they go, yeah, no kidding.

568
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,810
The exact same sentence heard by
the social sciences booboo Nazi.

569
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,470
Give me an example of that.
Well, just for example,

570
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,340
saying that there are evolved sex
differences, just that, right.

571
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,590
I mean the fact that of the 21st century,

572
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:01,640
a professor has to appear in front of the
Canadian Senate to say the things that

573
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:04,370
I had to say and then be
accused of being pro genocide.

574
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,650
What more do I need to say?
I mean that,

575
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,670
that captures the Zeitgeists
of Luna to see that exists.

576
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,400
What do you think has to
happen to turn this around?

577
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,020
Because on one hand it's like,
look,

578
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,720
all of these conversations that
so many of us are happening there,

579
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,990
they're growing. You know,
there's, there's, uh,

580
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,200
live events happening all over the
place that people are attending.

581
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,060
And so there is an awareness of this,

582
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:29,590
but I still sent were just the
frog in the pot right there.

583
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,610
That thing is just getting warmer and
warmer and we're looking around and we're,

584
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,050
we're realizing, oh, there's other frogs
in here. But they're looking at us going,

585
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,270
oh,
you're getting warm too.

586
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,920
So we'll go back to an earlier
point that we talked about. We said,

587
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:43,910
how do we get people to get engaged?
There's really, it's not rocket science.

588
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,260
You have to marginalize
the voices of lunacy.

589
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,590
And you do that by having the tsunami of
reason overtake the tsunami of Lunacy.

590
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,650
The problem is that a few highly committed
intellectual terrorists can hold the

591
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:05,780
rest of the people hostage. Right?
On nine 11, it only took 19 people.

592
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,360
It didn't take 19,000
of them take 19 million.

593
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,540
It took 19 people who were very committed
that morning to cause a level of the

594
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,720
structure that is unimaginable.
By the same token,

595
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:22,190
it doesn't take too many miscreants
and universities to cause damage,

596
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,290
but if everybody gets up and says,
look,

597
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,170
I'm indignant about these
constant injuries to truth,

598
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,930
I won't accept you saying the
things that you're saying.

599
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,890
Challenge your professor when he or she
says, bs challenged your Facebook friend.

600
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,180
If you get enough people to
marginalize the voices of lunacy,

601
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,710
then the very quickly the tide will,
will, will, will be overturned.

602
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,480
Do you think that the universities,

603
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,730
let's say 20 years from now we're
going to be completely different?

604
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:50,510
I mean the amount of access to information
and two great minds that you have on

605
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:52,070
youtube is incredible.
I mean,

606
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:54,740
you can learn about psychology
from Jordan Peterson.

607
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,600
You can learn about behavior from gads ad.

608
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,760
You can learn about a evolutionary
biology from Bret Weinstein.

609
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,520
I mean I could go on that.

610
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:06,521
People are learning in a new way now and
it almost for as much fun as I had in

611
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,720
college and as much as
I learned in college,

612
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:12,380
it's like at some level it's like
with this hysteria, if I was a parent,

613
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:15,770
why would I want to pay money
to have my kid reprogrammed?

614
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,110
If it's something that has nothing
to do with any of my beliefs,

615
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,780
I think universities
will eventually adapt,

616
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,200
but it will take much
longer than 20 years. So,

617
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,300
and I say this somewhat facetiously,

618
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,750
but it's actually a quite pretty
good description. You know,

619
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:33,710
we have meetings to set up
task forces to hold meetings,

620
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:37,570
to have a motion to have a task
force that we'll brainstorm, right?

621
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,750
That's the side whether we should
have more coffee in the mail room.

622
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,900
That's the pace at which the mail room,
the mail

623
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,370
box like Moscow, the exact, yeah. So, so,

624
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
so you can't have an institution that is
supposed to have great velocity and in

625
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,140
its ability to adjust to,

626
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,400
I mean we teach this in the business
school yet we don't apply it.

627
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,580
It takes us 50 years to adjust to
market conditions. So regrettably,

628
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:10,430
I think more and more people will
look for alternative, uh, sources of,

629
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,840
of information, as you said,
on Youtube and everywhere else.

630
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,500
So I got one for you that just popped
into my head that I wasn't planning on

631
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,410
asking you and I have no idea
if you've put any thought into.

632
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,880
But one of the things I've
been thinking about lately,

633
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,150
especially because of what's happened
here with Patriot and I want to figure out

634
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,620
how to move ahead with my business,

635
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,120
is that the numbers related to what's
happening online and on television seem

636
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,800
incredibly out of whack in that there
are millions and millions of people,

637
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,730
uh,

638
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,290
ingesting all of this online content
watching for extremely long times.

639
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,420
So the example I'll use is my chat,

640
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,540
we Shapiro in Peterson from two weeks
ago had, has over a million views.

641
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,720
The watch time is average
watch time is over 40 minutes,

642
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,150
which is unheard of on Youtube.
Um,

643
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,720
this is way more than NBC nightly
news gets, let's say on a,

644
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:58,110
on an average night or certainly more than
CNN gets out. CNN is a better example.

645
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,930
So you take Anderson Cooper,
eight o'clock whatever he's getting,

646
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:04,980
whatever numbers he's getting, that
brings in millions of dollars in revenue,

647
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,230
a two hour conversation that we do here.

648
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:10,020
I think it's made about 5,000
bucks or something like that.

649
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,090
What's the behavioral or marketing aspect
of this thing that needs to be flipped?

650
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:15,281
What?

651
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:20,281
What's causing the monetization of these
conversations is more lucrative and I

652
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:24,490
don't even mean this within the lens of
so that we, so that we make more money.

653
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah.
I don't even mean it that way.

654
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:29,490
I need it like something seems wrong with
me with the structures right now that

655
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:33,270
people are paying that old
school companies are paying
a ton of money for things

656
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:36,450
that have just existed forever that
nobody watches and nobody cares about.

657
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,560
Then there's this new thing
that everyone's watching
young people really care

658
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:43,560
about and yet it's getting pennies
on the dollar of the other thing.

659
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,150
What's the behavior pattern for the people
that are making that are probably of

660
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:48,960
all the levers.

661
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,510
So you're right that I hadn't thought
about it as I'm doing it on the fly.

662
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,340
And maybe the best way that I'll describe
it as by telling a another story and

663
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,880
what's going to be common about
my story and what your ask is.

664
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,710
The fact that most people,

665
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:06,090
once they are anchored in a particular
way of behavior, it's very difficult.

666
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,510
The inertia is very difficult to shift.

667
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,560
So I was invited to speak at Stanford
University business school. I mean,

668
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,320
it doesn't get more prestigious
than this. Okay. Uh,

669
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,180
the gentleman who took me out to dinner,
uh,

670
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,560
the night before my talk at Stanford
Business School is a pretty well known

671
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,780
consumer psychologist who is now one of
the editors of one of the major journals.

672
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:31,020
So he's a serious academic and
at one point he says, you know,

673
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:35,040
I didn't know you were such a celebrity
and you appear on Joe Rogan and all.

674
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,660
I thought, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I tried to do it all. He said,
and so he looked, he says,

675
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,460
yeah, well, you know, at Stanford
we don't really promote, uh,

676
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,190
you know, this kind of stuff.
I said, what'd you mean?

677
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,530
And he picked sort of the wrong
guy to act this way. He goes, well,

678
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:53,801
you know,

679
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:58,801
we don't do research so that we can be
half sexy findings that we can repeat on

680
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:03,940
Joe Rogan that we can, you know,
discuss on Joe Rogan. I said, well,

681
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,941
I'm not suggesting that you either do
scientific research or appear on Joe

682
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,430
Rogan. I'm saying, do scientific
research and appear on Joe Rogan.

683
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,070
Surely you as a professor of marketing,

684
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,300
you would appreciate the
fact that appearing on Joe
Rogan and having 10 million

685
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:24,301
people consume your ideas might be as
valuable as a paper that you published in

686
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:29,440
a scientific journal that's read.
This is maybe why I'm not, uh, the,

687
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,230
I don't get invited in some of
these parties that's read by you,

688
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,420
the editor to reviewers and
your mom. Yeah, that didn't,

689
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,030
that didn't sit too well. I've had
the rest of the dinner. I mean,

690
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,550
it was a bitsa frosty, but, but,
but he didn't pay for the state.

691
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:48,220
But you know, he didn't, he did that.
He was hospitable in that, that says,

692
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,630
but that speaks to the point
that you're at, which is, uh,

693
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,130
even a place like
Stanford Business School,

694
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:57,190
which is supposed to have
the brightest minds possible,

695
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,300
is resistant to change.
I mean, Joel, well,

696
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:05,170
you'd think that it would understand as
a business school that having your ideas

697
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:09,550
heard on a platform that is 10 million
people. Yeah. Rogan is, uh, you know,

698
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,650
it's insane how huge is that.

699
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,470
Might have something to do with
that might be good for business.

700
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:19,000
Perhaps selling a book or sharing.
Exactly. Exactly. But I think so now,

701
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,660
not to get too psychoanalytical,
but I will, uh, look,

702
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:25,600
it's an ego defensive strategy,
right? So I'm speaking as him now,

703
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:31,050
I have mastered the set of skills that
I need to succeed in publishing papers,

704
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:33,550
in peer review journals.

705
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,330
I don't think I could appear in front
of Joe Rogan and 10 million people.

706
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,360
Therefore I will
denigrate those who do it.

707
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,030
So it's a classic Eagle
Defensive Strategy.

708
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,350
Whereas the truly intellectually
secure person would say, no.

709
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,090
I am going to find all of the possible
mediums where I can share my ideas.

710
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,560
Academics are in the business of creating
mimetic knowledge and spreading it,

711
00:40:56,561 --> 00:41:00,280
right? So I create the knowledge
in my scientific research,

712
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,360
but if they Ruben asked me to come on
a show, I would be a lunatic to think,

713
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,530
to turn it down. Why would I turn
it down? I want to promote my ideas.

714
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,200
Is that the fun part of
what's going on right now?

715
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:14,680
That everything is kind of upside down?
So while it does seem scary,

716
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,461
it's also like,
Oh,

717
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,190
if you have your head on right and you're
and you're willing to suck up your ego

718
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:21,550
a little bit and maybe do some things
that maybe you wouldn't have done 10 years

719
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:24,970
ago, it's like, wow, there's a, there's a
ton of opportunity. It's unbelievably fun.

720
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:27,760
I wake up every day like
a kid in a candy store.

721
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,790
I'm excited by all of the endless
possibilities that await me and I love,

722
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,050
I love doing very,
very hardcore scientific research.

723
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,020
I love appearing on Ruben or Rogan.

724
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,350
I love speaking in front
of students in class.

725
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,150
Anything that allows me to spread
ideas I'm going to sign up for.

726
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,690
And I only wish I could convince a lot
of my academic colleagues who remain

727
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:54,160
quite high Falutin uh,
in their ivory towers to join.

728
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:57,590
And I think they will eventually. Yeah.
Well that's actually a perfect segue.

729
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:01,320
Can you mention a couple of the other
academics that you've had on your yes to

730
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:04,460
channel lately? Uh, that
are in some hot water.

731
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,660
They dare speak the truth. Yes. Thank
you. I'm going to be plugging them now.

732
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:10,630
Maybe people will listen. So, so I had,

733
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:15,110
so I don't know if you know why you do
know that I'm quite satirical and quite

734
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:19,140
sarcastic. So, and one of the your
video hiding under the bed. Oh,

735
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,450
exactly what you're
going to talk about her.

736
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,350
So now I have a series where I hide
under the table because I'm so afraid.

737
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,760
So the last installment of that
series was because I was very,

738
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:33,200
very afraid because a white supremacist
and quotes Rachel Fulton Brown,

739
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:37,160
who is a professor of medieval
history at University of Chicago.

740
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,000
What's coming on my show and you know,
as a brown Middle Eastern person,

741
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,740
I was very afraid of her white supremacy.

742
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,360
Now what is it that caused her to receive
the appellation of white supremacy?

743
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,580
It's that she wrote a very, very short
blog posts where she said, you know,

744
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:56,870
three hails to white men. A lot of
the freedoms that we have in the West,

745
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:57,980
a lot of the,
the,

746
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,040
the feminist virtues have been pushed
and supported and defended by white men.

747
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,270
So maybe they deserve some credit. My God,
what a Nazi. I mean, it's, it's almost,

748
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,440
she's almost indistinguishable from
Hemler himself. So that's one case.

749
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,980
How many people came to her
defense? Very few. Okay.

750
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,250
The second one is a gentleman high,
just had last week on,

751
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:21,470
his name is Alessandro's through Mia.

752
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,570
He is an Italian physicist
at the University of Pisa
who is also associated with

753
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,640
the uh,
uh,

754
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,500
research center called Cern Crn,
which is an acronym in,

755
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,980
in Geneva where they're doing the call.
[inaudible] exactly.

756
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,470
So he's a very polite and [inaudible]
extent of my scientific knowledge are out

757
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,910
there going to blow up the university.
They going to grow up the university.

758
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:44,331
Exactly.

759
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:49,331
And so he was invited to speak at a
gender and theoretical physics or some,

760
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,000
some, some identity politics,
you know, event, uh, you know,

761
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,150
basically to support the narrative that
women are deeply discriminated against

762
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:05,070
in physics.
And so rather than buy into the narrative,

763
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:10,060
what he decided to do is actually
present biblio metric data. Do you,

764
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,720
do you know what that is?
Help me out here.

765
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,430
Maybe they'll metric data
is if you'd like. It's the
scientific study of science.

766
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,090
For example, if you want to study
which fields sites, which other fields,

767
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,810
you could look at citation patterns.
So it's like building networks,

768
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,960
but it's scientific networks.
So it's you, you're quantifying,

769
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,380
you're taking a snapshot of science
itself. Is that science, science?

770
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,780
It's the science of science. It's,
and it's called bibliometrics.

771
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,950
Probably the most famous journal within
that jar is called psychometrics.

772
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:42,750
And I've published a few papers in
that journal. So what he did is he, he,

773
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,280
he did a book,
the metric analysis.

774
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,430
So let me give you an example of that so
that we can give you a concrete thing.

775
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,560
So if you have men and women applying
for a particular job in physics,

776
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,980
what is the average number of citations?

777
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,550
So citations for your viewers
who don't know if for example,

778
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:02,670
I've published 50 scientific papers and
you've published 50 scientific papers,

779
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,880
your 50 papers might've
been site at 10,000 times.

780
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,760
My 50 papers might've
been cited 2000 times,

781
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,770
even though we've both
published the same amount.

782
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,620
Your papers have been
cited a lot more than mine.

783
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,240
You're more influential in that sense.

784
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,700
So it's one measure of
scientific prominence.

785
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,940
And so what he did is he
looked at four specific jobs.

786
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,340
What is the average number of citations
that women candidates who got the job

787
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,410
had versus men? And he found that
men have a lot more citations,

788
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,450
right? Uh, well that's
just data right? Big.

789
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,400
Now because he presented data that
seemed to contradict the narrative.

790
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,400
And he did. One other thing that
some would argue as a football,

791
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,900
I'm not sure how much of a football it is,

792
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,110
he actually compared his citation record
to two other women and named them.

793
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,980
But that data is publicly available
that people thought of it as Gauche.

794
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,650
But originally when sir, that
might've been Gauche or in poor taste,

795
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:04,410
but that doesn't deny this the science.
Exactly.

796
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,880
So these complete idiots
particles for justice,

797
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,170
that what are the of noxious steam
particles for justice? Right.

798
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,010
That's actually the name.
That's actually the name.

799
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,540
So which is a constellation of
castrates at scientists. Yeah.

800
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,000
About 1600 of them.
So if I didn't have enough enemies,

801
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:25,220
now I have 6,100 new enemies. Uh, give
me five more minutes. Okay, let's,

802
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,970
let's start to exactly. Uh, they,
they came up with a, a letter,

803
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:34,320
an open letter. Uh, you
know, saying how bad he is.

804
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,120
We do not support any
physicist who do humanize a,

805
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:42,780
someone based on their religion, their
ethnicity, their gender orientation,

806
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:45,870
their race. He did no such thing.
He, he didn't mention race,

807
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:49,650
he didn't mention gender orientation,
he didn't mention ethnicity or religion,

808
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,940
but somehow he's now in Nazi on all
fronts simply because he shared with be a

809
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:58,470
metric data. Well, nobody would touch
the sky. Guess who, who would touch him,

810
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,440
this guy.
And for better or worse,

811
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,500
I've become the central
repository of every academic,

812
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,250
every student, every administrator,
every staff who is aggrieved,

813
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,360
we'll end up writing. To me, and frankly,

814
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,990
it's on the one hand is very exciting
because you feel like you're helping.

815
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,280
On the other hand,
it's,

816
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,240
it's takes a tremendous emotional toll
on you because you have to go about your

817
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:22,530
business being a professor,

818
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,070
writing your grants and writing your
papers and supervising your doctoral

819
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:30,970
students. But every day
you're overcome by 10 stories,

820
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,120
each of which upsets you,
but you can't address each one.

821
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,010
So it takes a burden on you.
Well,

822
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:37,750
not that you want to be more
overwhelmed than you are,

823
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:41,860
but I could probably send you five easily,

824
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,590
probably four or 500 stories exactly.
Like,

825
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:47,230
there's people who want to come on my
show and I obviously I've had some of

826
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,030
these people as they've sort
of bubbled up, you know,

827
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:51,850
I've had more of the high profile ones,
like a James Damore let's say,

828
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:55,090
or what happened at Bret Weinstein. But,
but Lindsay, a shepherd from Canada,

829
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,880
you know, we helped put her on
the map I think. But the amount,

830
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,800
I get these stories from
everybody I'm talking about,

831
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:01,870
I'm getting them from
elementary school teachers.

832
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,920
I'm getting them from obviously from
professors, but I'm getting them from,

833
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,880
from people that have nothing to do with
academia. I'm getting them from, uh,

834
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,180
you know, people that are in engineering
and all sorts of other things.

835
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:18,070
So it's just endless. But what, okay, what
do you think these, uh, what were they?

836
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:20,930
Equality and equity and diversity. Oh, I,

837
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,750
particles for justice particles or does
he, so let's, let's try to steal a man.

838
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,090
Their argument.
What do you think they actually want?

839
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,490
Do they actually want that?

840
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:34,350
Physics departments should have
the exact breakdown of females.

841
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:37,290
So let's say females are like 52% of
males are 48. Something like that.

842
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:37,870
Absolutely.

843
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:42,640
Think that actually the best way to
move physics forward in the future is to

844
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:47,180
have 52% females, 48%
males. Regardless of that,

845
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,230
men and women like different things and
that studies are something differently

846
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:55,000
and all the things they truly believe
that let's all give the devil his due here

847
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,010
like,
or they don't believe it.

848
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:00,130
And the deep recesses of their minds
when they're about to go to bed and the

849
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,920
privacy of their thoughts,
but to the public,

850
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,070
they certainly must demonstrate
that they do believe it.

851
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,860
So whether they truly believe
it or not is up for debate,

852
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,290
but there certainly signaling
that they believe, okay,

853
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,920
so let's take that section of them and I,
that's probably a huge amount of them.

854
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:17,780
Right? That's just the hot, that's
just sort of the week hostage is. Yeah,

855
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,510
I'd say so let's move those people out.

856
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,390
Now let's take the true believers in this.
You think they just,

857
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,010
they truly believe, even though they are
educated, these are, these are physicists.

858
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,260
Yes.
They believe that that would produce,

859
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,100
or are they putting physics
aside for the purposes of equity?

860
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:35,590
You know what I mean? Well, it's
funny because I actually do,

861
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:38,890
what do they think is more important?
Equity or physics I guess is my question.

862
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,300
Uh, which speaks to another point that
I talk about in my forthcoming book,

863
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,550
which is,
you know,

864
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:49,660
there are often times mission statements
that don't go hand in hand. If you,

865
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,980
if you do more of one,

866
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,250
you have to give up on the
other universities exist
for the pursuit of truth.

867
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,350
If in the pursuit of truth,
feelings are hurt. So be it.

868
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,570
This is exactly when Sam Harris on his
podcast, when I appeared a few years ago,

869
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,510
we don't, one of the first
things that he led with was, uh,

870
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,190
in your scientific word,
God,

871
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,710
is there anything that you
consider to be forbidden knowledge?

872
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,710
And my answer was an unequivocal no.

873
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:23,140
If you are an adherent truthfully and
honestly through the scientific method,

874
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,500
then it's not my job as a scientist to
worry about how that knowledge might be

875
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,150
misused because then it truly
is a slippery slope. Right?

876
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,380
We shouldn't have done physics research
because, you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

877
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,180
right? Uh, that's by the way,

878
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:42,560
what caused one of the reasons that
cause the abdication of biology from the

879
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,850
study of human behavior.

880
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:48,230
What's precisely because some social
scientists thought that by biology

881
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:53,170
[inaudible] human nature that
could be misused, like by,

882
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,330
by you, the Eugenesis, by the Nazis,

883
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,670
by British class elitists,

884
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,410
and therefore let's create a new edifice
that's completely removed from reality.

885
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,480
But where biology is no longer relevant.

886
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,800
So what these physicists are doing is
they've been parasitized by the Arctic

887
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:13,460
ideas. Physicists could be just as Moronic
as anybody else. As a matter of fact,

888
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,140
I've met quite a few physicists short
of whatever they know and physics. Uh,

889
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,430
they're fully lobotomized. So it's not
as though being in physics affords you a,

890
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:25,190
you know, greater knowledge
and in greater life. Right?

891
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:27,560
I guess that's just depressing at
some level. There's nothing but isn't.

892
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:29,030
The other inherent problem with that.

893
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:34,031
If you're afraid to go where science
we'll lead you because of whatever the

894
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,720
politically correct notion of the day
is that you're going to leave scientists

895
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,220
to allow us, you're gonna leave science
to a lot of bad people. Absolutely.

896
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,360
I mean that's, that's exactly why
I get so frustrated, right? I mean,

897
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:52,130
I've had reviewers, if I,
and I've kept the reviews, I
send the paper to a journal.

898
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:54,740
If I show you some of the reviews
I get back, you would think,

899
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,530
although this has god being satirical,
right,

900
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,540
but why is he studying sex differences?
Does he not know the danger of, I mean,

901
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:07,790
do I really in the 21st century have to
explain to you that there is inherent

902
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,700
value in studying evolved sex differences.

903
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,380
The fact that you get a reaction of
indignation and discuss and you call

904
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:20,090
yourself a scientist is like being in
the 13th century. It's breathtaking.

905
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,740
But that's because they believe they
place on sort of the hierarchy of ideals

906
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,040
they plays, uh, hurt feelings or the, the,

907
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:32,090
the refusal to have hurt feelings
above truth. Do you think all of this,

908
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:35,060
like almost everything we're talking
about here and sort of everything that

909
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,670
we're all fighting? Yes. All the time.

910
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,970
Simply like if we were to just boil
it down to, it's like, you know,

911
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,410
let's go to first
principles sort of thing.

912
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:47,420
That it's just because of an abdication
of personal responsibility that people

913
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,070
are just sort of afraid of their shadow.

914
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:54,070
They're just afraid that it's a little
bit of a scary idea to just get up every

915
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,780
morning and go, I gotta do a little
better today. It's definitely,

916
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,170
there's a bit of that, but I think
that what unites a lot of these,

917
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,420
what in the book I call idea pathogens,
right?

918
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,740
The book is about parasitic ideas that
infest our brains causing us to behave

919
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:11,750
maladaptively a lot of these ideas are
ultimately abdication of reality because

920
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,730
they make me feel good in some way.
So for example,

921
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,380
the Tabula Rasa premise that
the empty empty mind premise,

922
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,250
do you know what I'm talking about?

923
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,880
This is basically idea that we are born
empty minds and it's only socialization,

924
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,260
sort of the blank slate. The black slate.
Exactly. So the, the fancy tournaments,

925
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:35,520
Tabula Rasa. Okay. In Latin, the
empty slate. Gotcha. Okay. Well,

926
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,110
I know we were doing the show in English.

927
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,730
I could break it up for you in Arabic
and Hebrew and French. Uh, but anyways,

928
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,750
but hey, by the way, Obama says Pakistan
in this way. So he's the worldly guy.

929
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,390
Right, right, right, right. But, uh,

930
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,620
but the Tabula Rasa premise really
comes from a very hopeful place. Why?

931
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,880
Because it says that we are all
born with equal potentiality.

932
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,810
Had I simply been hugged
better by my mother?

933
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,740
I too could have been Michael Jordan,
but there was something, right?

934
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,520
There was something in my environmental
trajectory that caused it,

935
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,320
that that realization happen
for Michael Jordan. But not me.

936
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,260
But there was nothing inherent
at the start at t equals zero.

937
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,320
That would have led Michael Jordan to
have greater likelihood of becoming the

938
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:23,340
NBA started. He would have become rather
than me at five foot six and a half.

939
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,730
Right. Well that's helpful.
I'd like to believe that.

940
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,090
I'd like to believe that we are
all born with zero biological,

941
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,290
no innate differences in intelligence,
for example.

942
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,550
Know that makes me feel where it
would sort of be a beautiful thing.

943
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:38,210
It's a thing, right? Work.

944
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,280
So I think a lot of these parasitic
ideas all stem from a very noble place.

945
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,800
It stems from a place where you're trying
to sanitize the ugliness of reality.

946
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,820
So for example, to link it back
to marketing, the dove campaign,

947
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,750
that's probably the most
successful campaign of their
czar is one that basically

948
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:00,600
says, look, we're all equally beautiful.

949
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,520
There is no beauty is a social
construct. Well, if I'm a woman,

950
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:10,730
do I want to hear that message or do I
want to hear God sad telling me that?

951
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:13,020
No,
across all cultures,

952
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,950
facially symmetric people are judged
as a more beautiful than facially

953
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:18,480
asymmetric, right? It just is.

954
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,510
If my nose was all the way this
way and I had one eye over here,

955
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,250
I wouldn't be as attractive. But if that
were true, that would smell a fatalism.

956
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:30,450
That means I can't, I'm doing to that
asymmetry. But if you tell me no,

957
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:32,910
don't worry about it.
In the right context,

958
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:36,730
people will judge your sagging
breasts, your, your, uh, uh,

959
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,920
you've wrinkled face. You're asymmetry
to be as beautiful. And look,

960
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,570
there's the movement, fat
acceptance, for example, factory
acceptance. Sorry. No, no,

961
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:48,800
go ahead. This is just a doozy of one,
because now you have people that are,

962
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,320
that are in it is not healthy to be fat.

963
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,960
It's not a controversial statement.
Have we noticed that?

964
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:59,190
I've lost 30 pounds if I'm not
mistaken. Very good. Very good. Well,

965
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:01,470
thank you for notice.
Yes, no, but seriously,

966
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:05,580
since this will work well for you in
your career and in large life at law,

967
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,940
but fat acceptance basically says,
look,

968
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,960
it's a conspiracy from the
medical establishment to
argue that being overweight

969
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,950
is a bad thing. And so I actually troll
my physician. I joined, said, hey,

970
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,980
don't you dare tell me that I need
to lose weight. As a matter of,

971
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,280
at one point I had gone to see him and I
actually mentioned this in the book and

972
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,280
he pulls out,
he doesn't bring up my cholesterol scores.

973
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,150
He pulls out a couple of tweets of mine.
I'm guessing he follows me,

974
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,600
doesn't realize that I'm being
sarcastic as I write, you know, my, my,

975
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,880
my,
my physician is a complete fattest.

976
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,630
He said that I needed to lose weight.
Doesn't even know that, uh, you know,

977
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:50,780
this is a social construct. I'm trans
gravity, blah, blah, whatever. Yeah.

978
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,950
My usual got stuff.
And then he points to them.

979
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,730
Actually my wife was in
the room with me and,

980
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,780
and he pointed them and basically he's
questioning my emotional state and my

981
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,070
sanity, so I won't say
his name. I go, doc,

982
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,310
I was being sarcastic.
That's hilarious.

983
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,240
So physicians can be plugged surprised
by an inability to think and detect

984
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:20,980
sarcasm. Yeah. But, but so I think there
is, the root of that though is again,

985
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:24,670
it's personal responsibility,
right? Because isn't it?
It's very easy to be like,

986
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,980
all right, well I'm
fat or whatever. Right.

987
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,520
And I have no reason to.

988
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,050
It's not about me to get myself in order.
It's not about any of that. So that,

989
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,620
it just strikes me that almost
every problem that we're
seeing in society, right,

990
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,490
as his disease is due to the
ultimate abdication of people,

991
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:44,550
of just that it's their life.
They seem right.

992
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,190
Forgot that it's their life or something.
By the way though,

993
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:53,220
the fact that something is determined
by some evolutionary mechanism doesn't

994
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:56,530
mean that it is biologically
deterministic. I had an, uh,

995
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,620
of course I won't mention the
name of the person I had. Yeah,

996
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,680
I received probably be like,

997
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,460
you do a million emails of people asking
me for advice and I unfortunately I

998
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:05,740
can't answer everybody, but once in
a while someone forward them to you.

999
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,540
There you go. That's why I received so
many. And so one gentleman wrote to me,

1000
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:14,260
it was a guy of a certain age in his late
twenties saying basically that he had

1001
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:18,070
never had sex and he feels very distraught
by it then is there any hope for me,

1002
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:21,340
Dr Saad, blah, blah, blah. And you know,
I didn't know exactly what to answer,

1003
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,990
but I said, look, the reality is that uh,

1004
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:29,110
many of the attributes that women look
for in men are actually attributes that

1005
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:33,520
we could improve on. So for
example, your economic status,

1006
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,410
your social status, your educational
level, your confidence level,

1007
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,240
those are not determining what is,

1008
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,420
what is determined is the fact that
women are attracted to those traits.

1009
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,780
But you could score here on
them now and through hard work,

1010
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:50,410
through personal responsibility, you
could move here. Now my facial symmetry,

1011
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:54,160
I can't change. And so in that sense,
if I'm a bit, this is Los Angeles,

1012
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,210
this is the [inaudible] gastric
surgery. True. Yeah, you're right. But,

1013
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,620
but there are many attributes.

1014
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:01,940
Even though we know the evolutionary
roots of those attributes,

1015
00:59:01,941 --> 00:59:06,010
that doesn't mean that we are doing that
simply actually informs us about those

1016
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:10,780
things that if we take personal
responsibility we could improve on. Uh,

1017
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,540
I wanted to talk to you about,
uh, I asked you right before,

1018
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,470
cause I didn't want to screw it up.

1019
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:19,160
The indeed indigenization
indigenization at the university.

1020
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:21,470
The university's like,
since I've out again,

1021
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,670
I get one word that I
can't quite know. Yeah. Uh,

1022
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,390
so one of the things that's happening
kind of as you know, there's,

1023
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,660
there's been a lot of,

1024
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,460
of historical friction between
the Canadian government and the,

1025
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,950
the native people,
the indigenous people.

1026
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:42,370
And so now we've gone on hyper drive
where everything is getting indigenized.

1027
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,490
So for example, when you start
any ceremony at the university,

1028
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:50,590
you have to self flagellate. I'm evil. Uh,

1029
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,970
we are standing on stolen line and so on,

1030
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,840
which that itself I find
quite grotesque because, uh,

1031
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,070
not to imply that there haven't been
historical grievances that should be

1032
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,000
addressed that and so on.

1033
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:07,040
But here are students who have nothing
to do with those historical grievances.

1034
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,150
This is their moment to shine.
This is their moment to be celebrated.

1035
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:15,970
We start off by saying, you're a bad,
you're on stolen land. Admit that. Right?

1036
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,340
So that's one example. But that
that's okay. Symbolic fine,

1037
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,260
but it's not just symbolic,
right?

1038
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:24,980
Because doesn't that just leak into
everything else? You're like, fair enough.

1039
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,990
You're absolutely right. So here's what
bothers me more as someone who is a dog,

1040
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:30,800
good defender of truth.

1041
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:36,170
We now have what's called
indigenous way of knowing. Okay,

1042
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,900
so here's,
here's the,

1043
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,950
here's where it's appropriate to talk
about indigenous knowledge versus

1044
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:43,784
inappropriate.

1045
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Indigenous people have lived in certain
environments that makes them more privy

1046
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:53,570
to the local knowledge of the
flora of the fauna, right?

1047
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:55,010
It's content specific knowledge.

1048
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,040
If you've lived in a particular
region for 10,000 years,

1049
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,420
you might have some statistical
regularities that you've
noticed as part of your

1050
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:05,810
cultural transmission that the guy who's
sitting at Harvard may not have been

1051
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:09,770
exposed to. You have a lot of transmitted
data. Yeah. You except this is true.

1052
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,860
I accept this as true
and we should turn to,

1053
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,700
to the indigenous folks for their
locally specified knowledge.

1054
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,370
On the other hand, if
you say no, but you know,

1055
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:23,450
I could look at the shadow of my ancestor,
whatever,

1056
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:25,020
some Booga Booga stuff.
Uh,

1057
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:29,450
because that's an alternate way of also
in a way it's not just the white man's

1058
01:01:29,451 --> 01:01:33,980
sexist, racist colonial science
that we should abide by. No.

1059
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,220
The original extremely good looking
Lebanese Jew way of knowing there is no

1060
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,880
indigenous way of knowing.
There is just the scientific method.

1061
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:48,260
So once you try to argue that
there are multiple ways of knowing

1062
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:52,190
epistemologically you're entering into
bs Lon and I won't put up with it.

1063
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,280
Can you explain to me away
that they would say that?

1064
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,320
How would they make the
counter argument to that?

1065
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,000
What would they be talking about?
Well,

1066
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,970
what would be an indigenous
way of knowing not,

1067
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:03,350
I'm not talking about the legitimate part,

1068
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:07,910
when not everything is material science.
Not Everything is materialism.

1069
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:12,700
Not everything can be captured by
conducting an experiment using white man's

1070
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:17,510
science. Hashtag science must fall, right?
You have to decolonize your mind, man.

1071
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,250
You have to accept there are,
you know,

1072
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,600
central African Way of knowing
where you understand the rain to be,

1073
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:27,480
that God is crying. You have
to understand saying, yeah,

1074
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:32,190
so you have to incorporate people's
mythologies and folklores into ways of

1075
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,461
knowing.

1076
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:36,690
Shamanism is a way of knowing that is
very different in terms of how you cure

1077
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:40,410
cancer. That has nothing to do
with western science. It's BS.

1078
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,640
There is only one way of knowing and
it's called the scientific method.

1079
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,590
But by the way, people
who do, for example, touch
therapy, touch therapy is, uh,

1080
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,230
I have an energy state and my,

1081
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:56,250
and I could cure your pancreatic
cancer simply by hovering right now.

1082
01:02:56,251 --> 01:03:00,030
When you actually do a study to check
the efficacy, it obviously fails.

1083
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,470
What do you think they rebuffed?

1084
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,160
Well by putting us through
the vulgar tests of science.

1085
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,690
It that in that itself the magic,
there you go.

1086
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,660
So there is no indigenous way of knowing.

1087
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:17,661
There is very valuable indigenous
knowledge that should be maintained,

1088
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:18,930
preserved and shared.

1089
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,080
But there is no different epis thermology
there is no way to get at the truth

1090
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,580
other than the scientific method.
It's the only game in town.

1091
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,220
How is this leaking into
academia? I mean, is this now,

1092
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,610
is this a discipline that's
being taught or it's just,

1093
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:36,050
or it's just sort of the lower layer of
it? It's everywhere. It's that you, you,

1094
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:40,710
you in curricular and gets
imported, imported. Uh, the,

1095
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:45,480
I think it was the Environment Minister
of Quebec who questioned when talking

1096
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:47,100
about some environmental policy.

1097
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,280
He basically said something similar to
what I'm saying here where he's saying

1098
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,330
there is only the scientific
method. He was clobbered. No,

1099
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,820
there isn't just a scientific matter.
What kind of racist pig are you?

1100
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:00,570
Is there something unique or something
bizarre about what's happening in Canada

1101
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:05,070
right now that so many of the fighters
right now that the world is looking at

1102
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,740
are coming from Canada? I
mean, look, there's, there's
something that your water,

1103
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,270
yeah, well Peterson obviously I think
is the, is the pinnacle of this. Um,

1104
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:17,240
but you, but Lindsay Shepherd, I, there's
a series of other people, Janice Fandango.

1105
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:21,310
Janice, you may go ahead and here who's
just off the charts phenomenal. Uh,

1106
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,410
that there's something happening in
Canada perhaps that you guys had it pretty

1107
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:28,410
good and stayed at a world
affairs enough or something.

1108
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,760
But now the Internet has like made us
all feel the same, right? Or I don't,

1109
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:37,300
I don't think there's anything, I think
it's just a statistical anomaly that, uh,

1110
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,710
a few of the forefront people
happen to be from Canada.

1111
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,360
I don't think there's any, it may be, it's
this completely, I'm sorry, I'm not sure,

1112
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,650
but maybe the fact that we are actually
getting parasitized by some of these

1113
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:52,460
idiotic ideas so much more quickly.
I think so.

1114
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,910
Maybe that's it because I think there's
some connection to Trudeau so slick and

1115
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:59,910
says all the right things, but everyone
knows he's not doing the right things.

1116
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:03,210
And you know, when we were in western
Canada, there was a lot of people,

1117
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:05,340
almost all the questions
when we do these Q and A's,

1118
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,150
we're about what's going on with,
uh,

1119
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,200
the oil pipeline and all that
and taxes and all these things.

1120
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:14,430
But he looks good anywhere. It's nice
on us and he can dance. That's right.

1121
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,950
And so people just think it's good.
So maybe it's something like,

1122
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,520
like Canadians I think generally
are a little more, it's odd.

1123
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:21,670
It correct me if I'm wrong on this.

1124
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,080
My gut feeling about Canadians is you
guys are a little more inherently live and

1125
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:27,940
let live say libertarian,

1126
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:31,360
except you have a government that gives
you your dues and a whole bunch of other

1127
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:35,220
things. So there's a weird dichotomy
there. I mean, maybe I'll go,

1128
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,150
I can tell you that in Quebec,
uh,

1129
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:42,040
we're one of the last functioning deeply
communist places in the world. Uh,

1130
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:45,640
I say that somewhat facetiously, but
not quite facetiously. We really,

1131
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:49,480
that one of the reasons why I've always
wanted to move to the United States is

1132
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:54,310
because this socialist ethos is really
great for people who don't do much.

1133
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,320
And it really punishes those
who are, uh, producers. Yeah.

1134
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,800
And so you're constantly getting the
government who comes at you and says, Hey,

1135
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,310
everything you do 50 50 right.
So it's not enough that I,

1136
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,250
my salary is taxed at a
level that is unimaginable.

1137
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:11,860
That would make most of the people
viewing the show have heart attacks.

1138
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,190
Is that anything that I try to
do beyond that to, to make a bet,

1139
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,310
if I go give a talk, if I write
a book, if I'm on Patriot,

1140
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,750
the government says whatever you do
forevermore, if it's world income,

1141
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,850
if it's on Mars, we're 50 50
partners, as a matter of fact,

1142
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,620
ends up being much more than 50 50 because
your income is about 50% but then the

1143
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:33,580
50% that's left to you,
they tax you 15% on what you spend.

1144
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,360
So the amount that I'm left with, I mean,
so how could it be that someone who,

1145
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,430
it's not that I'm very rich,
it's not that I make you,

1146
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:42,760
but if you look at sort of that
I probably am in the top 5%.

1147
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,870
I'm left with very little at the
end of the year because you know,

1148
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:50,890
we are a gentle sweet society where
you have free health care. Well,

1149
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:54,730
it's free health care other than the
fact that I pay 50% of my income for it.

1150
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,490
So if you exclude the 50% that I pay
for it, it's free. So for example,

1151
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,650
[inaudible] that upsets people when you
tell them that something is that's free

1152
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,240
is actually paid for,

1153
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,260
that really upsets people because they
live in that utopia where the blank slate

1154
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:12,580
premise is the, uh, the theory
that ego, you know, they're idiots.

1155
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,720
You got one more good one for me
before we sign off. We, I mean,

1156
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:20,260
we could do this forever and I know we're,
unfortunately, I got some more stuff.

1157
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:24,470
I gotta do that. Anything else
that I can tell you? Uh, well my,

1158
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,140
my book will be out next year.
I am supposed to deliver it in October.

1159
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,630
Um,
feverously working on it.

1160
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,170
There was a bit of a snag it last year
where I wasn't able to work on it as much.

1161
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,060
Now I'm back full throttle.

1162
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:41,410
I have about half of the book written
and somewhat disorganized fashion.

1163
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,330
Our books are going to come out at about
the same time. I know that's not good.

1164
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,260
That's bad news for you because of
course I'm going to overshadow you.

1165
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,300
I was about to say that we
could tour together. Nope. Nope.

1166
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,350
Diplomatic. I'm Middle Eastern. I
have to learn from you. Yeah. See,

1167
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,690
I try to impart a little wisdom
at the end. Thank you sir.

1168
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,250
It's been a pleasure as always, my friend
where were, okay, so Patriot obviously,

1169
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:05,780
but where else can people support? So
this is the thing that everyone thought.

1170
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:10,510
So I just signed up on
subscribed star. Uh, I also,

1171
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:14,200
they could follow me. I have a
youtube channel. The sad truth act,

1172
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,170
Gad side is my Twitter handle. I've got up
on the frame. Yeah. That was just going,

1173
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:21,800
how can they support all support
me for support, pow, subscribed,

1174
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,310
star and Patrion. Yeah. I don't
really don't end the show with the,

1175
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,170
with the pimping out of that nature,

1176
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,580
but I just think people are trying
to figure it out now. They want it.

1177
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,220
They want to support good ideas in strange
and I should say I'm everyday that I

1178
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:37,380
see your success. You know, there's
an old expression that says, uh,

1179
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,580
whenever I see my friends succeed,
something in me dies,

1180
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:44,390
which is the ugly emotion of envy.
I feel the opposite for you.

1181
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:48,080
And I truly mean that every
as I see you flourish, I say,

1182
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:52,490
I knew this guy when he was a fetus and
I love that you are this big Herculean

1183
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:54,240
guy now. Good for you buddy. Can wish.

1184
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:57,380
I love that you're doing
it right alongside me. So
thank you. Are, there you go.

1185
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:01,210
All right, well say more nice things
to each other off camera. Um, so yes.

1186
01:09:01,211 --> 01:09:03,050
So just very quickly,
uh,

1187
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:05,420
I'm trying to figure out what to
do with the Patriot and situation.

1188
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:08,030
If you are not happy with
what they're doing there.

1189
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:11,480
And I'm still trying to get more
information on everything. Uh,

1190
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:16,160
you can go to Dave rubin.com/donate if
you'd like to do that. And, uh, all right,

1191
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:16,501
this is,

1192
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:20,870
this is my last taping in the studio
for 2018 and it was a completely bananas

1193
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:24,860
here. I did about a hundred stops on
the road, uh, got back into stand up.

1194
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,820
I think we did some good stuff here. We
do have shows coming out, uh, on Monday.

1195
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:32,390
I think we have a eamomm Tahiti and then,
uh,

1196
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:36,380
which we take just a couple of days ago.
It's really wild, a great interview. Uh,

1197
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,470
and then we've got rabbi
David Wolpe and Bishop Barron.

1198
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:41,450
I think that's on Wednesday,
if I'm not mistaken.

1199
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:43,670
We've got a clip show at the end of
the year and a couple of other things.

1200
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,600
Thank you for watching.
And good.
