00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.780
- In the current moment we live in,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.140
selfless acts hardly dominate
our political environment.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.720
Instead, we see our
leaders dodging issues,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240
exploiting others to serve
their own self-interests

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.140
without much regard for
what's right for our country,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.793
or for how we can work together.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.130
Mayor Landrieu stands out

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.680
against that backdrop very brightly.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.960
He fits the mold of a Profile In Courage,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.050
not just for what he did,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.850
but for how he did it.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.000
Despite facing intense criticism,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.470
like we've heard tonight,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.690
heated political attacks,
personal threats,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.410
he removed four Confederate monuments

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.410
from public spaces in New Orleans.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.190
And he gave an eloquent
and compassionate speech,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.070
the kind of which I have
not heard in a long time,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.968
explaining to his city
and our country and to me,

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:45.800
why that decision was the right one

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880
and why our public spaces
should be committed

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.680
to justice and equality

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.930
and provide hope and inspiration

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.137
for everyone who passes through them.
