00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.577
So let's look at the concept
of image re-projection.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.990
Our interest is being able to take
a scene like this, and capture it on two

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.210
different images and more being able to
then, of course, project the information

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.640
between those two images to be able to
reconstruct a panorama or a mosaic.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.320
So for the capturing this scene,
imagine I have the first viewpoint,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.370
we'll call it projection plane one.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.590
And this showcases
the second projection plane.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.770
Again, this is the scene
we're capturing.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.480
So what we're interested in
is relating these two images,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.650
which have been taken from
the same camera, and map a pixel

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.370
that is in this scene from both PP1 and
PP2.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.350
So it basically means is we now need to
cast a ray through each pixel in PP1,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.800
and draw the pixel where
a ray intersects PP2.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.040
So that means is, this point here,
this is a ray of light.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.420
This is a point here in PP2.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.920
And, of course, this is a point in PP1.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.825
Now in essence,
this is the kind of stuff we learn, we,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.960
we could do with things like,
feature detection, right?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.690
The same feature is
visible in between them,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.600
and now we need to
detect the same feature.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.840
And of course, this implies that this
ray of light is not going through this.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.720
So, rather than to make this
into a 3D re-projection problem,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.070
we will think of it as a 2D image
warp from one image to the other.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.800
What that means is, we're going to take
these two different projection planes,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.880
and think about what would be a work
between these two images that would

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.610
allow us to align these two points, even
though these cameras would have moved

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.625
as I moved this you know,
took the mosaic or a panorama.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.180
And remember, we're taking multiple
pictures of the same scene and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.780
we're moving the camera a little bit.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.170
So while this ray of light is going
through the same thing, these cameras,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.950
or these viewpoints, are shifted
a little bit, or moved a little bit.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.280
Of course we want to be able to do
this without knowing whole 3D geometry

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.950
of the scene, because if you were
to make it into 3D projection,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.560
it would be a little
bit more complicated.
