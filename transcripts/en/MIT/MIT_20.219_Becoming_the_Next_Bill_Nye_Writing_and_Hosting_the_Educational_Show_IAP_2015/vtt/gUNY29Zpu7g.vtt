00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.520
PROFESSOR: Thank you all
for uploading all your stuff

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.470
last night.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.270
We do watch everything,
just so you know.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.160
And it's a really,
really helpful for us.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.659
So I really appreciate
you guys doing that.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.970
I thought we'd start off today
by doing just a quick exercise

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.340
where you say the point of your
video in one to two sentences.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.860
And I think about
this last night.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.780
Because it's actually
a really nuanced thing,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.060
understanding the
difference between what

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.850
the point of your video is
and what your videos does.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.510
I was trying to think of a good
way to explain it last night

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.680
and this morning.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.880
And I think that
might be the best

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.760
way for me to understand it.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.100
And that's why I gave that
example of the snot video,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.600
right?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.489
Because the point of the
video that I made about snot

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.980
wasn't to explain what snot is.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.130
That's what my video does.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.880
But the point of it is to show
that this material that you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.470
take for granted,
that's in your body,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.390
actually does all these
xyz amazing things.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.550
So does the difference
between those two things

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.590
make sense to you guys?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.006
Or do you recognize
the difference

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.530
between those two things?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.570
So for instance, Joshua.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.586
Your video maybe about what
a binary search is, right?

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:38.210
But that's not the
point of your video.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.700
That's what your video does.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.150
In achieving the
point of your video,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.520
explaining why binary
search is, is sort

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.710
of a happy afterthought, right?

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.360
But it's not what drives
the video forward.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.490
So if we could just
go around and pitch

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.880
the point of your video
in one to two sentences.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.750
And the more specific
it is the better, right?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.965
Because we can generalize things
like, the point of my video

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:07.900
is to explain how
amazing snot is.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.639
But that's actually
not that different

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.790
from the point of my videos to
explain what snot is, right?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.424
I've just thrown in an
adjective, basically.

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:17.840
So does that sound
OK to everyone?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.860
And I think this will be
helpful because once you really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.900
think of what the
thesis of your video

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.630
is it's going to help
you a lot in scripting.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.100
Because you'll always be able
to go back to that big point,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.600
right?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.720
If you're scripting with the
objective of explaining what

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.010
a fractal is, that's what
Ulea's video is about it,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.330
it's really easy to get
lost in the details.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.190
So that's the whole
point of this exercise.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.890
Does anyone want to go first?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.230
Otherwise we'll
just go in order.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.230
AUDIENCE: I'll go first.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.563
PROFESSOR: Awesome, thanks Josh.

00:03:02.563 --> 00:03:08.670
AUDIENCE: So you were just
highlighting that my video,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.050
it was about the binary
search algorithm.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.000
But I guess the theme here
is why can't find my stuff?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.970
And how can I find it there?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.490
That's what the theme is about.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.460
And the question is
can Google teach me

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.745
how to do my own search
in my life better.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.870
PROFESSOR: I think it's a
really good start, right?

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.495
Because we were
talking about yesterday

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:32.010
the power of questions.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.980
But again, the point of your
video isn't the question.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.410
The point of your video is
the answer to the question.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.630
So what if you go
from there and try

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.060
to go for two sentences that
try to answer those questions.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.240
AUDIENCE: Do you
have an example?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.760
PROFESSOR: Well, wait.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.010
Say the questions again?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.576
AUDIENCE: Why can't
I find my stuff?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.684
And how can I find it better?

00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:06.570
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.050
So Josh, how can you
find your stuff better?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.650
AUDIENCE: If we keep a list
of, like, where is it located?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.110
Or better yet, if they're
positioned in a way

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.200
that has a relationship
among them.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.950
So it's kind of like, if you put
stuff in the toilet, everything

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.550
you need to use in the toilet,
you put them in that location.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.430
So you avoid putting
things in places where

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.140
they don't need to be there.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.660
But you place the things where
the relationship is natural.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.410
PROFESSOR: So basically
what you're saying

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.070
is that the way you
organize objects

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.440
isn't just for
aesthetic purposes.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.630
It can actually change
the time and efficiency

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.967
in which you find things.

00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:56.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.890
PROFESSOR: Which doesn't
sound like a big deal

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.660
until you realize that
that's the fundamental way

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.164
that something as
huge as Google uses.

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:05.830
Is that correct?

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.070
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.120
PROFESSOR: Does that
feel like more of a point

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.284
than this is how a
search engine works?

00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:14.600
AUDIENCE: It's more of a point.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.715
PROFESSOR: That's
more of a point?

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.215
AUDIENCE: That
sounds like something

00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:18.615
more than you're writing down.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.876
I mean, for me, at least, maybe.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:21.810
I'm a visual person.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.900
But, like, that's a
really important concept

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.730
that we just figured out.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.679
Right?

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.720
PROFESSOR: It's like, it's
a super nuanced thing.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.890
And very difficult
to figure out.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.270
It's a lot easier to figure
out someone else's point

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.730
than your own, actually.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.790
Which is why I wanted you
guys to come up with a script

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.720
sometime tomorrow.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.300
It's a lot easier for me,
at least, as an editor

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.300
to give productive
feedback when I actually

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.000
have something tangible
in front of me.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.870
So your questions were a
really great starting point.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.470
And the script that
you wrote is also

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.719
a really great starting point.

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.049
Because there's a lot of
material to work with.

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:01.840
But I wouldn't have
been able to figure out

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.660
that that was your point unless
I had had those materials,

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.520
right?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.770
The questions are a super
good starting point.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.820
Oftentimes the
point of your video

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.320
is going to be the answer
to those questions.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.340
So the questions
set up the video.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.698
But the point of the video
is not the questions.

00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:23.022
AUDIENCE: It's like the
difference between a symptom

00:06:23.022 --> 00:06:26.459
and a disease from a
doctor's perspective, right?

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:28.630
Like, that's a different
way of thinking about it.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.480
AUDIENCE: You keep asking,
like, why is something itching?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.410
Why is something itching?

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.735
And then you finally understand
the core reason to why?

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:35.865
I think that's what you're
trying to get across?

00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:36.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.713
And I think it's a
very compelling way

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:43.310
to set up not just video,
but scientific papers, talks.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.560
Any time you're
trying to sell an idea

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.880
to someone, grant proposals.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.049
Oftentimes you'll ask somebody
you're going to the conference,

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:53.090
what are you going to do?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.548
And their answer
is well, I'm going

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:57.020
to talk about the
research that I did.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.932
And that's not really helpful.

00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:02.390
Obviously, you're going to talk
about the research you did.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.980
What I want to know is
what is your research?

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.040
I know that you're going to talk
about binary search, probably

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.710
from the title of your video.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.410
What I want to know
is, what is it, right?

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.450
So let's do this one more time.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.420
Can you describe the
point of your video

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.490
in two sentences or less?

00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:31.130
AUDIENCE: The way
we could find things

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:38.414
better is the way we put--
[INAUDIBLE] right now.

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:40.220
PROFESSOR: That's a good start.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.610
That's good.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.220
So the way we can
find things better,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.650
you're trying to
relate a concept

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.330
or an everyday
experience that we have,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.290
like organizing things.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.710
So the way we organize things.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.610
The way we find things
better is the way

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.578
Google could find
our results better.

00:08:01.578 --> 00:08:02.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.910
Yeah.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.700
That's a much stronger
point than the questions

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.450
you had initially.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.316
Than saying the point is to
explain what binary search is.

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:16.190
And you can flesh that
out a little bit more.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.610
But do you see where
we're going with this?

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.930
Ulea, we're going
around doing one

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.460
to two sentence explanations
of what our videos are.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.124
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:29.540
PROFESSOR: Let's
have other people

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.900
go since you just got here.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.108
Paul, do you mind going next?

00:08:32.108 --> 00:08:33.289
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.465
So mine's about using
principles that kids are already

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:39.100
familiar with, like
floating and sinking

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.049
to show an application
of navel architecture.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.842
Specifically, how
to prevent ships

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:50.223
from sinking using subdivision
and Archimedes's Law.

00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:51.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.670
So that is very informative.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.500
That's, like, a
perfect description

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.900
of what your
video's going to be.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.690
That maybe verbatim what
you put as the summary

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.270
in the YouTube video.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.787
Like, that's going to be super
helpful to a teacher who's

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:07.870
looking through the videos
and wanting to find out

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.290
what videos are about.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.890
So I guess my question
would be, what

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.200
are the actual
principles that kids

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.350
learn that would
help them understand

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.030
the ship and the subdivision?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.847
AUDIENCE: So kids are familiar
with floating and sinking

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:28.449
because they go through second
grade or something like that.

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:30.240
PROFESSOR: And not just
kids, but everyone.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.159
Right.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.900
PROFESSOR: So you
could start off

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.110
"Most people are familiar
with the concepts of flooding

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.188
and sinking."

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:39.064
AUDIENCE: Right,
but how you can be

00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:46.000
able to divide your
ship so that it can

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.619
float when it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:50.160
I think I'm kind of
going in circles.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.140
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.015
That's a great start.

00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:55.187
And oftentimes what I
personally like a lot--

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:56.770
and maybe this is
something that we've

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.100
been repeating over
and over again--

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.010
but the whole concept
of the unexpected.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.090
The familiar becoming
unfamiliar, as Chris

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.420
was talking about.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.480
The fact that a huge piece
of technical equipment,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.040
like a ship, can be
protected from sinking

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.940
using just the basic principles
that even second graders know

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.740
is actually really amazing.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.240
All right, so maybe
that's something

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.230
that you can sort of play off
of in the point of your video.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.050
That the concepts that we learn
as children, like why things

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.350
float and why things sink, are
actually the building blocks

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:43.940
of knowing how to protect
machinery like submarines

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.300
from sinking even
when they get damaged.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.090
And the wording of that
obviously isn't super great.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.990
AUDIENCE: But yeah.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.633
That an aircraft
carrier, which is

00:10:53.633 --> 00:10:57.774
one of the most complicated
machines ever built--

00:10:57.774 --> 00:10:59.190
the fact that it
can even float is

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.834
based on this very
simple principle

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:07.470
that you learn in, you know,
first grade or second grade.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
that's a very strong point

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.260
to the video, actually.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.210
I personally love the idea of
complexity from simplicity.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.130
That the things
that people often

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.420
think of as being
really complicated,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.220
like naval architecture
or systems biology,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.250
are actually built off
of really simple concepts

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.490
and really simple ideas.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.430
Does that makes sense to people?

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.770
OK.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.054
David, how about we
go with you next?

00:11:36.054 --> 00:11:37.470
AUDIENCE: The point
of my video is

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.090
that some people are naturally
predisposed to better survive

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.385
the next Ice Age.

00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:45.760
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
I didn't hear--

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.530
some people are better
disposed to what--

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.150
AUDIENCE: Some people are better
predisposed to better survive

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.410
the next Ice Age.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.720
PROFESSOR: The next Ice Age?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and they
could be predisposed

00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:59.132
by genetically or physically, or
maybe they just do meditation.

00:11:59.132 --> 00:12:00.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.600
Yeah, actually that is a point.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.880
That's a thesis,
that's an argument.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.470
And I think that's a
very interesting one.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.680
But notice that the
pitch wasn't why

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.570
are some people more
predisposed to this?

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.410
Or why do I feel cold
but my friend doesn't?

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.170
Right?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.175
The point is an answer
to those questions.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.360
Does anyone have
feedback or suggestions

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.325
on maybe ways that David
could alter the point at all?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.490
And again, no one is ever going
to read your point, right?

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.880
No one is ever going to
see your thesis written out

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.420
before they watch your video.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.720
The idea is that they're
going to watch the video,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.600
and they're going to come
to the same conclusion

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.410
that you've written.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.150
So it's OK if the
wording's not perfect.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.300
Because no one's ever
going to read it.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.050
They're just going
to watch your video.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.883
But I guess if you were
going to publish it,

00:13:08.883 --> 00:13:13.630
I would open up with have
things like genetic makeup

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.530
or physiological
differences among people are

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.315
what might predispose certain
humans to survive the next Ice

00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.470
Age.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.302
Kenneth, do you want to go next?

00:13:25.302 --> 00:13:26.992
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:13:26.992 --> 00:13:28.700
The more succinct
point I can think about

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.310
is letting them know that time
travel right now is not doable

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.800
yet.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.750
Yeah, that's the most
succinct point I can think of.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.070
If you want me to elaborate
a bit more on that,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.960
it's to let you know
that we can possibly

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.740
travel forward in time faster.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.800
But traveling back in time
requires too much energy.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.720
PROFESSOR: Too much energy.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.170
OK.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.490
, Again nice distilled point.

00:14:00.062 --> 00:14:02.520
I would say that you could
flesh that out a little bit more

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.910
for the point.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.010
Because that's, like, time
travel is not possible

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.910
is the ultimate argument
that you're making.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.650
But it's a super broad one.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.080
So you can include maybe
why it's not possible.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.330
Again, because it
takes too much energy.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.350
I don't exactly know
what that means.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.241
But maybe your video
is going to cover that?

00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:20.741
OK.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.530
Andrea, do you feel
comfortable going?

00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:30.796
AUDIENCE: I'll throw
something out there.

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:33.640
Even though I think
it's more what it does.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.970
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.400
But see, when you throw
that out there, it

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.500
makes it a lot easier
for us to give feedback.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.435
It gives us something
to work off of.

00:14:42.435 --> 00:14:45.480
AUDIENCE: So the
video illustrates

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:52.860
how engineers in medicine use
natural processes in our bodies

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.104
to actually repair or
improve the human body.

00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.770
PROFESSOR: So I
actually think the point

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.850
is in there if you just take
out the first three words.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.490
Engineers and-- what
was it-- scientists

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.869
use natural processes
in our bodies to what?

00:15:09.869 --> 00:15:12.184
AUDIENCE: Enhance it.

00:15:12.184 --> 00:15:14.500
To improve or repair.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I actually think

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.878
the point is in there
if you just get rid

00:15:17.878 --> 00:15:23.742
of the "my video explains."

00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:25.200
AUDIENCE: Which is
kind of awesome,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.470
considering where she
started two days ago, right?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.660
Like, the braces, you
totally done the [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.242
It's awesome.

00:15:33.242 --> 00:15:34.950
AUDIENCE: That's what
you asked me to do.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.241
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was awesome.

00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:37.930
I'm saying it was awesome!

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:38.620
Way to go.

00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:42.310
PROFESSOR: Nathan,
you want to go?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.370
We aren't the only
ones who eat our food.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.223
And life without them
would be a lot different.

00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.473
PROFESSOR: That's pretty good!

00:15:51.473 --> 00:15:53.360
That's pretty good!

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.310
Nathan had an aha
moment last night,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.120
if you heard his reflection.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.900
And I'm really excited to
see where you go with that.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.440
But very, very different
point and answer

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.530
to my question than the one
you gave, like, yesterday even.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.950
So I asked him what the point
of his video was yesterday.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.685
And he was like, to explain
what decomposition is.

00:16:12.685 --> 00:16:14.060
But do you see
how this is, like,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.690
a completely different point?

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.950
And a much more engaging one?

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.040
And in explaining and
getting to that point,

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.275
he is going to cover
what decomposition is.

00:16:23.275 --> 00:16:24.040
All right, Ulea.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.240
AUDIENCE: Mine is
repeating patterns

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.620
called fractals are present in
every facet of our existence

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.280
and are indispensable in
nature, research, medicine,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.920
and technology.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.557
In that way, mathematics helps
us explore and understand

00:16:38.557 --> 00:16:40.545
the world around us.

00:16:40.545 --> 00:16:41.539
PROFESSOR: Nice.

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:43.527
Nice.

00:16:43.527 --> 00:16:45.515
Any feedback on that one?

00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:53.964
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat it?

00:16:53.964 --> 00:16:56.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.870
Repeating patterns
called fractals

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.750
are present in every
facet of our existence

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.760
and are indispensable in
nature, research, medicine,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.130
and technology.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.410
In that way, math helps
us explore and understand

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.790
the world around us.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.859
PROFESSOR: That's also a super
different point than the one

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.579
you had given yesterday, right?

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.200
Yesterday the
point of your video

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.010
was-- it wasn't even
like, what is a fractal?

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:24.973
It was like, what is the
philosophy of math, right?

00:17:24.973 --> 00:17:27.050
AUDIENCE: No, it was was
math even real, right?

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.758
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that
was two days, yeah.

00:17:28.758 --> 00:17:31.796
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but you've
come so far in narrowing

00:17:31.796 --> 00:17:33.102
this concept, it's awesome.

00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:35.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
hopefully with these points

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.990
it's going to help you
script a tighter set of text.
