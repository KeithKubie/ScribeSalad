that we're doing special effects and
 

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:18.100
that we're doing special effects and
we're because I don't think imagination

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.110
we're because I don't think imagination
 

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.889
we're because I don't think imagination
should be measured by a dollar symbol I

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:20.899
should be measured by a dollar symbol I
 

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.079
should be measured by a dollar symbol I
think even if you have ten bucks go out

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:23.089
think even if you have ten bucks go out
 

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:25.420
think even if you have ten bucks go out
and make a movie do whatever it is it

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:25.430
and make a movie do whatever it is it
 

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.160
and make a movie do whatever it is it
might have to be just a flip book at

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.170
might have to be just a flip book at
 

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.650
might have to be just a flip book at
that point or whatever but you know

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.660
that point or whatever but you know
 

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.240
that point or whatever but you know
animate it with stick figures but

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.250
animate it with stick figures but
 

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.699
animate it with stick figures but
whatever you have available at your

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:33.709
whatever you have available at your
 

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:36.490
whatever you have available at your
resources you should be able just use it

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:36.500
resources you should be able just use it
 

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.889
resources you should be able just use it
and just use it creatively and to just

00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:38.899
and just use it creatively and to just
 

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.069
and just use it creatively and to just
max out what you can do with that and

00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079
max out what you can do with that and
 

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:45.400
max out what you can do with that and
not limit your imagination and also I

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:45.410
not limit your imagination and also I
 

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.990
not limit your imagination and also I
think it's funny when you see something

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000
think it's funny when you see something
 

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.689
think it's funny when you see something
and it's like on a string or you know

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:48.699
and it's like on a string or you know
 

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:51.460
and it's like on a string or you know
things that are like made of plastic to

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
things that are like made of plastic to
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.960
things that are like made of plastic to
me that's more tangible it's more

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:52.970
me that's more tangible it's more
 

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.230
me that's more tangible it's more
interesting than you know these like

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240
interesting than you know these like
 

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.040
interesting than you know these like
really detailed CG

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.050
really detailed CG
 

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.010
really detailed CG
animations everything so I like to see

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.020
animations everything so I like to see
 

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.620
animations everything so I like to see
things that are real it was so weird I

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.630
things that are real it was so weird I
 

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.170
things that are real it was so weird I
never realized how desensitized I kind

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.180
never realized how desensitized I kind
 

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.510
never realized how desensitized I kind
of got how my CG there is I don't really

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:09.520
of got how my CG there is I don't really
 

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.100
of got how my CG there is I don't really
have too much against CG I think it's

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
have too much against CG I think it's
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.860
have too much against CG I think it's
overused but uh you know it's a fine

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:13.870
overused but uh you know it's a fine
 

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.810
overused but uh you know it's a fine
tool but there was something so strange

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:15.820
tool but there was something so strange
 

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.639
tool but there was something so strange
when I see a giant monster like at

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:17.649
when I see a giant monster like at
 

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:20.550
when I see a giant monster like at
Excalibur uh and I know it's it's

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560
Excalibur uh and I know it's it's
 

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.560
Excalibur uh and I know it's it's
obviously a guy in a suit it's obviously

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.570
obviously a guy in a suit it's obviously
 

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.420
obviously a guy in a suit it's obviously
a model but when he hits it it's like I

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:24.430
a model but when he hits it it's like I
 

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.820
a model but when he hits it it's like I
know that the physical hit I'm actually

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:26.830
know that the physical hit I'm actually
 

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.860
know that the physical hit I'm actually
gonna feel that when it impacts because

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:28.870
gonna feel that when it impacts because
 

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.230
gonna feel that when it impacts because
it's really there yeah where I can see

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240
it's really there yeah where I can see
 

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.900
it's really there yeah where I can see
like a CG Godzilla hitting a movie it

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910
like a CG Godzilla hitting a movie it
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.880
like a CG Godzilla hitting a movie it
won't have I won't have this be a

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:35.890
won't have I won't have this be a
 

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.769
won't have I won't have this be a
connection because I know it's it's CG

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:37.779
connection because I know it's it's CG
 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.010
connection because I know it's it's CG
I'm just so used to seeing that uh so

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.020
I'm just so used to seeing that uh so
 

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.990
I'm just so used to seeing that uh so
was very interesting to see like actual

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000
was very interesting to see like actual
 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.840
was very interesting to see like actual
physical destruction again yeah that it

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:45.850
physical destruction again yeah that it
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.699
physical destruction again yeah that it
that isn't it's somehow it actually

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:47.709
that isn't it's somehow it actually
 

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:49.800
that isn't it's somehow it actually
feels more real even though it looks

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:49.810
feels more real even though it looks
 

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.320
feels more real even though it looks
more fake yeah that's very very

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.330
more fake yeah that's very very
 

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.420
more fake yeah that's very very
stressful because then a lot of things

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:54.430
stressful because then a lot of things
 

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.150
stressful because then a lot of things
we you know put a guy in this elaborate

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160
we you know put a guy in this elaborate
 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.949
we you know put a guy in this elaborate
costume that that's that takes like an

hour to put on and he's got these
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.269
hour to put on and he's got these
tentacles that come out and these wings

tentacles that come out and these wings
 

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.430
tentacles that come out and these wings
and there's people operating the wings

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440
and there's people operating the wings
 

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.230
and there's people operating the wings

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240
with the strings and people are have
 

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.240
with the strings and people are have
poles on the tentacles we have to remove

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.250
poles on the tentacles we have to remove
 

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.180
poles on the tentacles we have to remove
the poles later and post but then you'd

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.190
the poles later and post but then you'd
 

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.620
the poles later and post but then you'd
have this building that's the size of

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:13.630
have this building that's the size of
 

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.449
have this building that's the size of
him and he's going to smash it and

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:15.459
him and he's going to smash it and
 

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:17.730
him and he's going to smash it and
you're going to get one take sometimes

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:17.740
you're going to get one take sometimes
 

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.590
you're going to get one take sometimes
out and if it goes wrong if it doesn't

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600
out and if it goes wrong if it doesn't
 

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.120
out and if it goes wrong if it doesn't
break the way it's supposed to break or

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.130
break the way it's supposed to break or
 

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.100
break the way it's supposed to break or
something happens then it's like it's

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.110
something happens then it's like it's
 

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.870

over and you're done so we're just so
 

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.170
over and you're done so we're just so
stressed out you know but then once it

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:28.180
stressed out you know but then once it
 

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.579
stressed out you know but then once it
happened it was awesome it was like oh

my god we did that but yeah on the
 

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.810
my god we did that but yeah on the
blu-ray it goes into more detail about

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:33.820
blu-ray it goes into more detail about
 

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.180
blu-ray it goes into more detail about
how we did all that stuff and really

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:36.190
how we did all that stuff and really
 

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.639
how we did all that stuff and really
candid it just shows like raw footage

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:38.649
candid it just shows like raw footage
 

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:40.620
candid it just shows like raw footage
from like the behind the scenes stuff of

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:40.630
from like the behind the scenes stuff of
 

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.750
from like the behind the scenes stuff of
us putting that all together yeah it was

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760
us putting that all together yeah it was
 

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.550
us putting that all together yeah it was
crazy but I was I was like kicking

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560
crazy but I was I was like kicking
 

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.829
crazy but I was I was like kicking
myself up until the day when we were

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839
myself up until the day when we were
 

00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.389
myself up until the day when we were
trying to shoot all that really

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399
trying to shoot all that really
 

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.760
trying to shoot all that really
elaborate stuff because it got to the

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:50.770
elaborate stuff because it got to the
 

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.780
elaborate stuff because it got to the
point where I was like this is

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:51.790
point where I was like this is
 

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.819
point where I was like this is
impossible and nobody does like physical

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:53.829
impossible and nobody does like physical
 

00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:55.170
impossible and nobody does like physical
effects like this everything's in

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:55.180
effects like this everything's in
 

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.090
effects like this everything's in
computer now so it's hard to even find

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.100
computer now so it's hard to even find
 

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.000
computer now so it's hard to even find
people to build that stuff for you and
