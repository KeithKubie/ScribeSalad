00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.810
Hi, I'm Amy Jo Kim,
designer, entrepreneur,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.860
and startup coach.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.080
I've worked with dozens of
startups and game studios

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
to bring their
early ideas to life

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.110
by creating an MVP,
Minimum Viable Product.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.960
Through trial and error,
I've learned what works

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.870
and what doesn't at the
early stages of innovation.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.900
I synthesized these lessons
into a set of techniques

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.530
I call MVP Design Hacks.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.390
Today, I'm going to teach you
a quick, effective hack that's

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.790
a great way to kick
off your MVP process.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.070
It's called the
MVP Design Canvas.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.190
This one-page document
gives your team

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.220
a highly-useful tool for
articulating and evolving

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.320
your product strategy
and key assumptions.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.360
This has places for you to
write down your initial thoughts

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.060
about who your customers are,
what their unmet needs are,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.980
what problem you're solving,
what solution you're coming up

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.830
with to solve that problem.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.910
The value prop your solution
delivers, the unfair advantage

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.180
or competitive edge
that you and your team

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
have that makes you ideally
suited to solving this problem,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.110
the early metrics that you'll
use to gauge whether you're

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.320
on the right track;
and then, finally,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.380
the key assumptions that you
have going into this project

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.570
that you need to test to
determine whether or not

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.160
this is a viable idea
that's worth pursuing.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.840
You'll use this canvas, as
your assumptions get tested

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.220
and refined, throughout
your development process.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.540
To update and communicate
your new vision strategy

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.000
and direction to your
team and any investors

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.490
or interested people.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.320
It's a great tool to
help you and your team

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.270
stay strategically aligned.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.730
Let's see how this design
canvas works in action.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.539
Let me tell you a story about
a recent client I worked with.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.256
Let's call them Toy Co.

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:12.130
They're part of the
Collaborative Consumption

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.270
movement.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.860
They're a toy rental
company, initially

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.590
specializing in building toys.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.580
We worked through our
kickoff questionnaire,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.250
and found we had a lot
of unanswered questions--

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.150
some very clear assumptions.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.340
Like many companies, Toy
Co started with a solution.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.880
They had this idea that a
digital community, where people

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.870
could connect around
their shared love of toys,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050
would be a great thing
for their company,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.150
for driving the metrics
they're interested in.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.170
Particularly
satisfaction retention,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.690
and the length of time
each rental was out.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.760
So we took that as
a starting point,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.290
and then fleshed out the
rest of our assumptions.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.390
After completing this
Design Canvas exercise,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.320
our assumptions were
clear, and we set out

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.650
to test that assumption and see
what our members really wanted.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.300
Through a series of
surveys and interviews

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.590
we identified a handful
of early adopters,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.690
sketched up our ideas, and walk
them through the possibilities.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.500
Here's what we learned.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.040
First of all, let's
look at the solution.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.950
We found that, in fact, none
of the members we talked to

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.180
were interested in the
solution we were proposing.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.630
However, they were interested
in video content related

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.560
to the toys that would entertain
and educate their children,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.210
and keep them busy.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.030
We found this out
through our interviews.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.410
We discovered our early
customers had an unmet need

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.170
that we knew nothing about.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.240
Which was a need for
curated, wholesome,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.920
family-friendly
content they could

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.110
trust that would feed their
kids' building toys habit.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.400
Certain kids, when
they're a certain age,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.210
this is all they want to do.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.100
And these parents,
these enthusiast,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.460
these early adopters, were very
clear that that was something

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.480
they were seeking, and did
not have a great solution for.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.990
So the value prop, rather
than being connected

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.170
with other parents, was actually
enriching video content.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.350
Trusted by the parents that
they could show to their kids,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.230
so they could make a phone
call, take dinner off the stove,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.800
have a few minutes with their
husband at the end of the day.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.780
That was the need we identified
that we knew nothing about.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.900
So we change the solution
that we had in mind

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.470
to be this curated
video collection.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.160
Turns out, our MVP
is a YouTube channel.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.270
Not building some
technology ourselves,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270
but simply developing
some content

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.670
and testing it with our users
by using the YouTube platform.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.160
The unfair advantage
remains the same.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.430
The metrics basically
remain the same.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.760
And the assumption
that we tested

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.050
resulted in a pivot of our
focus for our digital community,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.160
based on what we know our
members want and need,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.480
without building a single
piece of technology,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.760
or writing a single
line of code.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.140
That's the power
of using this MVP

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.580
Canvas to think through
and test your assumptions.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.320
I hope this example
has inspired you

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.700
to try this exercise
with your own ideas.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.050
It's a great way to
crystallize and communicate

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.260
what you're doing.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.330
And a great tool for
tracking and communicating

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.650
changes to your project as
you're thinking evolves.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.880
If you can put aside
your confidence,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.090
and take the mindset and
point of view of a scientist,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.010
and run your MVP ideas through
the gauntlet of testing it

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.300
with real users.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.870
You will save time, money,
and greatly increase

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.640
your chances of success.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.340
Good luck with your project.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.230

Hacks for more information,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.870
Thank you.
