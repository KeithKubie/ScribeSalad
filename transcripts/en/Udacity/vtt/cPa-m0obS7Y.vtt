00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.970
These are reflections in the y-axis of one another. We can see that if we flip

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.450
this one across this line right here, we'd end up with this exact graph. Now we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.778
can why this happens from our equations if we rewrite this one using the other

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:21.188
form we learned. Remember, we can also write this as 2 to the negative x. A few

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:26.802
lessons ago, we saw that if you replace x with negative x in a function. You

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:31.836
end up with the reflection of the original function across the y-axis. That's

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:36.310
exactly what's happening here. Turns out this other form could be pretty useful

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.195
in certain situations.
