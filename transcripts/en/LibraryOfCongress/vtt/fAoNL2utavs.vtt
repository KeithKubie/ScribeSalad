&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.430
How's everybody doing?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.470
So my name's Pam Jackson.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.530
I'm the director for
the Center for the Book

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.440
which is a really awesome place
in the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.940
And I'd like to welcome you
here to the Young Readers Center

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240
which is another really,
really great place.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.620
How many of you are
here for the first time?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.490
Awesome. Thanks for being here.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.940
So some of the hands
didn't get raised.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.240
Some of you have been here before.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.610
Yes? Or no.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.950 position:56%
You just weren't responding earlier.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.250
Okay. Great.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.550
All right.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.310
So let me ask you where
are you guys from?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.060
Okay. Okay.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.440
Great. So and then
what grades do we have?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.740
What grades?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.850
Is everybody third grade?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.100
Welcome. What's wonderful
about third grade?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.420
What do you like most
about third grade?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.450
Recess. Well, just -- this is
the time you can shout it out.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.190
So recess.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.260
Recess. Two recess -- you
have two recesses every day?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.750
Wow. And you get to take
on more responsibility.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.290
Wow. That's awesome.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.430
What's that?

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.670
One recess in the mornings?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.970
Wednesdays.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.270 position:56%
Oh, on Wednesdays you only have one.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.240
So what's today?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.220
Today's not Wednesday so
you have two recesses today?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.550
So on Wednesdays, you get
out at 3:15 and every what --

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.700
Monday through Saturday
you get out at 4:15?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.810
You have extended day.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.710
And do you really have school on
Saturday or did you just miss that?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.260
You don't go Saturday?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.710
You don't go to school
on Sundays either?

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.640
Wow. So you have Saturdays
and Sundays off?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.830
Wow. Okay.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.240
Great. All right.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.520
So sometimes -- yeah,
so no school on Monday?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.920
What is Monday?

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.360
Columbus Day.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.110
Okay. So, you know, we're actually
open on Monday, Columbus Day.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.250
So you can come back
and visit us again.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.550
Bring your family, friends.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.850
We're open Monday through
Friday 9:00 to 4:30.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990
On a day like Monday when you
don't have school, we're here.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.290
So it's a great place to come.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.620
There are a couple of rooms
fulls of books back there.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.650
You can lounge around and hang
with your family and friends.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.080
So we do invite you back for that.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.090
And let me talk a little bit
about why we're here today.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.310
So why are we here today?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.460
Yes? Well, it's a field trip, yes.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.930
To know about books.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.400
Yes, ma'am?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.700
So we can learn.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.190
Okay. We can learn
different types of books.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.020 position:56%
Does anyone know what types of books
we're going to talk about today?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.800
What type of book it is?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.140
Who hasn't talked yet?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.430
Yes? Chicken in the -- oh.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.640
Is there something behind me?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.360
Oh, yes. Chicken in the Kitchen.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.190
And we have with us
somebody who's kind

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.570
of something to do with the book.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.180
So what do you know about books?

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.030
Right. So -- yes, yes?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.670
They can teach you some things
and in this book we might learn

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.040
about chickens and we might
learn about kitchens; right?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.340
Yes, ma'am?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.730
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.820
You can find adventures in books.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.120
Absolutely.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.420
What else?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.500
You can learn about
lessons in books.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.800
That's true.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.650
Yes? Way in back.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.870
You can find puzzles.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.550 position:56%
Yes, you can sometimes find puzzles.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.160
So who makes books?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.420
Yes, sir? Authors.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.480
Right. And so we have the
author of this book with us.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.780
It's really great.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.080
She's going to do a
talk about her book,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.270
a little bit about
the motivation for it,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.400
and there's another person that's
with her that helped make the book.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.060
Who do you think that is?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.360
Illustrator.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.210
What's an illustrator?

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.180
Yes? Draws the pictures.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.480
That's right.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.290 position:56%
So we have the author and the
illustrator here with us for Chicken

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.250
in the Kitchen, Nnedi
Okorafor and Mehrdokht Amini.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.070
And they will be with us shortly.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.590
They're in the back
wrapping up something

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.320
and they'll be with us shortly.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.480
So tell me have any of you --

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.610
raise your hands if
you've authored a book?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.910
Or a story?

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.210
How about authored a story?

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.920
How about a story?

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.220
Okay. Great.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.520
Hands down.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.780
How many of you have authored
-- illustrated a story?

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.920
Okay. Great.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.220
All right.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.570
And how many of you --
so I asked this before.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.870
Let me try it again.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.490
How many of you have met other
authors and illustrators?

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.990
Yeah? Okay.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.260
Great. Where were you
when you did that?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.560
Were you here?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.020
Did you meet him here?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.150
No? Where were you?

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.580 position:56%
School. So you've had authors and
illustrators come to school and talk

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.060
to you about their books?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.360
That's really great.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.660
All right.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.960
All right.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.840 position:56%
So let me tell you a little bit more
about who's with us in the room.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.430
So we have a great partner.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.090
The Young Readers Center
partners with Everybody Wins DC

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.330
which is a really extraordinary
group of individuals

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.370
who help make this event possible.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.480
They coordinated with your
teachers to bring you here

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.130
and they helped actually facilitate
the books that will be gifts

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.970
that you'll get to
take home with you.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.910
And Jenny, wave your hand
is from Everybody Wins DC.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.550
She's with us helping today.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.710
So thank you for being here.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.230
We also have with us
Brenda Randolph.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.320
And Brenda is with Children's
Africana Book Awards.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.620
Let me pause.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.950
The Children Africana Book
Awards is the organization

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.520
that this book is actually --
we're celebrating the authors --

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.070
the author and the illustrator
as a winner of a special award.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.570
And it's from that organization.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.180
And Brenda Randolph is with us and
she's with the outreach council

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.920
of the African Studies Association.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.630
Wave your hand, say hello.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.930
Hi. Oh.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.340
Oh, beautiful.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.020
So when the -- so when books win
awards, that seal could be placed

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.720
on them to acknowledge that
they are award winners.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.020
All right.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.320
Great. And it looks like --

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.630
let me just check my notes here to
make sure I've covered everything.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.400
So, yes, we're going to get
ready to actually meet the author

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.950
and the illustrator who are
available, ready to come join us.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.150
So what do you guys know?

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.060 position:56%
The author's going to talk a little
bit about the motivation of her book

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.780
and then she's going
to read the story.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.390 position:56%
So what do you guys know you should
be doing when she starts to do that?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.690
Yes, ma'am?

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.990
Listening.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.910
So what do we listen with?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.770
Ears. Everybody do like this.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.230
Make sure I know you
know where your ears are.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.530
Okay. Great.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.680
And so when we're listening
what are we not doing?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.980
Talking. Okay.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.470
What do we talk with?

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.770
Okay. Do like this.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.070
Everybody clear.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.370
So nothing's happening here.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.690
All the action's here.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.990
Yes, yes. Okay.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.340
So let's welcome -- and --
and you're going to be excited

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.870
and it's going to be wonderful.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.330
So you'll have questions
and we'll have time for that

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.700 position:56%
so you can hold those until the end.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.910
So while she's leading
-- while the author

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.230
and the illustrator are leading
we're going to be listening.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.550
Do your ears again.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.420 position:56%
And then when they're finished, I'm
going to come back and say it's time

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.360
for questions and then
you'll be able to do what?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.660
Talk, okay.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.960
So no talking.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.260
Talking. Ready?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.140
Question? Well, no, it's
not so much a movie.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.870
I think there will be some
pictures here that show you the --

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.830
a bigger version of the book
as she's going through it.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.310
So it won't be a movie.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.400
It's going to be way more
exciting than a movie.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.490
All right.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.920 position:56%
Let's welcome our authors, Nnedi and
Mehrdokht, author and illustrator.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.220
Come on.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.880
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: How are
we supposed to get through?

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.670
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Oh, I guess
we -- let's make a path.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.970
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.270
Excuse me.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.570
Thank you.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.870
Excuse me.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.370
Okay. Good morning, everyone.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.670
&gt;&gt; [group] Good morning.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.970
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Oh,
wonderful, wonderful.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.670
So today I'm going to read you
my book, Chicken in the Kitchen.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:46.030
And this was a book that -- a
story that I read or that I told

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.000
to my daughter for years
when she was little.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.090
And the reason why I
told this story to her --

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.520
the reason why I made it up was

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.410
because my daughter just loved
chickens and she did not feel

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.200 position:56%
that chickens got their due respect.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.490
So -- so I came up with
a story about a chicken,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.380
a very, very special chicken.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.710
And over the years, I told her this
story and it kind of developed.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.710
And then eventually
when the opportunity

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.790
to write a children's book came
along, this was the first story

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.220
that popped into my head.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.560
And so it's wonderful to see
it realized in this book.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.880
So I'm going to read this to you.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:29.790 position:56%
It's titled, Chicken in the Kitchen.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.090
Okay.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.630
Let me get comfortable here.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.900
Okay. It was late at night.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.150
A noise had woken Anyaugo.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.570
She climbed out of bed and crept
quietly towards the kitchen.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:59.480
[noise]

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.240
Oh, my, Anyaugo whispered.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.930
What was she going to do?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.920
There was a giant chicken
in the kitchen.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.720
It was going to spoil the food her
mother and her aunties had cooked

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.450
for the New Yam Festival
the next day.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.640
She had to do something.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.800
[chicken noise] Said
the chicken happily.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:32.380
The New Yam Festival marked the
beginning of the harvest season.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.310
It was a time for being thankful,
dancing, seeing friends and family,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.570
and of course eating lots of yams.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.220
Anyaugo couldn't let the chicken
ruin the yam dishes in the fridge.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:50.620
What was wrong with
it, Anyaugo wondered.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.290
The chicken was causing
a lot of mischief.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.070
Anyaugo wished she knew where
her friend the Wood Wit was.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.430
He was a nature spirit.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:05.430
He would know what to do.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.070
Anyaugo tried to muster
up some courage.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.480
I'm going to just tell it to leave.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.060
Or maybe not.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.130
It was time to get
help from the Wood Wit.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.720
Where is it?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.250
Anyaugo wondered.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.590
The Wood Wit could travel
through anything made of wood.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.600
It can be almost anything
-- anywhere.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.770
Maybe it was playing
outside in the coconut trees.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.890
If so, she would never
be able to find it.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.740
Are you there, Anyaugo called.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.790
There you are, Anyaugo said.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.730
There you are, the Wood Wit said.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.030
It laughed.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.250
You have a chicken in your kitchen.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.120
You want to -- and you
want to get rid of it.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.850
How do you know?

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.570
Oh, I know everything that the
wood knows, the Wood Wit said.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.930
Anyaugo didn't understand
what the Wood Wit meant

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.310
but that didn't matter.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.350
The Wood Wit was always
saying odd things like that.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.590
Will you help me?

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.470
Sure. I love being helpful.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.080
It looks quite annoyed,
the Wood Wit said.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.300
Whatever have you done to it?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.450
I didn't do anything,
Anyaugo insisted.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.070
How can I make it leave?

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.460
Ask it, the Wood Wit said.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.060
But ask it in chickenese.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.400
But I don't speak chickenese,
cried Anyaugo.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.470
Say buck, buck, cluck,
the Wood Wit suggested.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.460
But you have to say it just right.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.760
It laughed out loud.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.690
It laughed out -- it burst out
laughing, amused with itself.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:09.770
Anyaugo lifted her chin,
clenched her fists and said hello.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.460
The chicken flashed
the sunniest, shiniest,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.040
sweetest smile Anyaugo
had ever seen.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.070
Then the Wood Wit began to hum.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:28.320
It sounded like three
voices and a soft drum beat.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.360
It was with the sound of the drum
beat that Anyaugo understood.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.150
How had she not guessed it?

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.690
This was more than a chicken.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.130
Buck, buck, it said softly.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.320
It was asking her to dance.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.030
Later that night, when
Anyaugo finally went

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.750
to bed, she smiled to herself.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.750
Her father had told her about
the powerful masquerade spirits

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.100
that came to participate
in the New Yam Festival.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.340
Masquerades visited the
community during the festivals,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.570
ceremonies, and events.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.290
Some were spirits of the
elements, like the land and water.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.600
Others were ancestors
returning to dance showing

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.140
that death was a natural
part of life.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.210
This one must have come
for a midnight snack.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:25.970
At the New Yam Festival the next
day, Anyaugo ate several yam dishes

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.820
and saw some of the biggest
yams she had ever seen.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.420
But though she watched many
wonderful masquerades perform,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.440
she did not see the chicken
masquerades amongst them until --

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.510
boom, boom, boom, -- The End.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:53.120
[ Applause ]

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.350
So a little bit -- a
little bit more about --

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.090
about Chicken in the Kitchen.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.390
Also masquerades.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.760
I didn't talk much
about masquerades.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.330
So masquerades are a very --
a deeply African tradition.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.720
All parts of Africa have their
own masquerading traditions.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.280
And masquerades are
basically, they are --

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.420
usually men who dress up
in these elaborate costumes

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.440 position:56%
and these costumes are -- they are
symbols for the spirits or ancestors

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.350
or people who have passed and
they come out during ceremonies,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.870
various ceremonies like
weddings, funerals,

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.860
parties, just celebrations.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.370
And they can be scary.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.470
They can be -- they can be utterly
terrifying; they can be funny;

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.460
they can just be weird; sometimes
they can just look like a big ball

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.220
of hay that dances
and shakes around.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.550
It's fascinating.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.440
So in this story, because my
daughter loved chickens so much

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.610
and I didn't feel like
chickens got enough respect,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.270
I decided to also create a
masquerade chicken in this story.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.680
So that's -- that's who you
encountered in this story.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.070
So do we want to segue
into the drawing stuff?

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.320
Okay. Okay.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.620
Go ahead.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.690
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Do you want to?

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.990
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Well, okay.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.290
No, you can go ahead.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.930
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Well, so how
many of you noticed other animals

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.350
in the slide presentation of
the book besides the chicken?

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.110
Raise your hand if you
noticed other animals.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.190 position:56%
And this is our talking part, right.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.890
So you can shout out
what animals did you see.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.600
I'll start over here.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.500
A cat? What did you see?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.870
You saw the chicken.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.170
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.020
A bear. You think you saw a bear.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.920
Okay. Yes, and what did you see?

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.220
A wood chuck?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.300
Oh, wow. You guys are
very observant.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.600
Really awesome.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.200
What did you see?

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.980
Did you have one?

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.280
So -- okay.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.580
Great. Thank you.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.990
Yes, one last one.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.390
Yes? Sorry, the what?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.260
Oh, the Wood Wit, yes.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.910
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor:
The Wood Wit, okay.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.400
So -- can anyone -- okay.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.850
So the Wood Wit is a creature that
lives in the -- it lives in wood.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.070
It can move through wood and
it's a very smarmy, sarcastic,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.950
tricky -- tricky character.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.900
And it is Anyaugo's best
friend in this story.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.310
Can anyone -- the Wood
Wit is here with us today.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.750
Can anyone -- has anyone
seen the Wood Wit?

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.600
Has anyone?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:47.620
Yes? Yes. Oh, look at the Wood Wit.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.920
It's here.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.220
Yes, the Wood Wit is
in all the walls

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.690
and the walls are made of wood.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.020
So -- okay.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.660
So yes. There were several
animals in the story; correct?

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.100
And Mehrdokht would like to --

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.330
is there any animal that
you guys would particular --

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.870
any character in the book that
you guys would particularly

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.370
like her to illustrate?

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.280
Because she drew all of the
-- everything in this book.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.380
So is there anything
that you'd like to see?

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.790
Yes? The chicken?

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.100
Super chicken?

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.060
Is that -- would you
say that the chicken

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.810
in this story was a super chicken?

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.430
Yes, it was quite large.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.350
Okay. No -- okay.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.640
So you'd like to -- okay.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.900 position:56%
It was kind of special, yes, it was.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.830
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Let's see somebody
who hasn't shared with us yet.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.420
Yeah. Let's get those hands up.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.420 position:56%
This is a time you get to talk so
who's going to -- ready for talking?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.600
Yes, in the front.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.920
Yes. The cat.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:14.150
Yes. You love kittens.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.750
Teeny tiny kitten.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.200
And did that kitten
look like your kitten?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.730
Nope. Your kitten's bigger.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.900
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: As
big as the chicken?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.410
Okay. Making sure.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.710
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Yes, sir?

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.120
Your favorite was the chicken.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.420
Okay. Great.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.470
that I should think
about is this pad

this is where we'll
switch back to using what?

&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: Of course,

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.900
I always start sketching
with a pen and pad.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.860
But then I use all
sorts of materials.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.770
It depends on the book.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.790
If I start painting and then I scan
them, take them to the computer

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.520
and work through digital software.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.450
I don't know whether you cared
about software like Photoshop.

and painting, making pictures and --

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.810
the whole thing to the
computer and work from there.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.890
So I combine everything
-- all this stuff that --

need to see the chicken?

want to see the chicken?

And they were so beautiful, so
powerful and I think they were kind

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.940
of -- got inspiration from looking

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.350
at the pictures from
the masquerades.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.740
Remember you can't find him exactly
in those pictures but, you know,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.440
the inspiration come from looking
at them and I just doodled and,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.170
you know, I do the sketches and --

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.250
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: And so
this might be a good segue.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.240
Is the Wood Wit your creation

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.550
or is this an African
culture creation that you've?

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.340
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: It's -- the
Wood Wit is kind of a blend

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.440
between things that, you know,
that I would hear relatives talk

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.390
about especially when they
were talking about the forests.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:58.510 position:56%
And so they'd often talk about
spirits in the forest and especially

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.150
in the wood, in the trees.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:04.610 position:56%
And so I would think about those and
then the Wood Wit came from that.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.550
And the Wood Wit's personality,
you know, very annoying,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.520
tricky personality, I guess
I kind of came up with that.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.400
Just fun, yeah, yeah.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.700

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.080
do you have another
mike for over there?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.050
Okay. Yes?

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.350
Question?

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:30.030
&gt;&gt; I was going to say how does
she come up with these creations?

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.330
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.970
Is that for the author
or the illustrator?

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.270
The author.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.460
How do you -- the illustrator?

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.210
Okay. So the question is how do
you come up with the creations?

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.070
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini:
Well, it's the story.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.650
[inaudible] Story that
give me ideas.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.120
I read the story many, many times.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.500
And then you know I've
never been to Nigeria.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.100
I never had an Nigerien friend
so I needed to do research.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:03.330
And research on the culture
and the art, the people.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.660
And then -- well I, yeah.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.440
As I said I always have
my pad with me and pen

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.350
and I do sketching all the time.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.070
So through those sketches, there
by little comes the characters.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:19.380
And Nnedi was there to help me
and, you know, always advise me

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.510
on the colors that, you know --

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.810
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor:
The feet, the feet,

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.110
I know we talked a
lot about the feet.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.410
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini:
The feet, the feet.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.840
Nnedi might change things as we go.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.250
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So just
a quick question there.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:40.640
Do the chickens in Nigeria look
different than the chickens

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.090
that we might have seen here?

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.830
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: That's
an interesting question

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:50.110
and I was always fascinated by
the chickens that I would -- Okay.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.330
So I was born and raised here
in the United States and then

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.330
from a young age my parents
would take my siblings and I back

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.950
to Nigeria to meet with family.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.850 position:56%
Both of my parents are from Nigeria.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.620
So we would meet with family
and we'd stay especially

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.050
in the villages, the
smaller more rural areas

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.010
where especially my
father had grown up.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.980
And whenever we would go
there would be chickens,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.170
just free range chickens
that are just free to do --

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.260
go wherever they want, wherever
they please, all over the village.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.730
And they would always come
back to their homes at night.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.980
So in the morning you'd see
them come out, scratch around,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.560
making their chicken
sounds, their bucking

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.010
and clucking and all of that.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.180
And then they would walk into
-- at some point in the day,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.640 position:56%
they would just walk into the forest

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.580
and you never knew
where they would go.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.300
And then they'd come
back in the evening.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.260
So I was always fascinated by this.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.850
And also one thing I noticed about
the difference between the chickens

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:47.380
that I would see here in the
United States versus over there,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.980
the chickens here would
be more of the --

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.990
they'd be white; they'd
be one color;

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:58.350
they'd be more domesticated
and fatter.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.430
And the ones that I would
encounter were not free range.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.850
So those are the chickens
that I would see here.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.800
And in Nigeria they were free
range and they were always --

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.100
they were skinnier and
they had longer legs.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.640
And they're -- and when
you would eat them,

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.750
yeah, we would eat them, yes.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.250
The meat was tougher and it
was chewier and more flavorful

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.780
which I don't -- I know that's
not really part of the story here

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.820
because we're dealing with
living chickens but yeah,

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.610
I guess that would be --
that would be the difference

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:30.070
that they seemed freer and
had a chance to just be birds

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.340
and have personalities and
life and all of that, so, yeah.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.670
That would be the difference.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.970
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: All right.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.270
So I've got one question here.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.570
Yes, sir?

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.870
&gt;&gt; How did you both come together?

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.170
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: How
did the two, the author

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.640
and the illustrator come together?

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.180
Oh, great question.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.480
How did you come together?

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.230
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Did
you want to answer that?

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.660
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini:
Actually it's the first time

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.380
that Nnedi and I see each other

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.680
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: In person.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.980
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: In person.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.280
Maybe did we send e-mails?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.580
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.880
We exchanged a lot.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.180
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: But, you
know, it's through internet.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.480
I live in UK.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.850
She lives in U.S. so it
was impossible for us

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.790
to meet each other in person.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.110
But we kept in touch
through e-mails and yeah.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.820
She was there for me
whenever I needed her help.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.120
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yes.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.420
And vice versa.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.760
And our publisher also
brought us, introduced us.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.120
And so then we worked
together from there.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.420
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.690
Who knows what the publish
-- what's a publisher?

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:26.990
What's a publisher?

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.200
Yes, sir? What's a publisher?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.990
&gt;&gt; A publisher is someone
that when an author

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.580 position:56%
and an illustrator finish the story,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:43.450
it is someone that finishes
all the stuff that they work

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:50.980
and makes it public so
everybody can see it.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.280
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.580
So you want to add -- so great.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.880
Great answer.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.270
You want to add to
that a little bit?

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.570
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.250
Well, yes, very excellent question.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.600
The publisher would take the story

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.420
that we brought together
and make it into a book.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.800
And then put it out there
for other people to get

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.100
and read and all of that.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:18.190 position:56%
So the publisher is, I guess, the
entity that brings the author's work

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.640
to -- into a packaged thing.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.480
If that makes sense.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.500
That's a very simplified
way of putting it, yes.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.800
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: All right.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.100
Great. So there's a question here.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.740
I'm going to just come this way.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.360
Yes?

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.680
&gt;&gt; How tall is the chicken?

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.200
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Literally?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.830
That's a great question.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.960
How tall do you think
the chicken is?

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.190
&gt;&gt; I think it would be --

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.490
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: 8 feet?

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.250
Who else? 4 feet tall?

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:50.130
Ten? The size of you?

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.450
All of your answers are correct.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.730
The chicken can be
whatever size it wants to be

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:02.370
because it is a powerful,
masquerade spirit and so

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.210
at some points it can be 4 feet.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.100
I think if it were -- if it
chose the size that it liked

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.160
to be the most often,
I'd say 10 feet.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.740
Yeah. It's a big chicken.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.360
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: How many of you
have seen a 10-foot chicken?

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.660
Raise your hand?

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.740
Oh, wow. Okay.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.040
Great.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.340
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Excellent.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.640
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Really awesome.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.570
Okay. So do we want to -- do you
want to say more about what you?

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.950
So hang on.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.650
Shh. Okay.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.020 position:56%
So we're going to ask for your ears.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.970
Ears on, ears on again.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.020
Because the drawing
has been finished.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.320
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: Yeah.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.440
Just to show you how
I start my work.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:54.030
I mean I start on the composition,
do lots of composition sketching.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.330
[Inaudible] sketching
on composition.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.690
And then I decide then
which one works best.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.290
I thought maybe.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.800
Do we have time to do
another sketching and then

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.880
at the same time we'll
talk with the children.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:14.550
May be they could give me a name
of an animal and then I sketch

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.380
and then you would give me marks
based on how good I've done.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.680
I might not be able to do it.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.980
It's a very risky thing on my part.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.340
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: Unicorn?

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.670
Unicorn is not that difficult.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.560
Yes? Baby chickens?

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.520
Do baby chickens.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.170
Another -- how about monkey?

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.570
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Okay.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.240
So we've got -- we've
got three choices.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.200
We've got a unicorn,
a chick, and a monkey.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.460
Raise your hand if you
want to do the unicorn.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.760
Okay.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.720
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: One, two, three,
four, five votes for that.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.020
Six, seven, sorry.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.690
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Raise your
hand if you want to do the monkey.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.170
&gt;&gt; Mehrdokht Amini: You
only get to vote once.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.470
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Monkey.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.580
One. One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.880
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Okay.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.220
Raise your hand if you
want to do the chick.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.520
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Uh-oh.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.820
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Okay.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.120
That's the chick.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.420
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: One, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.720
seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.020
All right.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.350
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So wait.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.650
I'm sorry.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.950
I wasn't listening.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.990 position:56%
So what's it -- she just drew a
chicken and now she's drawing chick.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.410
What's the difference?

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.490
Wait, wait, wait.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.790
Way in the back.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.090
Hold on. Hold on.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.090
Let me -- I really -- you guys are
going to have to help me with this.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.800
What's the difference?

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.940
&gt;&gt; A chick is smaller
and a chicken is bigger.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.240
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.510
A chicken is -- a chick is
smaller and the chicken is bigger.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:20.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.340
Is ten good?

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.000
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: We're
all over the place here.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.930
We're just -- we're
all over the place.

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.230
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Oh, okay.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.530
Wait. Shh.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.650
And were you going to
add to the difference

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.700
between a chick and a chicken.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.000
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Okay.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.520
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Yes?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.820
No?

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.120
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Big eyes.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.420
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.720
Hang on. Shhh.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.020
Question.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.320
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah, okay.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.620
Wait, no. Is this eagle or owl?

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.920
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Need bigger eyes?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.220
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Big round eyes.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.570
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Smaller head.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.000
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.310
We're doing eagle.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:03.610
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:08.450
So what's the difference
between an eagle and a chicken?

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.750
Eagle and a chicken?

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.920
Hang on one second.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.220
Yes?

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.980
&gt;&gt; A chicken is a -- I
mean an eagle is a predator

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.310
and a chicken is not a predator.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.610
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Whoa.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.030
Eagle is a predator
and a chicken is not.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.960
Okay. But then I guess my
question is what's a predator?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.260
Okay, yes.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.480
Help me out.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.780
&gt;&gt; Meat eater.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.100
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: A predator
is a meat eater.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.450
So an eagle is a meat
eater and a chicken is not.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.480
Are you going to help
me out with this?

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.390
&gt;&gt; And the chicken is a
plant eater or I mean --

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.690
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.990
Good question.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.290
Is the chicken a plant eater?

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.590
What do chickens eat?

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.060
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor:
That's a good question.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.360
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Wait a minute.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.660
Did I hear cheese?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.960
Did I hear cheese?

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.340
Okay. Chickens eat worms.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.840
Raise your hand if
you agree with that.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.390
But who's the chicken
expert in the room?

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.650
I don't know.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.950
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Close.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:10.300
That's cute.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.600
Bugs, seeds.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.310
You know -- you do know that
chickens also eat fruit.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.610
Did you know that?

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.910
They'll eat watermelon.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.910
If you put watermelon rinds,
they will eat that too.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.460
So yeah. Chickens -- chickens
will eat a lot of things.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.760
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So there's

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.060
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.650
They'll eat seeds, small
worms, bugs, fruit.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.600
Yeah. So I think they eat worms
but I've never seen one eat worms.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.170
They might.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.470
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Okay.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.150
So there's one other big
difference that I heard

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.140
for chickens versus eagles.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.870
There's one big difference that
I know that I did not yet hear.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:51.680
So what's another difference
between the chicken and the eagle?

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.980
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Oh, yeah.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.280
The obvious.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.580
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Oh, wait.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.880
I have a hand.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.180
Somebody we haven't heard from yet.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.480
Yes, ma'am?

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.670
&gt;&gt; Um, an eagle can fly
and a chicken can't.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.970
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yes.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.130
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So how many
of you guys heard that?

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.430
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yes.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.510
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Hang on one sec.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.810
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Who -- okay.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.600
So who heard her answer
that the biggest --

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.170
the biggest difference between
a chicken and an eagle is

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:21.560
that the chicken cannot fly and the
eagle is an expert flyer; correct?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.500
So everyone knows that
chickens can't fly.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.780
Does anyone know why
chickens can't fly?

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.660
I'd love to hear this answer.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.160
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: You ready?

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.660
Hang on. Hang on.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.510
Why can chickens not fly?

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.440
&gt;&gt; I think that chickens cannot fly

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.590
because they don't
have hollow bones.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.360
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: They
don't have hollow bones.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.530
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: They
do have hollow bones.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.370
And you know you're talking
about ostriches though.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.770
Because ostriches have very
heavy bones and very dense bones.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.390
And it's because they don't fly --

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.920
they're actually land animals
so they run very, very fast.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.040
So -- so no, but chickens
do have hollow bones.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.170
They just I believe evolutionary
-- like in terms of evolution,

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.210
they just didn't develop
the ability to fly.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.680
And there are other
flightless birds.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.970
Another one that I -- the first one
that pops into my head, penguins.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:16.990
The doo-doo which doesn't
exist any more.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:21.640
There's a parrot -- there's a
flightless parrot in New Zealand.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.390
And there are other
flightless birds.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.230
But some birds just don't
develop the ability to fly

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:32.190
because maybe they're -- where
their habitat does not -- is not --

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.290
makes it so that they
don't need to fly.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.840
But that might be completely wrong.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.140
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: And --

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.440
&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Yeah.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.740
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Go ahead.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.040
I just noticed something though.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.400
I noticed that there's this book
here that looks like your book

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.100

what your book says.

those of you who do speak Spanish,

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.870
I speak more French than Spanish,
but is this a direct translation

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.680
of Chicken in the Kitchen.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.370
It is? Good.

-- it's more an owl than an eagle.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.710
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: How
many of you think

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:31.140
that this is the eagle
that you requested?

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.510
How many of you think
of it as something else?

going to ask to draw the Wood Wit.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.890
It's neither.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.910
Okay. While she's drawing that,
I have a question for you all.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.490 position:56%
Okay. So if you were in Anyaugo's
position where you woke up one night

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.970
and your parents are
asleep, everyone's asleep.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.210
And you hear some noise in there.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.530
And you go and look in the kitchen

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:26.410
and you see a giant
chicken, what would you do?

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.730
Someone who has not answered.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.030

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.930
Roger.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.340
What would you do?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.640
You wake up in the
middle of the night;

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.940
the chicken's in your kitchen.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.240
What are you going to do?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.540

think his name is Robert

again so everybody can hear.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.900
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

about your mom and eating it.

&gt;&gt; Nnedi Okorafor: Even if
you see a beautiful chicken

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.260
or like a beautiful bird in your
kitchen, would you want to eat it?

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.560

and learn about -- a little bit
more about Nigerian culture.

sized chickens has been really --
