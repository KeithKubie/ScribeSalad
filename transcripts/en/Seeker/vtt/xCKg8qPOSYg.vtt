00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.890
Growing up in Michigan, it's cold.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.189
No really.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.189
It's frickin' cold.

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.220
As a kid, my mom was always worried about
frostbite, but what is it and why is Jack

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.389
Frost so nibbly?

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.400
Hello my frosty friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.400
Frostbite is a medical condition where your
skin and underlying tissue can literally start

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.290
to freeze - a bit like a human popsicle.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.770
Being exposed to extremely cold temperatures
combined with fast winds like those on Mount

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.410
Everest, can see frostbite set in within just
5 minutes.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.080
So what is frostbite really like?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.160
Well, we were fortunate enough to talk to
former Everest Expedition leader Bob Hoffman

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.360
about his experience with frostbite...

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.650
...I had a couple close calls on Everest.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.850
It's one of those mountains, no matter how
experienced you are, something can always

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.850
go wrong.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.990
Everest’s summit is located at an elevation
of almost 9 thousand meters, now at that altitude,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.380
a climber's body has a lot to contend with
which may be why it’s often referred to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.680
as “the death zone”.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.800
Average temperatures here fluctuate between
-31 (-35C) in winter to a pleasent -4 (-20C)

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.200
in summer and wind speeds during the May climbing
season are usually over 100 miles per hour

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
(160kph).

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.850
In fact, the highest wind speed on Everest
was 175 miles an hour (281 kph) recorded in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.470
February 2004.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.190
...On my last climb in 2003, I was on the
summit and, we had some lousy weather.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.810
It was extremely windy and very cold.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.940
The ice was just blowing off and you felt
like you were being sandblasted …

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.065
Our bodies are mostly made of water, so when
the temperature is low, that water can begin

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:39.065
to form ice crystals -- which permanently
changes the cell's chemistry and can physically

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.065
damage the squishy little guys.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:41.065
Eventually, blood flow can decrease, and clots
can form causing cell death and if untreated

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:42.065
gangrene.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.065
Frostbite progresses in three stages: The
first stage, called frostnip, is where the

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:44.065
surface of the skin freezes.

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.065
During the second stage called superficial
frostbite, the tissue beneath the skin starts

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.065
to freeze.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.065
And by the third stage, known as deep frostbite,
your muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.065
start to freeze.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:49.065
It’s at this point that your skin may start
to turn a dark blue or black indicating that

00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:50.065
the tissue is dead and you’re probably going
to lose some fingers and toes.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:51.065
Normally, our core temperature is a cozy 98.6
degrees fahrenheit (37C), this temperature

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.065
is actually crucial for maintaining the critical
bodily functions that keep us alive.

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:53.065
But, strong winds and frigid temperatures
can make staying warm a constant challenge.

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:54.065
Which is why, if our core temperature starts
to dip for any reason, the hypothalamus, that’s

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:58.520
the thermoregulatory center of our brain,
springs into survival mode in order to protect

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.650
our vital organs and maintain that core temperature.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.119
See, our blood carries oxygen molecules for
energy but also distributes warmth, to every

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.250
part of our body.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.620
If your core temperature is compromised your
blood vessels will constrict and divert that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.260
warmth away from the extremities and toward
vital organs.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.400
Basically, you can live without an arm, but
not without lungs or your intestines.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.580
So once the hypothalamus diverts the warmth
to protect your inner organs, your extremities

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.489
are vulnerable to frostbite.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.930
Once your body has begun protecting the vital
organs, then the worry becomes hypothermia.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.900
If the core body temperature drops below 95
(35C), people become confused, combative,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:51.030
and are at extreme risk of death.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.590
This is all pretty scary stuff.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.800
With the right gear, you can endure cold weather
for a time, without suffering from frostbite

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.040
or hypothermia, however, as Bob found out,
you can’t always rely on it.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.750
The Sherpa that I was climbing with, Pemba,
motioned to me that my ... That my oxygen

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.940
mask was icing up, ... and as I tried to clear
it I broke the oxygen tube going into the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.070
mask.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.340
Climbers also have to cope with limited oxygen
in the air, which is why they always carry

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.010
their own supply.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.310
When the body is starved of oxygen it's called
Hypoxia.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.160
Hypoxia triggers altitude sickness, leaving
climbers with a shortness of breath, elevated

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.040
heart rates and feelings of confusion.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.080
And for some reason, if a climber does find
themselves without oxygen, the severity of

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.150
frostbite can dramatically increase.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.019
When I stood up to start going down, my legs
just collapsed out from underneath me.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.280
I didn't have the strength to stand up...

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.870
All together, it's a perfect storm of awful.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.599
Bob was experiencing something called high-altitude
frostbite - a deadly combination of frostbite,

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.650
dehydration and hypoxia.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.700
Aware of these compounding dangers, Bob knew
he had to reach base camp and find medical

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.730
help as soon as possible.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.760
For the next twelve hours, I crawled, slid,
and fell down the mountain, and I knew that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.650
if I stopped, I'd die where I stopped.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.299
but managed to get down to a high camp, but
I paid the price with some pretty severe frostbite

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.819
on my feet.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.530
Luckily, he lived to tell the tale.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.329
And although you may not find yourself in
the same position anytime soon, it’s worth

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.180
remembering that you don’t have to climb
Everest to experience frostnip, frostbite

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.180
or hypothermia.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.180
Let's say it's zero degrees.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.180
You could get frostbite in 30 minutes on a
moderately windy day!

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.380
So if you’re planning a cold-climate adventure,
make sure you wrap up warm!

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.749
Climbing Mount Everest is not for the faint
of heart and seldom few have managed it without

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.360
the help of the knowledgeable Sherpa guides
on Everest.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.619
Don’t forget to tune into the premiere of
Sherpa, airing Saturday April 23rd at 9/8

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:42.460
central as part of elevation weekend on Discovery.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.759
The film is an in-depth look at how Sherpa
community came together to reclaim Everest

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:45.801
following a deadly avalanche in April, 2014.
