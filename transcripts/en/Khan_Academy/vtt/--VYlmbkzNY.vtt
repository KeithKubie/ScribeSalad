00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.640
- [Instructor] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.500
is to create a simple
spreadsheet to help us understand

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.810
why if R greater than G,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.210
why that might lead to more
and more of national income

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.400
going to the owners of
capital as opposed to labor.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400
So let's just say R is 3%,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.060
we can change that assumption later.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.210
So that's the return on
capital that we're assuming.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.470
We're assuming it's just going to be fixed

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.480
at that constant rate

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.190
and let's say that economic growth is 2%.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.190
So we're assuming it's an area
where R is greater than G.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.760
Now in this column let me write the years.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.840
There's Year One, Year
Two, and then we would go.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.710
Let's see, maybe we can go up to Year,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.640
let's go to Year 15 just for good measure.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.510
Now we could think about
what our national capital is

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.670
or I could say Total Capital.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.410
So the capital in our economy.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.450
Now we'd also want to think
about the national income.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.360
So we could view this as
the output of the economy.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.020
National income.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.530
And now we could think about
the split of the income

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.290
between capital and labor.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.290
So income to capital and income to labor.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.260
And now let's just think
about percentage of total.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.923
So capital as percent of total.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.350
So let's come up with some
assumptions right over here.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.880
So let's say that our aggregate capital

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.170
and I'm just gonna throw
out a random number here.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.720
Let's say it's 4,000

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.160
and if we're talking
about millions of dollars,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.780
then this would be four trillion dollars,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.180
but I'm being currency
agnostic right over here.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.660
So let's just say it's 4,000.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.390
It could be, this could,
if it was in millions

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.350
this would be four trillion,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.200
but let's just say 4,000 for now.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.980
And let's say our national income is 1,000

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.069
and we've seen charts already
that, at least for the U.S.,

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.810
capital, the national
capital as a percentage of

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.330
national income has
been about 400 or 500%.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.100
It's kind of oscillated in that range.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.160
So it's been about four or
five times national income.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.080
So this is kind of a
not unreasonable ratio.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.330
And now what's the income
to the owners of capital?

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.420
Well we're saying the
return on capital is 3%.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.390
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.400
this 3%, I'm gonna press F4
to put those dollar signs

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.610
and we'll see why that's valuable.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.190
It'll make sure that we
stay referenced to that cell

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.270
as we drag this down later on.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.270
It's going to be that times,
times the amount of capital

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.420
that we have in the economy.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.760
So it's going to be 120

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.620
and notice, I had the
dollar signs on the B1

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.660
because I always wanna refer to this,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.640
but I didn't put the
dollar signs on the B5

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.330
because as I drag this down
I always want this cell,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.130
say that when I drag it down here,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.810
I want it to refer to that same 3%.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.040
So that's why I kind of anchored it there

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.220
with the dollar signs,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.930
but I want it to be times
the capital in that row.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.360
So we'll see how that happens in a second.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.060
Now what's the income to labor?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.187
Well it's gonna be what's left over.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:02.880
National income minus
the income to capital

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.820
and then capital as a percentage of total?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.524
The income to capital is a
percentage of total income,

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:10.210
well that's just going to be equal to,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.990
I can select income to capital, D5,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.210
divided by, divided by national income

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.090
and so it's 12%.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.294
And we're also going to
assume that every year

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:25.580
that income to capital all
gets reinvested as capital.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.880
So it doesn't get consumed in some way.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.740
So, then Year Two the capital
that we start off with

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.720
is going to be the capital from last year

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.060
plus the new income to capital.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.610
That capital, that income
to capital's going to get

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.200
reinvested as capital

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.400
is just going to be my assumption there.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.470
And national income,
well we know its growth.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.490
It's going to be the previous
year's national income

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.300
plus, I guess we could say times,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.300
times one plus this number,
plus our economic growth.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.360
So there and I'll press F4

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.568
because I keep, I wanna
stay referencing that.

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:05.160
And so notice, we grew by 2%

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.610
and then these two over here.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.900
Actually all three of these over here

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.010
we can just drag down.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.115
And now hopefully you see
the value of what I did

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:16.550
when I put the dollar signs here

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.614
because now when I dragged it down,

00:04:18.614 --> 00:04:21.860
this is still referring to B1

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.910
'cause it had the dollar signs there.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.595
So it's taking the 3% times B6.

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:27.230
So B6 is this.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.306
So it's looking at the right,

00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:29.990
at the B column,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.040
but in its row now.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.750
That's what's one of
the really useful things

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.710
about spreadsheets

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.420
and actually this
column, let me make this.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.230
Let me make this a percentage

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.170
just so it becomes a little bit cleaner.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.710
Okay, there you go.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.632
And then we can just keep on going.

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:47.470
So let's just keep on going down

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.960
and what do we get?

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.793
And actually let me get rid of

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:52.170
some of the decimal places here.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.720
It's making a little bit messy.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.070
So, let me.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.150
So, there you go.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.500
That actually makes it
a little bit cleaner.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.713
And so what do we have going on over here?

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:06.510
Well we see that when R
is a fixed rate of return

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.620
on capital that is greater than growth,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.940
we see that capital,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.200
the income going to
capital as a percentage

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.610
of the total national
income is increasing.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.590
Now, this could be used
as a proxy for inequality

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.020
because as we've said before

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.640
capital does tend to
be concentrated amongst

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.242
the upper percentile, decile, quartile,

00:05:27.242 --> 00:05:29.660
however you want to define it,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.750
but once again this is just a proxy.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.110
And the other thing you
have to keep in mind is

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.117
inequality is a natural by-product of

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:39.352
a capitalistic market economy.

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:42.450
And even though more
and more of the income

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.840
is going to the owners of capital,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.250
the labor, the income going to labor,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.500
is also increasing.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.480
Now that by itself doesn't necessarily say

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.313
it's a good thing.

00:05:51.313 --> 00:05:53.710
For example, if the
population were increasing

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.561
faster than this

00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:58.190
then the income to labor
divided by the population,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.450
which would be kind of the
per capita income to labor.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.560
A kind of a proxy for how
much the individual person

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.618
working is making,

00:06:04.618 --> 00:06:06.987
then if that, even if this is going up

00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:08.920
but the population is
growing faster than that

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.080
that might not be a good thing

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.420
because that means per
capita income might not be

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.253
where it needs to be.

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:16.250
But if we assume the population is stable

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.763
or it's not growing as fast as this,

00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:20.520
even though we see inequality

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.870
or at least this measure
of inequality going up,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.840
more and more of the
income is going to capital.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.910
These people still,
still might be better off

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.771
in this reality.

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.570
But to kind of test the
sensitivity of this model

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.600
that we've created,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.980
we can actually try different things.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.130
So if the return on
capital is much larger,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.497
say it's 5%, we see that the disparity,

00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:44.140
the disparity becomes much
much more significant.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.530
And let's say if it was 10%,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.630
now you see a situation that
could get not so pleasant.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.330
'Cause in this situation,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.010
and this is a fairly extreme situation

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.440
we have right over here,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.500
now all of a sudden the income to labor

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.290
and not even on per capita terms,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.900
is actually decreasing.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.490
So it really does matter a lot
where these two numbers are,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.410
but of course, if economic
growth was also pretty robust

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.243
now all of a sudden,

00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:07.280
well this is still decreasing,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.480
but if economic growth was 9%,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.020
now all of a sudden this could
be a pretty good scenario

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.889
for everyone involved.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.047
You do have,

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:15.890
at least this is kind of a proxy for

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.310
increased income to capital

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.819
which could be a proxy for inequality,

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.290
but maybe the economy
is growing fast enough

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.200
that everyone is benefiting.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.630
So I encourage you to either
build a model like this

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.590
or I'll give you the link
to this model as well

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.670
and play with these numbers.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.800
And just try to get a
better understanding for

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.267
if we assumed R and G were constant

00:07:35.267 --> 00:07:37.300
and we made some assumptions about

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.160
starting capital and national income,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.770
how that ends up breaking down as we go

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.043
further and further into the future.
