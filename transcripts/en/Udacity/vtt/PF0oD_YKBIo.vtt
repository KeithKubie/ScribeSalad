00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.310
So remember we got this graph
from plotting ordered pairs.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.350
And plotting is just the word we use
when we start putting points down.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.440
And we got these ordered
pairs from our t-chart.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.500
And we knew which values to put
in the t-chart from our equation.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.970
So we have equations, t-charts,
ordered pairs, graphs.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.840
It seems like there's
a lot going on here.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.620
But it's really all the same thing.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.310
We can go straight from equation to
graph, or ordered pair to graph.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm just showing you a few
different ways to think about this.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.229
And I want to explore this
t-chart a little more.
