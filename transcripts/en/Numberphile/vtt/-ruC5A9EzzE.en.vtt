00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.220
I think I have a solution

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.660
to a... very much an unkown problem,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.800
it's a, this is a problem no one was really looking for a solution for,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.220
but I think I found one.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.460
So there's a thing called the 10958 problem.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.360
To demonstrate what the problem is, I'm gonna start with a little number trick

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.160
a little something, a little bit of number showmanship.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.280
Like all good number tricks, it starts with you picking a number.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.080
Can you give me any three-digit number? What would you like? Pick a three-digit number.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.640
[Brady: "814."]

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.480
814, interesting, okay.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.280
And can you give me a single digit? What single digit would you like?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
It can be one of these. It can be a whole new one. Whatever you want.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.960
[Brady: "2."]

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
2, okay, all right. Here's what we're gonna do.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320
So, I can now tell you that 814 equals

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.120
22 times (2 plus 2 plus 2) to the power of 2 plus 22.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.660
I mean, if you don't believe me, we can double-check that.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840
2 plus 2 plus 2 is 6. I'm prepared to accept that as given.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.660
And 6 squared is 36.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.880
So, this, we now want 22 times 36 plus 22...

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.520
22 times 36 equals 792,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.900
add 22 equals 814. There you go!

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.200
You gave me a three-digit number, and I could write it out as an expression using only the digit you gave me.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780
Do you think that is exciting enough to do a second time?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.820
[Brady: "Yes."]

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.560
All right! What would you like this time?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.680
[Brady: "998."]

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
998! You've gone for a large, but not predictably large, number!

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.780
And what one digit would you like to be used?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.960
So we had 2 last time.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.860
[Brady: "1."]

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.240
1, oh my goodness! You are thatâ€“ now, obviously,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.100
I could cheat, and just write, equals, 1+1+1+1...

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
right, and I could have done that over here,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.440
because you happened to pick an even number, and 2, I could have written 2+2...

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.040
The goal is I'm trying to do it in as few digits written out as possible.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.520
So I can actually do 998 as 11 minus 1, will give us 10

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.680
to the power of 1 plus 1 plus 1 is just, uh,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.000
oh, I've done two pluses there, that is a mega-plus, oh my goodness, that's pretty plus.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.920
And so, that's ten cubed, is a thousand, minus 1 minus 1, and there we are!

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920
We've landed on 998.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
I could, I could go on all day.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.580
In fact I would,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820
but people would cease watching the video quite quickly.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.620
And I can confidently tell you that ANY three-digit number you give me I will be able to write it out using any digit you give me

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.880
because down here I have a paper

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.900
with all of them in it.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.940
So this is Single Digit Representations of Natural Numbers

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.460
A guy called Taneja.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.560
I'm gonna pronounce that wrong. He is from Brazil,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.480
so I've definitely pronounced that wrong.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.320
And it's just tables and tables of three-digit numbers and how you write them out.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.680
So this is all three-digit numbers done using the digit 4.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.960
And then over here, using 6 or 5, anything you want to look up.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.280
And so the way I was able to do this is I was cheating.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.600
And if you want to cheat, it's really quite straightforward.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.440
You put aside a month or two just to memorize this,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.580
and then you can cheat with this inside your brain!

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.580
That's the great thing about, you know, the human brain,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.420
you can cheat by memorizing your cheat notes, and then you can look at them without anyone being able to tell.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.500
It's, you know, it's a real loophole in life,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.380
you can cheat by memorizing things.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.340
[Brady: "Also known as learning."]

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.360
Also known... learning, yeah, oh you learn it, and then you do that, right.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.880
[Brady: "And we know that they're all the shortest versions? I mean, how, has he used some sort of rigorous proof that they're the shortest versions?"]

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400
That is a really good question.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.620
I don't know.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080
He claims these are the shortest.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640
I can't remember if he claims DEFINITELY the shortest

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.180
or the shortest he's found.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
He just says they're minimal possible digits.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.480
I don't know how he has confirmed that.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.280
So if you trust this guy,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.200
then these are the smallest, but, they may, I mean...

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.560
I trust him.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.140
[Smooth vibraphone music]

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.680
Did he stop there?

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.160
Oh, no.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320
No, no, no, he went one step further.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.140
So, let's carry on to, in a different color sharpie,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.660
let's do any number below 11111.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.460
[Brady: "7415."]

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.220
7415, okay. So I can tell you that this can be written as,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.820
Here's the other one, this one's a bit longer,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.480
so, this one's like 160-something pages, and I'm just gonna look it up.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.420
So let's find,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.480
[Brady: "Did you memorize that one?"]

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480
I haven't had time to memorize this one, you know,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.320
you know, if I had another holiday on the beach, I could sit there and memorize this one, too.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
Ooh, you picked a good one!

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900
This one has to use subtraction.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.140
Not all of them do.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.740
[Brady: "You didn't ask me my digit, my single digit."]

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.500
You don't get to choose this time, because I'm gonna use all the digits.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.040
So you said 7415. 7415 is either

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.980
negative 1 plus 2 times 3456

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.420
plus 7 times 8 times 9

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.080
or

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.040
it equals

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.800
in brackets 9 plus in brackets 8 times 7 plus 6

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.120
times 5 in brackets times 43, close up some brackets,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.560
multiply it by 2 add 1.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.760
Okay, so there is your number written as all the digits in ascending order,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.760
so that's 1 to 9 in order,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.080
or all the digits in descending order, that's 9 counting all the way back down to 1,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.820
only using multiplication, addition, division, subtraction,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.820
and you can have powers.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.340
So, only using the simple operations. This guy has also gone through and found

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.760
every number up to 11111, ascending and descending, using only those operations.

This guy is a legend. I love this guy.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.260
And he just does it. He just puts them online. They just, you can just find his papers.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.820
Yeah, I'd ration them out. You know, I would have a freemium model

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.520
where you get ascending for free, but you pay for descending, come on!

This is premium content.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.160
Right. Or, you don't even get the middle digits.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.480
So, now, as you may have realized from the name of this video,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.380
there is a problem.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.440
And it is the 10,958 problem.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.240
If you look up, let's look up 10,958,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.080
So it should be right at the end.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.780
So there it is there. There's 10,958 in descending order.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.700
And if we look up the ascending order, it's

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.100
still not available.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.780
[Brady: [gasp]]

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.540
It is the only gap in all the numbers up to 11111.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.400
It's the first one you come across, as you go up, everything from 1, all the way to here, it's all there,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.260
And then you end up with: 'still not available.'

[Brady: "So, it's like the Achilles' heel."]

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.840
It's the Achilles' heel. It's the missing piece, right?

It's, you know, it's that little bit, you're like, I've done it all,

except for that little bit.

Similar to before, I don't know how comprehensive he has been in assembling this list.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.280
So he thinks it can't be done. But he, he's not, doesn't seem to have completely ruled out that someone else won't do it.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.520
Well,

at least give it a go, right?

That's the spirit. That's my whole philosophy.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.440
It may be an impossible task, but you give it a go, and it's just as much fun, anyway.
