00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:03.054
- [Narrator] We hold these
truths to be self-evident,

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:05.590
that all men are created equal,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.741
that they are endowed by their creator

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.348
with certain unalienable rights,

00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:13.099
that among these are life, liberty,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.734
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:20.006
This is an excerpt of the US
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.938
and the United States goes
on with its constitution,

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:27.105
which gets ratified in 1789,
to articulate a Bill of Rights,

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.254
and many will point to The Enlightenment

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.433
as the inspiration for these ideas.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.787
Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:39.954
cited figures like Locke as
some of mankind's best thinkers,

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:43.698
so at this early date,
nations were at least writing

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:47.038
these types of words
into their Declarations

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:49.905
of Independence, into their constitutions.

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:53.025
But despite that, the 20th century

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:57.452
is one of the bloodiest
centuries in human history.

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:01.619
You have World War I, where
roughly 17 million people die.

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:08.136
In World War II, 50 to
80 million people die,

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.301
some directly because of the conflict,

00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:13.699
but many because of lack of
access to food and famine.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.449
The Chinese are particularly hit.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.489
Over 15 million died during
the Japanese occupation

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:21.322
of China.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.531
This idea of genocide comes about,

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.558
first with the Armenian genocide

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:31.026
in the declining Ottoman Empire
where over a million people

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:33.156
are believed to have been killed,

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:35.982
and then in World War II,
you have the holocaust,

00:01:35.982 --> 00:01:38.798
where six to 11 million
people were killed,

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.120
roughly two thirds of
the Jewish population

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.609
in Europe and many others.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.938
The Russian empire and
eventually the Soviet Union

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.528
gets especially hit hard in the first half

00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:50.195
of the 20th century.

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.405
In World War I alone, three
million Russians died.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:58.036
Shortly after the war, you have
a significant Russian famine

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.439
that killed five million people.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.652
Then in the early thirties,
you have the Soviet famine,

00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:06.596
five to seven million people.

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:07.843
This is believed to have occurred

00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:09.769
because of Stalin's attempts

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.245
to make agriculture collectivized.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:15.614
In the late thirties,
you have Stalin's purge,

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.216
where he goes after political opponents,

00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:20.054
and it's believed that he killed

00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:22.449
as many as three million people.

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.553
These things were so
shocking to the planet

00:02:24.553 --> 00:02:28.299
that they made attempts to
prevent them in the future.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.799
In 1920, out of the trauma of World War I,

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:35.610
the League of Nations was founded.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.854
It was an attempt to prevent
things like this in the future,

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.689
for nations to talk to each other

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.108
and to coordinate so they don't go to war,

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:45.951
especially at the scale
seen in World War I.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:48.360
But clearly, that was unsuccessful,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.926
and we have World War II
where even more people die,

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:54.052
after which the slightly stronger

00:02:54.052 --> 00:02:56.374
United Nations gets founded,

00:02:56.374 --> 00:02:59.095
once again with the
charter of fostering dialog

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.625
between nations so that we can prevent

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.708
these types of trauma for the planet.

00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:08.465
Early on in the newly founded UN agenda

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.888
was this idea of revisiting the ideas

00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:15.402
of The Enlightenment,
this idea of human rights,

00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:19.319
and trying to codify them
in international law.

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:24.759
In 1948, you have the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.408
that's drafted by the United Nations,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.703
and it was an attempt to
make a universal declaration

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:35.020
of these rights that
all humans on the planet

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.386
have access to.

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:38.135
I'm going to give excerpts of it,

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.302
and keep a lookout for things
that feel awfully close

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:44.322
to ideas in the United States
Declaration of Independence,

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:48.489
the US constitution, or
ideas from The Enlightenment.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.103
This is part of the preamble.

00:03:51.103 --> 00:03:53.540
Whereas recognition of
the inherent dignity

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.183
and of the equal and unalienable rights

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:59.158
of all members of the human
family is the foundation

00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:02.590
of freedom, justice,
and peace in the world.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.336
Whereas disregard and
contempt for human rights

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:07.331
have resulted in barbarous acts

00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.366
which have outrage the
conscience of mankind.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:12.288
Remember World War II just happened.

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:14.945
And the advent of a world
in which human beings

00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:17.797
shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief

00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:21.012
and freedom from fear and
want has been proclaimed

00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:24.107
as the highest aspiration
of the common people.

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:27.775
Now, therefore, the
general assembly proclaims

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:31.275
this universal declaration of human rights

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.653
as a common standard of achievement

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:37.320
for all peoples and all nations.

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:39.821
You might be thinking,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.047
"Why did they even have to write this?"

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.126
Well, think about it.

00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:44.587
Things like the constitutions
of various countries,

00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:45.726
especially the United States,

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:48.617
these only applied to those countries,

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.669
but now there was an
attempt to write down,

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.419
to codify something that would apply

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.506
to all human beings, to the entire planet,

00:04:56.506 --> 00:05:01.323
and here's just some of the 30
articles to that declaration,

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:04.811
to that Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.509
All human beings are born free

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.654
and equal in dignity and rights.

00:05:08.654 --> 00:05:12.266
They are endowed with
reason and conscience

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:14.414
and should act towards one another

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:17.050
in the spirit of brotherhood.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.161
This really feels similar to
some of the ideas of Locke

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.968
in The Enlightenment that we
talk about in other videos.

00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:26.876
Everyone is entitled to all the rights

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:29.245
and freedoms set forth
in this declaration,

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.475
without distinction of
any kind, such as race,

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:35.803
color, sex, language, religion, political,

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:39.429
or other opinion,
national or social origin,

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:42.741
property, birth, or other status.

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:43.761
So this is interesting,

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:46.511
because even though I start this video

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.916
with the United States
Declaration of Independence

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.703
and a discussion of the constitution,

00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:52.266
slavery in the United States

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:54.182
would last for another 80 plus years

00:05:54.182 --> 00:05:56.906
after the Declaration of
Independence was written.

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:58.640
Women didn't even have the right to vote

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.958
until the early 20th century,

00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.138
so beyond this being a
universal declaration

00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:08.330
for the entire planet, the
attempt is also to make it clear

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.263
that it needs to apply to everyone.

00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:13.777
Everyone has the right to life,

00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:17.076
liberty, and security of person.

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:21.240
No one shall be held in
slavery or servitude.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.741
No one shall be subjected to torture

00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:27.372
or to cruel, inhuman, or
degrading treatment or punishment.

00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:30.636
Everyone charged with a
penal offense has the right

00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:34.303
to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.569
Once again, ideas that seemed
very similar to what we see

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.486
in constitutions like
that of the United States.

00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:44.552
Everyone has the right to freedom

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:47.780
of thought, conscience, and religion.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.728
Everyone has the right to freedom
of opinion and expression.

00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:56.091
Very similar to the First
Amendment in the US constitution.

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.963
Everyone has the right to freedom

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:01.108
of peaceful assembly and association.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:04.606
No one may be compelled to
belong to an association.

00:07:04.606 --> 00:07:07.253
And article 21 is especially interesting.

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.115
Everyone has the right to take part

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:11.905
in the government of his country directly

00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:15.253
or through freely chosen representatives.

00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:16.741
Everyone has the right of equal access

00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:19.008
to public service in his country.

00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:21.599
The will of the people shall be the basis

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.540
of the authority of government.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.831
So this is a big statement.

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:27.909
It's taking a stand, saying
that everyone on the planet

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.334
should be able to live in a democracy

00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:32.917
and participate in a democracy.

00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:39.144
The commission that drafted
this declaration was chaired

00:07:39.144 --> 00:07:43.323
by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife
of Franklin Roosevelt.

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:46.948
This is a map of who
voted for this declaration

00:07:46.948 --> 00:07:49.441
and these are the countries in green.

00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:51.897
Who abstained, they
just decided not to vote

00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:54.944
for the declaration, those
are the countries in orange,

00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:57.789
and then you have a few
that voted against it.

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:00.606
In gray are the countries
that weren't part

00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:03.338
of the United Nations at the time.

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:05.439
An interesting question
looking at this map

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.853
is to think about why certain
countries were willing

00:08:08.853 --> 00:08:10.901
to vote for it and why other countries

00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:14.123
decided to abstain at the time.

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:16.128
These articles are talking about people

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.848
having the right to
participate in a democracy,

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:22.340
the right to be equal,
that all people are equal,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.891
and in many of these countries,

00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:26.745
people did not have equal rights.

00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:29.844
You had severe discrimination
in places like South Africa.

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:33.294
In many of these countries,
you did not have a democracy,

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:36.074
but there's a broader question here.

00:08:36.074 --> 00:08:39.851
It's nice to be able to write
these fairly idealistic ideas,

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:43.864
but to what degree does it have an effect,

00:08:43.864 --> 00:08:47.781
and to what degree can
it actually be enforced?

00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:50.613
You might cite things like the American

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:54.772
Civil Rights Movement, which
did echo some of these ideas

00:08:54.772 --> 00:08:59.071
that were made in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.464
Maybe they helped the
civil rights movement,

00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:03.265
or maybe the civil rights
movement would've happened

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:06.133
regardless of what the UN did.

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:09.203
But at the same time, you
have ideas like apartheid.

00:09:09.203 --> 00:09:11.677
You have racism and
discrimination in South Africa

00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:13.793
from the beginning of colonial rule,

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:15.955
but it was actually at the exact same time

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.498
as this declaration that the
official policy of apartheid,

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:22.328
of government-sanctioned discrimination,

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.888
of government-sanctioned segregation,

00:09:24.888 --> 00:09:27.747
preventing racial
mingling came into effect

00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:30.580
and lasted all the way until 1991.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:33.710
And so one could make an argument,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.107
maybe things would've been worse

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.504
without the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:40.170
or maybe the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.473
really wasn't in a situation

00:09:41.473 --> 00:09:44.047
to actually effect things like this.

00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:45.861
In many of the countries around the world,

00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.221
not just the orange ones but often

00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:49.401
in many of the green ones as well,

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.395
you continued to see
things that go against

00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:55.562
those ideas of universal human rights.

00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:58.024
Even if the UN passes something

00:09:58.024 --> 00:09:59.874
and if one country doesn't
want to abide by it,

00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:03.320
what action can the other countries take?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.384
Economic action, maybe
sanctions, maybe military action,

00:10:06.384 --> 00:10:09.241
and to what degree are people
actually willing to do that?
