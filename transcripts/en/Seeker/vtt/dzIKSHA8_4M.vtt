00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.660
A new study finds that despite popular belief,
double mastectomies are NOT the most effective

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.470
option for women with breast cancer

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:17.520
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and you may
recall in 2013, Angelina Jolie made headlines

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.200
for publicizing her decision to get a preventative
double mastectomy.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.870
Her reasoning, she said, in addition to having
a family history of breast cancer, was that

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.080
she was born with the BRCA1 gene mutation,
which puts her at a very high risk for developing

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.830
breast and ovarian cancer.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.350
A lot of people applauded her decision to
have that surgery, and it certainly raised

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.609
awareness about the fight for breast cancer.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.440
But was it really the right decision?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.319
And can preventative surgery, actually prevent
breast cancer?

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.699
According to a new study, the answer - is
no.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.489
The Journal of the American Medical Association
published an article earlier this week - one

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.899
of the largest studies ever conducted on this
topic - stating that women with breast cancer

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.420
who opt for double mastectomy, don’t increase
their chances of survival any more than women

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.160
who undergo a single lumpectomy, followed
by radiation.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.930
Now for those of you who aren’t familiar,
a double mastectomy is when they literally

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.369
remove all of the breast tissue from both
breasts, including the nipple and everything,

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.210
to prevent the spread of cancerous tissue.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.460
It is an extremely painful surgery, not to
mention the emotional distress of losing such

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.200
a fundamental part of your womanhood.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.750
It’s devastating in pretty much every sense
of the word.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.609
So typically, it’s only performed in extreme
cases.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.799
But still, a lot of women do opt for it - under
the assumption that it could prevent future

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.799
cancer.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.930
A lumpectomy, on the other hand, is usually
performed on women who have a single localized

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.170
tumor, less than 4cm in diameter.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.090
The basic formula is doctors extract the tumor,
and then the patient undergoes radiation therapy

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.110
for anywhere from 1-2 months.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.500
Surgically, it is far less invasive than a
double mastectomy - but there is still a lot

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.500
of scarring.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.159
Thankfully, breast reconstruction is available,
whichever route you choose.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.710
And the increased availability of those options,
could explain why the rate of double mastectomies

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.680
has risen so sharply over the past 15 years.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.030
In 1998, only 2% of women with breast cancer
opted for complete removal of both breasts.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.940
But by 2011, that number rose to 12.3%.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.690
So for this study, researchers followed 189,000
women in California with breast cancer, for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.570
a period of 10 years, to see who actually
fared better from which surgical option.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.890
55% of those women had lumpectomies followed
by radiation, 40% had only one breast removed,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.840
and the remaining 5% had both breasts removed.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.800
After a 10 year follow-up, researchers noted
that 16.8% of women who opted for a lumpectomy

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.500
had died, compared to 18.8% of women who had
both breasts removed.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770
Statistically, that’s not a significant
difference.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.880
But what’s interesting, is that women who
only had one of their breasts removed, actually

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.290
had the highest mortality rate, of 20.1%.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.130
The author of the study, Dr. Allison Kurian,
says this doesn’t mean we should discount

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.860
double mastectomy surgery, since it is still
necessary for certain cases.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.540
But she does warn against women unnecessarily
losing both of their breasts.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.740
Naturally, I would assume anyone undergoing
that kind of surgery, has carefully weighed

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.500
all of the risks and benefits - but it’s
still interesting to see that something which

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
seems like it would be far more effective,
really isn’t any better than the current

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760
standard therapy.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.330
While we’re on the topic of devastating
diseases, I wanna let you guys know that I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.600
host another show here on Discovery, called
TestTube - which is kinda like Dnews, but

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600
for current events.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.980
Last week, we filmed an episode on why the
world may never fully eradicate infectious

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
diseases.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.650
So if you’re curious about that, and you’d
like to know more - just click the link on

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.830

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.170
In the meantime, if you have any questions,
comments, anything you wanna say about THIS

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.760
