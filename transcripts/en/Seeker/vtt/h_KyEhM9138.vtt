00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.740
Thousands of kilometers from Earth, an explosion
put Apollo 13 on a path to disaster.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.810
For three days, the fate of the mission hung
in the balance as NASA figured out how to

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.100
get the astronauts home alive.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.240
On April 11, 1970 - NASA launched its third
mission to the lunar surface.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.950
The crew of Apollo 13 consisted of veteran
Jim Lovell and first time space flyers

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.460
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.380
The spacecraft and configuration for this
mission were nearly identical

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.900
to the one used during Apollo 12.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.240
The Command-Service Module was given the call sign Odyssey while the Lunar Module was dubbed, Aquarius.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.020
While coasting to the moon, the crew docked
Odyssey and Aquarius, sealing the tunnel that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.610
connected the two spacecraft.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.329
About 56 hours in, mission control instructed
Swigert to perform a procedure called a "cryo-stir”

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.680
which helps monitor oxygen levels.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.520
A flip of a switch ended with an explosion.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.020
Back on Earth, mission control was trying
to figure out the severity of the situation,

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.420
but it was becoming increasingly complicated.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.369
What they didn’t know was that Apollo 13
launched with the makings of a bomb aboard.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.160
The source of the explosion was one of the
two cryogenic oxygen tanks

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.039
located in the Service Module.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.480
A preflight test damaged insulation on the
wiring inside the tank,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
but it went unnoticed.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.520
So when Swigert started the cryo stir, one of
the damaged wires caused a spark... and boom.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.350
The CSM was quickly losing its power and life
sustaining resources.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.200
The damaged oxygen tank caused two out of
three fuel cells to shutdown.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.660
That meant that the spacecraft was flying
without its main source of electricity and water.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.360
Once mission control figured this out, the
moon was no longer an option.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.660
Now, the goal was to salvage enough resources
to just get the Command Module back to Earth.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.040
Flight controller, Sy Liebergot, had the unpopular
idea to isolate the surge tank - the small

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.060
reserve of oxygen that the crew would need
for re-entry.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.400
But doing so would require the crew to ultimately
power down every system in the Command-Service

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.239
Module- making the spacecraft inhospitable.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.010
The Lunar Module would then have to be used
as a lifeboat.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.940
This was not a perfect solution.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.739
The lunar module was only designed to support
two astronauts for a total of 45 hours as

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.400
they traveled from the CSM to the moon and
back.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
It definitely wasn’t equipped to support
three astronauts for the 90 plus hours

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.220
needed to get home.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.220
But because the CSM was failing, this was
the crew’s only option

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.920
if they were going to survive.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.959
First, they had to power up the Lunar
Module.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.310
This was supposed to be done using electricity
from the CSM which was now on its deathbed.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.010
So hundreds of thousands of kilometers away,
the lunar module controllers had to figure

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.310
out how to hotwire the spacecraft using diagrams.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.800
The Lunar Module’s main source of power
came from these big batteries in the descent stage.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060
Since they relied on electricity from a switch
in the Command Module, the controllers instructed

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.680
the crew to reroute electricity from the LEM’s smaller ascent batteries to the power distribution system

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.400
This hack energized the relays connected to
the descent batteries and powered up the spacecraft.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.829
The crew was safer, now that they were in
the Lunar Module.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.780
But NASA still had to figure out how they
could get them home.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.000
The explosion happened when Apollo 13 was
about 300,000 kilometers from Earth.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.349
It was unknown if the Service Modules propulsion
system was damaged, so mission control decided

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.680
the best abort trajectory would utilize the
moon’s gravity

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980
to guide the spacecraft back to Earth.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.860
Apollo 13 was not on what was known as a “free-return”
trajectory.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.110
This essentially meant that the spacecraft
would miss Earth by thousands of kilometers.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.010
So to get back on course, the spacecraft needed
a big push, and it would have to come from

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.910
a relatively small engine in the Lunar Module’s
descent stage.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.700
Ordinarily, mission control used software
to calculate the length and duration of engine

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.760
burns needed to produce a given trajectory.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.420
But no one had ever planned for the LEM’s
descent engine to fire while still connected

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.260
to the CSM, so engineers had to make new calculations
on the spot.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.340
And this was all primarily done without a
navigation system.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.730
Due to the loss of power, the astronauts had
to instead confirm their location using the sun, stars

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.560
and the Earth’s terminator - the line which
delineates between night and day.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.220
Adding to this, the crew was facing a fatal
buildup of carbon dioxide.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.920
A problem that mission control
solved… with Duct Tape.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.720
As the spacecraft approached re-entry, the
astronauts weren’t in great shape.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.680
They hadn’t slept in days, they were running
out of water and it was about 3 degrees Celsius

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.280
in the lunar module.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.760
Despite their exhaustion, it was time to power-up
the Command Module - a procedure the crew

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.640
would end up doing completely blind.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.520
Since the damaged Service Module was no longer
needed to protect the Command Module’s heat

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.990
shield, the crew released it into space

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.180
and they got a first look at the damage.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.300
[Astronaut] There’s one whole side of that
thing missing.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.620
And then, it was time to let go of their life
saving Lunar Module.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.390
[Astronaut] Farewell Aquarius, and we thank
you.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.680
The crew was so close to home, but there was
still a lot that could go wrong.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.840
If the command module’s heat shield was
cracked during the explosion,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.300
the astronauts would burn up.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.780
And if the parachutes froze, they would slam
into the ocean.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.760
But they just had to trust that mission control
would get another miracle.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.460
The world waited as the spacecraft entered
Earth’s atmosphere - holding a collective

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.440
breath during the next three minutes of radio
silence.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.720
[Mission Control] Odyssey, Houston standing by, over.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.000
[Mission Control] Odyssey, Houston we show you on the mains. It really looks great.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.280
After about six sleepless days and a lot of weight lost,
the crew safely made it back to solid ground.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.180
Mission control had pulled off the impossible…again.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.780
And while there was a lot to celebrate, NASA now
had to figure out how a ticking time bomb

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.780
made it onto the Apollo 13 spacecraft in the first place,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.160
and ensure that this mistake would never happen again.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.200
NASA credits much of its successful failure
to mission control.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.580
