ADAM GLAZIER: Hi.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.110
I'm Adam Glazier, a UX designer
on the Google Cast team.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.260
If you're new to
Cast, Cast is a way

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.580
for people to get content
from your app to their TV.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.480
In this video, I'll show you
why Cast works the way it does,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840
so that you can be informed
while designing your app.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.060
Now, for the sake of
simplicity, the examples

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.270
I'll share focus on Casting
and controlling video.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.690
However, it's worth
noting that you can also

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.170
Cast other types of media, such
as music, photos and games.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.800
When designing for Cast, there's
three main things to consider.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.940
First, your app is the remote.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.140
So just like a TV
remote, your app

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.990
should make it easy for anyone
to control a Cast at any time.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.630
People need instant
control, no matter

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.170
what state their device is in.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.580
Second, it's a
shared experience.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.240
When your app's casting, expect
that others are in the room.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.720
Some will be watching,
some will contribute,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.320
and some will need
to take control.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.060
The third is that
it's cross-platform.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.000
The living room has
many devices in it,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.510
and the more devices that
can control your Cast,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.410
the more seamless it will feel.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.370
Because casting is a
new action, its usage

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.190
depends on people being
reminded that it's available.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.170
An easy way to do this
is to show a one time

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.100
Cast introduction screen.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.950
This intro helps
users new to Casting,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.580
and it also helps experienced
users know that your app is now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.590
Cast enabled.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.460
Additionally,
placing the Cast icon

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.080
at the top right of
every screen in your app

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.780
allows users to start and
control casts at any time.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.210
And to be clear, the
Cast icon should always

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.660
be visible whenever the
Cast receiver is available.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.070
Once users are ready
to cast, there's

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.620
two ways they can connect.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.740
They can connect to a Cast
receiver and then play content,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.310
or they can start
playing content

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.400
and then connect to a receiver.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.100
Either way, they start
Cast as a mode of the app.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.660
So just like Bluetooth,
once you're connected,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.000
whatever you play in the
app should Cast to the TV.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.810
Now, once content starts
streaming to the TV,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.150
the phone allows users to
browse and control Casts

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.140
while the TV displays
the streaming content.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.840
So when designing
your TV UI, do not

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.980
make it look touchable or
simply reuse the tablet UI.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.450
For example, in research
I have observed,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.030
people attempted to use
the actual physical TV

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.100
remote when the UI on the
TV looked interactive.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.050
So with this in mind, when
you tap pause on the phone,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.810
it should change to a
play icon, but the TV

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.710
should show a paused icon.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.420
This is because the TV is
showing the state paused,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.030
and the phone is providing
the action to play.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.280
The second tip is to help the
TV UI stay out of the way.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.830
For instance, people
will sometimes

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.940
pause a video to examine a frame
or read text on the screen,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.840
like closed captions.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.810
So when someone pauses a
video, fade the TV UI away

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.680
after 5 seconds.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.210
Keeping the UI within the
lower fourth of the TV

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.260
will also help, since most
of the important content

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.430
is typically above that.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.120
And the last tip is
to provide the ability

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.740
to control a Cast from
every state of your app.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.640
At any given time, the most
critical controls for people

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.280
are play and pause and volume.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.330
Remember, this is
super important,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.380
because your app is the
only remote they have.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.934
Now, for Android there's five
places to surface controls.

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.100
You could provide a full
set of controls in your app

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.230
for the content
currently playing,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.590
and when navigating
elsewhere in your app,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.580
provide a persistent controller.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.350
This is commonly a control bar
at the bottom of the screen.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.880
Also provide controls
within the Cast menu,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.860
because this is where users
start and stop Casting.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.890
And when users
exit your app, make

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.270
sure to provide controls
in the notifications

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.740
and the lock screen.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.510
Doing all of these together
will ensure the most seamless

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.580
experience so your
users can relax and use

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.670
their phone however they like.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.700
Now, once something is
casting, expect that more users

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.720
will want to join in.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.510
At a minimum, when multiple
users are connected,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.940
each user should be
able to take control.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.350
An example of this
is that you just

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.160
left the room while
Casting, and your friend

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.029
needs to take control.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.530
Another possibility is that you
started a Cast and your friend

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.550
wants to add to the queue.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.430
So designing your app to
work for anyone at any time

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.400
will help it feel extra natural.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.310
Now, from time to time, expect
that the phone's connection

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.660
to a Cast may go in and out.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.340
This can happen from
the Wi-Fi going out

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.730
of range, the battery
dying, or your app's process

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.180
is being stopped by another app.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.790
When this happens,
automatically reconnect

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.640
users that dropped off
whenever they're in your app.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.730
And the final step to a
Cast is disconnecting.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.350
Users can disconnect
from the Cast menu

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.170
or from a notification
in Android.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.190
To prevent users from
accidentally stopping a Cast,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.180
only stop the Cast when the
last connected user disconnects.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.900
For the complete set
of Cast UX guidelines,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.850
don't forget to check out the
design checklist on the Cast

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.660
SDK site.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.380
Thanks for watching, and
I'll see you next time.
