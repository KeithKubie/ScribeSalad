00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.830
So there are lots of different ways to answer this,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.440
especially, depending on your age. Here's one way. So, I'm going to

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.130
define the variable, age, and I'm going to use my age in

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.340
spirit, which is 7. And then, we'll multiply that by the

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.960
number of days in a year. But let's also define

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.960
a variable for the number of days in a year. And

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.510
we could use 365. If we want to account for leap years,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.360
it would be more accurate to use 365 and a quarter,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.480
since one quarter of the years are leap years.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.460
And to compute the number of days that I've been

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.360
alive, we can multiply those two values and print

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.540
out the result. So let's try that in the Python

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.600
interpreter. So here, we've defined our two variables. We

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.890
have age is 7, not my real age, in case

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.100
you're wondering. And days_in_year is 365 and a quarter.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.430
So we'll multiply those two to print out the result,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.160
which is 2556 and 3 quarter days. Quest to do

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.990
this more accurately, we'd need to use a real age.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.220
And our actual age is probably not an exact number

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.490
of years, unless it's your birthday today, in which case,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.140
happy birthday. But otherwise, you'd need to add the number

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.330
of days since your birthday to get a more accurate

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.210
number. I'll change my age to my real age. And

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.750
I will add the number of days since my birthday.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.090
Which is 268, if you're watching this on the day it's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.540
released. And then we got my age, in days, is 14,878. Which

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.970
seems pretty old.
