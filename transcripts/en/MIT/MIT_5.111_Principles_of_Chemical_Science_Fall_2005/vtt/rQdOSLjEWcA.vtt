00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.463
Last time, we were talking
about this valence bond model

00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:24.536
for describing the bonding.
In particular,

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:30.000
the bonding between atoms in a
polyatomic molecule.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.720
And we saw that the key to this
description was allowing the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.986
wave functions,
the individual wave functions

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:45.318
on an atom to constructively and
destructively interfere

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:49.681
themselves to form some hybrid
wave functions,

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:55.110
to form some hybrid orbitals.
And then it is those hybrid

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.024
wave functions that overlap with
the wave functions of another

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:06.688
atom to form a chemical bond.
And, in particular,

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:12.200
what we treated last time were
these sp^3 hybrid wave functions

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.533
that were centered on carbon,
that were centered on nitrogen,

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:22.866
that were centered on oxygen.
And we saw that these sp^3 wave

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:28.022
functions were this linear
combination, or this destructive

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:33.355
and constructive interference
between the s wave function and

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:39.097
the three 2p wave functions --
To form these sp^3 wave

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:43.384
functions and correspondingly
these sp^3 states.

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:46.758
And, as I said,
we saw that on carbon,

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:50.954
we saw that on nitrogen,
we saw that on oxygen.

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:56.517
And those wave functions end up
being pointed to the corner or

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:02.172
to the vertex of a tetrahedron
where the atom was at the center

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:07.601
of that tetrahedron.
In the case of methane then,

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:12.990
if you bond a hydrogen to each
one of those sp3 hybrid wave

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.471
functions, what you get is a
tetrahedral geometry around the

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.537
carbon.
If you had a nitrogen with

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:27.019
those sp63 wave functions around
it, and you bonded to three

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.315
hydrogens, then you got a
trigonal pyramid as the geometry

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:37.611
of the ammonia molecule with
those two lone pairs sticking

00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:43.000
out there at another vertex of a
tetrahedron.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.540
But remember we talked about
the shape of the molecule as

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.081
being described by the positions
of the atoms and not the

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.378
positions of the electrons.
And we talked about water.

00:02:56.378 --> 00:03:01.000
Water, sp^3 hybridized.
We add two hydrogens to it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.642
We form two bonds that are
planar bent.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:07.745
And then we have two lone pair
electrons sticking out of the

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.249
oxygen.
Those are going to play a big

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.726
role in some of the bonding
we're going to look at,

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.882
at the end of the lecture
today.

00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:19.498
We have got to move on.
And we have got to talk about

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:23.671
another kind of hybridization,
which we started to talk about

00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.661
last time, which is this sp^2
hybridization.

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:30.000
And we talked about it on
boron.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.385
We saw that the sp^2 wave
functions end up being in a

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:38.686
plane which, in the case of
boron, if we then bonded

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:43.240
hydrogens to those sp^2 wave
functions, we got a planer

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.108
molecule for boron H three.

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:50.409
But carbon can also undergo
this sp^2 hybridization.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.445
And so let's take a look at
that now.

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:57.578
In the case of carbon,
we have to do this electron

00:03:57.578 --> 00:04:02.469
promotion that we talked about
also in the case of the sp^3

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:07.750
hybridization.
And then we let now one of the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.250
2s wave functions and two of the
2p wave functions hybridize,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.100
constructively and
destructively interfere.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.233
And the result is three sp^2
wave functions or three sp^2

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:27.000
states with one electron in each
one of them.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.302
And then one of those p
orbitals or those p wave

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:34.597
functions on the carbon is
untouched.

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:39.997
That is just the atomic wave
function, the atomic orbital on

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:43.750
that carbon.
And if we look at the picture

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.503
of all of those wave functions
here it is.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:51.439
This is the 2s on the carbon,
2pz, 2px, 2py.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.741
And what we did is let these
three, for example,

00:04:55.741 --> 00:05:00.226
constructively and
destructively interfere to form

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:07.000
these three sp^2 hybrid orbitals
or hybrid wave functions.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.070
And the result is that they
look like this.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.456
The result is they all have a
large positive lobe on them due

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.795
to the constructive
interference,

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:20.011
and they all have a small
negative lobe here.

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:24.397
And then all of the rest of the
pictures that we are going to

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:28.929
draw, we are not going to draw
that small negative lobe because

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:34.237
it just makes it hard to draw.
But the bottom line is that

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:36.888
these three lobes lie in a
plane.

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:40.865
And then, of course,
we still had that 2py atomic

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.848
wave function centered on the
carbon.

00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:48.322
And that is unperturbed.
Now what I am going to do is I

00:05:48.322 --> 00:05:53.294
am going to put all of these
three wave functions on the same

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:56.691
plot, since they all have the
same origin.

00:05:56.691 --> 00:06:01.000
So that is what I am doing
right there.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.442
There it is for the carbon,
with the three positive lobes

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:11.106
of that sp^2 wave function all
in the same plane.

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:16.548
Again, I didn't draw the little
part of the negative wave

00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:21.796
function in this picture.
But now, what we also have is

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:26.655
that 2py wave function,
the 2p wave function on the

00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:32.000
carbon that hasn't hybridized.
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.718
That hasn't hybridized,
right?

00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:39.218
And it is sticking out of the
plane of the board,

00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:42.593
right?
That's the 2p orbital that you

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:45.593
are used to seeing on the
carbon.

00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:51.500
And it is perpendicular here to
the plane in which the sp^2 wave

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.468
functions are sitting.
Now, what we are going to do is

00:06:56.468 --> 00:07:00.781
I am going to take this sp^2
hybridized carbon,

00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:06.031
where the positive lobes of
these sp^2 wave functions are

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:11.000
all 120 degrees away from each
other.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.479
And where you would say these
wave functions had a trigonal

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.264
planar configuration.
I am going to take this sp^2

00:07:19.264 --> 00:07:22.585
wave function,
and I am just going to rotate

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:26.447
it so that this lobe here is
parallel to the floor.

00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:30.000
I am going to do that for
convenience.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.582
And you are going to see why in
a moment.

00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:37.432
That is what happens here on
the next slide.

00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:41.731
I just rotated this by 90
degrees, in particular,

00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:47.283
so I could put the z-axis here
along a bond I am going to form.

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:51.671
That is the top view.
Now, let's look at what this

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:55.164
looks like from the side.
From the side,

00:07:55.164 --> 00:08:00.000
what it would like is something
like that.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.503
The carbon is right here at the
center.

00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:05.996
Then the positive lobe,
this positive part of the wave

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:08.368
function, that is what this is,
here.

00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:11.003
This 2py wave function,
well, here it is.

00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:14.825
It is perpendicular to this
plane that you are looking down

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:17.329
on up here.
It is perpendicular to this

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.767
plane.
That is that 2py wave function.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:23.655
Positive part of the p wave
function, negative part of the p

00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:26.554
wave function.
And then this part of the wave

00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:29.387
function, well,
this is just a projection of

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:34.000
these two big positive parts of
the wave function.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.581
This just projects this way and
out that way.

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.837
That is what it looks like from
the side.

00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:44.988
Now what I am going to do,
is I am going to bring in

00:08:44.988 --> 00:08:48.081
another sp^2 hybridized carbon
up here.

00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:52.558
I am going to bring it in.
It is going to look just like

00:08:52.558 --> 00:08:55.000
that.
Here it comes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.491
And when I do that,
what is going to happen right

00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:05.105
here is that I am going to allow
the 2sp^2 wave function from

00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:10.719
this carbon to overlap with the
2sp^2 wave function from this

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:14.087
carbon and I am going to form a
bond.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:19.888
And that is going to be a sigma
bond, sigma because it is going

00:09:19.888 --> 00:09:25.409
to be cylindrically symmetric
around this carbon-carbon bond

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:30.625
axis.
And it is a sigma bond formed

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:38.125
by the carbon 2sp^2 hybrid wave
function and the other carbon

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:44.750
2sp^2 hybrid wave function.
I have formed a bond here.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:51.625
And now, what I am going to do
is bring this carbon sp^2

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:58.000
hybridized wave function or
carbon in again.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.178
But I am going to bring it in
and we are going to watch this

00:10:03.178 --> 00:10:06.162
view.
We are going to watch it from

00:10:06.162 --> 00:10:09.497
the side.
This time, what I want you to

00:10:09.497 --> 00:10:14.938
see is what is going to happen,
here, to the 2py wave function.

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:18.537
Here it goes.
We are going to bring it in.

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:23.803
And then this 2sp^2 is going to
form a bond here between this

00:10:23.803 --> 00:10:29.069
carbon, but now what happens is
that those 2py wave functions

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:32.757
overlap.
They constructively or

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:37.071
destructively interfere.
If you want to watch it again,

00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:40.905
here it comes in,
we are going to make this sigma

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:45.778
bond, but now these two lobes
are going to interfere and these

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:48.334
two lobes are going to
interfere.

00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:52.647
And this is going to be
constructive interference there

00:10:52.647 --> 00:10:58.000
because they both have a
positive sign or negative sign.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.762
And so we are going to have
wave function up here and wave

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:06.772
function down there.
We formed another bond right

00:11:06.772 --> 00:11:09.779
here.
The bond that we formed here is

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:14.541
going to be called the pi bond.
It is pi because it is not

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:19.053
cylindrically symmetric around
this carbon-carbon axis.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:23.648
There is wave function or
electron density if you square

00:11:23.648 --> 00:11:28.744
it up here and wave function or
electron density if you square

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:32.484
it down here.
But right here,

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:37.134
along the plane,
there is a node in that pi wave

00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:40.893
function.
So this is a pi wave function

00:11:40.893 --> 00:11:45.544
made out of the atomic wave
functions on carbon.

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:50.194
The atomic wave functions,
the ones that haven't

00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:53.558
participated in this
hybridization.

00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:59.000
It is made out of carbon 2py
and carbon 2py.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.372
What I have got here is a
double bond.

00:12:02.372 --> 00:12:06.018
I have two bonds between the
two carbons.

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:10.393
I have got a sigma bond and I
have got a pi bond.

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:13.674
That's great.
Now let's bring in some

00:12:13.674 --> 00:12:15.497
hydrogen.
I just did.

00:12:15.497 --> 00:12:19.416
And when I brought in those
hydrogens, well,

00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:22.515
you can recognize this as
ethylene.

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:28.166
The hydrogens form a sigma bond
between the carbon 2sp^2 hybrid

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:34.000
wave function and the hydrogen
1s wave function.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.180
That is what forms this sigma
bond.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.483
It is sigma because it is
symmetric around that

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:46.816
carbon-hydrogen bond access.
And the molecule that we have

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:51.212
here is ethylene.
Now, let's look at that again,

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:54.674
because this is really very
important.

00:12:54.674 --> 00:13:00.380
Here I show you just those two
2p^2 hybridized carbons forming

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.319
that sigma bond.
And this just represents,

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:09.216
here, the energy levels as I
bring them in.

00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:14.412
In this case we have two
electrons in this sp^2 state and

00:13:14.412 --> 00:13:19.051
we have one electron in each one
of the 2py states.

00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:23.041
And so this represents this
sigma bond here.

00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:28.237
And then we made a pi bond.
And we will watch it now from

00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:32.037
the top.
We made a pi bond.

00:13:32.037 --> 00:13:36.905
We let these two 2py wave
functions overlap,

00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:41.660
constructively interfere to
form a pi bond,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.622
which is the carbon 2py,
carbon 2py.

00:13:45.622 --> 00:13:50.377
Clue here, every double bond
has two bonds.

00:13:50.377 --> 00:13:56.377
That's why it is double.
But every double bond is made

00:13:56.377 --> 00:14:02.886
up of one sigma bond.
And the sigma bond is always

00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:08.144
the overlap between two 2sp^2
hybrid wave functions.

00:14:08.144 --> 00:14:14.432
And the second bond that always
makes up a double bond is a pi

00:14:14.432 --> 00:14:17.525
bond.
The pi bond is always the

00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:21.237
overlap of two atomic wave
functions.

00:14:21.237 --> 00:14:27.216
In the case here of carbon it
is two 2p wave functions that

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:32.416
have overlapped.
That is what a double bond

00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:36.135
always is.
It always is so whether it's a

00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:41.991
carbon double bond or a nitrogen
double bond or an oxygen double

00:14:41.991 --> 00:14:44.594
bond.
It is always one sigma,

00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:47.847
one pi.
And there are the hydrogens.

00:14:47.847 --> 00:14:51.380
And, as we said,
those hydrogens there,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.678
that carbon-hydrogen bond is
this overlap between a carbon

00:14:56.678 --> 00:15:03.000
2sp62 wave function and that
hydrogen 1s wave function.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.054
And now, what is the geometry
of ethylene?

00:15:07.054 --> 00:15:11.604
Well, the geometry here of
ethylene is that the

00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:16.153
hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen bonds
are 120 degrees.

00:15:16.153 --> 00:15:21.296
That is 120 degrees because
that is the result of the

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:25.747
hybridization,
that 2sp^2 hybridization of the

00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:30.000
wave functions around the
carbon.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.757
This bond here is 120 degrees,
again, because of the 2sp^2

00:15:35.757 --> 00:15:38.989
hybridization around that
carbon.

00:15:38.989 --> 00:15:43.232
So the geometry of this
molecule is planar.

00:15:43.232 --> 00:15:46.565
All of these atoms are in a
plane.

00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:52.828
Those six atoms are in a plane
and the bond angles here are all

00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:56.969
120 degrees.
Now, if you see a carbon that

00:15:56.969 --> 00:16:02.820
has a double bond.
If you see a nitrogen that has

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.051
a double bond.
If you see an oxygen that has a

00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:11.094
double bond.
That is always a clue that that

00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:16.076
carbon, that nitrogen,
that oxygen has a hybridization

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.991
of 2sp^2.
Double bonds have this

00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:23.692
hybridization always.
If you are asked to tell what

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:29.427
the hybridization is around some
atom, it has a double bond to

00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:37.111
it, it is a 2sp^2 hybrid.
Now, what I want to do is I

00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:45.944
want to take this 2sp^2 hybrid
and build a larger molecule.

00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:55.385
I am going to take this carbon
two, take the two carbons

00:16:55.385 --> 00:17:03.000
here that are bonded via this
2sp^2 hydrogen.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.534
So here are two of them.
And here are another two.

00:17:08.534 --> 00:17:14.408
And they are kind of
strategically placed for what it

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:17.910
is I want to do.
And, of course,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:23.106
this is the sigma bond between
the two carbons.

00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:27.059
Here is the carbon 2sp^2 sigma
bond.

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:33.837
Now, what I am going to do is
bring in another carbon that is

00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:38.470
sp^2 hybridized.
Here it comes.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:44.771
And, again, it is strategically
oriented so that right here I

00:17:44.771 --> 00:17:50.863
have now formed another sigma
bond between the carbon 2sp^2

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:56.534
wave function and the other
carbon 2sp^2 wave function.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:18:02.745
The same thing right here.
I just form two other sigma

00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:06.508
bonds.
And now, I am going to bring in

00:18:06.508 --> 00:18:09.661
a sixth carbon,
sp^2 hybridized.

00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:13.830
And it is going to come in from
this side.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.389
Again, it is strategically
oriented.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:21.254
I just formed,
here, another sigma bond

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:27.457
between these two carbons and
another sigma bond between these

00:18:27.457 --> 00:18:32.712
two carbons.
Hey, look at this.

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:39.041
It is beginning to look a lot
like benzene.

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:41.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
That is my favorite part.
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.931
Here come the hydrogens.
This is going to be benzene.

00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:11.178
So what did I do here?
I made some sigma bonds.

00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:18.136
I made six sigma bonds between
the carbon 2sp^2 wave functions

00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:22.015
and the hydrogen 1s wave
functions.

00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:28.174
Now I've got all of my atoms
there and almost all of my

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:32.280
bonds.
However, we have got to do

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.456
something here about these 2p
atomic wave functions that are

00:19:37.456 --> 00:19:41.228
centered on the carbon.
We are not done yet.

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:43.947
What is going to happen to
them?

00:19:43.947 --> 00:19:48.333
Well, they are going to
overlap, constructively and

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:51.842
destructively interfere.
And to see that,

00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:56.052
let's take this benzene
molecule and rotate it 90

00:19:56.052 --> 00:20:01.578
degrees so that we are going to
look at it from the side-on view

00:20:01.578 --> 00:20:06.341
instead of the top view.
So there it is.

00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:11.707
Here are my carbon-carbon sigma
bonds, the 2sp^2-2sp^2 bonds.

00:20:11.707 --> 00:20:16.715
Here is my sigma bond between
the hydrogen and the carbon

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:21.097
2sp^2 wave function.
And now I am going to let the

00:20:21.097 --> 00:20:26.552
2p, the atomic wave functions,
not the hybrid wave function on

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:31.113
the carbon, the atomic wave
functions on the carbon,

00:20:31.113 --> 00:20:35.943
I am going to let them
constructively and destructively

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.581
interfere.
And here it goes.

00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:42.465
Well, they are going to
overlap.

00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:47.395
And I've got something that
looks like a pi bond here.

00:20:47.395 --> 00:20:52.139
I have wave function above the
plane of these atoms,

00:20:52.139 --> 00:20:58.000
and I have wave function below
the plane of these atoms.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.928
It is a pi bond that is formed
by the overlap of the 2p wave

00:21:04.928 --> 00:21:10.330
functions, the atomic wave
functions on carbon.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.380
It is pi because it is not
symmetric around,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.548
now, the bond axis.
There is density up here,

00:21:20.548 --> 00:21:25.010
density up there,
but not in the plane.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:31.000
Let's look at it again from the
top view.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.996
What did I do?
Well, I let these 2p wave

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:40.121
functions here overlap.
Let's look at that a little

00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:44.425
more carefully.
What exactly did I do here?

00:21:44.425 --> 00:21:47.704
Well, what I did is,
for example,

00:21:47.704 --> 00:21:53.649
I let the 2p wave functions on
these two carbons overlap to

00:21:53.649 --> 00:21:58.260
form a pi bond.
I let the 2p wave functions on

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:04.000
these two carbons overlap to
form a pi bond.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.681
And I let these two 2p wave
functions overlap to form a pi

00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:12.571
bond.
Well, that is very nice,

00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:18.451
but I could also have let the
2p wave functions on these two

00:22:18.451 --> 00:22:22.039
carbons overlap or these two
carbons.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:26.225
In other words,
I could have made a pi bond

00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:32.006
between these two carbons or
these two carbons or these two

00:22:32.006 --> 00:22:36.526
carbons.
So which one do I choose?

00:22:36.526 --> 00:22:42.487
Well, in recitation the other
day, you should have looked at

00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:47.641
the Lewis structure of molecular
benzene or benzene.

00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:53.400
And what you should have seen
is that you would be able to

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.362
write several different Lewis
structures, all which have the

00:22:59.362 --> 00:23:05.409
same set of formal charges.
And that you wouldn't be able

00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:10.395
to decide which structure you
should have based on the formal

00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:13.220
charges.
Rather, what you had was a

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.209
resonance structure.
And that is exactly what you

00:23:17.209 --> 00:23:19.785
have.
Instead of these six extra

00:23:19.785 --> 00:23:25.020
electrons, which are centered on
the carbon, those 2p electrons,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.260
there is one here,
one there, one there,

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.000
one there, one there,
one there.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.718
Instead of each one of those
electrons being shared between

00:23:37.718 --> 00:23:42.450
just one of the adjacent
carbons, those six extra

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.478
electrons are actually
delocalized around all of the

00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:51.028
carbons.
And so what you are going to

00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:56.845
form here is not a clear double
bond between this carbon and

00:23:56.845 --> 00:24:03.431
this one and this one.
Instead, what you are going to

00:24:03.431 --> 00:24:07.435
form is kind of a half of a pi
bond.

00:24:07.435 --> 00:24:14.184
That is, you are going to let
those six electrons be equally

00:24:14.184 --> 00:24:20.476
distributed, so to speak,
around all of the six carbons.

00:24:20.476 --> 00:24:26.309
And so this pi bond here isn't
quite a full pi bond.

00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:31.000
It is kind of half of a pi
bond.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.895
Because this carbon is sharing
its 2p electron with this carbon

00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:41.363
and with this carbon,
and vice versa all the way

00:24:41.363 --> 00:24:44.786
around.
And so we have this resonance

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:48.590
structure.
I drew this as kind of a fuzzy

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.059
green line there.
We have these six pi electrons

00:24:53.059 --> 00:25:00.000
that are delocalized amongst the
six atoms of this carbon ring.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.650
So these double bonds here are
really a bond and a half.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:11.404
This bond is more than a single
bond in terms of its bond

00:25:11.404 --> 00:25:15.205
strength and in terms of its
distance.

00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:21.061
It is closer than a single
bond, but it isn't as strong as

00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:25.582
a double bond,
nor is it as short as a double

00:25:25.582 --> 00:25:30.000
bond.
It is somewhere in between.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.743
That is the structure here of
benzene.

00:25:34.743 --> 00:25:39.871
So that takes care of sp^2
hybridization.

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:47.435
Now, we've got one other kind
of motif and that is called sp

00:25:47.435 --> 00:25:53.076
hybridization.
And we are going to use carbon

00:25:53.076 --> 00:26:00.000
again as the example of this sp
hybridization.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.155
Again, since we are starting
with carbon here,

00:26:04.155 --> 00:26:09.972
we are going to have to undergo
this electron promotion process.

00:26:09.972 --> 00:26:13.112
We are going to take an s
electron.

00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:18.099
Are there some questions here
that I can help you with?

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:18.653
No.
OK.

00:26:18.653 --> 00:26:23.916
We are going to take that s
electron and promote it to the

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:27.425
2p state.
And then we are going to do a

00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:30.011
hybridization,
but this time,

00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:35.274
what we are going to do is let
the 2s atomic wave function

00:26:35.274 --> 00:26:41.000
hybridize with one of the 2p
wave functions.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.299
And the result,
then, is that we are going to

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:48.275
have a new wave function that we
are going to call sp,

00:26:48.275 --> 00:26:52.849
and there is only going to be
two of them, because we only let

00:26:52.849 --> 00:26:56.599
one of the 2s and one of the
2p's constructively or

00:26:56.599 --> 00:27:02.026
destructively interfere.
So we are going to get two sp

00:27:02.026 --> 00:27:05.680
states or two new sp wave
functions.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.228
Each one has got an electron in
it.

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:12.986
Each state has got an electron
in it.

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:18.936
And then we've got left over
two atomic states centered on

00:27:18.936 --> 00:27:25.303
the carbon, the py and the px.
Each one has an electron in it.

00:27:25.303 --> 00:27:30.000
Yes?
Well, by convention here yes.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.468
The p state we are going to
hybridize is going to be 2pz,

00:27:36.468 --> 00:27:43.745
and that is because that is the
wave function I am going to make

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:47.788
a bond to.
And I want that along the

00:27:47.788 --> 00:27:53.102
internuclear axis.
In real life you cannot tell

00:27:53.102 --> 00:27:58.762
what is x, y or z,
but by convention we are always

00:27:58.762 --> 00:28:05.000
going to put the z-axis along
the bond axis.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.493
And I will say a little more
about labeling py and pz and an

00:28:10.493 --> 00:28:14.775
example that I am going to do in
a few minutes,

00:28:14.775 --> 00:28:18.034
so I hope that will clear
things up.

00:28:18.034 --> 00:28:22.689
In the picture form,
here are our three atomic wave

00:28:22.689 --> 00:28:27.065
functions again.
And I am going to let these two

00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:32.000
constructively and destructively
interfere.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.943
And the result is,
then, two new sp wave

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:37.811
functions.
Now, given that I am letting

00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:41.962
only two wave functions
constructively and destructively

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:46.339
interfere, it is a little bit
easier to see how I get these

00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:47.849
shapes.
Here it goes.

00:28:47.849 --> 00:28:51.698
This 2s wave function,
remember the 2s wave function

00:28:51.698 --> 00:28:54.943
always has one sign?
Say it has a plus sign,

00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:58.339
it never crosses the axis.
There are no nodes,

00:28:58.339 --> 00:29:01.211
right?
No radial nodes.

00:29:01.211 --> 00:29:05.073
When you have a node,
that is when the wave function

00:29:05.073 --> 00:29:08.329
changes sign.
I am going to put that 2s wave

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:12.948
function in the same place in
space as this 2pz wave function.

00:29:12.948 --> 00:29:15.674
When I do that,
since this is a wave,

00:29:15.674 --> 00:29:19.991
it is going to constructively
and destructively interfere.

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:23.777
Up here, where I am
constructively interfering this

00:29:23.777 --> 00:29:28.320
positive wave function with the
positive part of the 2pz wave

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:34.000
function, I am going to get a
lot of positive wave function.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.797
That is where this lobe comes
from.

00:29:36.797 --> 00:29:40.500
But down here,
where this is positive and this

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.189
is negative, that is going to be
destructive interference.

00:29:45.189 --> 00:29:49.879
And because this negative part
of the 2pz lobe is actually

00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:53.253
larger than the 2s that is
positive, well,

00:29:53.253 --> 00:29:58.272
I am going to have a little bit
of leftover of a negative wave

00:29:58.272 --> 00:30:01.842
function.
Here, it is easier to see how

00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:05.018
you get this shape by the
interference of that wave

00:30:05.018 --> 00:30:07.051
function with that wave
function.

00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:10.418
And then, correspondingly,
I am going to let this wave

00:30:10.418 --> 00:30:13.911
function and that wave function
destructively interfere.

00:30:13.911 --> 00:30:17.342
If this is still positive,
positive minus a positive is

00:30:17.342 --> 00:30:21.344
going to give me a little bit of
a wave function and it is going

00:30:21.344 --> 00:30:23.885
to be negative.
And then positive minus a

00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:26.743
negative, that is going to give
me a positive.

00:30:26.743 --> 00:30:31.000
Here is my big positive part of
the wave function.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.136
That is a little bit easier to
see, now, than in the sp^3 case,

00:30:36.136 --> 00:30:40.940
where it is not so easy to see.
These are now my two new 2p

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.585
wave functions.
And the atomic wave functions

00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:47.650
here, I haven't done anything to
them.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:52.538
Now, I am going to put these
wave functions all on one plot.

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:57.426
They all have the same origin.
It is the carbon right in the

00:30:57.426 --> 00:31:01.155
center.
I am going to put them all on

00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:02.865
one plot.
Here they are.

00:31:02.865 --> 00:31:06.136
And, what I did is that I
rotated the z-axis.

00:31:06.136 --> 00:31:10.522
It was going up and down here.
The z-axis in this picture is

00:31:10.522 --> 00:31:13.793
coming this way.
It is parallel to the floor.

00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:17.882
Again, strategically placed for
the next bond formation.

00:31:17.882 --> 00:31:21.079
But here, you can see the 2px
wave function,

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.681
the atomic wave function,
untouched.

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:27.249
And perpendicular to it,
you can see the 2py wave

00:31:27.249 --> 00:31:33.565
function, untouched.
Now I am going to take another

00:31:33.565 --> 00:31:40.340
sp carbon wave function and
bring it in, and I am going to

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:46.520
let the sp wave functions on the
two carbons overlap,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.532
so that I form a sigma bond.
Sigma formed by the carbon 2sp,

00:31:53.532 --> 00:31:59.000
carbon 2sp.
That's my sigma bond there.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.600
But now, you know what is going
to happen?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.430
We are going to let the atomic
wave functions on the two

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.821
carbons constructively and
destructively interfere.

00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:15.509
Oh, I am going to bring in
hydrogens first.

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:18.671
Sorry.
We brought in the hydrogen and

00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:24.116
formed this sigma bond between
the carbon 2sp wave function and

00:32:24.116 --> 00:32:30.000
the hydrogen 1s wave function.
And we've got acetylene.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.342
Except now we've got to let the
2p atomic wave functions on each

00:32:36.342 --> 00:32:40.872
carbon interfere.
Except I wanted to point out

00:32:40.872 --> 00:32:44.798
this geometry.
[LAUGHTER] I got this all

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:48.523
wrong.
This is 180 degrees because the

00:32:48.523 --> 00:32:52.046
sp wave functions lie in a line.
The

00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:57.986
hydrogen-carbon-carbon-hydrogen
here, that bond angle is 180

00:32:57.986 --> 00:33:02.240
degrees.
We have a linear molecule.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.409
And now, we are going to let
the 2p wave functions interfere.

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:11.545
When we did that,
we are going to form a pi bond.

00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:16.715
The interference of this 2py
and this 2py is going to be a pi

00:33:16.715 --> 00:33:19.386
bond.
It is pi because it is not

00:33:19.386 --> 00:33:24.469
cylindrically symmetric around
this carbon-carbon bond axis.

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:29.898
There is electron density above
the plane of the slide and below

00:33:29.898 --> 00:33:35.070
the plane of the slide.
We've got a pi bond here.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.963
And then, finally,
we are going to let these two

00:33:38.963 --> 00:33:43.352
atomic wave functions
constructively and destructively

00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:47.328
interfere, the 2px.
Again, we are going to form a

00:33:47.328 --> 00:33:50.144
pi bond.
It is pi because it is not

00:33:50.144 --> 00:33:53.788
cylindrically symmetric around
the bond axis.

00:33:53.788 --> 00:33:58.426
There is electron density up
here and electron density up

00:33:58.426 --> 00:34:02.687
there.
What we have here is a triple

00:34:02.687 --> 00:34:05.375
bond.
We have, between the two

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:10.009
carbons, one sigma bond,
one pi bond and another pi

00:34:10.009 --> 00:34:12.326
bond.
The two pi bonds are

00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:16.590
perpendicular to each other.
That is important.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.780
So a triple bond is always
composed of one sigma bond and

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.560
two pi bonds.
That is the case,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.287
whether you're looking at a
triple bond on carbon or

00:34:29.287 --> 00:34:34.570
nitrogen or anything else,
well, almost anything else that

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:41.651
forms a triple bond.
But, for your intents and

00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:50.561
purposes, carbon and nitrogen
are going to form a triple bond.

00:34:50.561 --> 00:34:57.865
That is important here.
Those are our hybridization

00:34:57.865 --> 00:35:04.000
schemes that we are going to
look at.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.773
And it is going to allow us to
describe the bonding in lots and

00:35:10.773 --> 00:35:16.126
lots of molecules.
And one of the molecules that I

00:35:16.126 --> 00:35:21.369
want to describe the bonding of
is this molecule.

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:26.831
It is methyl nitrate.
This is going to help you out

00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:32.016
on the homework here.
Suppose you are asked to

00:35:32.016 --> 00:35:37.140
describe the bonding in methyl
nitrate, and you are given this

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.501
structure.
Well, the first thing you have

00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:45.289
to do is write down a skeletal
structure, and to actually,

00:35:45.289 --> 00:35:48.314
in your mind,
get down what the Lewis

00:35:48.314 --> 00:35:53.607
structure is for methyl nitrate.
A couple of days ago I told you

00:35:53.607 --> 00:35:58.143
that when you see a CH three
species like that,

00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:02.927
it is a methyl group.
That is always terminal.

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:06.783
That is a carbon with three
hydrogens bond to it.

00:36:06.783 --> 00:36:09.836
And so that is what we are
going to do.

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:14.013
We are going to make this
carbon there with the three

00:36:14.013 --> 00:36:18.030
hydrogens bound to it.
And then, if you have a long

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.886
molecule like this,
one place to start is to then

00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:24.778
just bind this atom to the next
atom.

00:36:24.778 --> 00:36:28.232
So I did that.
I put the carbon bound to the

00:36:28.232 --> 00:36:32.301
oxygen.
And then following that rule,

00:36:32.301 --> 00:36:35.952
I took the oxygen and bound it
to the nitrogen.

00:36:35.952 --> 00:36:40.476
And then following that rule,
I got two oxygens here and I

00:36:40.476 --> 00:36:45.317
put the oxygen on this nitrogen
and the oxygen on that oxygen.

00:36:45.317 --> 00:36:48.095
And then I drew the Lewis
structure.

00:36:48.095 --> 00:36:52.063
I counted my electrons,
drew it up and there it is.

00:36:52.063 --> 00:36:56.507
There is a Lewis structure.
But now what I am going to do

00:36:56.507 --> 00:37:01.961
is calculate the formal charge.
All of these atoms here,

00:37:01.961 --> 00:37:05.476
if I do it right,
have a zero formal charge.

00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:10.544
I then find a formal charge of
plus one on the oxygen and minus

00:37:10.544 --> 00:37:14.550
one on the nitrogen.
And I see that the sum of the

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.882
formal charges is zero.
And the overall charge on that

00:37:18.882 --> 00:37:22.070
molecule is zero,
so it looks like I did

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.749
everything right.
However, is this the correct

00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:28.528
Lewis structure for methyl
nitrate?

00:37:28.528 --> 00:37:32.707
No.
It is not the correct structure

00:37:32.707 --> 00:37:36.987
for methyl nitrate.
And it isn't because we have a

00:37:36.987 --> 00:37:42.141
negative formal charge on the
nitrogen and a positive on the

00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:47.033
oxygen, and oxygen is more
electronegative than nitrogen,

00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:51.837
so this is not an adequate
structure for methyl nitrate.

00:37:51.837 --> 00:37:56.379
This does not describe the
chemical bonding in methyl

00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:59.000
nitrate.
What does?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Well, to do that let's look at
the board here.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Let's look at the bonding,
here, in methyl nitrate.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Here is another Lewis structure
that I could draw.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.653
CH three,
oxygen, and then I could have

00:38:34.653 --> 00:38:40.722
put the double bond here between
the oxygen and the nitrogen,

00:38:40.722 --> 00:38:45.881
and then I could have bonded
the two oxygens to that

00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:49.624
nitrogen.
And there is a bunch of lone

00:38:49.624 --> 00:38:53.569
pairs here on the oxygen.
That's all OK.

00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:59.335
But now, if I go and calculate
the formal charges on that,

00:38:59.335 --> 00:39:05.000
I am going to get a plus one on
this oxygen.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.695
I am going to get a plus one on
that nitrogen,

00:39:08.695 --> 00:39:13.703
and I am going to get a minus
one on this oxygen and minus one

00:39:13.703 --> 00:39:17.316
on that oxygen.
That is a lot of distribution

00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:21.011
of charge, here,
away from the distribution of

00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:25.856
charge in the isolated atom.
Let's see if we can do a little

00:39:25.856 --> 00:39:28.976
better.
Again, starting with the methyl

00:39:28.976 --> 00:39:33.000
group here at the end,
let's do this.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.125
Let us bond the oxygen to the
carbon, and then singly bond

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:42.802
that nitrogen to the oxygen,
and then doubly bond one

00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:46.848
oxygen, and then singly bond the
other oxygen.

00:39:46.848 --> 00:39:51.615
And there is going to be a
resonance structure to this

00:39:51.615 --> 00:39:56.651
because I could have switched
where the double bonds were

00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:00.544
here.
And if I go and I calculate the

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:04.320
formal charges,
I find now everything has got a

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.328
zero, except the nitrogen has a
plus one and this oxygen has a

00:40:09.328 --> 00:40:12.201
minus one.
And that is a much better

00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:16.962
situation than a lower energy
situation, than a plus one on

00:40:16.962 --> 00:40:20.410
the oxygen and a minus one on
the nitrogen.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.037
There is the resonance
structure.

00:40:23.037 --> 00:40:26.895
I won't draw it.
But that is the Lewis structure

00:40:26.895 --> 00:40:31.000
here for methyl nitrate.
Now, clue.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.575
If you see an NO two
written like that,

00:40:36.575 --> 00:40:43.848
that is always going to mean
the two oxygens are bound to the

00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:48.333
nitrogen.
And if you ever see the word

00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:55.969
nitrate like in that expression,
that means all of those oxygens

00:40:55.969 --> 00:41:03.000
are going to be bound to the
nitrogen in some way.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.989
On an exam, if you see an NO
two, those two oxygens

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:09.534
are going to be bound to the
nitrogen.

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:13.523
If you see the word nitrate,
the three oxygens are going to

00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:16.000
be bound to the nitrogen.
Yes?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.276
If I do that then I am going to
have these five bonds to the

00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:33.000
nitrogen, and that is going to
give a very high formal charge.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.986
It is not going to be the
lowest energy structure.

00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:45.339
That is our structure.
But now the question is how to

00:41:45.339 --> 00:41:49.859
describe the bonding in this
molecule.

00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:54.990
Let's do that.
Let's describe that bonding.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:42:00.000
Let me erase this structure
here.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.576
What do we have?
We have three carbon-hydrogen

00:42:04.576 --> 00:42:08.237
bonds.
And this carbon here is bonded

00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:13.830
to four different atoms.
That carbon has no double bond,

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:18.000
has no triple bond.
If it is bound to four

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.474
different atoms and it has just
single bonds,

00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:26.135
the carbon is always sp^3
hybridized.

00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:33.041
That is something to know.
What that means is that these

00:42:33.041 --> 00:42:36.923
carbon-hydrogen bonds are sigma
bonds.

00:42:36.923 --> 00:42:43.111
They are sigma bonds formed
between the carbon and the 2sp^3

00:42:43.111 --> 00:42:48.041
wave function and the hydrogen
1s wave function.

00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:53.811
That describes the bonding in
the carbon-hydrogen bonds.

00:42:53.811 --> 00:43:00.000
What about this bond,
the carbon-oxygen bond here?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.511
How do we describe it?
Well, we already said this

00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:11.366
carbon is sp^3 hybridized.
And so, we can write this

00:43:11.366 --> 00:43:16.188
carbon as sp^3.
And then, this oxygen here,

00:43:16.188 --> 00:43:20.896
well, this oxygen has got two
bonds to it.

00:43:20.896 --> 00:43:25.374
It has no double bonds,
no triple bonds,

00:43:25.374 --> 00:43:31.000
so this oxygen is also sp^3
hybridized.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.186
This oxygen looks like the
oxygen in water.

00:43:35.186 --> 00:43:38.376
This is going to be a sigma
bond.

00:43:38.376 --> 00:43:44.158
It is going to be symmetric
around that axis between carbon

00:43:44.158 --> 00:43:48.445
2sp^3 and oxygen 2sp^3.
We've got that bond.

00:43:48.445 --> 00:43:52.034
Next we have an oxygen-nitrogen
bond.

00:43:52.034 --> 00:43:56.320
How do we describe the
oxygen-nitrogen bond?

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.507
Well, the oxygen,
we already said was 2sp^3

00:44:00.507 --> 00:44:04.320
hybridized.
We know that.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.892
But this nitrogen has got a
double bond to it.

00:44:08.892 --> 00:44:14.784
If it has a double bond to it,
well, that nitrogen is 2sp^2

00:44:14.784 --> 00:44:19.050
hybridized.
But this is still a single bond

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:23.215
between the oxygen and the
nitrogen there.

00:44:23.215 --> 00:44:27.584
It is symmetric.
And so that bond is a sigma

00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:35.000
between the nitrogen 2sp^2 wave
function and the oxygen 2sp^3.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.354
Next the nitrogen-oxygen double
bond, how are we going to

00:44:41.354 --> 00:44:45.893
describe that?
Well, it is a double bond.

00:44:45.893 --> 00:44:52.248
It means we have two bonds.
One of those bonds is a sigma

00:44:52.248 --> 00:44:57.468
bond, as I said.
It is going to be a sigma bond

00:44:57.468 --> 00:45:04.276
between the nitrogen 2sp^2 wave
function and the oxygen 2sp^2

00:45:04.276 --> 00:45:09.196
wave function.
Because oxygen here is also

00:45:09.196 --> 00:45:11.962
double bonded.
If we use that rule,

00:45:11.962 --> 00:45:15.135
we will consider the oxygen to
be 2sp^2.

00:45:15.135 --> 00:45:18.796
It is a sigma bond.
But now we have two bonds,

00:45:18.796 --> 00:45:22.132
so the second one has to be a
double bond.

00:45:22.132 --> 00:45:25.061
What is that double bond going
to be?

00:45:25.061 --> 00:45:31.000
Well, it is going to be between
the nitrogen 2p wave function.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.576
Because the pi bonds are always
between the unhybridized wave

00:45:36.576 --> 00:45:40.387
functions.
Notice, I am going to leave out

00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:44.849
the x or the y here,
because I don't really know.

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:50.519
And, between the oxygen 2p wave
function, I left out the x and

00:45:50.519 --> 00:45:52.935
the y there.
Then, finally,

00:45:52.935 --> 00:45:56.932
I have the nitrogen-oxygen
bond, that second

00:45:56.932 --> 00:46:02.534
nitrogen-oxygen bond.
And, what do I have there?

00:46:02.534 --> 00:46:07.311
Well, it's a single bond.
It is going to be sigma.

00:46:07.311 --> 00:46:10.333
It is symmetric around the
axis.

00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:16.279
It is going to be between the
nitrogen 2sp^2 wave function and

00:46:16.279 --> 00:46:21.933
the oxygen 2pz wave function.
It is going to be 2pz in that

00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:26.223
case because we are here along
the bond axis.

00:46:26.223 --> 00:46:31.000
It is sigma bond.
It is not a pi bond.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.616
The sigma bonds are along the
bond axis.

00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:42.363
So that is methyl nitrate.
I am a little bit rushing to do

00:46:42.363 --> 00:46:47.689
something here,
and that is I want to describe

00:46:47.689 --> 00:46:51.477
to you one other kind of
bonding.

00:46:51.477 --> 00:46:57.751
But this is a bonding that is
not a bonding within the

00:46:57.751 --> 00:47:03.580
molecule.
It is actually bonding between

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.995
molecules.
And this is called hydrogen

00:47:07.995 --> 00:47:11.337
bonding.
In hydrogen bonding,

00:47:11.337 --> 00:47:18.259
what you have to have is a
hydrogen, and you have to have a

00:47:18.259 --> 00:47:24.106
hydrogen bonded to an
electronegative element like

00:47:24.106 --> 00:47:29.000
oxygen.
A good example is water.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.316
Water is bound to an
electronegative element,

00:47:33.316 --> 00:47:39.104
and we've got two lone pairs.
But in hydrogen bonding you've

00:47:39.104 --> 00:47:44.892
got bonds between molecules.
This is intermolecular bonding.

00:47:44.892 --> 00:47:50.876
And what happens is that this
hydrogen here will interact very

00:47:50.876 --> 00:47:55.585
strongly with the lone pair
electrons here on its

00:47:55.585 --> 00:48:00.000
neighboring oxygen,
forming a bond.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.143
It does so because this
hydrogen is kind of deshielded.

00:48:04.143 --> 00:48:06.905
The oxygen, being so
electronegative,

00:48:06.905 --> 00:48:10.434
it has kind of pulled all the
charge toward it.

00:48:10.434 --> 00:48:14.961
This hydrogen kind of looks a
little bit positively charged,

00:48:14.961 --> 00:48:18.337
delta plus where this is kind
of delta minus.

00:48:18.337 --> 00:48:21.329
And so this hydrogen being
really small,

00:48:21.329 --> 00:48:26.086
it can get close to the oxygen
lone pairs, where there is a lot

00:48:26.086 --> 00:48:30.000
of electron density,
and form a bond.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.715
And that bond ranges from 20 to
60 kilojoules per mole.

00:48:34.715 --> 00:48:38.383
Certainly not as strong as a
covalent bond.

00:48:38.383 --> 00:48:43.273
A C-H bond is 400 kilojoules
per mole, about the tenth of

00:48:43.273 --> 00:48:46.853
that strength.
And it turns out to be very

00:48:46.853 --> 00:48:50.171
important.
Hydrogen bonds determine the

00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:54.625
properties of water.
They determine the structure of

00:48:54.625 --> 00:48:58.030
proteins.
DNA owes its helical structure

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:03.890
to hydrogen bonding.
Trees stand up straight because

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.900
of hydrogen bonding in the
cellulose chains.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.028
The strength of nylon is
determined by hydrogen bonding.

00:49:13.028 --> 00:49:18.437
And whether or not you have a
bad hair day is determined by

00:49:18.437 --> 00:49:21.141
hydrogen bonding.
For example,

00:49:21.141 --> 00:49:26.363
on the slides on the side,
what you see is the protein of

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:30.000
hair.
This is a polypeptide.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.356
It is a repeating unit here of
C-O, C-H, N-H,

00:49:34.356 --> 00:49:38.217
C-O, C-H, N-H again and again
and again.

00:49:38.217 --> 00:49:44.356
Here is another polypeptide or
another peptide strain with this

00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:47.722
repeating unit.
Well, what happens,

00:49:47.722 --> 00:49:53.663
when your hair is actually wet,
what happens is the hydrogens

00:49:53.663 --> 00:49:58.019
on the nitrogen,
you can see in that chain up

00:49:58.019 --> 00:50:02.910
there --
What happens is that they are

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.323
hydrogen bonded to water
molecules.

00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:11.643
And you can also see in the
second chain over that the

00:50:11.643 --> 00:50:17.063
oxygen on the carbon here is
hydrogen bonded to a water

00:50:17.063 --> 00:50:20.475
molecule.
When your hair is wet the

00:50:20.475 --> 00:50:27.000
actual polymers in your hair
kind of slip by each other.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.141
However, if you then take your
hair and you put it some very

00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:39.283
strange configuration and you
dry it, you remove these water

00:50:39.283 --> 00:50:44.176
molecules that are hydrogen
bonded to your hair,

00:50:44.176 --> 00:50:50.735
what happens then is that these
two chains now kind of lock into

00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:54.378
registry.
They kind of bond together

00:50:54.378 --> 00:51:00.000
because these water molecules
are gone here.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.509
And so now they hydrogen bond
to each other.

00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:10.067
The hydrogen bonds to the
oxygen on the CO and the two

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:15.310
chains are in registry.
And then, when you let your

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:19.820
form go, well,
your strands actually stay in

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:26.007
that registry for a little bit
until the humidity wipes that

00:51:26.007 --> 00:51:27.790
out.
Bad hair day.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:28.790
See on Friday.
