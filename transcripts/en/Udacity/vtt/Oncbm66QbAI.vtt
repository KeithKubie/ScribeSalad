00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.500
Firstly we'll need to update our parseAtlastDefinition function to take into

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.920
account if a sprite has been trimmed, using this data to modify the corner x and

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.478
corner y offset values. This is important because if you recall the coordinate

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:18.041
system of the canvas will place an image according to its top left corner. Well,

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:22.521
the trimming process in texture picker can move the top left corner to the new

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:26.764
trimmed location. As such, we need to refer to the trim data against the source

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:30.670
data to figure out what the proper offset is to draw the sprite in the correct

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.596
location. With this in mind you need to update the parse atlas definition to

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:38.500
take into account the differences between the framed version and the source

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.343
version to properly update the offset values so that the sprite draws in the

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:43.341
right location.
