a very quick intro before we do more

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
a very quick intro before we do more
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.449
a very quick intro before we do more
technical explanation so here you see

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459
technical explanation so here you see
 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.559
technical explanation so here you see

image and what what happened in many
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.979

games is the game is going to draw one

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
games is the game is going to draw one

frame frame number one here and at the
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.110
frame frame number one here and at the
end it's going to put it that that bar

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
end it's going to put it that that bar
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.729
end it's going to put it that that bar
is going to show the number of buffer

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739
is going to show the number of buffer
 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.240

here while while it's waiting for the
first frame to be displayed it's going

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
first frame to be displayed it's going
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.640
first frame to be displayed it's going
to draw a second frame which will get an

the game is not idle so it's going to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
the game is not idle so it's going to
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.350
the game is not idle so it's going to
start during the third frame which an

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360
start during the third frame which an

Android will also get uncute because

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459
Android will also get uncute because
 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.910
Android will also get uncute because
Android allows ripple buffering so right

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
Android allows ripple buffering so right
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.560
Android allows ripple buffering so right
now we have two buffering the queue

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570
now we have two buffering the queue
 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.539
now we have two buffering the queue
waiting to be displayed and when the

the next waiting frame number two is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350
the next waiting frame number two is
 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.099
the next waiting frame number two is
going to get displayed sorry

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109
going to get displayed sorry
 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.640
going to get displayed sorry
that's an interesting bit actually what

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
that's an interesting bit actually what
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.960
that's an interesting bit actually what
should happen is that you should start

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
should happen is that you should start
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.930
should happen is that you should start
during frame number four there however

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
during frame number four there however
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.520
during frame number four there however
it's going to get delayed until after

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
it's going to get delayed until after
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.920
it's going to get delayed until after
the vsync because you cannot acquire one

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930
the vsync because you cannot acquire one
 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.900
the vsync because you cannot acquire one
more buffer Android doesn't allow it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
more buffer Android doesn't allow it
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.099
more buffer Android doesn't allow it
it's only triple buffering so after the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109
it's only triple buffering so after the
 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.740
it's only triple buffering so after the
vsync frame number two is being

number three is still in the queue and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850
number three is still in the queue and
 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.059
number three is still in the queue and
you can start draw frame number four

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069
you can start draw frame number four
 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.759
you can start draw frame number four
because you can equate your one buffer

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769
because you can equate your one buffer
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.410
because you can equate your one buffer
at the end of the Ring frame number four

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420
at the end of the Ring frame number four

at the end of the Ring frame number four
it's going to get an queued and you are

it's going to get an queued and you are
in a constant state of triple buffering

in a constant state of triple buffering
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.819
in a constant state of triple buffering
right now so the next frame is going to

right now so the next frame is going to
 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.430
right now so the next frame is going to
be drawn after the vsync and you are

be drawn after the vsync and you are
 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.720
be drawn after the vsync and you are
going to incur it and you are in a

going to incur it and you are in a
 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.009
going to incur it and you are in a
constant state of triple buffering I

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019

guess the reason why it's bad is when

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689
guess the reason why it's bad is when
 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.990
guess the reason why it's bad is when
you start considering inputs and the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
you start considering inputs and the
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.610
you start considering inputs and the
user feeling of Latins

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620
user feeling of Latins
 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.620
user feeling of Latins
between when the user touched the screen

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
between when the user touched the screen
 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.210
between when the user touched the screen
on do something on when it happened on

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220
on do something on when it happened on
 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.760
on do something on when it happened on
the screen so let's overlay on that

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770
the screen so let's overlay on that
 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.780
the screen so let's overlay on that
these yellow orange bar this orange bar

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790
these yellow orange bar this orange bar
 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.030
these yellow orange bar this orange bar
represent the time when Android tell us

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040
represent the time when Android tell us
 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.120
represent the time when Android tell us
something some input happened it's

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130
something some input happened it's
 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.790
something some input happened it's
actually tightly coupled with everything

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
actually tightly coupled with everything
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.200
actually tightly coupled with everything
so it happened a little bit after the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210
so it happened a little bit after the
 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.760
so it happened a little bit after the
Java sync and if you look at the first

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770
Java sync and if you look at the first
 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.469
Java sync and if you look at the first
image and the first buffer and the ones

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479
image and the first buffer and the ones
 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.170
image and the first buffer and the ones
the draw one

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180
the draw one
 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.240
the draw one
well the input happen after the drone

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
well the input happen after the drone
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.129
well the input happen after the drone
has started so you can imagine the game

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139
has started so you can imagine the game
 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.750
has started so you can imagine the game
cannot really handle the input right

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760
cannot really handle the input right
 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.939
cannot really handle the input right
there so the game is actually going to

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949
there so the game is actually going to
 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.060
there so the game is actually going to
consume the input only next frame which

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070
consume the input only next frame which
 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.629
consume the input only next frame which
will then be rendered during that frame

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639
will then be rendered during that frame
 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.390
will then be rendered during that frame
which will be uncured which will be

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400
which will be uncured which will be
 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.270
which will be uncured which will be
consumed only in the next vessel so here

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280
consumed only in the next vessel so here
 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.610
consumed only in the next vessel so here
you are looking at a latency of one full

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620
you are looking at a latency of one full
 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.010
you are looking at a latency of one full
Vissing plus maybe 10 milliseconds which

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020
Vissing plus maybe 10 milliseconds which
 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.590
Vissing plus maybe 10 milliseconds which
is twenty six milliseconds latency it

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600
is twenty six milliseconds latency it
 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.379
is twenty six milliseconds latency it
wouldn't be terribly bad but if you look

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389
wouldn't be terribly bad but if you look
 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.090
wouldn't be terribly bad but if you look
at the case where the game is triple

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100
at the case where the game is triple
 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.379
at the case where the game is triple
buffering for example this one you start

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389
buffering for example this one you start
 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.969
buffering for example this one you start
seeing that between the time where you

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979
seeing that between the time where you
 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.360
seeing that between the time where you
receive the input and the time where it

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
receive the input and the time where it
 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.060
receive the input and the time where it
is uncute there is maybe around 18

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070
is uncute there is maybe around 18
 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.610
is uncute there is maybe around 18
milliseconds roughly there but it's

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
milliseconds roughly there but it's
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.029
milliseconds roughly there but it's
uncured it's not the next buffer to be

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039
uncured it's not the next buffer to be
 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.210
uncured it's not the next buffer to be
displayed it's actually the third the

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220
displayed it's actually the third the
 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.400
displayed it's actually the third the
second one so you are looking at a whole

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410
second one so you are looking at a whole
 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.680
second one so you are looking at a whole
end-to-end latency around 40

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.450
end-to-end latency around 40
milliseconds which start being

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460
milliseconds which start being
 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.760
milliseconds which start being
noticeable as players especially when

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770
noticeable as players especially when
 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.339

you look at a fast-paced action game

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349
you look at a fast-paced action game
 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.550
you look at a fast-paced action game
like roll star so what can we do well

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560
like roll star so what can we do well
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.120
like roll star so what can we do well
let's take a look first at sorry can we

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130
let's take a look first at sorry can we
 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.850
let's take a look first at sorry can we
switch to the to the laptop please hi

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860
switch to the to the laptop please hi
 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.420

let's take a look quickly at systrace so

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430
let's take a look quickly at systrace so
 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.480
let's take a look quickly at systrace so
when I was investigating this issue

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.550
sorry give me one second okay when I was

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560
sorry give me one second okay when I was
 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.719
sorry give me one second okay when I was
investigating this issue one thing I was

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729
investigating this issue one thing I was
 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.020
investigating this issue one thing I was
better

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030
better
 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.570
better
one thing I took really right away is a

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
one thing I took really right away is a
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.730
one thing I took really right away is a
systrace so from far away it looks

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740
systrace so from far away it looks
 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.719
systrace so from far away it looks
slightly scary I I'm going to try and

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729
slightly scary I I'm going to try and
 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.200
slightly scary I I'm going to try and
explain a bit what's happening there

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210
explain a bit what's happening there
 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.450
explain a bit what's happening there
okay so here at the top you can see the

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460
okay so here at the top you can see the
 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.659
okay so here at the top you can see the
CPU usage which you can see have some

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669
CPU usage which you can see have some
 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.360
CPU usage which you can see have some
spike on the bottom line that is pretty

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370
spike on the bottom line that is pretty
 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.020
spike on the bottom line that is pretty
constant there we can see details about

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030
constant there we can see details about
 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.999
constant there we can see details about
what's happening on each core but we

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009
what's happening on each core but we
 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.260
what's happening on each core but we
don't care too much about it

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270
don't care too much about it
 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.210
don't care too much about it
and then there is too is too interesting

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220
and then there is too is too interesting
 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.339
and then there is too is too interesting
between systrace the first one is

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349
between systrace the first one is
 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.140
between systrace the first one is
something called surface flinger you can

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
something called surface flinger you can
 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.029
something called surface flinger you can
see the name there that's a non right

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039
see the name there that's a non right
 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.339
see the name there that's a non right
process that is responsible for

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:07.349
 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.290
composing is the final image drawn on

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300
composing is the final image drawn on
 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.689
composing is the final image drawn on
the screen of your device so if you use

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699
the screen of your device so if you use
 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.540
the screen of your device so if you use
a normal app you will see that most of

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
a normal app you will see that most of
 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.129
a normal app you will see that most of
the time you have the UI of the app but

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139
the time you have the UI of the app but
 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.719
the time you have the UI of the app but
you also have the notification bar at

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729
you also have the notification bar at
 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.430
you also have the notification bar at
the top on some of their element on the

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440
the top on some of their element on the
 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.240
the top on some of their element on the
screen so sister a surface flinger is

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250
screen so sister a surface flinger is
 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.040
screen so sister a surface flinger is
the one that takes a notification bar

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050
the one that takes a notification bar
 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.260
the one that takes a notification bar
the image of the app put both of them

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270
the image of the app put both of them
 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.779
the image of the app put both of them
together on this plate on the screen so

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789
together on this plate on the screen so
 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.100
together on this plate on the screen so
we are going to look into a bit of the

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110
we are going to look into a bit of the
 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.300
we are going to look into a bit of the
detail of systrace later and at the

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310
detail of systrace later and at the
 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.610
detail of systrace later and at the
bottom here we have come the super cell

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620
bottom here we have come the super cell
 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.860
bottom here we have come the super cell
that brawl star which is the game i was

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870
that brawl star which is the game i was
 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.370
that brawl star which is the game i was
profiling there okay let's go back to

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380
profiling there okay let's go back to
 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.399
profiling there okay let's go back to
systrace a little bit and let's zoom a

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.409
systrace a little bit and let's zoom a
 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:51.360
systrace a little bit and let's zoom a
little bit so the cool part of this

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.370
little bit so the cool part of this
 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.490
little bit so the cool part of this
trace tool if you open it in Chrome or

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:53.500
trace tool if you open it in Chrome or
 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.700
trace tool if you open it in Chrome or
whatever you can navigate it the same

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.710
whatever you can navigate it the same
 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.790
whatever you can navigate it the same
way you navigate in a game so W&amp;S lets

00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800
way you navigate in a game so W&amp;S lets
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.670
way you navigate in a game so W&amp;S lets
you zoom in and out and a on D let you

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680
you zoom in and out and a on D let you
 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.760
you zoom in and out and a on D let you
go left and right which is convenient

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.770
go left and right which is convenient
 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.029
go left and right which is convenient
okay let's take a look here so the first

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039
okay let's take a look here so the first
 

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.450
okay let's take a look here so the first
thing to notice is this big grey on

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:12.460
thing to notice is this big grey on
 

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.540
thing to notice is this big grey on
white band our one frame D being

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:15.550
white band our one frame D being
 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.060
white band our one frame D being
displayed on the screen so if you try to

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.070
displayed on the screen so if you try to
 

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.270
displayed on the screen so if you try to
measure each of these is 16 milliseconds

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280
measure each of these is 16 milliseconds
 

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.620
measure each of these is 16 milliseconds
right it's running at 60 fps so yeah

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.630
right it's running at 60 fps so yeah
 

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.689
right it's running at 60 fps so yeah
and in surface flinger there is one line

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699
and in surface flinger there is one line
 

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:31.410
and in surface flinger there is one line
here

there is one buffer in the queue which
you can guess means we are triple

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.860
you can guess means we are triple

earlier okay and if we look a little bit

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.010

the end of that vsync here there is a
 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.310
the end of that vsync here there is a
whole lot of things that are happening

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320
whole lot of things that are happening
 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.700
whole lot of things that are happening
in in the UI thread so this whole lot of

in in the UI thread so this whole lot of
 

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.160
in in the UI thread so this whole lot of
things is what I was explaining it's if

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.170

we zoom a lot we can see do composition

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.570
we zoom a lot we can see do composition
 

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.440

here it's taking the different buffer

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:31.450
here it's taking the different buffer
 

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.350
here it's taking the different buffer
being displayed in the device and I'm

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360
being displayed in the device and I'm
 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.010

doing the composition to draw it on the

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.020
doing the composition to draw it on the
 

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.800
doing the composition to draw it on the
screen there is an interesting bit about

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:40.810
screen there is an interesting bit about
 

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:47.370
screen there is an interesting bit about
it if you look at that vsync here you

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:47.380
it if you look at that vsync here you
 

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.860
it if you look at that vsync here you
can see that our count of buffer in the

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:52.870
can see that our count of buffer in the
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.320
can see that our count of buffer in the
queue drop a little bit after the vsync

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.330
queue drop a little bit after the vsync
 

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.570
queue drop a little bit after the vsync
like about 500 microseconds the

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:00.580
like about 500 microseconds the
 

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.290
like about 500 microseconds the
interesting bit is naively when I looked

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.300
interesting bit is naively when I looked
 

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.820
interesting bit is naively when I looked
at it the first time I would believe

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:05.830
at it the first time I would believe
 

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.220
at it the first time I would believe
that drop would happen at the same time

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.230
that drop would happen at the same time
 

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.970
that drop would happen at the same time
as the vsync it's really interesting

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:11.980
as the vsync it's really interesting
 

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.880
as the vsync it's really interesting
because what it means is that that

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:14.890
because what it means is that that
 

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.980
because what it means is that that

so in that trace I did a little bit of

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:11.370
so in that trace I did a little bit of
 

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.010
so in that trace I did a little bit of
information about what's happening in

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.020
information about what's happening in
 

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.230
information about what's happening in
the game so you can see that at that

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240
the game so you can see that at that
 

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.550
the game so you can see that at that
time we are slapping buffer that the

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560
time we are slapping buffer that the
 

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.800
time we are slapping buffer that the
fare being swept is being drawn there

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:21.810
fare being swept is being drawn there
 

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.900
fare being swept is being drawn there
and the logic of the game is being

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:23.910
and the logic of the game is being
 

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.290
and the logic of the game is being
executed in the game update here the

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300
executed in the game update here the
 

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.300
executed in the game update here the
interesting bit is if I keep zooming a

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.310
interesting bit is if I keep zooming a
 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.600
interesting bit is if I keep zooming a
bit the game update here is using the

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:32.610
bit the game update here is using the
 

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.480
bit the game update here is using the
inputs that are delivered at that point

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:35.490
inputs that are delivered at that point
 

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:42.710
inputs that are delivered at that point
here so between that moment sorry

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720
here so between that moment sorry
 

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.210
here so between that moment sorry
between that moment when the frame was

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220
between that moment when the frame was
 

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:54.790
between that moment when the frame was
being drawn when it has been queued

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800
 

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.900
sorry okay

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:56.910
sorry okay
 

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.510
sorry okay
so it has been queued here it has been

00:13:59.510 --> 00:13:59.520
so it has been queued here it has been
 

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.820
so it has been queued here it has been
DQ'd there it will be rendered here on

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:01.830
DQ'd there it will be rendered here on
 

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.130
DQ'd there it will be rendered here on
the screen we are at about 32

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:04.140
the screen we are at about 32
 

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.170
the screen we are at about 32
milliseconds latency for the inputs

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180
milliseconds latency for the inputs
 

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.110
milliseconds latency for the inputs
which is pretty much the best at least I

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120
which is pretty much the best at least I
 

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.490
which is pretty much the best at least I
could I could find if we look back at

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500
could I could find if we look back at
 

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.770
could I could find if we look back at
the previous game and we try to look at

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:15.780
the previous game and we try to look at
 

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.360
the previous game and we try to look at
the same number okay here we have triple

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.370
the same number okay here we have triple
 

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.980
the same number okay here we have triple
buffering so let's take a look at this

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:21.990
buffering so let's take a look at this
 

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:29.000
buffering so let's take a look at this
one we have we we have our on draw frame

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.010
one we have we we have our on draw frame
 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:34.100
one we have we we have our on draw frame
happening here which is actually using

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.110
happening here which is actually using
 

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:39.080
happening here which is actually using
the input being delivered the previous

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.090
the input being delivered the previous
 

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.140
the input being delivered the previous
frame which happened around here and

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:41.150
frame which happened around here and
 

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:46.310
frame which happened around here and
then if I look at the queue it's being

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320
then if I look at the queue it's being
 

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.860
then if I look at the queue it's being
DQ'd this buffer that is enqueued there

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:51.870
DQ'd this buffer that is enqueued there
 

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.170
DQ'd this buffer that is enqueued there
at the top is not the one being DQ'd

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180
at the top is not the one being DQ'd
 

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.760
at the top is not the one being DQ'd
there it's the one being the queued at

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:55.770
there it's the one being the queued at
 

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.130
there it's the one being the queued at
the next frame which is actually being

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.140
the next frame which is actually being
 

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.650
the next frame which is actually being
rendered here so if I look at the

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660
rendered here so if I look at the
 

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.290
rendered here so if I look at the
overall input latency we were looking at

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300
overall input latency we were looking at
 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.890
overall input latency we were looking at
something around one too many

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:07.900
something around one too many
 

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.520
something around one too many
around 47 milliseconds so we dropped

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:11.530
around 47 milliseconds so we dropped
 

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.320
around 47 milliseconds so we dropped
about one frame of latency let's take a

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.330
about one frame of latency let's take a
 

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.060
about one frame of latency let's take a
look at how it looks in the game in the

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.070
look at how it looks in the game in the
 

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.680
look at how it looks in the game in the
end because well that's what player

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:19.690
end because well that's what player
 

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.540
end because well that's what player
experience is right I made a small video

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:24.550
experience is right I made a small video
 

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.060
experience is right I made a small video
I'm not really good at editing video so

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.070
I'm not really good at editing video so
 

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.150
I'm not really good at editing video so
it's not my primary skill I did the best

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160
it's not my primary skill I did the best
 

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.390
it's not my primary skill I did the best
so if you look very carefully it's

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.400
so if you look very carefully it's
 

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.340
so if you look very carefully it's
really clear obvious right now joking

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:35.350
really clear obvious right now joking
 

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.430
really clear obvious right now joking
I have a frame-by-frame thing happening

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
I have a frame-by-frame thing happening
 

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.200
I have a frame-by-frame thing happening
okay so look at the on the left here we

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.210
okay so look at the on the left here we
 

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.500
okay so look at the on the left here we
have our virtual joystick and there that

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:46.510
have our virtual joystick and there that
 

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.970
have our virtual joystick and there that
white circle is where the finger is or

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:50.980
white circle is where the finger is or
 

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.700
white circle is where the finger is or
pretty much it's actually displaying

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:53.710
pretty much it's actually displaying
 

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.170
pretty much it's actually displaying
we're on the rate sync the finger is so

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:58.180
we're on the rate sync the finger is so
 

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.150
we're on the rate sync the finger is so
I am going to put my mouse and that

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160
I am going to put my mouse and that
 

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.520
I am going to put my mouse and that
white circle and I'm going to move

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:02.530
white circle and I'm going to move
 

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.360
white circle and I'm going to move
forward by one frame so you can see my

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:06.370
forward by one frame so you can see my
 

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.080
forward by one frame so you can see my
mouse is still not and there's of the

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.090
mouse is still not and there's of the
 

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.540
mouse is still not and there's of the
virtual joystick if I move by one frame

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:12.550
virtual joystick if I move by one frame
 

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.500
virtual joystick if I move by one frame
more now I have the virtual joystick

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:16.510
more now I have the virtual joystick
 

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.200
more now I have the virtual joystick
under my mouse which means that I have

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.210
under my mouse which means that I have
 

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.560
under my mouse which means that I have
to frame latency between the user input

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:22.570
to frame latency between the user input
 

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.250
to frame latency between the user input
and the game reacting to it now if you

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:26.260
and the game reacting to it now if you
 

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.460
and the game reacting to it now if you
look at the right yeah

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.470
look at the right yeah
 

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.470
look at the right yeah
if you look here for example you have

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480
if you look here for example you have
 

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.010
if you look here for example you have
the that's after the fix so you have the

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:35.020
the that's after the fix so you have the
 

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.070
the that's after the fix so you have the
user finger being here and if I move by

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.080
user finger being here and if I move by
 

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.760
user finger being here and if I move by
one frame like the vercharged oh stick

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:41.770
one frame like the vercharged oh stick
 

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.320
one frame like the vercharged oh stick
is on it which means we have one frame

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:43.330
is on it which means we have one frame
 

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.270
is on it which means we have one frame
later on see in the display between the

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:45.280
later on see in the display between the
 

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.280
later on see in the display between the
user input and the display on the screen

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.290
user input and the display on the screen
 

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.260
user input and the display on the screen
it's also interesting if I move a little

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:49.270
it's also interesting if I move a little
 

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.540
it's also interesting if I move a little
bit forward or backward in time actually

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:53.550
bit forward or backward in time actually
 

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.020
bit forward or backward in time actually
sorry if you look here the distance

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.030
sorry if you look here the distance
 

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.810
sorry if you look here the distance
between the joystick and the finger is

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:00.820
between the joystick and the finger is
 

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.930
between the joystick and the finger is
quite big if you look at this one the

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:03.940
quite big if you look at this one the
 

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.650
quite big if you look at this one the
distance is quite quite a lot shorter

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660
distance is quite quite a lot shorter
 

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.090
distance is quite quite a lot shorter
sorry yeah it's quite a tad shorter

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.100
sorry yeah it's quite a tad shorter
 

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.150
sorry yeah it's quite a tad shorter
which means that like that's also

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160
which means that like that's also
 

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.730
which means that like that's also
translate into the the latency felt by

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:14.740
translate into the the latency felt by
 

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.220
translate into the the latency felt by
the user

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.230
 

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.439
yes that the result of the input latency

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:20.449
yes that the result of the input latency
 

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:25.900
yes that the result of the input latency
fix one frame less okay can we switch

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:25.910
fix one frame less okay can we switch
 

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:32.140
fix one frame less okay can we switch
back to the slide please we hop on back

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.150
back to the slide please we hop on back
 

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.770
back to the slide please we hop on back
to the yeah thank you oh yeah so that's

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:35.780
to the yeah thank you oh yeah so that's
 

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.370
to the yeah thank you oh yeah so that's
about it for my part and systrace and

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:39.380
about it for my part and systrace and
 

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.049
about it for my part and systrace and
dark art of systrace on how to

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:41.059
dark art of systrace on how to
 

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.630
dark art of systrace on how to
understand it if you have any question I

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640
understand it if you have any question I
 

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.130
understand it if you have any question I
am happy to chat after the talk I am

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.140
am happy to chat after the talk I am
 

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:54.180
am happy to chat after the talk I am
handing it back to Chris cool there you

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.190
handing it back to Chris cool there you
 

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.919
handing it back to Chris cool there you
actually did that water cool Thank You

00:17:59.919 --> 00:17:59.929
actually did that water cool Thank You
 

00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:08.470
actually did that water cool Thank You
Damian yeah yes this trace it's it can

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480
Damian yeah yes this trace it's it can
 

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.060
Damian yeah yes this trace it's it can
be a little bit frightening at first but

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.070
be a little bit frightening at first but
 

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.070
be a little bit frightening at first but
it's a really powerful tool for really

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080
it's a really powerful tool for really
 

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.980
it's a really powerful tool for really
optimizing the performance of your game

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:13.990
optimizing the performance of your game
 

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.930
optimizing the performance of your game
so it's all available I would encourage

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:16.940
so it's all available I would encourage
 

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.549
so it's all available I would encourage
looking into it if that's something that

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559
looking into it if that's something that
 

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.080
looking into it if that's something that
you're really interested in and really

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.090

really better
so moving on we're gonna move into

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.150
so moving on we're gonna move into
 

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.880
so moving on we're gonna move into
something a little more high-level and

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:27.890
something a little more high-level and
 

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.419
something a little more high-level and
this will be instant game referral

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:31.429
this will be instant game referral
 

00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:36.580
this will be instant game referral
tracking so they first talked a little

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:36.590
tracking so they first talked a little
 

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.919
tracking so they first talked a little
bit about why we would want to have

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:38.929
bit about why we would want to have
 

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:42.490
bit about why we would want to have
instant games anyways so the traditional

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:42.500
instant games anyways so the traditional
 

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.799
instant games anyways so the traditional
game install flow looks something like

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:44.809
game install flow looks something like
 

00:18:44.809 --> 00:18:47.350
game install flow looks something like
this there's a user acquisition event

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360
this there's a user acquisition event
 

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.919
this there's a user acquisition event
like somebody clicks on an ad they click

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:50.929
like somebody clicks on an ad they click
 

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.140
like somebody clicks on an ad they click

big banner at the top install and this

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880
big banner at the top install and this
 

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.970
big banner at the top install and this
is great the player wants to try and

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:57.980
is great the player wants to try and
 

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.400
is great the player wants to try and
play your game the idea is they try it

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.410
play your game the idea is they try it
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.870
play your game the idea is they try it
they find it really exciting and they

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880
they find it really exciting and they
 

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.340
they find it really exciting and they
want a player or they go into and and

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.350
want a player or they go into and and
 

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.610
want a player or they go into and and
play right but now they have to install

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:06.620
play right but now they have to install
 

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.100
play right but now they have to install
now that's actually a lot of friction

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.110
now that's actually a lot of friction
 

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.169
now that's actually a lot of friction
right there you know could be up to a

00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:11.179
right there you know could be up to a
 

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:13.210
right there you know could be up to a
100 megabyte download there and maybe

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.220
100 megabyte download there and maybe
 

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.610
100 megabyte download there and maybe
they're on not on Wi-Fi maybe on mobiles

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:15.620
they're on not on Wi-Fi maybe on mobiles
 

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.100
they're on not on Wi-Fi maybe on mobiles
somewhere and if you're a game developer

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.110
somewhere and if you're a game developer
 

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.169
somewhere and if you're a game developer
I'm sure you all really know that really

00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:20.179
I'm sure you all really know that really
 

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:23.560
I'm sure you all really know that really
the end result is that often just

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.570
the end result is that often just
 

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.900
the end result is that often just
getting an install can be the challenge

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:25.910
getting an install can be the challenge
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.399
getting an install can be the challenge
you know that once they play the game

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:27.409
you know that once they play the game
 

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:29.110
you know that once they play the game
they'll love it but you can't even get

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120
they'll love it but you can't even get
 

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.460
they'll love it but you can't even get
to that point

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.470
to that point
 

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.919
to that point
so this is where instant games come in

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:32.929
so this is where instant games come in
 

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:35.230

now and the instant game is the is the

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.129
now and the instant game is the is the
 

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.639
now and the instant game is the is the
is where you prompt the player to

00:20:15.639 --> 00:20:15.649
is where you prompt the player to
 

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.529
is where you prompt the player to
actually install the game but this is

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:17.539
actually install the game but this is
 

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:18.879
actually install the game but this is
after they've had a chance to really

00:20:18.879 --> 00:20:18.889
after they've had a chance to really
 

00:20:18.889 --> 00:20:21.249
after they've had a chance to really
experience it and really enjoy the game

00:20:21.249 --> 00:20:21.259
experience it and really enjoy the game
 

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:22.990
experience it and really enjoy the game
and really this is why you've made the

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000
and really this is why you've made the
 

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.060
and really this is why you've made the
game in the first place once they

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.070
game in the first place once they
 

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.680
game in the first place once they
actually decide that they want to try it

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:26.690
actually decide that they want to try it
 

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.440
actually decide that they want to try it
then you do the install then you

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:29.450
then you do the install then you
 

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.509
then you do the install then you
actually prompt them the game begins to

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:31.519
actually prompt them the game begins to
 

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:33.669
actually prompt them the game begins to
download but you know it doesn't matter

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679
download but you know it doesn't matter
 

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:35.049
download but you know it doesn't matter
so much at this point because you've

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:35.059
so much at this point because you've
 

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:37.119
so much at this point because you've
already gotten the player involved and

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:37.129
already gotten the player involved and
 

00:20:37.129 --> 00:20:38.950
already gotten the player involved and
they're already really committed to it

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960
they're already really committed to it
 

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.430
they're already really committed to it
now as I'm talking about this this is

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440
now as I'm talking about this this is
 

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.680
now as I'm talking about this this is
obviously about optimizing user

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:44.690
obviously about optimizing user
 

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.680
obviously about optimizing user
acquisition and I'm sure that you all

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:47.690
acquisition and I'm sure that you all
 

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.970
acquisition and I'm sure that you all
know if you've done any user acquisition

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:48.980
know if you've done any user acquisition
 

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.970
know if you've done any user acquisition
that a key part of this is knowing your

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:51.980
that a key part of this is knowing your
 

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.009
that a key part of this is knowing your
analytics knowing your metrics how

00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:54.019
analytics knowing your metrics how
 

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.330
analytics knowing your metrics how
effective are your different ad

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.340
effective are your different ad
 

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.369
effective are your different ad
campaigns knowing where your sources of

00:20:57.369 --> 00:20:57.379
campaigns knowing where your sources of
 

00:20:57.379 --> 00:20:59.950
campaigns knowing where your sources of
those clicks are but the issue is that

00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960
those clicks are but the issue is that
 

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.840
those clicks are but the issue is that
when you if you have an instant game

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:01.850
when you if you have an instant game
 

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.570
when you if you have an instant game
just naively the game will not know

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:04.580
just naively the game will not know
 

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.190
just naively the game will not know
where that source is because there's

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200
where that source is because there's
 

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.830
where that source is because there's
that intervening step and so if you look

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840
that intervening step and so if you look
 

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.440
that intervening step and so if you look
at the game from its point of view it

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:11.450
at the game from its point of view it
 

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.869
at the game from its point of view it
doesn't know where the source is however

00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:13.879
doesn't know where the source is however
 

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:17.919
doesn't know where the source is however
there's a way to fix this and that is

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:17.929
there's a way to fix this and that is
 

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:20.529
there's a way to fix this and that is
forwarding the referral from the instant

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:20.539
forwarding the referral from the instant
 

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:24.430
forwarding the referral from the instant
game so as it turns out the instant game

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440
game so as it turns out the instant game
 

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.740
game so as it turns out the instant game
gets the same referral information that

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:26.750
gets the same referral information that
 

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.710
gets the same referral information that
a regular game install would so the

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720
a regular game install would so the
 

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.200
a regular game install would so the
problem or really the issue is at that

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.210
problem or really the issue is at that
 

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.879
problem or really the issue is at that
point you just have to collect that data

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:33.889
point you just have to collect that data
 

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:36.190
point you just have to collect that data
and somehow get that to the full game

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200
and somehow get that to the full game
 

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.460
and somehow get that to the full game
and this is how it's done so you first

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:39.470
and this is how it's done so you first
 

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.279
and this is how it's done so you first
buy you first collect the referral data

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:42.289
buy you first collect the referral data
 

00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:43.640
buy you first collect the referral data
by adding the

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:43.650
by adding the
 

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.580
by adding the
code to the instant games on create and

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:46.590
code to the instant games on create and
 

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.620
code to the instant games on create and
you can see we get the intent you know

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:48.630
you can see we get the intent you know
 

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.600
you can see we get the intent you know
we do a little processing about it then

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:50.610
we do a little processing about it then
 

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.700
we do a little processing about it then
at the bottom you pull the parameters

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:52.710
at the bottom you pull the parameters

parts first of all can the binary be

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:03.870
parts first of all can the binary be
 

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.920
parts first of all can the binary be
trusted in particular did the binary

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:06.930
trusted in particular did the binary
 

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.710

come from somewhere that I trust is it

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720
come from somewhere that I trust is it
 

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.230
come from somewhere that I trust is it
from a known source and the second part

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240
from a known source and the second part
 

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.570
from a known source and the second part
is can the device itself be trusted

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580
is can the device itself be trusted
 

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.030
is can the device itself be trusted
because obviously if you're just

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980
your game and let me talk a little bit
 

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.770
your game and let me talk a little bit
more about how this is a licensing works

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:57.780
more about how this is a licensing works
 

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.370
more about how this is a licensing works
like this say you have a game and you

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380
like this say you have a game and you
 

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.710
like this say you have a game and you
want to know did this game was this apk

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720
want to know did this game was this apk
 

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.850

check and this is a little bit more

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:09.780
check and this is a little bit more
 

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.530

antah station API back-end now this

00:27:59.840 --> 00:27:59.850
antah station API back-end now this
 

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.720
antah station API back-end now this
back-end has a lot of different signals

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:02.730
back-end has a lot of different signals
 

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.390
back-end has a lot of different signals
and ways of checking if the device

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400
and ways of checking if the device
 

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.120
and ways of checking if the device
itself has been compromised or if it's

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.130
itself has been compromised or if it's

uses all these different signals to
basically return back to you it says

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220
basically return back to you it says
 

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.649
basically return back to you it says
this device is good

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659
this device is good
 

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:22.070
this device is good
or maybe it isn't so good whatever that

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080
or maybe it isn't so good whatever that
 

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.200
or maybe it isn't so good whatever that
response is gets sent back to the safety

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.210
response is gets sent back to the safety
 

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.889
response is gets sent back to the safety
net assay Station API which then comes

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:27.899
net assay Station API which then comes
 

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:31.580
net assay Station API which then comes
back to the game itself for to back onto

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:31.590
back to the game itself for to back onto
 

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.919
back to the game itself for to back onto
the back end now the back end here is

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:33.929
the back end now the back end here is
 

00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:36.499
the back end now the back end here is
going to then check to see whether or

00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:36.509
going to then check to see whether or
 

00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:38.450
going to then check to see whether or
not this this is where you actually

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460
not this this is where you actually
 

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.219
not this this is where you actually
you're checking the response here like I

00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:40.229
you're checking the response here like I
 

00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:41.930
you're checking the response here like I
said you don't want to chest trust the

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940
said you don't want to chest trust the
 

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.619
said you don't want to chest trust the
device just yet so if you have a Valadez

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:45.629
device just yet so if you have a Valadez
 

00:28:45.629 --> 00:28:48.289
device just yet so if you have a Valadez
sensation and the nonce manses now the

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299
sensation and the nonce manses now the
 

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.779
sensation and the nonce manses now the
reason you have that nonce is to protect

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:50.789
reason you have that nonce is to protect
 

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:52.879
reason you have that nonce is to protect
against replay attacks because there

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:52.889
against replay attacks because there
 

00:28:52.889 --> 00:28:55.549
against replay attacks because there
could be a hack for example that takes a

00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559
could be a hack for example that takes a
 

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:57.769
could be a hack for example that takes a
valid attestation and responds back and

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779
valid attestation and responds back and
 

00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:59.299
valid attestation and responds back and
says hey where everything's good even

00:28:59.299 --> 00:28:59.309
says hey where everything's good even
 

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:01.460
says hey where everything's good even
though it isn't however they won't have

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:01.470
though it isn't however they won't have
 

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.169
though it isn't however they won't have
the correct nonce that you have attached

00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179
the correct nonce that you have attached
 

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:04.879
the correct nonce that you have attached
for that and that's is why you initiate

00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:04.889
for that and that's is why you initiate
 

00:29:04.889 --> 00:29:06.710
for that and that's is why you initiate
that from the back end you will also

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720
that from the back end you will also
 

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.210
that from the back end you will also
want to check few other things like time

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220
want to check few other things like time
 

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.919
want to check few other things like time
stamps you know just in case something

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:09.929
stamps you know just in case something
 

00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:11.960
stamps you know just in case something
else is there's a few other checks that

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:11.970
else is there's a few other checks that
 

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.060
else is there's a few other checks that
you put into there but assuming

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:14.070
you put into there but assuming
 

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.839
you put into there but assuming
everything works out says good let's the

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:17.849
everything works out says good let's the
 

00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:20.060
everything works out says good let's the
player into the game so this is how

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.070
player into the game so this is how
 

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:25.039
player into the game so this is how
safety net integrity check works so how

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:25.049
safety net integrity check works so how
 

00:29:25.049 --> 00:29:26.359
safety net integrity check works so how
does this work in the real life and how

00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:26.369
does this work in the real life and how
 

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:27.979
does this work in the real life and how
can you use this to try your game so I

00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:27.989
can you use this to try your game so I
 

00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:30.070
can you use this to try your game so I
have a couple interesting cases here the

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080
have a couple interesting cases here the
 

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.190
have a couple interesting cases here the
first is from Rovio now Rovio is a game

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200
first is from Rovio now Rovio is a game
 

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.859
first is from Rovio now Rovio is a game
named Angry Birds 2 which maybe you've

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:36.869
named Angry Birds 2 which maybe you've
 

00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:37.729
named Angry Birds 2 which maybe you've
heard of

00:29:37.729 --> 00:29:37.739
heard of
 

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:41.119
heard of
now obviously Angry Birds 2 huge game

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:41.129
now obviously Angry Birds 2 huge game
 

00:29:41.129 --> 00:29:43.879
now obviously Angry Birds 2 huge game
global worldwide and it also has a

00:29:43.879 --> 00:29:43.889
global worldwide and it also has a
 

00:29:43.889 --> 00:29:46.969
global worldwide and it also has a
global leader board now you're thinking

00:29:46.969 --> 00:29:46.979
global leader board now you're thinking
 

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:48.769
global leader board now you're thinking
is a popular game and it has a

00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779
is a popular game and it has a
 

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:50.089
is a popular game and it has a
leaderboard that everyone in the world

00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:50.099
leaderboard that everyone in the world
 

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:52.700
leaderboard that everyone in the world
to see has wants to see there are going

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:52.710
to see has wants to see there are going
 

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.919
to see has wants to see there are going
to be a lot of attacks on this

00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:54.929
to be a lot of attacks on this
 

00:29:54.929 --> 00:29:56.539
to be a lot of attacks on this
leaderboard because a lot of people want

00:29:56.539 --> 00:29:56.549
leaderboard because a lot of people want
 

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:57.889
leaderboard because a lot of people want
to cheat and get their name on the top

00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899
to cheat and get their name on the top
 

00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:01.399
to cheat and get their name on the top
of that leaderboard so Rovio was seeing

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:01.409
of that leaderboard so Rovio was seeing
 

00:30:01.409 --> 00:30:03.229
of that leaderboard so Rovio was seeing
a lot of attacks coming in and there

00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:03.239
a lot of attacks coming in and there
 

00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:06.229
a lot of attacks coming in and there
were two main ways of attacking the

00:30:06.229 --> 00:30:06.239
were two main ways of attacking the
 

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:08.509
were two main ways of attacking the
leaderboard that they saw the first was

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519
leaderboard that they saw the first was
 

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:11.570
leaderboard that they saw the first was
tampered a be case modified apks

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580
tampered a be case modified apks
 

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.099
tampered a be case modified apks
somewhere that people were side loading

00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:13.109
somewhere that people were side loading
 

00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:15.830
somewhere that people were side loading
and the second one was a memory attack

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840
and the second one was a memory attack
 

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.469
and the second one was a memory attack
and accessed to the memory of the game

00:30:18.469 --> 00:30:18.479
and accessed to the memory of the game
 

00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:20.719
and accessed to the memory of the game
now this is only possible on a rooted

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:20.729
now this is only possible on a rooted
 

00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:24.560
now this is only possible on a rooted
device so this is a perfect use case for

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.570
device so this is a perfect use case for
 

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.749
device so this is a perfect use case for
safety net which is checking to see if

00:30:26.749 --> 00:30:26.759
safety net which is checking to see if
 

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:28.489
safety net which is checking to see if
the device has been rooted or not

00:30:28.489 --> 00:30:28.499
the device has been rooted or not
 

00:30:28.499 --> 00:30:29.810
the device has been rooted or not
because if it's been rooted then you

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820
because if it's been rooted then you
 

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.919
because if it's been rooted then you
can't really trust to see it try

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:31.929
can't really trust to see it try
 

00:30:31.929 --> 00:30:33.720
can't really trust to see it try
that the device is really as it always

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:33.730
that the device is really as it always
 

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.249
that the device is really as it always
was maybe there was a custom ROM or

00:30:35.249 --> 00:30:35.259
was maybe there was a custom ROM or
 

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:38.970
was maybe there was a custom ROM or
something else so Rovio in implemented

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:38.980
something else so Rovio in implemented
 

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:44.399
something else so Rovio in implemented
safety net add a station API and the

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:44.409
safety net add a station API and the
 

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.799
safety net add a station API and the
results were pretty good for them what

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:46.809
results were pretty good for them what
 

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:49.169
results were pretty good for them what
they saw was first of all right off the

their leaderboard I mean if you think

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:54.730
their leaderboard I mean if you think
 

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.299
their leaderboard I mean if you think
about it that's 40% fewer attacks you

00:30:57.299 --> 00:30:57.309
about it that's 40% fewer attacks you
 

00:30:57.309 --> 00:30:59.700
about it that's 40% fewer attacks you
have to defend against it's a much more

00:30:59.700 --> 00:30:59.710
have to defend against it's a much more
 

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.700
have to defend against it's a much more
safer environment for their game it's

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:02.710
safer environment for their game it's
 

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.930
safer environment for their game it's
less that they have to work on whoops

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:03.940
less that they have to work on whoops
 

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.820
less that they have to work on whoops

their resource management as far as
 

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:12.149
their resource management as far as
managing the game it's less effort for

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159
managing the game it's less effort for
 

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:13.889

all what they saw were there was a

00:31:15.989 --> 00:31:15.999
all what they saw were there was a
 

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:18.029
all what they saw were there was a
higher degree of spenders in their top

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039
higher degree of spenders in their top
 

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:20.489
higher degree of spenders in their top
leaderboard which if you think about

00:31:20.489 --> 00:31:20.499
leaderboard which if you think about
 

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:22.259
leaderboard which if you think about
this makes sense and this is really what

00:31:22.259 --> 00:31:22.269
this makes sense and this is really what
 

00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:23.759
this makes sense and this is really what
they wanted to see because you don't

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:23.769
they wanted to see because you don't
 

00:31:23.769 --> 00:31:25.379
they wanted to see because you don't
want to see hackers in the top of the

want to see hackers in the top of the
 

00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:26.549
want to see hackers in the top of the

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.460
who are there you know don't really care
about the game they just want to show

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:29.470
about the game they just want to show
 

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.560
about the game they just want to show
off like hey I'm great at this instead

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:31.570
off like hey I'm great at this instead
 

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.600
off like hey I'm great at this instead
the leaderboard was actually showing

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:33.610
the leaderboard was actually showing
 

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.060
the leaderboard was actually showing
real players people who were really

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.070
real players people who were really

those are the ones that you would expect

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:39.580
those are the ones that you would expect
 

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.310
those are the ones that you would expect
to actually be on the leaderboard and

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320
to actually be on the leaderboard and
 

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.249
to actually be on the leaderboard and
that's actually what Rovio got so as a

00:31:44.249 --> 00:31:44.259
that's actually what Rovio got so as a
 

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:46.289
that's actually what Rovio got so as a
result it really helped the game and

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:46.299
result it really helped the game and
 

00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:47.489
result it really helped the game and
help their community help their

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:47.499
help their community help their
 

00:31:47.499 --> 00:31:49.950
help their community help their
leaderboard or help the the ecosystem of

their game they were very very happy

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:51.850
their game they were very very happy
 

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:57.570
their game they were very very happy
with the results and then finally for

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:57.580
with the results and then finally for
 

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.830
with the results and then finally for
the last case I wanted to talk about

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840
the last case I wanted to talk about
 

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.919
the last case I wanted to talk about
today which is reducing beta leakage

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:01.929
today which is reducing beta leakage
 

00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:04.230
today which is reducing beta leakage

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.730
with app licensing and safety net
together now first of all what is beta

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:08.740
together now first of all what is beta
 

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.659
together now first of all what is beta
leakage so some people call it beta some

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:12.669
leakage so some people call it beta some
 

00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:15.239
leakage so some people call it beta some
call it a soft launch but the idea is

00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:15.249
call it a soft launch but the idea is
 

00:32:15.249 --> 00:32:17.310
call it a soft launch but the idea is
before you do your full launch before

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320
before you do your full launch before
 

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.930
before you do your full launch before
you gave it out to they give your game

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:18.940
you gave it out to they give your game
 

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.549
you gave it out to they give your game
out to the rest of the world you might

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559
out to the rest of the world you might
 

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:22.919
out to the rest of the world you might
want to try a limited release a soft

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:22.929
want to try a limited release a soft
 

00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:25.230
want to try a limited release a soft
launch where you have a fewer maybe a

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240
launch where you have a fewer maybe a
 

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.180
launch where you have a fewer maybe a
few territories where people are trying

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:27.190
few territories where people are trying
 

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.070
few territories where people are trying
out the game you start getting feedback

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080
out the game you start getting feedback
 

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.930
out the game you start getting feedback
on it you start getting some information

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:30.940
on it you start getting some information
 

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.970
on it you start getting some information
about the resources used by the game

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:32.980
about the resources used by the game
 

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.889
about the resources used by the game
maybe how many servers you need for it

00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:34.899
maybe how many servers you need for it
 

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:36.600
maybe how many servers you need for it
and so on and kind of see if the game is

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:36.610
and so on and kind of see if the game is
 

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.369
and so on and kind of see if the game is
actually working like you think so

00:32:38.369 --> 00:32:38.379
actually working like you think so
 

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:39.629
actually working like you think so
that's what your beta is but you want to

00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639
that's what your beta is but you want to
 

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:40.889
that's what your beta is but you want to
keep it limited you don't want it

00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:40.899
keep it limited you don't want it
 

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:42.450
keep it limited you don't want it
everyone out there because your game

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:42.460
everyone out there because your game
 

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.249
everyone out there because your game
wellit's this isn't really ready for the

full world
 

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:48.390
full world
but beta leakage is when that doesn't

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:48.400
but beta leakage is when that doesn't
 

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.159
but beta leakage is when that doesn't
happen where instead of having a few

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:50.169
happen where instead of having a few
 

00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:51.720
happen where instead of having a few
territories playing the game now you

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:51.730
territories playing the game now you
 

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:53.520
territories playing the game now you
have people from everywhere playing the

have people from everywhere playing the
 

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.130
have people from everywhere playing the

game and this can be really bad for your
 

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.840
game and this can be really bad for your
game management because now all of your

game management because now all of your
 

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.870

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.460
behavior of your audience are going to
be completely out of whack from what you

their beta users came from non beta
 

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.680
their beta users came from non beta
countries because they're able to see

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:43.690
countries because they're able to see
 

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.880
countries because they're able to see
where these players were playing

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:44.890
where these players were playing
 

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.070
where these players were playing
normally but in this case now when they

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080
normally but in this case now when they
 

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.510
normally but in this case now when they
want to play the beta son later and

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:48.520
want to play the beta son later and
 

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.130
want to play the beta son later and
they're able to play even though they're

they're able to play even though they're
 

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.669
they're able to play even though they're
not in that place and the reason for

not in that place and the reason for
 

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.649
not in that place and the reason for
this is that well Android is really open

00:33:55.649 --> 00:33:55.659
this is that well Android is really open
 

00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:57.630
this is that well Android is really open
is that's very cool I mean that's one of

straightforward you can pull an apk you

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:04.929
straightforward you can pull an apk you
 

00:34:04.929 --> 00:34:06.960
straightforward you can pull an apk you
can share it around distribute to your

and this is where app licensing comes in

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:23.830
and this is where app licensing comes in
 

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.090
and this is where app licensing comes in
and safety net so as I mentioned sharing

about this and for me this was actually

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:36.609
about this and for me this was actually
 

00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:38.579
about this and for me this was actually
the first time I'd seen a developer used

00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:38.589
the first time I'd seen a developer used
 

00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:40.290

case so if you have a game that's coming

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960
case so if you have a game that's coming
 

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.970

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:47.700
keeping it only in a certain region this
is something I would actually take a

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:47.710
is something I would actually take a
 

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:54.720
is something I would actually take a
look at so finally just kind of recover

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:54.730
