00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.530
- I'm Kim Kutz Elliott, and I work

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.230
on humanities content at Khan Academy.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.970
So I thought about things
that were really difficult

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.160
for me, and one thing that was hard for me

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.390
was class discussion, because I went

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.210
to this history class and
I swear that every other

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.990
person in that class had like
read every history book ever.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
And I don't know how they
did it, but I was convinced

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.900
that I was an imposter,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.150
I did not belong in this class. (laughs)

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.829
Everyone else was just
completely brilliant,

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.040
and you know, they would sit around

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.790
and discuss these ideas and
they were kind of vicious,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.900
you know, say like oh,
this text book is wrong.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.137
This person has a terrible argument.

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:47.030
And I'd be sitting there thinking

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.270
I haven't even read a text book,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.593
like that's a pretty big deal. (laughs)

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.670
So I was just, I think
I was just terrified

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.470
to open my mouth in this class

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.653
and kinda reveal to everyone
that I didn't belong there.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.870
And so I went to a teacher
who was a mentor to me

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.882
and I said, everybody's so mean.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:17.257
I'm not this mean, and
he said to me, you know,

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.867
"It's okay to be the person who says,

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:21.987
"what can we learn from this,

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:26.527
"and it's okay to be the person
who wants to take something

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:29.147
"positive away from this class."
