00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.093
 [applause] 

00:00:16.073 --> 00:00:20.046
 Pausch: Allow me to deserve it. 

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:21.046
 This is-- 

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:23.076
 man: LEFT IT. 

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:26.023
 Pausch: It's great to be here. 

00:00:26.023 --> 00:00:28.043
 What Indira did not tell you was this series of lectures 

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:30.039
 once called "Last Lecture." 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.080
 If he could hold the last lecture before his death, 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.010
 what would it be? 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.096
 I thought, "Damn, just when you mastered the subject, 

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.080
 they renamed it. " 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.013
 So, in case someone has just jumped in 

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:43.050
 and he does not know the whole story 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.086
 my father taught me, 

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.000
 When the "elephant in the room" (obvious questionnaire) to meet people with him. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.043
 If you look at my roentgen shots, 

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:51.056
 you can see that there are about ten tumors in my liver, 

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:53.003
 and the doctors predicted me 

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.000
 three to six months of healthy quality of life. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.026
 It was a month ago, so now you know how the account is. 

00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:01.066
 I have some of the best doctors in the world. 

00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.510
 So that's how it is. 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.520
 We can not change that, and we can only decide 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.560
 how will we react to that. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.543
 We can not change the maps that are shared, 

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:21.560
 but the only way we can play them. 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.543
 If I do not act depressively or madly as I should, 

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:26.570
 I'm sorry to disappoint you. 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.546
 [laughter] 

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:31.563
 And believe me, I'm not in the stage of denial. 

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:33.566
 Not that I'm unaware of what is happening. 

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:37.503
 My family, my three children and my wife, we just moved. 

00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:39.580
 We bought a lovely house in Chesapeake, Virginia, 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.520
 near Norfolk, and we did it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.536
 because it's a better place 

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.573
 for the family, on the road that expects us. 

00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:45.590
 And another thing 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.566
 I'm feeling really healthy right now. 

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.596
 I want to tell you how big it is 

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:51.536
 the cognitive dislocation that you will ever see 

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:53.593
 Just the fact I'm in really good shape. 

00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:58.500
 Actually, in a better state than most of you. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.593
 [applause] 

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:11.533
 So, anyone who wants to cry or complain to me 

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:12.593
 you can go free and make a couple of these, 

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:14.550
 and then you can complain. 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.536
 [laughter] 

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.540
 All right, well, what we are not going to talk about today, 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.533
 We will not talk about cancer, 

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.523
 because I spent a lot of time talking about it, 

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:23.556
 and really lost interest in it. 

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:25.540
 If you know any herbal remedies or herbal remedies, 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.553
 please, stay away from me. 

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:28.506
 [laughter] 

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:29.563
 And we will not talk about things 

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:30.576
 which are more important 

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:32.546
 from realizing their own baby dreams. 

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:33.593
 We will not talk about my wife. 

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:35.586
 We will not talk about my children, because I am well controlled, 

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:36.596
 but not good enough 

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:38.550
 to talk about it and not to break emotionally. 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.526
 So we'll just get things out of the agenda. 

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.536
 These things are just too important. 

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:45.506
 And we will not talk about spirituality and religion. 

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.596
 Although I will admit to you how I did 

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:49.526
 fearful transformation. 

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:50.586
 I just bought a Macintosh computer. 

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:53.580
 [applause] 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.530
 Well, I knew that I would win 9% of the audience. 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.550
 Okay, so what are we going to talk about today? 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.553
 About my baby dreams and how I did them-- 

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:12.543
 I was very happy about that question-- 

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:14.560
 as I think I was able to realize those dreams-- 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.563
 how could I realize the dreams of others, 

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.583
 and to a certain extent, the lessons learned from that-- 

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:20.596
 I am a professor; 

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.509
 There should therefore be some lessons learned-- 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.576
 and how you can use the things you will hear today 

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:28.550
 to achieve your own dreams or help to realize the dreams of others. 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.500
 How are you going to get married, you might know 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.570
 how is the potential of other people's dreams 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.590
 even more fun. 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.583
 So what were my baby dreams? 

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.530
 You know, I had a really nice childhood, 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.583
 I mean, without teasing. 

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:42.523
 I looked at the old archive of family pictures, 

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.506
 And what was really amazing, 

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.509
 I could not find my child's picture 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.546
 where I did not smile, okay? 

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:53.583
 That was such a pleasant thing 

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:56.540
 Here are pictures of our dog, right? 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.593
 Aaa, thank you. 

00:03:58.593 --> 00:04:01.590
 and here is a picture that really sees me as I dream. 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.513
 [laughter] 

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:05.553
 And I did it a lot. 

00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:09.509
 Many times, "awakening moments," you know? 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.526
 and that was the time when it was easy to dream imaginatively. 

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:16.509
 I was born in 1960, okay? 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.596
 When you are eight or nine years old 

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:20.576
 and you look at the TV screen and see people coming down to the moon, 

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:22.583
 everything is possible, 

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:26.519
 and there is also something that should not be diverted from the mind, 

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.556
 that is inspiration 

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:31.526
 and the permission to imagine a big deal. 

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.519
 So what were my baby dreams? 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.593
 You may not agree with this list, but I was there. 

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.573
 [laughter] 

00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:39.513
 Being in the best state, 

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:40.590
 Play American Football in the National League 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.563
 Being the author of the article in the "WORLD BOOK" encyclopedia-- 

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:45.539
 It seems that dumplings can be recognized early-- 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.586
 [laughter] 

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.563
 Being Captain Kirk. 

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:51.543
 Is anyone else here having this baby's dream? 

00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:53.566
 Not on CMU, No. 

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.533
 I wanted to become a jumbo of those guys 

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:57.550
 who conquer large plush animals at the parties, 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.580
 And I wanted to work as a creator of attraction (so-called Imagineer) at Disney Park. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.563
 These dreams are not sorted in a particular order, 

00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:03.550
 Although I think that somehow this is becoming more difficult to achieve, 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.580
 except maybe the first one. 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.573
 OK, so be in the best condition. 

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.553
 It's important to note here, how important it is to have specific dreams. 

00:05:09.553 --> 00:05:11.500
 I did not dream of being an astronaut, 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.586
 because I was already wearing a pair of glasses, 

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:14.593
 and they said to me, "Oh, the astronauts can not wear glasses." 

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:16.546
 And my reaction was, "Hm, so I did not want it 

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:19.506
 the whole astronaut performance; I just wanted to float. " 

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:21.550
 And - I'm like a kid-- 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.516
 [laughter] 

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:28.530
 Prototype variant 0.0. 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.556
 It did not work so well, but it turned out as NASA 

00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:35.536
 there is something called the Blind Comet 

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:36.593
 and that plane serves to attract astronauts, 

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:39.563
 This thing in the air performs arches in the form of parables, 

00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:40.596
 and at the top of each port, 

00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:42.586
 There is a time of 25 seconds moving ballistic 

00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:46.500
 and it hurts to get the condition alike to the bumblebee 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.519
 and it takes about 25 seconds. 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.530
 And there is a program for which university students 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.553
 can submit requests, 

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:56.573
 and if they win in the competition, they have the opportunity to fly, 

00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:58.523
 so I thought it was cool. 

00:05:58.523 --> 00:05:59.593
 And we had a team. We have teamed up, 

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:01.543
 who defeated them, and they were able to flee, 

00:06:01.543 --> 00:06:04.566
 I was totally excited to go with them ... 

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:06.576
 And then I ran to the first wall, 

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.530
 Because they made it very clear 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.593
 as in any situation to members who carry out faculty activities 

00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:14.519
 he can not let him fly with the dunes 

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.596
 I know. My heart was broken, you know. 

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:21.563
 I was in a situation where you are thinking, "But I worked so hard." 

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:24.566
 And so I went to study the rules very carefully, 

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:26.546
 to turn out that NASA-- 

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:29.516
 owns a program of its own publicity and openness to the media, 

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:31.560
 and it turns out that the students are consequently laughing 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.523
 with him take local journalists from the local city. 

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:38.513
 [laughter] 

00:06:43.543 --> 00:06:46.519
 Randy Pausch, Web Journalist. 

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.573
 It's really easy to get a PRESS card. 

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.510
 So I called people in NASA, and said, 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.593
 "I need to know where to fax documents." 

00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:55.523
 And they asked, "What documents will you send us?" 

00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:57.566
 I said, "My resignation as a faculty advisor 

00:06:57.566 --> 00:07:01.573
 and apply as a journalist. " 

00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:06.556
 And he said, "Do not you think it's a little transparent?" 

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:09.519
 And I said, "Yes, but our project is a virtual reality, 

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.530
 "We will bring down a series of VR (Virtual Reality) head sets," 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.530
 "and all students from all teams" 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.546
 "will experience this event" 

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:17.506
 "And they all make journalists" 

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:20.533
 it will be able to record it. " 

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:24.500
 Jim Folay says, "Oh, you bastard, yes." 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.593
 And the guy says, "Here's the fax number." 

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:29.543
 And - really, we kept our part of the deal, 

00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:31.513
 And one of the things you will listen to 

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:32.539
 later in speech 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:34.533
 is to bring something to the table, eat, 

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.513
 Because it will make you more welcome. 

00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:40.596
 And if you're interested in what the best-selling situation looks like, 

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:44.550
 Let's hope the sound will work. 

00:07:47.536 --> 00:07:48.556
 male: Sound is on. 

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:51.583
 woman: All right, get them, Mazi. 

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.596
 This is fantastic. 

00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:55.519
 Just miraculous. 

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.523
 Totally different from what I expected. 

00:07:58.523 --> 00:07:59.560
 Pausch: Here I am. 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.586
 [laughter] 

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.523
 Woman: This is amazing. 

00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:08.546
 [laughter] 

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:09.570
 They've got eaten, Mazi. 

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.510
 That's good. 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.576
 Man: I have a ball for you, Maz. 

00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:15.523
 [Laughter] 

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:20.530
 Pausch: Man is paying his feet to the bottom. 

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.539
 So baby dream number one, Filled. 

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:26.500
 All right, let's go now to American football. 

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.583
 My dream was to play American football in national league. 

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:31.560
 And most of you do not know I'm playing fast - No. 

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.590
 [laughter] 

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.503
 No, I did not advance to the national soccer league, 

00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:40.510
 but I'm probably more of a dreamer 

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.580
 and that I did not realize that dream 

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.576
 than what I got from those I did. 

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.506
 I had a trainer. 

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:48.550
 I reported when I was nine years old. 

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.580
 I was by far the smallest kid in the league, 

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.536
 And I had a trainer, Jima Graham, who was 195 cm high. 

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:56.560
 He played in the position of the last line in the Penn State club. 

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.500
 was a real bang, 

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.503
 and old school, I mean, really old school. 

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:05.526
 For example, he thought the front add-on was a trick move. 

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:07.556
 [laughter] 

00:09:07.556 --> 00:09:09.560
 The first day of training came on, 

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.560
 and you know, it's really a bang of a man. 

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.506
 We all feared him to die, 

00:09:13.506 --> 00:09:16.506
 And he did not bring any ball. 

00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:19.553
 How will we have a ball training? 

00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:21.553
 And the boy was asleep, 

00:09:21.553 --> 00:09:24.510
 "Sorry, coach, but no balls." 

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.500
 Coach Graham replied, "Okay, how many players are there 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.566
 on the soccer field during the game? " 

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.563
 "11 by team, 22." 

00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:31.520
 and coach Graham asks, 

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.566
 "All right, and how many people 

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:34.560
 touching the ball at some point? " 

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.586
 "One of them." 

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:37.556
 And he said, "Well, we'll practice 

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:40.533
 in what remains of man works. " 

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:42.566
 And that is a very good story, 

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:44.590
 because everything is in basics, basics 

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.529
 basics, basics. 

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:47.590
 They have to master the basics, 

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.506
 because otherwise attractive things will not burn. 

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:51.596
 And my second story with Jim Graham 

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:53.506
 We had one training 

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:54.573
 where he ran all the way. 

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:56.593
 It's just the whole way, either "This is wrong, what you doing wrong. 

00:09:56.593 --> 00:09:58.533
 "Come back from scratch. You owe me. 

00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.593
 After training, you will do the work. " 

00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:01.529
 And when it was all over, 

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:03.546
 one of the assistant coaches approached me and said, 

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:05.563
 "Oh yeah, Coach Graham put you really hard, did not you?" 

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.566
 I said, "Yes." 

00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:07.586
 He says, "That's a good thing for you." 

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:09.583
 And then he said this, "When you're wrong 

00:10:09.583 --> 00:10:12.533
 "and no one tells you anything about it, 

00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:16.500
 that means they gave up on you. " 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.510
 The lesson that has remained in the head for life, 

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.596
 that when you see yourself doing something really bad 

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:23.503
 and nobody is trying to tell you that, 

00:10:23.503 --> 00:10:24.586
 it's a very bad position. 

00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:26.553
 Critics are the people on your side who say so 

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.529
 how do you still love and love for you. 

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:29.596
 After Graham coach, I had another trainer, 

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.526
 coach Setliffa, 

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:33.536
 He taught me much about the power of enthusiasm. 

00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:36.500
 He had this habit only once in every game, 

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.543
 let people play on, so like 

00:10:37.543 --> 00:10:40.580
 the worst possible position for their game. 

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.529
 For example, he would set all low people as a ball bearer, right? 

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:45.560
 It was a laugh. 

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.566
 But we're just entering one attack, okay? 

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:51.560
 And, that was it, the other team never knew what had happened to them, 

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.553
 Because when you play just one attack 

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:55.536
 and you're not where it should be 

00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:57.556
 and the word of freedom is the second expression for nothing to lose, 

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.533
 old, then you'll spit on somebody's way 

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:00.590
 That one attack. 

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.566
 and such a kind of enthusiasm was great, 

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:05.560
 Even today, I feel the most comfortable on the soccer field. 

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.563
 I want to say, that's one of those things where, 

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.546
 you know, when I handle a difficult problem 

00:11:09.546 --> 00:11:11.516
 people will see me walk through the corridors 

00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:13.556
 with one of these balls, and that's just it. 

00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:15.543
 You know, when you do something early enough 

00:11:15.543 --> 00:11:16.566
 And you work for that, 

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:18.506
 it simply becomes part of you, 

00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:20.580
 and I am very pleased that American football was part of my life, 

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.590
 and if I did not realize the dream of playing in the NFL, 

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.506
 That's OK. 

00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:26.503
 I've probably pulled out much more important things, 

00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:28.510
 because when you look at what's happening in the NFL these days, 

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.510
 it seems to me that these boys and girls are just wonderful now and then. 

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.550
 OK. 

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.500
 And so one of the expressions 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.566
 which I learned in Electronic Art, which I love, 

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.583
 which refers to this is, "Experience is what you are getting 

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:40.516
 when you do not get what you want. " 

00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:43.503
 And I think it's absolutely wonderful. 

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:44.590
 And another thing about American football, 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.543
 when we send our kids out to play rugby, soccer, 

00:11:47.543 --> 00:11:48.596
 to swim or what already, 

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:51.500
 and that's a school example of what I'm going to call 

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.550
 stealth or indirect learning. 

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.543
 We actually do not intend to play football. 

00:11:54.543 --> 00:11:55.560
 I mean, yes, it's really nice 

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.526
 which I can achieve a great hit worth three points 

00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:58.566
 and what I know how to perform the bloom of the block 

00:11:58.566 --> 00:11:59.566
 and all these things. 

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:01.510
 but we're sending our kids out to learn 

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.590
 much more important things: 

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.560
 teamwork, sportsmanship, perseverance, and so on, 

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.580
 And so on. 

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.510
 Such types of learning at the head of the head 

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.580
 is absolutely important, 

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.546
 and should be aware of them, 

00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:15.500
 because they are all around. 

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.539
 All right, one simple, 

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:18.563
 Being an author in "WORLD BOOK" Encyclopedia. 

00:12:18.563 --> 00:12:19.596
 While I was a child, 

00:12:19.596 --> 00:12:22.503
 we had the "WORLD BOOK" Encyclopedia on the shelf. 

00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:23.596
 For the brunette, that's the paper. 

00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:26.593
 [laughter] 

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:31.586
 We used to have those things that are called books. 

00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:34.546
 And when I became a bit of authority 

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.586
 in terms of virtual reality, but not as, 

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:37.529
 very important - 

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:40.576
 So I was at the level of people who would "WORLD BOOK" bother-- 

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:42.539
 they called me, and I wrote an article, 

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:44.500
 and this is Caitlin Kelleher. 

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.586
 And there is an article if you go to your local library 

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:48.596
 Where are they still holding copies of the "WORLD BOOK" encyclopedia. 

00:12:48.596 --> 00:12:50.553
 Look under "V" for Virtual Reality, 

00:12:50.553 --> 00:12:51.553
 and there it is. 

00:12:51.553 --> 00:12:54.500
 And all I have to say is, 

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.576
 I was chosen for the author 

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:57.560
 in the "WORLD BOOK" encyclopedia, 

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.576
 today I believe WIKIPEDIA is a perfectly good source 

00:13:00.576 --> 00:13:01.596
 information 

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:03.590
 Because I know what quality control is 

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.526
 actual encyclopaedia. 

00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:07.583
 They let me go (to write). 

00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:09.586
 All right, next. 

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:12.586
 [laughter] 

00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:16.563
 At some point, understand 

00:13:16.563 --> 00:13:18.536
 as there are some things you will not do, 

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:21.539
 so you may just want to stand close to "those" people. 

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:31.526
 I want to say, God, what a role model for young people. 

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:33.580
 I mean, he's all you want to be, 

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.580
 What I learned and what carried me forward 

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.520
 while doing business later in life is that, 

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.503
 you know, he was not the smartest guy on board. 

00:13:39.503 --> 00:13:40.550
 I mean, Spock was pretty clever, 

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.506
 and McCoy was a doctor, and Scotty was an engineer, 

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:45.560
 and then all you ask is, "What kind of skill did he possess? 

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.593
 that they put it on the forehead of that thing and that it was water? " 

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.536
 And, you know, obviously there is 

00:13:49.536 --> 00:13:51.503
 a series of skills called GUIDELINES, 

00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:53.533
 And, you know, whether you like this series or not, 

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.546
 no doubt how much could be learned 

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:59.546
 about how to lead people by just looking at that guy in action, 

00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:03.590
 And he had the toughest toys. 

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.596
 I mean, my God, he, you know-- 

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.560
 I was fascinating as a child 

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.576
 that he had this thing the injure he could, 

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:13.556
 you know, talk to the boat. 

00:14:13.556 --> 00:14:15.593
 [electronic punch] 

00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:17.580
 I considered him spectacular, 

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:23.523
 And of course, I now own one, and it's smaller. 

00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:26.583
 and in some ways it's cool. 

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:32.506
 And so I made my own. 

00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:37.513
 James T. Kirk - his alter ego William Shatner wrote a book, 

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:39.516
 which I think is actually a pretty cool book. 

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:40.553
 He wrote it as a co-author with Chip Walter, 

00:14:40.553 --> 00:14:43.536
 pretty good writer from Pittsburgh, 

00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:45.506
 And they're basically together 

00:14:45.506 --> 00:14:46.550
 Science Star Trek, you know, 

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.506
 What has happened, 

00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:50.543
 They traveled the country and the world in high tech locations 

00:14:50.543 --> 00:14:51.580
 seeing different things, 

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.593
 they came here to study our device for virtual reality, 

00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:56.556
 And so we built a virtual world for the sake of it. 

00:14:56.556 --> 00:14:58.539
 It looks like this. 

00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:00.503
 We started it, turned on the red alarm. 

00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:01.536
 He was a great guy. 

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:06.533
 Not that he hoped. 

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:12.500
 And it is really the law to meet his idol from childhood, 

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.583
 But it's even better when he comes to you. 

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:19.523
 see what law you are doing in your lab, 

00:15:19.523 --> 00:15:22.513
 it was simply a great moment. 

00:15:22.513 --> 00:15:27.529
 All right, conquering stuffed animals. 

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:28.590
 This can work on the ground, 

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.506
 but when you are a small child and you see a big plush animal 

00:15:31.506 --> 00:15:32.550
 while you walk in a fun park 

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.563
 and there are those big stuffed animals, are not they? 

00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:36.520
 This is my lovely woman, 

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.563
 And I have a lot of pictures of plush animals I've won. 

00:15:40.563 --> 00:15:44.576
 Here my stakes pose with the one I won. 

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:47.526
 I've won many such animals. 

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:48.560
 Here's my dad. 

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.580
 To honor him this one won alone. 

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.573
 [laughter] 

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.546
 Yes, this was easy 

00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:01.506
 much of my life and life in my family, 

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:03.523
 But you know, I can hear cynics. 

00:16:03.523 --> 00:16:06.590
 You know, at this time of digital manipulation of things, 

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.583
 maybe those bears are not really in the picture with me, 

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:12.563
 or maybe I paid $ 5 to somebody 

00:16:12.563 --> 00:16:14.590
 to be in the party near the bear. 

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.583
 I wondered, "How in this era of cynicism, 

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.566
 can anyone convince anyone? " 

00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:22.523
 And I said, "I know, I can show them the bear." 

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:27.506
 Bring them. 

00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:30.596
 [applause] 

00:16:30.596 --> 00:16:33.520
 If you can accommodate them there. 

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.570
 Just place them against the wall. 

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:41.596
 woman: It's hard for you to hear. 

00:16:41.596 --> 00:16:46.550
 Pausch: Thank you, baby. 

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.529
 Here are some bears. 

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:51.546
 We did not have enough space in the truck to move 

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:53.516
 on the way to Chesapeake, 

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:55.570
 so everyone who wants a little pieces of me 

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.523
 at the end of this lecture, it can be freely available. 

00:16:58.523 --> 00:17:01.506
 who first, his bear. 

00:17:01.506 --> 00:17:04.573
 All right, my next dream, be Imagineer. 

00:17:04.573 --> 00:17:06.520
 This was difficult. 

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.510
 Believe me, I'll be in the best condition 

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.593
 it is easier than to become Imagineer. 

00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:13.593
 When I was a boy, he was eight years old 

00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:15.573
 the family went on a journey to the state. 

00:17:15.573 --> 00:17:18.529
 to see Disneyland, and if you've ever watched the movie 

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:22.576
 "National Lampoon's Vacation," was just so. 

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:24.583
 It was an adventure. 

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:28.580
 And these are real photos of that time, 

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.586
 here I am 

00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:34.513
 In front of the castle, and this is me-- 

00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:36.513
 for those who like preaching, 

00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:39.556
 This is Alise's ride in the land of miracles. 

00:17:39.556 --> 00:17:44.503
 I thought this was the best environment 

00:17:44.503 --> 00:17:45.560
 in which I have ever been. And instead of words, 

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.520
 "Oh, I want to experience it," I said, 

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.513
 "I want to create such things." 

00:17:49.513 --> 00:17:51.526
 And so I waited for the opportunity, 

00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:52.566
 doctorate 

00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:54.556
 at Carnegie Mellon University, thinking it was me 

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.516
 unconditionally qualifies to do anything, 

00:17:56.516 --> 00:17:57.593
 I just sent a job application 

00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:59.540
 Walt Disney Imagineering Department, 

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.509
 and they sent me the most beautiful "carrying" letter to the worst 

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:04.540
 which I have ever received. 

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.573
 I mean, it was easy-- 

00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:09.543
 "We carefully considered your application, 

00:18:09.543 --> 00:18:12.580
 "and we currently have no place at all 

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.520
 which requires your specific qualification. " 

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.570
 Keep in mind the fact that you receive this from the place 

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.590
 which is known for the types that target the street. 

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.536
 So, that was a bit of an obstacle. 

00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:29.563
 But remember, the stone walls are there for a reason. 

00:18:29.563 --> 00:18:31.583
 All right, the stone walls are not there to prevent us from entering. 

00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:34.516
 Stone walls are here to give us a chance 

00:18:34.516 --> 00:18:37.516
 show how much we want something, 

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.523
 Because the stone walls are here to stop people 

00:18:39.523 --> 00:18:41.576
 who do not care enough about it. 

00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:46.543
 They are here to stop other people. 

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.573
 All right, let's roll by 1991. 

00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:50.573
 Then we developed a system at Virginia University 

00:18:50.573 --> 00:18:53.523
 which was called 'Virtual Reality for $ 5 a day', 

00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:56.540
 One of those incredible, spectacular things. 

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.580
 I was so scared of these early, academic days. 

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.553
 Jim Foley was there, and I just love to talk this story. 

00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:04.583
 He knew my midwifery advisor, Andy Van Dam, 

00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:07.526
 and I am at my first conference, and scared to death, 

00:19:07.526 --> 00:19:10.560
 And it is an icon within the community that deals with user interfaces 

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.509
 He came over to me, and without a cause 

00:19:12.509 --> 00:19:13.553
 just hugged me, 

00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:16.523
 You said to me, "It's from Andy." 

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.529
 And then I thought, "OK, maybe I can do it. 

00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:21.576
 All right, you know, I might really belong here. " 

00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:23.513
 And a similar story 

00:19:23.513 --> 00:19:24.580
 This device was an incredible hit 

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.516
 because at that time, 

00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:28.550
 everybody needed $ 1/2 million to make the virtual world 

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.583
 and everyone was frustrated, 

00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.553
 and we have literally skimmed the system 

00:19:31.553 --> 00:19:34.576
 whose parts cost about $ 5,000, and created a VR device that works, 

00:19:34.576 --> 00:19:36.523
 And people were able to, "Oh my God, 

00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.553
 This is so, you know, as something from the Hewlett-Packard garage. 

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.503
 This is great. " 

00:19:40.503 --> 00:19:42.536
 And so, I hold that speech, the room is in madness, 

00:19:42.536 --> 00:19:44.506
 and during questions and answers, a man named Tom Furness, 

00:19:44.506 --> 00:19:46.596
 which at that time was one of the great names in the development of virtual reality, 

00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:49.513
 he went over to the microphone and played. 

00:19:49.513 --> 00:19:50.553
 I did not know how it looks, 

00:19:50.553 --> 00:19:51.580
 but I knew his name very much. 

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.536
 He asked a question and I wondered in wonder, 

00:19:53.536 --> 00:19:55.576
 "Sorry, did you say you were Tom Furness?" 

00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:57.506
 he replied, "Yes." 

00:19:57.506 --> 00:19:59.503
 And I said, "Then I'll be happy to answer your question, 

00:19:59.503 --> 00:20:01.503
 but before that, would he go to lunch tomorrow with me? " 

00:20:01.503 --> 00:20:03.520
 [laughter] 

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.576
 And there's a lot in that tiny moment. 

00:20:06.576 --> 00:20:08.523
 There is a lot of humility in the order 

00:20:08.523 --> 00:20:11.523
 but also asks a person where she simply can not say 'No'. 

00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:14.516
 [laughter] 

00:20:17.573 --> 00:20:20.520
 And so Imagineering a few years later 

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.586
 worked on a virtual reality project. 

00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:23.529
 It was a secret. 

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:26.570
 They have negated the existence of virtual reality attractions 

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.506
 and after the department for the public 

00:20:29.506 --> 00:20:31.506
 he puts on TV commercials. 

00:20:31.506 --> 00:20:34.529
 So the Imagineering Department really has sealed everything about it. 

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:36.503
 And it was about Aladdin's attraction, 

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:37.570
 where a man would fly on a magical carpet, 

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.513
 with a visualization tool mounted on the head, known as Gator Vizion. 

00:20:42.513 --> 00:20:44.583
 And so I took the open entrance. 

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:47.513
 As soon as the project-- 

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:49.513
 You know, they started to launch TV commercials, 

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:52.509
 and they asked me from the ministry of defense for the report 

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:53.536
 related to the question of virtual reality. 

00:20:53.536 --> 00:20:56.573
 OK, Fred Brooks and I were invited 

00:20:56.573 --> 00:20:58.583
 to report defense secretaries, 

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:02.540
 and it gave me an excuse. 

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.553
 So I called them. 

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:05.513
 I called Imagineering, and said, 

00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:07.500
 "Look, I can report to the Secretary of Defense. 

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.566
 I would like to give you some materials about what you have, 

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:10.573
 because it's one of the best VR devices in the world. " 

00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:12.500
 And they wanted to resist. 

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.590
 So I said, "Look, are these all pathetic things 

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.523
 in the park of the farce? " 

00:21:15.523 --> 00:21:18.546
 They smiled like, "Hm, OK," but they said, 

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:20.529
 "But there is no public relations department ... This is like some news, 

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.536
 "But the Public Relations Department has no record for you, 

00:21:22.536 --> 00:21:23.586
 "Well, we'll have to connect you 

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:25.590
 directly with a team that works at an attraction. " 

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.593
 Jackpot. 

00:21:27.593 --> 00:21:30.529
 And so I get to talk over the phone with a man named Jon Snoddy 

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:32.563
 It's one of the most depressing people 

00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:33.596
 which I've ever met, 

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:35.563
 and he was the man who runs the whole team, 

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:38.516
 No wonder they made impressive things then. 

00:21:38.516 --> 00:21:39.590
 And so he sent me some things. 

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.500
 We talked a card. 

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.529
 He sent me some stuff, and then I said, 

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:43.570
 "Hey, I'll be close to you soon 

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.590
 "at a conference. 

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.570
 Would you like to meet me at lunch? " 

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.576
 Translation: "I'll laugh you 

00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.553
 "and say I have an excuse that I'm in the vicinity 

00:21:50.553 --> 00:21:52.550
 "so I do not seem too interested, 

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.529
 while actually going to Neptune to dine with you. " 

00:21:56.529 --> 00:22:00.543
 And so Jon said, "Of course," 

00:22:00.543 --> 00:22:04.536
 After that I spent some 80 hours 

00:22:04.536 --> 00:22:07.536
 talking to all VR experts in the world, asking them, 

00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:10.536
 "If you had access to this incredible project, 

00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:12.503
 what would you ask? " 

00:22:12.503 --> 00:22:14.526
 And I did all this in the whole, and I had to remember it all, 

00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:16.556
 and everybody who knows me knows it's not easy because I have no memory, 

00:22:16.556 --> 00:22:18.556
 because I could not get there looking like a nerd, 

00:22:18.556 --> 00:22:20.546
 you know, like, "Hello, question number 72." 

00:22:20.546 --> 00:22:23.593
 And so I went, and it was, kind, lunch of two now, 

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:25.526
 to Jon now that he thought 

00:22:25.526 --> 00:22:28.540
 how to talk to a phonemic person, 

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.503
 Because Fred Brooks passed through me 

00:22:31.503 --> 00:22:32.566
 and Ivana Sutherlanda and Andy Van Dama 

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:34.529
 and the like, Henry Fuchs. 

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:35.596
 So, it's very easy to look smart 

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:39.523
 When you repent as a parrot of the words of smart people. 

00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:42.546
 And at the end of that lunch with Jon I'm somehow, 

00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:44.580
 as we say in the business, "asked the question." 

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.580
 And he said, "You know, my free academic year begins." 

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.596
 And he asks, "What is it?" 

00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:52.590
 [laughter] 

00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:58.533
 The beginnings of collision of culture. 

00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:01.509
 So I talked to him about the possibilities 

00:23:01.509 --> 00:23:03.586
 to come and work with him. 

00:23:03.586 --> 00:23:07.533
 He also said, "Well, that's a very good idea, except, 

00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:08.576
 "You know, you are in business 

00:23:08.576 --> 00:23:10.509
 "to talk to people about things, 

00:23:10.509 --> 00:23:12.590
 while we are at work where we keep secrets. " 

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.546
 All right, and then the thing Jona Snoddy did 

00:23:14.546 --> 00:23:17.516
 I told Snoddy, he said, "but we will sort it out," 

00:23:17.516 --> 00:23:18.546
 And I really liked it. 

00:23:18.546 --> 00:23:20.529
 The other thing I learned from Jon Snoddy-- 

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:21.570
 I could easily talk about an hour 

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.540
 about all I learned from Jon Snoddy. 

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.520
 One of the things he said was, 

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.503
 "If you wait enough, people will surprise you and impress you." 

00:23:28.503 --> 00:23:29.576
 He told me, "When you go for somebody 

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.500
 and you are angry at him, 

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.553
 "means that you have not given enough time to that person yet. 

00:23:33.553 --> 00:23:34.593
 "Just give them some more time, 

00:23:34.593 --> 00:23:36.550
 and will almost always impress you. " 

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.586
 And that really really left me in my head. 

00:23:37.586 --> 00:23:39.586
 I think he's totally right with that. 

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:45.556
 But to shorten, we agreed on a legal agreement. 

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:46.596
 It will be the first-- 

00:23:46.596 --> 00:23:49.516
 Some people call it the first and last article 

00:23:49.516 --> 00:23:50.596
 ever published by the Imagineering Department-- 

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:53.590
 But the deal was to go there, I am funded, 

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.566
 I go to six months, work on the project, 

00:23:55.566 --> 00:23:58.566
 and we publish the article. 

00:23:58.566 --> 00:24:00.560
 And then we meet up with his own villain. 

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.533
 They can not be sweet and gentle, 

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:05.586
 because I do not have credibility. 

00:24:05.586 --> 00:24:08.523
 Somebody's head will end up on the cart. 

00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:10.536
 It turns out that the person with a head on the wheel 

00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:12.560
 Dean at Virgii University. 

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.566
 His name does not matter. 

00:24:13.566 --> 00:24:15.546
 We call it Dean Wormer. 

00:24:15.546 --> 00:24:18.540
 [laughter] 

00:24:20.593 --> 00:24:23.553
 So dean Wormer is sitting with me at a meeting where I say, 

00:24:23.553 --> 00:24:25.503
 "I want to take that academic free year, 

00:24:25.503 --> 00:24:26.596
 "because I managed to persuade these people from the Imageneering Department 

00:24:26.596 --> 00:24:28.566
 to allow the entrance to the professor, "which is total madness. 

00:24:28.566 --> 00:24:30.526
 I want to say that Jon was not a jerk, 

00:24:30.526 --> 00:24:31.593
 this would never have enabled you. 

00:24:31.593 --> 00:24:33.550
 It's a very silent organization. 

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.580
 And Sekan Wormer looks at the paper and says, 

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.520
 "Hm, so here it is written how they will own 

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.563
 your intellectual property. " 

00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:39.593
 And I say, "Yes, we have agreed to publish the article. 

00:24:39.593 --> 00:24:41.596
 "No other benefits. I will not work for the patents." 

00:24:41.596 --> 00:24:43.596
 And he said, "Fa, but you could just as well, so this conversation will be gone. 

00:24:43.596 --> 00:24:47.523
 "Just go to them and change this little paragraph 

00:24:47.523 --> 00:24:50.550
 and then come again to me. " 

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.563
 And I'm like, "PLEASE?" 

00:24:52.563 --> 00:24:54.509
 And then I told him, 

00:24:54.509 --> 00:24:56.503
 "I want you to understand how important this is. 

00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:57.536
 "If we can not solve this, two of us 

00:24:57.536 --> 00:24:59.576
 "I will take unpaid vacation, 

00:24:59.576 --> 00:25:04.540
 and just go there, and do that thing. " 

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.590
 And he says, "Hey, you know, 

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.543
 "Maybe I will not let you either. 

00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:10.526
 "I think if you already have a design project in your head, 

00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:12.516
 "it might just get you out of here, 

00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:14.560
 so that's not going to happen either. " 

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.553
 [laughter] 

00:25:19.523 --> 00:25:23.536
 It is very important to recognize the moment of "piercing competition" 

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:24.546
 and it is very important 

00:25:24.546 --> 00:25:26.593
 as soon as they move away from such a situation. 

00:25:26.593 --> 00:25:30.550
 So I said, "All right, let's get back a little. 

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.576
 Do we really think this had a good idea? " 

00:25:32.576 --> 00:25:35.560
 He said, "I do not know if this is a good idea, you know." 

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.513
 And I mean, "OK, well, at least we agree." 

00:25:39.513 --> 00:25:40.593
 Then I said, "All right, but do you decide about this? 

00:25:40.593 --> 00:25:43.529
 Do not make these decisions 'dean for sponsored research' 

00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:44.536
 if it's a research project? " 

00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:45.573
 And he says, "Yes, that's right." 

00:25:45.573 --> 00:25:47.543
 I said, "So if he is so happy, and you are happy?" 

00:25:47.543 --> 00:25:48.543
 "Yes, then it would be okay." 

00:25:48.543 --> 00:25:49.543
 poof! 

00:25:49.543 --> 00:25:50.563
 Like Wilo Wild Coyote. 

00:25:50.563 --> 00:25:52.523
 and find myself in the office of Gene Block, 

00:25:52.523 --> 00:25:53.590
 who is the most fanciful man in the world, 

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.560
 let me talk to Gene Block, and I say, 

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.586
 "Let's start at the main level," 

00:25:56.586 --> 00:25:58.500
 that I do not have to go back to that. 

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.533
 "So let's get high. 

00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:00.580
 Do you think this is a good idea? " 

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.586
 He said, "Well, if you ask me if this is a good idea, 

00:26:02.586 --> 00:26:04.533
 "I do not have much information to judge. 

00:26:04.533 --> 00:26:06.523
 "The only thing I know is a member of my college staff 

00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:07.550
 "in my office, and that she was very excited, 

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.583
 therefore, tell me, please do more about it. " 

00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:10.590
 This lesson for everyone involved in the administration. 

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.509
 They both said the same thing, 

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:18.500
 But think about the way they said that, okay? 

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.553
 "I do not know!" 

00:26:19.553 --> 00:26:21.509
 "Well, I do not have much information, 

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:23.506
 "but one member of my college staff is here, 

00:26:23.506 --> 00:26:25.513
 and he's completely excited so I want to hear more. " 

00:26:25.513 --> 00:26:26.586
 Both of these ways to say do not know, 

00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:29.506
 But, man, there's a good way and a bad way. 

00:26:29.506 --> 00:26:32.500
 Anyway, we've all been relieved. 

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.590
 I went to the Imaging Department, sugar and glitter 

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.550
 And it's all good to be done well. 

00:26:40.543 --> 00:26:44.529
 Some walls are made of meat. 

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:46.540
 So I worked on the ALADDIN project. 

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.556
 It was absolutely spectacular, I mean, just incredible. 

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:52.586
 Here's my nephew Christopher. 

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:54.520
 This was a developed device. 

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.526
 Sitting on this thing that looks like a motorcycle, 

00:26:56.526 --> 00:26:58.550
 and would manage a magical carpet, 

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.556
 And put the screen on the head. 

00:27:00.556 --> 00:27:02.550
 The video monitor mounted on the head was very interesting. 

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.583
 It was made of two parts, which was a very wise design. 

00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:06.546
 To fit properly, the only part 

00:27:06.546 --> 00:27:08.546
 who touched the visitor's head was this little cap, 

00:27:08.546 --> 00:27:09.593
 and everything else was merged by clicking on it, 

00:27:09.593 --> 00:27:11.509
 All set of equipment. 

00:27:11.509 --> 00:27:12.546
 That way you could simply rip caps 

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:14.580
 which were basically very inexpensive to make. 

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.513
 This is what I really worked there, 

00:27:16.513 --> 00:27:19.593
 I was a cap scalp during a free academic year. 

00:27:19.593 --> 00:27:22.550
 I loved Imagineering. 

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.533
 It was just a spectacular place, simply spectacular, 

00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:27.566
 All I ever dreamed of. 

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:29.500
 I liked a workshop for modeling, 

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.560
 people who sneak around the models that are the size of this room 

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.506
 which are simply great physical models. 

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:35.576
 It was just an amazing place to walk 

00:27:35.576 --> 00:27:37.536
 and inspiration. 

00:27:37.536 --> 00:27:40.553
 I always remember the time when I was going there and people were asking, 

00:27:40.553 --> 00:27:42.529
 "Do not you think the expectations are a bit overdue?" 

00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:43.566
 And I told them, "Have you ever watched the movie 

00:27:43.566 --> 00:27:45.520
 "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" - 

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.580
 "Willy Wonka and Chocolate Factory" 

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.536
 where Gene Wilder tells a little boy Charlie-- 

00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:49.576
 before deciding to give him a chocolate factory. 

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:51.576
 He says, "Well, Charlie, have you ever told someone 

00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:53.506
 "a little boy story 

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:56.566
 who suddenly got everything he ever wanted? " 

00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:59.520
 Charlie's eyes become big as a flying gun, and he says, 

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.513
 "No, what happened to him?" 

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:05.536
 Gene Wilder answers, "He lived happily for the rest of his life." 

00:28:05.536 --> 00:28:07.576
 Okay, so work on Aladdin's virtual reality, 

00:28:07.576 --> 00:28:08.596
 I describe it as 

00:28:08.596 --> 00:28:10.573
 An opportunity that opens once in five years. 

00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:12.529
 and stand in that estimation. 

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:14.523
 That changed forever. 

00:28:14.523 --> 00:28:15.583
 Not that it was just about good business 

00:28:15.583 --> 00:28:17.596
 although this is partly true, 

00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:21.506
 but has led me to a place where I worked with real people 

00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:23.560
 and on real-life user interface development issues. 

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.506
 Most professors live in this fairy tale world 

00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:29.570
 white collar workers with doctoral and magistrate diplomas. 

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.566
 You know, until you get dirty with ice cream, 

00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:34.590
 Do not deal with fieldwork, okay? 

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.533
 And more than anything else, I learned from Jon Snoddy 

00:28:37.533 --> 00:28:39.546
 how together we connect the engineers and engineers, 

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:41.540
 and I consider it a real legacy. 

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.560
 We have published an article, 

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.543
 which was a nice cultural scandal. 

00:28:44.543 --> 00:28:46.560
 As we wrote the article, people in Imagineering suggested, 

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.523
 "Well, let's put a pretty big picture 

00:28:49.523 --> 00:28:50.596
 as they would put in a magazine. " 

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:53.506
 And for the Siggraph Commission, which received the articles, 

00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:54.560
 it was a big scandal. 

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.546
 "Do they have to do that (put a picture)?" 

00:28:56.546 --> 00:28:58.560
 [laughter] 

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.546
 There were no rules. 

00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:03.546
 So we published the article, and surprisingly, 

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:05.546
 Since then there is tradition of Siggraph articles 

00:29:05.546 --> 00:29:08.506
 they have colored images on the front side. 

00:29:08.506 --> 00:29:11.576
 So, in a small way, I managed to change the world. 

00:29:11.576 --> 00:29:15.503
 And then, at the end of those six months, 

00:29:15.503 --> 00:29:16.533
 they came to me and asked, 

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:19.576
 "Would you like to do this forever? You can stay." 

00:29:25.556 --> 00:29:27.556
 And I said, "No." 

00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:30.500
 One of the few moments in life when I managed to surprise my dad. 

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.503
 It was a miracle, "Did you do what?" 

00:29:33.503 --> 00:29:35.570
 He told me, "Since you were, you know yourself, you just wanted it, 

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.566
 and now that you get it, you are - Ha? " 

00:29:38.566 --> 00:29:40.563
 There was a bottle of gorge in the drawer of my work desk. 

00:29:40.563 --> 00:29:41.583
 Be careful what you want. 

00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:43.553
 It was a particularly stressful place. 

00:29:43.553 --> 00:29:46.553
 Imagineering was generally not a bad place, 

00:29:46.553 --> 00:29:50.506
 But the lab I was in-- Oh, Jon went to the middle of the project, 

00:29:50.506 --> 00:29:52.566
 And it was very similar to the Soviet Union. 

00:29:52.566 --> 00:29:55.513
 It was a bit risky for a while, 

00:29:55.513 --> 00:29:56.550
 But everything ended well, 

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.560
 And they said to me, "Stay here 

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.506
 or never cross over to this building, " 

00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:01.573
 I would do that. 

00:30:01.573 --> 00:30:03.546
 I would go for a ten-year experience. 

00:30:03.546 --> 00:30:05.509
 I just would do it. 

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:06.533
 But they made it easier for me. 

00:30:06.533 --> 00:30:08.526
 They told me, "You can eat and have a cake," 

00:30:08.526 --> 00:30:09.536
 And basically I became 

00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:11.513
 Imagineering Advisor One Day a Week, 

00:30:11.513 --> 00:30:12.563
 And I worked it for ten years, 

00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:14.509
 And that's one of the reasons 

00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:16.570
 Why should all become professors, 

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.576
 Because you can have and eat your cake, okay? 

00:30:20.576 --> 00:30:22.596
 I continued as an advisor on things like DISNEYQUEST. 

00:30:22.596 --> 00:30:24.580
 so there was a cruise to the Virtual Jungle 

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.583
 And the best interactive experience I've ever worked on-- 

00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.596
 and Jesse Schella Gzbog should praise it-- 

00:30:29.596 --> 00:30:34.506
 Pirates from the Caribbean, the goddess of Disney Adventure. 

00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:35.586
 And so, that's my dreams from childhood, 

00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:38.500
 And you know, that's pretty good. 

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.526
 I felt good about it. 

00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:40.596
 And then the question arises, 

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:44.503
 How can I realize the children's dreams of others? 

00:30:44.503 --> 00:30:46.586
 And again, man, I'm glad I became a professor. 

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:52.586
 What is the best place to accomplish dreams from childhood? 

00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:54.523
 Maybe work in EA (Electronic Arts), I do not know. 

00:30:54.523 --> 00:30:58.546
 It would probably be a good and close alternative. 

00:30:58.546 --> 00:31:03.560
 This has started with a real concrete realization 

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.540
 To do that, 

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.516
 Because I'm a young man named Tommy Burnette, 

00:31:07.516 --> 00:31:09.520
 while I was working at a university in Virginia, 

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.529
 He was interested in joining my development team, 

00:31:11.529 --> 00:31:13.529
 We talked about it when he said, 

00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:15.553
 "Oh, and I have a childhood dream." 

00:31:15.553 --> 00:31:18.570
 It becomes quite easy to recognize them when they tell you that. 

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.513
 I asked him, "Yes, Tommy, what is your childhood dream?" 

00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:25.583
 He said, "I want to work on the next" STAR WARS "movie." 

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.593
 Here you need to keep in mind the time when this happened. 

00:31:27.593 --> 00:31:29.540
 Where's Tommy? Tommy is here today. 

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.573
 What would be the age? Your fucking year. 

00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:32.573
 woman: somewhere there. 

00:31:32.573 --> 00:31:34.513
 Male: Around 1993. 

00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:36.543
 Pausch: Do you think any breakdown is in the back, young man? 

00:31:36.543 --> 00:31:38.540
 OK, okay, so 1993. 

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.560
 And I said to Tommy, "You know 

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.506
 you will most likely not be doing these movies. " 

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:47.500
 [laughter] 

00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:52.566
 And he says, "No, they will do them." 

00:31:52.566 --> 00:31:55.560
 [laughter] 

00:31:56.586 --> 00:31:59.593
 And Tommy worked with me for years 

00:31:59.593 --> 00:32:01.576
 as an undergraduate and later as a member of the facultet staff, 

00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:03.553
 And then when I moved to Carnegie Mellon University, 

00:32:03.553 --> 00:32:05.553
 all members of my team 

00:32:05.553 --> 00:32:08.526
 they came from Virginia to Carnegie Mellon 

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:11.590
 except Tommy, because he got a hefty offer, 

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.553
 And really, he did it all 

00:32:14.553 --> 00:32:18.509
 three films. 

00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:19.553
 And then I said, "Well, that's nice, 

00:32:19.553 --> 00:32:22.566
 But, you know, (to realize people's dreams) once is somehow ineffective. " 

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:25.533
 People who know they know I'm crazy about efficiency. 

00:32:25.533 --> 00:32:27.553
 So I wrote, "Can I do it massively? 

00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:30.520
 Can I run people in this way 

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.573
 to turn to your dreams from childhood? " 

00:32:32.573 --> 00:32:34.566
 And I created a course. I came to Carnegie Mellon, 

00:32:34.566 --> 00:32:36.586
 and he founded the subject that was called "Creating Virtual Worlds." 

00:32:36.586 --> 00:32:38.529
 It was a very simple course. 

00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:41.526
 How many people here have ever been at any of the show? 

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:42.573
 OK, so some of you have an idea of ​​what's going on. 

00:32:42.573 --> 00:32:44.580
 For those who have not been trained, the course is very simple. 

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.513
 50 students are selected 

00:32:46.513 --> 00:32:48.546
 from various departments at the university. 

00:32:48.546 --> 00:32:50.583
 They are rendered randomly complex-- 

00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:54.520
 Randomly complex teams, four people per team, 

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.576
 and teams are changing at every turn. 

00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:58.543
 One project lasts only two weeks, to do something, 

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.563
 something created, something to show, 

00:33:00.563 --> 00:33:03.506
 After that I pronounce the teams, and you get three new colleagues, 

00:33:03.506 --> 00:33:06.546
 And it all starts again, and it's so every two weeks, 

00:33:06.546 --> 00:33:09.583
 In this way, you make five projects per semester. 

00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.560
 In the first year we thought that this subject, 

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.500
 it is impossible to describe 

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.513
 how much we had a drag-and-drop situation. 

00:33:17.513 --> 00:33:18.540
 I did this thing just for that 

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.516
 what I wanted to see if we can do it. 

00:33:20.516 --> 00:33:22.560
 We have just learned how to build textures in 3D graphics, 

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.550
 and we could make things that looked half-full. 

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:25.573
 But, you know, we did it 

00:33:25.573 --> 00:33:28.593
 on really poor computers by today's standards. 

00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:30.529
 But I said, "Let me try." 

00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:32.546
 At my new university, I made a couple of phone calls, 

00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:34.523
 and said, "I want to make crossroads of students on this subject 

00:33:34.523 --> 00:33:36.523
 to get all those other people, "and within 24 hours, 

00:33:36.523 --> 00:33:38.590
 My subject was chosen by people from five departments. 

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.550
 I love this university. 

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.506
 I mean, That's so-- It's the most amazing place. 

00:33:43.506 --> 00:33:45.509
 And the children were wondering, "What kind of content do we do?" 

00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:47.500
 I said, "Damn it, I do not know. 

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.533
 "Do whatever you want. 

00:33:48.533 --> 00:33:52.536
 There are two rules: No torture and no pornography. " 

00:33:52.536 --> 00:33:54.586
 Not because I personally oppose this personally, 

00:33:54.586 --> 00:33:59.596
 but because it has already been done through virtual reality, is not it? 

00:33:59.596 --> 00:34:01.596
 And they'd be surprised at how many 19-year-old boys 

00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:05.553
 stay completely without the idea of ​​removing these two choices. 

00:34:05.553 --> 00:34:08.546
 [laughter] 

00:34:10.566 --> 00:34:12.593
 Anyway, I invented for the subject. 

00:34:12.593 --> 00:34:15.520
 the first task, I shared them, 

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.519
 They've been back for two weeks, and they just kicked me off. 

00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:23.506
 I mean, their work has overcome, literally, my imagination, 

00:34:23.506 --> 00:34:25.573
 I copied the development process from Imagineering Laboratory for Virtual Reality, 

00:34:25.573 --> 00:34:27.523
 but I had no ideas 

00:34:27.523 --> 00:34:30.536
 What can be done with such an approach, and not with undergraduates, 

00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:31.560
 And their tools were weak, 

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.530
 And they came back with their first assignment, 

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.516
 And I did something that was so spectacular 

00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:37.530
 To literally not ... as a professor with 10 years of experience, 

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.506
 If I did not want to do anything else. 

00:34:39.506 --> 00:34:40.580
 So I called my mentor. 

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.530
 I call Andy your lady, and I told him, 

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.513
 "Andy, he just split his two-week assignment, 

00:34:46.513 --> 00:34:47.546
 "And they came back to things done 

00:34:47.546 --> 00:34:49.513
 "for which I would have given them the entire semester, 

00:34:49.513 --> 00:34:50.560
 "Everyone gets five. 

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.570
 Master, what can I do? " 

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.560
 And Andy thought for a minute, and said, 

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.566
 "Tomorrow is coming back to class, 

00:35:00.566 --> 00:35:02.556
 "Look at them in the eyes, and tell them, 

00:35:02.556 --> 00:35:05.563
 'people, this was pretty good, but I know you can do better.' " 

00:35:05.563 --> 00:35:08.556
 [laughter] 

00:35:09.573 --> 00:35:11.526
 And that was a real advice, 

00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:12.566
 Because then he said this, 

00:35:12.566 --> 00:35:16.506
 "You obviously do not know where the boundary should be set, 

00:35:16.506 --> 00:35:18.530
 "And you'll just get them off 

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.506
 if you put it anywhere. " 

00:35:21.506 --> 00:35:23.519
 And, people how good it was, 

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:27.536
 Because they only continued to advance, and during that semester, 

00:35:27.536 --> 00:35:29.560
 it became a "matter of the underworld". 

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.546
 I would go to the classroom with 50 enrolled students, 

00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:36.596
 And there were 95 people, 

00:35:36.596 --> 00:35:38.593
 Because it was the day we showed the works, 

00:35:38.593 --> 00:35:42.560
 And the names of students and friends and parents-- 

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.590
 Never before did parents come to classes. 

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.550
 It was flattering and somewhat scary. 

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.530
 And so it started to snow, and we had that bizarre feeling, 

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:52.573
 "Well, we have to split this up." 

00:35:52.573 --> 00:35:54.543
 If I was raised to do something, 

00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:55.580
 it is to share, and so I split, 

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.573
 "We have to share this with others at the end of the semester. 

00:35:57.573 --> 00:35:58.583
 We need to have a great show. " 

00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:00.516
 And we booked this great lecture, Mcconomy. 

00:36:00.516 --> 00:36:01.576
 I have many nice memories from this room. 

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.593
 We did not book it because we thought we would fill it up, 

00:36:03.593 --> 00:36:06.573
 but because the only one had a projector with loudspeakers, 

00:36:06.573 --> 00:36:11.509
 Because it was ZOO, computers and everything else. 

00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:13.593
 And then we filled it up, and more than stuffed it. 

00:36:13.593 --> 00:36:15.550
 People were standing in the passage. 

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.513
 I will never forget the dean of that time, Jim Morris, 

00:36:18.513 --> 00:36:20.580
 who was sitting in the lab here somewhere. 

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.596
 We had to get him some way out of that place. 

00:36:23.596 --> 00:36:26.526
 And energy in the room was something that never 

00:36:26.526 --> 00:36:28.553
 before I did not, and chairman Cohen, 

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:32.523
 Jerry Cohen was there, and felt the same thing. 

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.556
 Later he described it as E 

00:36:33.556 --> 00:36:38.583
 The Ohio Country Football Set Only for Academics, 

00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:41.503
 He approached, and set up the very right question. 

00:36:41.503 --> 00:36:42.536
 He asked, "Before somebody starts," 

00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:45.509
 He said, "I just have to know where all these people are from?" 

00:36:45.509 --> 00:36:47.540
 He said, "Audiences, what are the divisions?" 

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.570
 And we randomly asked them, and they were from all departments, 

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.583
 And I felt very good, 

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.553
 Because I just got to this college. 

00:36:52.553 --> 00:36:54.509
 He just came to this college, 

00:36:54.509 --> 00:36:57.556
 And my new boss saw it in a very physical way 

00:36:57.556 --> 00:37:01.553
 how this university brings together all the people together, 

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:04.580
 And that made me feel very much. 

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.536
 So we made a presentation before the whole university. 

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:07.580
 People are doing their work here. 

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.536
 They are in costumes, and we have shown up just like this, 

00:37:10.536 --> 00:37:11.593
 And you can see what's going on. 

00:37:11.593 --> 00:37:13.540
 You can see what they see 

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540
 through the device on the head. 

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.573
 There are a lot of big props. 

00:37:15.573 --> 00:37:19.519
 It was that rafting guy on the rushes. 

00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:24.540
 this is Ben in "ET" 

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.509
 And yes, I told him not to do it

 scene with a kid riding a bike in front of the moon, 

00:37:27.583 --> 00:37:28.583
 to crash it. 

00:37:28.583 --> 00:37:30.540
 That's the real story. 

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.550
 And I meant to show you just a little-- 

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.530
 [laughter] 

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.586
 And I thought to show you only one world, 

00:37:37.586 --> 00:37:40.593
 And if we can shake the lights, if possible. 

00:37:40.593 --> 00:37:42.519
 No, OK, that does not mean. 

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:43.540
 Alright. 

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.533
 All right, we'll be fine then how best we can. 

00:37:48.573 --> 00:37:49.580

 all WHEE! 

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:24.593
 Pausch: Now all this will be superstitious. 

00:39:24.593 --> 00:39:26.556
 Watch carefully. 

00:39:26.556 --> 00:39:28.546
 The world does not want to leave 

00:39:28.546 --> 00:39:30.530
 and continue with the following display. 

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.523
 So she is ready to go, but the world is not. 

00:39:39.563 --> 00:39:41.583
 Rabbit: What are you doing? 

00:39:41.583 --> 00:39:43.593
 You can not finish this now. 

00:39:43.593 --> 00:39:46.570
 woman: But there are so many other worlds that have also had to leave. 

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.593
 Rabbit: But our world is the best in the world. 

00:39:49.593 --> 00:39:51.530
 Hey, hey, hey! 

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.563
 Hey, no! 

00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:55.530
 not! 

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.556
 [Giggle] 

00:39:57.556 --> 00:39:58.570
 Here I am. 

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.546
 woman: We'll quit you. 

00:40:01.546 --> 00:40:04.553
 CONTROL, ALT, DELETE. 

00:40:04.553 --> 00:40:06.566
 rabbit: no CONTROL, ALT, DEL-- 

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:09.560
 [laughter] 

00:40:24.563 --> 00:40:27.570
 [screaming] 

00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:32.500
 Rabbit: He left us. 

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.519
 HE LEFT US. 

00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:38.553
 [screaming] 

00:40:38.553 --> 00:40:40.500
 My skin. 

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.540
 My skin. 

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.540
 My skin! 

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.536
 [Screaming and Attacked Shoots] 

00:40:50.543 --> 00:40:53.530
 [Screaming] 

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.593
 We loved you. 

00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:13.509
 Goodbye! 

00:41:20.543 --> 00:41:23.536
 [laughter] 

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.540
 Pausch: It was a neophyte course 

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.516
 With some of the most brilliant, creative students 

00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:37.570
 Everywhere from university. 

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.526
 It was a pleasure to be involved in this. 

00:41:40.526 --> 00:41:42.560
 And all that aspect of the show they realized 

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.513
 check and pre-order. 

00:41:44.513 --> 00:41:47.533
 [laughter] 

00:41:47.533 --> 00:41:50.523
 It became a university phenomenon every year. 

00:41:50.523 --> 00:41:52.540
 People would stand in line for that. 

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.533
 It was a very bearish, 

00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:58.506
 And he gave the kids a sense of excitement 

00:41:58.506 --> 00:42:01.570
 What kept the play for the others who were so excited about it, 

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:03.546
 And I think it's one of the best things 

00:42:03.546 --> 00:42:04.576
 which you can give to someone, 

00:42:04.576 --> 00:42:07.533
 A chance to see what it is like 

00:42:07.533 --> 00:42:09.563
 other people excite and be happy. 

00:42:09.563 --> 00:42:11.536
 I mean, It's a terrific gift. 

00:42:11.536 --> 00:42:13.523
 We have always tried to include the audience, 

00:42:13.523 --> 00:42:14.576
 Whether it was people who hold lightning sticks 

00:42:14.576 --> 00:42:18.513
 or by adding a ball to the beach, or a ride. 

00:42:18.513 --> 00:42:19.516
 It's really cool. 

00:42:19.516 --> 00:42:20.560
 This technology was even used and 

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.556
 at the premiere of "SPIDERMAN 3" in Los Angeles 

00:42:22.556 --> 00:42:24.583
 So the audience managed something on the screen, 

00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:27.550
 That's a nice way. 

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.590
 I have no class image of all the years, 

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.566
 But I extracted all that I have, 

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:33.596
 And you just say what a privilege is 

00:42:33.596 --> 00:42:35.570
 and it was a honor to teach this subject 

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.553
 some ten years ago, 

00:42:37.553 --> 00:42:41.573
 All good things come to their end, 

00:42:41.573 --> 00:42:45.556
 and so I stopped groaning that thing about a year ago. 

00:42:45.556 --> 00:42:47.550
 People always wonder what was my favorite moment. 

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.586
 I do not know if it may be your favorite moment, 

00:42:49.586 --> 00:42:52.576
 But, man, he was the one I'll never forget. 

00:42:52.576 --> 00:42:57.523
 I think it was the Ninja world on roller coaster, 

00:42:57.523 --> 00:42:59.550
 One of the rules was to make the show live, 

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:00.580
 and all worlds were supposed to work, 

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.519
 And if they stopped working at some point, 

00:43:02.519 --> 00:43:03.573
 We came back to show the recorded material, 

00:43:03.573 --> 00:43:05.590
 And that was very scandalous. 

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.576
 So we had that Ninja onstage, 

00:43:07.576 --> 00:43:09.546
 And he drives on the roller coaster, 

00:43:09.546 --> 00:43:11.583
 And the world crashed "not gently". 

00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:13.519
 Whoosh. 

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:14.553
 I went out, 

00:43:14.553 --> 00:43:16.540
 I think it was Steve Audia, did not it? 

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.519
 Where is? 

00:43:18.519 --> 00:43:19.560
 OK, where's Steve? 

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.519
 AH, my man, Steve Audia. 

00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:24.546
 Talk to me about speeding, okay? 

00:43:24.546 --> 00:43:27.526
 He told him, "Steve, I'm sorry, but your world has collapsed, 

00:43:27.526 --> 00:43:30.500
 We will include the Video tape. " 

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.536
 And he pulled out his ninja sword and shouted, 

00:43:33.536 --> 00:43:34.573
 "I'm embezzled! WHA!" 

00:43:34.573 --> 00:43:36.526
 And just falls. 

00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:39.519
 [lsmijeh i aplauz] 

00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:48.509
 And I think he's talking a lot 

00:43:48.509 --> 00:43:49.526
 how is my favorite moment 

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:51.506
 in ten years of this subject with high technology 

00:43:51.506 --> 00:43:53.519
 this brilliant improvisation. 

00:43:53.519 --> 00:43:55.583
 After the recording ended and the lights turned on, 

00:43:55.583 --> 00:44:00.553
 he lies stationary there, and his colleagues pull him away. 

00:44:00.553 --> 00:44:05.546
 It was a fantastic time. 

00:44:05.546 --> 00:44:07.563
 And there was a lot of people connecting to the course. 

00:44:07.563 --> 00:44:08.583
 People knew to ask, Do you know, 

00:44:08.583 --> 00:44:10.540
 "What will result in a good world?" 

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.596
 He would have told them, "I do not know how to tell you in advance, 

00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:13.540
 "But shortly before the presentation, 

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.573
 "I can tell you if the world is good 

00:44:14.573 --> 00:44:16.500
 "by the body's speech. 

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.566
 "If they are close to each other, 

00:44:17.566 --> 00:44:19.596
 the world is good. " 

00:44:19.596 --> 00:44:23.523
 Creating virtual worlds was a pioneer subject. 

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.533
 I will not be bored with all the details, 

00:44:30.533 --> 00:44:33.576
 But it was not easy to do it, 

00:44:33.576 --> 00:44:36.563
 I got this when I came down from the head of the head, 

00:44:36.563 --> 00:44:38.523
 and I think it's significant. 

00:44:38.523 --> 00:44:40.516
 If you're going to do any pioneering job, 

00:44:40.516 --> 00:44:41.583
 you will get those arrows in your back, 

00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:43.519
 And you just have to screw it up. 

00:44:43.519 --> 00:44:45.523
 I mean, all that could go wrong, went wrong. 

00:44:45.523 --> 00:44:46.583
 but at the end of the road, 

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:51.503
 a lot of people had fun. 

00:44:51.503 --> 00:44:52.543
 When you have something 

00:44:52.543 --> 00:44:55.513
 ten years, and so daringly precious, 

00:44:55.513 --> 00:44:56.556
 it's the toughest in the world 

00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:58.543
 to surrender, 

00:44:58.543 --> 00:44:59.586
 and the only advice I can give you is, 

00:44:59.586 --> 00:45:03.506
 find someone better than you to surrender, 

00:45:03.506 --> 00:45:04.543
 That's what I did. 

00:45:04.543 --> 00:45:08.583
 That kid had long been in the studio for virtual reality, 

00:45:08.583 --> 00:45:10.533
 and you should not spend much time 

00:45:10.533 --> 00:45:12.580
 near Jesse Schnella to say, 

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.593
 "The force is strong in this." 

00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:17.566
 And one of my biggest-- 

00:45:17.566 --> 00:45:20.509
 my two greatest achievements, we, for Carnegie Mellon 

00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:21.593
 is what I got to Isac Hodgins and Jesse Schnella 

00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:23.533
 to come here and join our faculty, 

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:25.550
 And I was thrilled that I could hand it over to Jesse, 

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.513
 And to no surprise, 

00:45:27.513 --> 00:45:29.523
 he took the whole thing a line further, 

00:45:29.523 --> 00:45:32.550
 and the object is in more good hands. 

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.536
 He's in better hands. 

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:37.560
 But that was just one item, 

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.516
 And then we really raised the thing, 

00:45:40.516 --> 00:45:45.519
 and create what I like to call a dream-filled factory. 

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:47.583
 Don Martinelli and I got together, 

00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:50.563
 and with the blessing and support of the university, 

00:45:50.563 --> 00:45:53.509
 make that thing out of pure fabric 

00:45:53.509 --> 00:45:54.583
 which was absolutely crazy, 

00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:56.590
 it did not have to try it. 

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.580
 All reasonable universities did not even approach this thing, 

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.536
 Creating an incredible opportunistic gaps. 

00:46:06.536 --> 00:46:08.500
 So the entertainment technology center 

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.560
 They were knocking on artists and technologists 

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.583
 who worked in small teams to do things. 

00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:14.519
 It was a two-year master's degree, 

00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:17.509
 Don and I were two kind souls. 

00:46:17.509 --> 00:46:18.523
 We are very different. 

00:46:18.523 --> 00:46:19.526
 Anyone who knows us knows 

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:22.526
 how are we two very different people, 

00:46:22.526 --> 00:46:24.536
 And I like doing things in a new way, 

00:46:24.536 --> 00:46:25.573
 And the real truth is 

00:46:25.573 --> 00:46:28.503
 that we both feel a bit more relaxed in the academy. 

00:46:28.503 --> 00:46:29.596
 I used to say I feel uncomfortable as an academic 

00:46:29.596 --> 00:46:31.550
 because I come from long lines of people 

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:36.563
 who really worked for life, so ... 

00:46:36.563 --> 00:46:38.583
 [laughter] 

00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:42.543
 I notice a nervous laugh. 

00:46:42.543 --> 00:46:43.596
 I want to emphasize that, Carnegie Mellon 

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:45.523
 the only place in the world 

00:46:45.523 --> 00:46:46.586
 where the entertainment technology center (ETC) could develop, 

00:46:46.586 --> 00:46:48.580
 far from all, the only place. 

00:46:52.536 --> 00:46:57.536
 OK, this picture is not Don's idea, okay? 

00:46:57.536 --> 00:46:58.586
 And we like to address this image 

00:46:58.586 --> 00:47:05.503
 like Don Marinelli on the guitar and Randy Pausch on the keys. 

00:47:05.503 --> 00:47:07.509
 But we really did manage to play the left half of the game, the right half of the brain, 

00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:08.586
 And it was supposed to get a good profit in that way. 

00:47:08.586 --> 00:47:12.546
 Don is an intense man. 

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:15.540
 [laughter and applause] 

00:47:18.556 --> 00:47:22.543
 Don and I shared the office, 

00:47:22.543 --> 00:47:24.563
 At first it was a small office. 

00:47:24.563 --> 00:47:29.506
 We've been working for six years, okay? 

00:47:29.506 --> 00:47:32.580
 All of you who know Dona know that he is a very fierce man, 

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.563
 And you know, considering my present condition, 

00:47:34.563 --> 00:47:36.596
 someone asked me-- It's a terrible joke, 

00:47:36.596 --> 00:47:39.563
 but I will apologize, 

00:47:39.563 --> 00:47:41.540
 Because I know that Don will forgive me. 

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.530
 Someone asked, "Taking into account your present condition, 

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.556
 "Have you been thinking about it 

00:47:44.556 --> 00:47:46.583
 do you go to heaven or hell? " 

00:47:46.583 --> 00:47:48.583
 I replied, "I do not know, but if I go to hell, 

00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:52.573
 for six years I have already served. " 

00:47:52.573 --> 00:47:54.550
 I'm joking. 

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.506
 Share a office with Done 

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:59.506
 it was like sharing a tornado office. 

00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:00.536
 There was so much energy, 

00:48:00.536 --> 00:48:04.506
 And you never know what the next thing is going to be right, right? 

00:48:04.506 --> 00:48:07.580
 But you knew that something exciting would happen, 

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.513
 And there was so much energy, 

00:48:10.513 --> 00:48:13.509
 And I believe that credit should be recognized where they are deserved. 

00:48:13.509 --> 00:48:15.566
 So if I show it in my typical, visual way, 

00:48:15.566 --> 00:48:18.550
 if Don and I shared the ETC success, 

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.500
 it is without doubt a lion's share. 

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.516
 He deserved to do the lion's share of the job okay. 

00:48:22.516 --> 00:48:23.590
 He had a lion's share of ideas. 

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:25.503
 It was a great team work. 

00:48:25.503 --> 00:48:26.566
 It was a great Yin and Yang combination, 

00:48:26.566 --> 00:48:30.523
 But it was more like "YIN" and yang. 

00:48:30.523 --> 00:48:32.516
 It deserves that confession, and I give it to him, 

00:48:32.516 --> 00:48:34.509
 because the ETC is a wonderful place, 

00:48:34.509 --> 00:48:37.509
 and he now leads him, and takes him to a global level. 

00:48:37.509 --> 00:48:38.580
 We'll talk about that for a second. 

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.566
 The description of the ETC is really difficult, 

00:48:40.566 --> 00:48:42.533
 And ultimately I found the metaphor. 

00:48:42.533 --> 00:48:44.536
 Talk to people about the ETC 

00:48:44.536 --> 00:48:46.506
 is like describing CIRQUE DU SOLEIL 

00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:47.540
 to someone who has never seen him. 

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.533
 Sooner or later you will make a mistake. 

00:48:49.533 --> 00:48:50.570
 You will say, "Well, it's like a circus." 

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.513
 And then take you to a talk about, 

00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:53.560
 "Oh, how many tigers there are; how many lions there are; 

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.580
 okay, how many points on the trapeze? " 

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.506
 And that's the whole bit. 

00:48:57.506 --> 00:48:58.563
 So when we say we are graduating for a master's degree, 

00:48:58.563 --> 00:48:59.586
 we are not really like 

00:48:59.586 --> 00:49:01.540
 A single master degree degree you've ever seen. 

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.563
 Here's the curriculum. 

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.593
 The curriculum eventually took on this form. 

00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:12.580
 I just want to show you visually 

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.596
 as are five projects that deal with the creation of virtual worlds. 

00:49:14.596 --> 00:49:16.536
 There are three more things to do. 

00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:19.550
 All time is spent in small teams, doing things, 

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.590
 There is no 'learning from the book'. 

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.503
 Don and I did not have the patience to learn from the book. 

00:49:23.503 --> 00:49:24.546
 It's got masters degrees. 

00:49:24.546 --> 00:49:26.543
 They have spent four years learning from the book. 

00:49:26.543 --> 00:49:31.566
 All right, so far, they should have read all the books. 

00:49:31.566 --> 00:49:32.586
 The keys to success were 

00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:36.563
 what Carnegie Mellon gave to us, 

00:49:36.563 --> 00:49:38.506
 He gave his hand in his hand. 

00:49:38.506 --> 00:49:39.550
 We should not give a statement to any dean. 

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.596
 We reported directly to the pro-Rector, 

00:49:40.596 --> 00:49:42.543
 What's great, since it's a redirector 

00:49:42.543 --> 00:49:45.550
 overwhelmed to watch you carefully. 

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.506
 We got a clear permission to break the mold. 

00:49:48.506 --> 00:49:49.533
 Everything was based on the project. 

00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:50.533
 It was intense. 

00:49:50.533 --> 00:49:52.553
 It was fun, and we had field trips. 

00:49:52.553 --> 00:49:54.553
 Each spring semester in January, 

00:49:54.553 --> 00:49:56.570
 would take all 50 students from the first year, 

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.556
 and took them to the PIXAR store (idea). 

00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:00.553
 They would take them to PIXAR, INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC, 

00:50:00.553 --> 00:50:01.590
 And of course when you know guys 

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:04.580
 like Tommy who hosts you there, sign, 

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.523
 It's pretty easy to get in to such places. 

00:50:07.523 --> 00:50:09.596
 So, we did things very, very differently. 

00:50:09.596 --> 00:50:11.560
 Such projects as the students would do, 

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.546
 We did a lot of what we called EDU-TAINMENT. 

00:50:14.546 --> 00:50:15.566
 We've rolled out a bunch of stuff 

00:50:15.566 --> 00:50:17.523
 with the New York Fire Department, 

00:50:17.523 --> 00:50:19.516
 A network simulator for firefighters training, 

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.516
 using technology similar to that for video games 

00:50:21.516 --> 00:50:23.513
 to teach people useful things. 

00:50:23.513 --> 00:50:25.533
 That is not bad. 

00:50:25.533 --> 00:50:26.580
 Companies have begun to treasure a strange thing. 

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:31.546
 They put it in writing, "We promise we'll hire your students." 

00:50:31.546 --> 00:50:33.516
 I keep here letters from EA and ACTIVISION. 

00:50:33.516 --> 00:50:36.523
 I think we now have such, five, five? 

00:50:36.523 --> 00:50:38.543
 Drew knows, I bet. 

00:50:38.543 --> 00:50:40.506
 So there are five written agreements. 

00:50:40.506 --> 00:50:41.553
 I do not even know about another school 

00:50:41.553 --> 00:50:43.573
 who has such a written agreement with any company, 

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:45.526
 and that is the right expression. 

00:50:45.526 --> 00:50:46.573
 And these are the things that matter for many years, 

00:50:46.573 --> 00:50:48.519
 So they agree to hire people 

00:50:48.519 --> 00:50:50.583
 on summer internships that we have not yet received in school. 

00:50:50.583 --> 00:50:52.519
 That's a pretty powerful message 

00:50:52.519 --> 00:50:54.516
 about the quality of this program. 

00:50:54.516 --> 00:50:56.580
 And Don, as I said, He is now-- He's crazy. 

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.536
 And I think it is a wonderful, commendable way. 

00:50:59.536 --> 00:51:03.519
 Doing those things to me, "Oh, my God." 

00:51:03.519 --> 00:51:05.573
 Tonight is not here because it is in Singapore, 

00:51:05.573 --> 00:51:08.530
 Because he is going to set up an ETC study at the University of Singapore. 

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:09.573
 It already exists in Australia, 

00:51:09.573 --> 00:51:11.516
 And one will exist in Korea. 

00:51:11.516 --> 00:51:12.590
 It therefore becomes a global phenomenon. 

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:14.550
 I think that says a lot 

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.590
 about all other universities. 

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.546
 It is true that Carnegie Mellon is 

00:51:17.546 --> 00:51:19.506
 the only university that can do something like this. 

00:51:19.506 --> 00:51:23.543
 The only thing we need to do now is around the world. 

00:51:23.543 --> 00:51:25.513
 Another great success with the ETC 

00:51:25.513 --> 00:51:27.576
 is learning to be angry to focus-- 

00:51:27.576 --> 00:51:32.536
 Oh, I hear the nervous laughter of students. 

00:51:32.536 --> 00:51:34.536
 I forgot what a shock therapeutic effect 

00:51:34.536 --> 00:51:36.523
 these bar charts. 

00:51:36.523 --> 00:51:38.516
 While the subject of Building Virtual Worlds is taking place, 

00:51:38.516 --> 00:51:39.583
 Every two weeks is received for each feedback. 

00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:41.536
 This is all put on a big pile, 

00:51:41.536 --> 00:51:42.576
 and at the end of the semester, 

00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:44.550
 he had three teammates per project, 

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:45.556
 five projects. 

00:51:45.556 --> 00:51:46.560
 this is 15 data points. 

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.586
 which is a statistically valid quantity. 

00:51:47.586 --> 00:51:50.536
 And you get a column column telling about your placement 

00:51:50.536 --> 00:51:51.563
 about how easy it is to work with you, 

00:51:51.563 --> 00:51:54.536
 How do you measure with other peers? 

00:51:54.536 --> 00:51:57.560
 Man, such a rating is hard to ignore. 

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.500
 Some still succeeded. 

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.540
 [laughter] 

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.550
 But in most cases, people would look at it and say to themselves, 

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.563
 "You, I need to boost the pace. 

00:52:07.563 --> 00:52:09.546
 "It's better to start thinking about what I'm talking about 

00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:10.570
 people at those meetings. " 

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.540
 And that is the greatest gift the educator can give 

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.546
 Encourage someone to become self-critical. 

00:52:16.546 --> 00:52:17.590
 The ETC is beautiful, 

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.560
 but even with ETC and with DON that spreads it around the world, 

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.519
 It's a very hard job, you know. 

00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:26.563
 It's not like Tommy's case that one man works. 

00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:29.516
 it is not about a development group of ten people. 

00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:32.583
 It is 50 or 100 people per faculty of four faculties. 

00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:36.573
 But I wanted something that could be infinitely enlarged, okay? 

00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:38.540
 Enlarge to the level where the million 

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.523
 or tens of millions of people 

00:52:40.523 --> 00:52:42.573
 you can hunt your dreams with something. 

00:52:42.573 --> 00:52:44.593
 And, you know, it seems to have that goal 

00:52:44.593 --> 00:52:48.506
 I really act like a crazy hat. 

00:52:48.506 --> 00:52:53.580
 ALICE is a project we have been working for a long, long time. 

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.596
 It's a new way of learning computer programming. 

00:52:56.596 --> 00:52:58.540
 Kids make films and games, 

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.560
 e - again, we got back to the head. 

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.543
 The Best Way to Learn Someone 

00:53:02.543 --> 00:53:05.509
 to make them think they learn something else. 

00:53:05.509 --> 00:53:06.566
 I do it through my entire career. 

00:53:06.566 --> 00:53:08.593
 The boss's head here is what they learn to program, 

00:53:08.593 --> 00:53:11.519
 but think they just learn to do movies and video games. 

00:53:11.519 --> 00:53:12.583
 That thing has already been downloaded 

00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:14.523
 got over a million times. 

00:53:14.523 --> 00:53:16.553
 The eight manuals are written about it. 

00:53:16.553 --> 00:53:18.536
 10% of us university members are just using it, 

00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:20.546
 And that is not the real thing either. 

00:53:20.546 --> 00:53:25.536
 Things are coming in the next version. 

00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:27.586
 I, like Moses, have a look at the promised land, 

00:53:27.586 --> 00:53:30.566
 I will not go on it, 

00:53:30.566 --> 00:53:33.566
 but that's fine because I can see it, 

00:53:33.566 --> 00:53:36.530
 and the vision is clear: 

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:41.506
 Millions of kids who are having fun while learning something hard. 

00:53:41.506 --> 00:53:43.500
 That's pretty cool. 

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.519
 I can handle it as a legacy. 

00:53:45.519 --> 00:53:46.596
 The next version of the program will be released in 2008. 

00:53:46.596 --> 00:53:48.566
 They will learn programming in JAVA programming language 

00:53:48.566 --> 00:53:50.550
 If you want to know how to learn JAVA. 

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.570
 Otherwise it will simply think 

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.553
 How to write a script for the movie. 

00:53:53.553 --> 00:53:56.573
 And we take the characters 

00:53:56.573 --> 00:53:59.583
 from the best-selling PC games in history, "THE SIMS." 

00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:01.590
 And all this already works in the lab, 

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.536
 So there is no real technological risk. 

00:54:04.536 --> 00:54:06.536
 I have no time to thank and mention everything 

00:54:06.536 --> 00:54:07.560
 from the ALICE team, 

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.533
 But I would like to say that Dennis Cosgove 

00:54:09.533 --> 00:54:11.536
 to build it, it already builds it. 

00:54:11.536 --> 00:54:12.586
 he is a designer. 

00:54:12.586 --> 00:54:16.516
 it is his baby, and for all who are wondering, 

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:18.503
 "Well, you know, for a few months, 

00:54:18.503 --> 00:54:20.503
 who should contact the email regarding the ALICE project, " 

00:54:20.503 --> 00:54:22.563
 Where's the marvelous Dann? 

00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:23.576
 Oh, there you are. 

00:54:23.576 --> 00:54:25.596
 Get up, let everyone see you. 

00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.546
 Everybody say, "Hello, Wanda." 

00:54:27.546 --> 00:54:29.543
 all: Hello, Wanda. 

00:54:29.543 --> 00:54:32.516
 Pausch: send her an e-mail. 

00:54:32.516 --> 00:54:34.530
 And I'll still tell you something about Caitlin Kelleher, 

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:36.526
 She completed her doctorate 

00:54:36.526 --> 00:54:37.583
 and is located at the University of Washington, 

00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:39.550
 and she will do this a little bit further 

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:41.519
 and go to high school. 

00:54:41.519 --> 00:54:44.580
 Dagle, a great vision, and its continuation 

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.530
 If you can live in something, 

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.576
 I will continue to live through the ALICE project. 

00:54:48.576 --> 00:54:50.550
 All right, and now the third part of speech, 

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.583
 Lessons Learned. 

00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:53.536
 We talked about my dreams. 

00:54:53.536 --> 00:54:56.503
 We talked about helping others to realize their dreams. 

00:54:56.503 --> 00:54:57.530
 Somewhere along that road, 

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:58.560
 there must be some insight 

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.533
 in allowing you to realize your dreams. 

00:55:02.533 --> 00:55:05.573
 First, there is the role of parents, mentors, and students. 

00:55:05.573 --> 00:55:10.586
 I was blessed to be born into the family of two incredible people. 

00:55:10.586 --> 00:55:15.523
 is my mother in my 70's birthday. 

00:55:15.523 --> 00:55:16.573
 I'm back here. 

00:55:16.573 --> 00:55:20.546
 He just overcame me. 

00:55:20.546 --> 00:55:24.593
 This is my dad on the slope of death on his 80th birthday, 

00:55:24.593 --> 00:55:28.516
 He states that, you know, he is not only brave; 

00:55:28.516 --> 00:55:29.556
 Even as he was talented, 

00:55:29.556 --> 00:55:32.593
 Because he also won the big bear that same day. 

00:55:32.593 --> 00:55:36.586
 My dad was full of life. 

00:55:36.586 --> 00:55:38.546
 Whatever he did with it was an adventure. 

00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:42.526
 I do not know what's in that bag, but I know it's a law. 

00:55:42.526 --> 00:55:45.550
 My tat dressed in Santa Claus, 

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:50.500
 But he also made very important things 

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.560
 to help many people. 

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:55.519
 This is a dormitory in Thailand signed by my mom and dad, 

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.546
 And every year, about 30 students go to school 

00:55:58.546 --> 00:55:59.573
 Which could not possibly be. 

00:55:59.573 --> 00:56:01.500
 That's something 

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.590
 in what we are deeply involved in and my wife and I, 

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.540
 and that is the kind of thing 

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.583
 which I think everyone should do, help others. 

00:56:07.583 --> 00:56:10.516
 But the best story we have about our father-- 

00:56:10.516 --> 00:56:11.560
 Unfortunately, my dad passed away 

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.590
 Just a little over a year ago, 

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.570
 And when we looked at his things-- 

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:16.590
 He fought in World War II in the Battle for Bulge-- 

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.563
 and when we reviewed his stuff, 

00:56:18.563 --> 00:56:22.586
 we discovered that he was honored with a bronze star of heroism. 

00:56:22.586 --> 00:56:24.570
 My mother did not know that. 

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:31.519
 In 50 years of marriage, it never came to an end. 

00:56:31.519 --> 00:56:32.563
 My mom. 

00:56:32.563 --> 00:56:37.516
 Moms are the people who love you even when you bite them for hair. 

00:56:37.516 --> 00:56:39.526
 And I have two great stories about Mom. 

00:56:39.526 --> 00:56:41.543
 While I was studying here to earn my doctorate 

00:56:41.543 --> 00:56:44.533
 and while I took something called Theoretical Qualification, 

00:56:44.533 --> 00:56:45.596
 For what I can definitely say 

00:56:45.596 --> 00:56:49.536
 that is the second worst thing in my life after chemotherapy ... 

00:56:49.536 --> 00:56:52.573
 [laughter] 

00:56:52.573 --> 00:56:54.553
 And I complained to my mother 

00:56:54.553 --> 00:56:56.519
 about how difficult this exam is 

00:56:56.519 --> 00:56:58.576
 and how horrible it was, and she just bowed, 

00:56:58.576 --> 00:57:00.536
 he patted me by the hand, and said, 

00:57:00.536 --> 00:57:02.556
 "We know how you feel, sweetheart, and remember, 

00:57:02.556 --> 00:57:05.533
 when your father was your age, he fought against the Gentiles. " 

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.526
 [laughter] 

00:57:12.566 --> 00:57:15.523
 After I got my doctor, my mother enjoyed it 

00:57:15.523 --> 00:57:17.503
 to represent me like, "This is my son. 

00:57:17.503 --> 00:57:19.573
 He's a doctor, but not the one who helps people. " 

00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:22.566
 [laughter] 

00:57:25.513 --> 00:57:26.563
 These slides are a bit dark, 

00:57:26.563 --> 00:57:28.593
 But while I was in high school, I decided to paint my room. 

00:57:28.593 --> 00:57:32.566
 I've always wanted a submarine and an elevator. 

00:57:32.566 --> 00:57:34.583
 And the wonderful thing about this is-- 

00:57:34.583 --> 00:57:37.576
 [laughter] 

00:57:40.543 --> 00:57:42.586
 What to say? 

00:57:42.586 --> 00:57:44.526
 And the wonderful thing about this one is, 

00:57:44.526 --> 00:57:46.500
 that they allowed me, 

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.550
 And they did not get upset about it, 

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.516
 and it's still there. 

00:57:49.516 --> 00:57:51.556
 If you go to my parents' house, it's still there. 

00:57:51.556 --> 00:57:53.543
 And to all who are here and who are their parents, 

00:57:53.543 --> 00:57:55.576
 if he wants a child to paint his bedroom, 

00:57:55.576 --> 00:57:58.519
 as a service to me, allow him that, okay? 

00:57:58.519 --> 00:57:59.593
 Everything will be fine. 

00:57:59.593 --> 00:58:03.563
 Do not worry about the house's sales value. 

00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:06.566
 Other people who help us with our parents: our teachers, 

00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:09.560
 our mentors, our friends, our colleagues. 

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.540
 God, what about Andy Van Dam? 

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.570
 While I was burning at Brown, he was on leave, 

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.519
 And all I was listening to was Andy Van Dam. 

00:58:18.519 --> 00:58:21.509
 He was like a mythical creature, like Centaur, 

00:58:21.509 --> 00:58:24.506
 But as a really ruthless centaur, 

00:58:24.506 --> 00:58:26.566
 And they were all, kind, very sad 

00:58:26.566 --> 00:58:31.583
 which is not but there is more relaxed in one hand, 

00:58:31.583 --> 00:58:33.500
 and I learned why, 

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.576
 So I started working for Andy. 

00:58:34.576 --> 00:58:36.570
 I was assistant lecturer during the 2nd year of study, 

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.586
 and I was a pretty arrogant young man, 

00:58:38.586 --> 00:58:41.596
 And I came during the evening, 

00:58:41.596 --> 00:58:43.530
 and of course, it was 9:00 pm, 

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:44.570
 Andy was there in the evening, 

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:45.580
 what's your first indication 

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.563
 about what the professor was. 

00:58:47.563 --> 00:58:49.570
 And I went inside, and, you know, 

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:51.526
 I was like - I'll save the whole world. 

00:58:51.526 --> 00:58:52.593
 All these children are waiting for help, 

00:58:52.593 --> 00:58:54.550
 blah blah, blah blah, blah blah, blah blah. 

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:57.513
 And after that, Andy literally flipped me (in the style of "Dutch uncle") - he's a Dutchman, okay? 

00:58:57.513 --> 00:58:58.526
 He frowned upon me, 

00:58:58.526 --> 00:58:59.580
 He put his hand over my shoulders, 

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.596
 We went to a small walk, 

00:59:00.596 --> 00:59:04.536
 when he said, "Randy, that's a pity 

00:59:04.536 --> 00:59:09.536
 "what these people experience arrogant, 

00:59:09.536 --> 00:59:11.586
 "because it will limit 

00:59:11.586 --> 00:59:15.570
 what you can do in life. " 

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:19.566
 How damn good way to say "You act like a monkey." 

00:59:19.566 --> 00:59:20.596
 Is it? 

00:59:20.596 --> 00:59:22.530
 He did not say "You're a jerk." 

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:24.509
 He said, "People are experiencing you that way," 

00:59:24.509 --> 00:59:26.503
 and he continued, "the bad side is, which will limit it 

00:59:26.503 --> 00:59:28.540
 what you will be able to achieve. " 

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.590
 When I met Andy better, plunder became more direct. 

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:35.570
 [laughter] 

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:37.543
 I could talk to you about Andy for a month, 

00:59:37.543 --> 00:59:39.580
 But the one I'll apologize for is from the time I was supposed to 

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.513
 start thinking about what I'm going to do 

00:59:41.513 --> 00:59:42.536
 After graduating from Brown, 

00:59:42.536 --> 00:59:44.513
 I would never have been in million years 

00:59:44.513 --> 00:59:46.550
 to go to postgraduate, from my own imagination. 

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:49.536
 It was not a kind of thing people made of my family. 

00:59:49.536 --> 00:59:50.580
 We did, say, how do you call them? 

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.500
 Jobs. 

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.566
 Andy said, "No, do not go to work. 

00:59:55.566 --> 00:59:57.560
 Go to your doctor. Become a professor. " 

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.519
 I asked him, "Why?" 

00:59:59.519 --> 01:00:03.530
 And he said, "Because you're so good a salesperson 

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.563
 "that every company that gets you 

01:00:04.563 --> 01:00:06.566
 "Use it as a trader, 

01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:09.519
 "And the last case could sell 

01:00:09.519 --> 01:00:12.513
 something that is worth it like education. " 

01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:20.516
 Thank you. 

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:23.536
 Andy was my first boss, so to speak. 

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:26.563
 I was lucky enough to have many bosses. 

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:27.596
 The red circle is far off. 

01:00:27.596 --> 01:00:30.563
 Al is located here. 

01:00:30.563 --> 01:00:33.516
 I have no idea what happened there (on slides). 

01:00:33.516 --> 01:00:35.513
 Probably this looks over the internet video transmission and speaks, 

01:00:35.513 --> 01:00:40.553
 "My God, he is fired, and he is still unaware of it!" 

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.566
 I do not want to talk much about the great bosses I had 

01:00:42.566 --> 01:00:44.546
 In addition to saying they were great, 

01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:46.590
 And I know that many people in the world had bad bosses, 

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.590
 and I did not have to endure that experience, 

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:50.563
 and I am very grateful to all people 

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.506
 to which I should have to carry out the examiner. 

01:00:52.506 --> 01:00:53.570
 They were simply unbelievable. 

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.563
 But it's not just about our bosses. 

01:00:55.563 --> 01:00:56.583
 We also learn from our students. 

01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:58.573
 I think it's the best "headshot" of all 

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:00.526
 came from Caitlin Kelleher-- 

01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:03.503
 Forgive me, Dr. Caitlin Kelleher-- 

01:01:03.503 --> 01:01:04.513
 which graduated from college right here 

01:01:04.513 --> 01:01:05.583
 and starts working at the Washington University, 

01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:07.550
 She looked at ALICE 

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.526
 While there was an easier version for learning programming, 

01:01:09.526 --> 01:01:11.576
 and she said, "Yes, but why would that be fun?" 

01:01:11.576 --> 01:01:14.536
 And I have an attitude, "Well, because I'm an impassioned man. 

01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:16.536
 "I love to move small toy soldiers around 

01:01:16.536 --> 01:01:19.550
 when they do it on my command, and that's fun. " 

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.550
 She imagined, "Hmm." 

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:22.596
 And she was the only one she said, 

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:25.586
 "No, we'll get to it all as a story story." 

01:01:25.586 --> 01:01:28.566
 And she did a fantastic piece of show that, 

01:01:28.566 --> 01:01:30.526
 especially with high school girls, 

01:01:30.526 --> 01:01:32.506
 if you present it as a story-telling activity, 

01:01:32.506 --> 01:01:33.550
 They are completely willing to learn 

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:35.503
 how to write computer programs. 

01:01:35.503 --> 01:01:38.503
 So the reward for the best winch slaps 

01:01:38.503 --> 01:01:42.506
 goes to the dissertation of Caitlin Kelleher. 

01:01:42.506 --> 01:01:43.573
 (Professor) President Cohon, when I told him 

01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:44.593
 that I will hold this lecture, 

01:01:44.593 --> 01:01:48.516
 he told me, "Please excuse them for fun, 

01:01:48.516 --> 01:01:52.513
 Because you remember that. " 

01:01:52.513 --> 01:01:54.516
 I replied, "I can do it, but it's like a fish 

01:01:54.516 --> 01:01:57.506
 talks about the importance of water. " 

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.593
 I want to say I do not know how to do not have fun. 

01:01:59.593 --> 01:02:03.519
 All right, I'm dying, and I'm having fun, 

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:07.593
 And I will continue to have fun every day that has left me, 

01:02:07.593 --> 01:02:10.546
 Because there is no different way to do that. 

01:02:10.546 --> 01:02:11.573
 Alright? 

01:02:11.573 --> 01:02:13.586
 So my next tip, 

01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:15.576
 You just have to decide Are you a Tigger (happy figure tiger) 

01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:17.560
 or you are Eeyore (a shabby sling figure). 

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.566
 I think it's clear where I stojikm 

01:02:19.566 --> 01:02:24.553
 As for the big Tigger-Eeyore debate. 

01:02:24.553 --> 01:02:28.503
 Never miss a peculiar amazement. 

01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:29.563
 It's just too important. 

01:02:29.563 --> 01:02:31.519
 It moves us forward. 

01:02:31.519 --> 01:02:33.550
 Help others. 

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.560
 Denny Profitt knows more about helping other people. 

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.580
 He forgot more than I would ever know. 

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.593
 He taught me his example of how to work with a group of people, 

01:02:40.593 --> 01:02:42.576
 How to marry people. 

01:02:42.576 --> 01:02:43.590
 MK Haley-- I have a theory 

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:45.553
 that people coming from large families 

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:46.583
 better people, 

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.583
 because they simply had to learn how to live with others. 

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:52.516
 MK Haley comes from a family who had 20 children. 

01:02:52.516 --> 01:02:54.596
 Yeah, incredible. 

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:57.583
 He always says, "It's kind of fun to do incredible things." 

01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:59.523
 When I first came to Imagineering, 

01:02:59.523 --> 01:03:01.509
 She was one of the people who measured me, 

01:03:01.509 --> 01:03:02.560
 and she said, "How do I understand 

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.509
 "you joined the ALADDIN project. 

01:03:04.509 --> 01:03:05.573
 What can you do? " 

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:08.556
 I said, "Well, I'm a professor of computer science with an indefinite contract." 

01:03:08.556 --> 01:03:10.580
 And she said, "Well, that's a very nice professor boy, 

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.530
 "but that's not what I asked. 

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.586
 I asked, 'What do you know how to work?' " 

01:03:13.586 --> 01:03:16.580
 [laughter] 

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:26.540
 And, you know, I mentioned in some way, your roots from the working class. 

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.556
 We keep what we value, what we value, 

01:03:28.556 --> 01:03:30.576
 and I kept my Letterman jacket all this year. 

01:03:30.576 --> 01:03:33.503
 I liked to wear it during undergraduate studies, 

01:03:33.503 --> 01:03:36.593
 One of my friends, Jessica Hodgins, would ask, 

01:03:36.593 --> 01:03:39.506
 "Why do you wear that Letterman jacket?" 

01:03:39.506 --> 01:03:41.556
 Then I would look at all non-athletic guys around 

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:46.523
 who were much smarter than me, and said, "Because I can." 

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:49.513
 She understood this as a true coffin, 

01:03:49.513 --> 01:03:53.516
 Well, for one year she made this little wrinkled Randy doll. 

01:03:53.516 --> 01:03:55.556
 And he has a little Lettermen jacket. 

01:03:55.556 --> 01:03:57.530
 He loves me all the time. 

01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:01.509
 It is a perfect gift for egomanians from your life. 

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:06.533
 So that I met wonderful people during my life. 

01:04:06.533 --> 01:04:08.519
 Faithfulness is a two-way road. 

01:04:08.519 --> 01:04:10.516
 There was a young man named Dennis Cosgrove 

01:04:10.516 --> 01:04:16.513
 at Virginia University, and while he was a young boy, 

01:04:16.513 --> 01:04:20.500
 Let's just say that some things have happened, 

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:24.590
 and I found myself in conversation with the dean, and the dean-- 

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:28.523
 No, with that dean. 

01:04:28.523 --> 01:04:30.516
 Anyway, this dean really intended to Dennis, 

01:04:30.516 --> 01:04:31.516
 and I could never Fudge why, 

01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:32.519
 because Dennis was a fine guy, 

01:04:32.519 --> 01:04:33.519
 but for some reason, 

01:04:33.519 --> 01:04:34.556
 that dean really had a pimple. 

01:04:34.556 --> 01:04:36.576
 And he ended up talking to me, "No, I guarantee Dennis." 

01:04:36.576 --> 01:04:38.586
 And that guy says, "You have not yet got a working contract for a permanent, 

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:41.526
 and you tell me you're gonna guarantee 

01:04:41.526 --> 01:04:43.506
 for this student the second or the first kind that has been in the past year? " 

01:04:43.506 --> 01:04:44.540
 I think he left the first year at that time. 

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.500
 I said, "Yes, I will guarantee for him, 

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.530
 because I believe in him. " 

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.523
 And the dean said, "And I'll remember it 

01:04:49.523 --> 01:04:51.513
 When your contract is signed for an indefinite period of time. " 

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.553
 And I said, "Agreed." 

01:04:52.553 --> 01:04:54.560
 I came back to talk to Dennis and told him, 

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.593
 "I would really appreciate it if you-- it would be okay." 

01:04:59.593 --> 01:05:01.540
 But loyalty is a two-way road. 

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.553
 I want to say, that happened before God knew how many years, 

01:05:03.553 --> 01:05:06.503
 But that's the same Dennis Cosgrove 

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.503
 Which carries the ALICE project forward, forward. 

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:10.526
 He stayed with me all those years, okay. 

01:05:10.526 --> 01:05:12.563
 And, you know, to choose one person 

01:05:12.563 --> 01:05:13.596
 that we send it into space in a space capsule 

01:05:13.596 --> 01:05:19.570
 to make contact with the extraterrestrial, I choose Dennis. 

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:21.526
 Speech at Carnegie Mellon University can not be held 

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:24.553
 without giving recognition to a very special person, 

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:27.506
 and that's Sharon Burks. 

01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:28.530
 I was kidding with her. 

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:29.590
 I told her, "Well, look, if you're retiring, 

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.570
 it is no longer worth living. " 

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:35.523
 [laughter] 

01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:37.586
 Sharon is so wonderful, it can not be described, 

01:05:37.586 --> 01:05:39.590
 and for all of us who helped, 

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.553
 That's unbelievable. 

01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:42.556
 I like this picture, 

01:05:42.556 --> 01:05:44.509
 Because it is located along with Syl, 

01:05:44.509 --> 01:05:45.546
 and Syl is great, 

01:05:45.546 --> 01:05:49.530
 because Syl gave me the best advice 

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:50.570
 which I have ever heard, 

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:53.560
 And I think all these young ladies should hear this. 

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.519
 Syl said, "It took me a long time, 

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:57.519
 "but I realized that much. 

01:05:57.519 --> 01:06:00.596
 "When it comes to men who are romantically interested in you, 

01:06:00.596 --> 01:06:02.576
 "It's really easy. 

01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:05.563
 "Just ignore everything they say 

01:06:05.563 --> 01:06:09.519
 "And just pay attention to what they are doing. 

01:06:09.519 --> 01:06:12.519
 That's easy. It's so easy. " 

01:06:12.519 --> 01:06:14.540
 And I remembered my little days, 

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.500
 And you're saying, "Damn it." 

01:06:20.556 --> 01:06:22.519
 Never give up. 

01:06:22.519 --> 01:06:23.593
 I did not immediately go to Brown University. 

01:06:23.593 --> 01:06:25.566
 I was on the waiting list. 

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:28.596
 I called them, and they finally decided 

01:06:28.596 --> 01:06:31.523
 that I became tiredly boring 

01:06:31.523 --> 01:06:34.509
 because I called every day so they let me in. 

01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:36.526
 At Carnegie Mellon, I did not go to postgraduate studies. 

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:37.526
 Andy was my mentor. 

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:38.550
 He said, "Go to postgraduate studies. 

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:39.596
 "You will go to Carnegie Mellon. 

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:42.573
 All my good students go to Carnegie Mellon. " 

01:06:42.573 --> 01:06:44.560
 And, yeah, you know what's going on. 

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.573
 And so he told me, "You will go to Carnegie Mellon, 

01:06:46.573 --> 01:06:48.506
 no problem." 

01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:50.519
 He forgot that he was a hacker 

01:06:50.519 --> 01:06:52.560
 to enroll in the best PhD program in the country 

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.519
 really grew, 

01:06:54.519 --> 01:06:57.556
 and also did not know that I would undermine my ratings, 

01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:59.503
 because he believed in me, 

01:06:59.503 --> 01:07:00.553
 What, on the basis of my points, 

01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:02.553
 was a really stupid idea, 

01:07:02.553 --> 01:07:04.530
 So I did not go to Carnegie Mellon. 

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:05.540
 No one knows this until today. 

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.556
 I'm telling you a story. 

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.566
 I was refused entry to Carnegie Mellon University, 

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:13.576
 And I behaved somewhat unbearably as a little kid. 

01:07:13.576 --> 01:07:15.513
 I went to Andy's office, 

01:07:15.513 --> 01:07:17.530
 he threw a letter to the desperate Lna desk. 

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:18.580
 and told him, "I just wanted to let you know 

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.566
 "how much your letter of recommendation is worth 

01:07:20.566 --> 01:07:21.593
 on Carnegie Mellon. " 

01:07:21.593 --> 01:07:24.586
 [laughter] 

01:07:29.563 --> 01:07:33.500
 And before the letter touched the desk, 

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.523
 his arm was on the phone, and he said, 

01:07:35.523 --> 01:07:37.550
 "I'll fix it." 

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:41.516
 [laughter] 

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.523
 And I said, "No, No, No, 

01:07:42.523 --> 01:07:43.550
 "I do not want to do that. 

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:44.580
 "It's not the way I got upset. 

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.563
 "You know, maybe some other postgraduate schools 

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.596
 want to promise. "And he said," Look. 

01:07:48.596 --> 01:07:50.586
 Carnegie Mellon is the place to go. " 

01:07:50.586 --> 01:07:52.576
 He said, "You know what, I'll make a deal with you. 

01:07:52.576 --> 01:07:53.596
 Go visit other schools. " 

01:07:53.596 --> 01:07:55.573
 Because I went to all the other schools. 

01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:57.519
 He said, "Go and visit other schools, 

01:07:57.519 --> 01:07:59.540
 "And if you do not feel comfortable in either one, 

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.500
 will you give me then to call Nico? "Nice about Nico Haberman. 

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.550
 And I agree, "OK, agreed." I went to other schools. 

01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:09.513
 Without a specific appointment-- Berkley, Cornell-- 

01:08:09.513 --> 01:08:11.530
 They were there to be so unkind 

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:12.580
 that I found myself talking to Andy, 

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.553
 "You know, I'll get hired." 

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:16.526
 And he said, "No, you will not," 

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:19.519
 He received the phone and spoke in Dutch. 

01:08:19.519 --> 01:08:22.500
 [laughter] 

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.519
 He hung up the phone and said, 

01:08:24.519 --> 01:08:25.593
 "Nico says if you're around this serious, 

01:08:25.593 --> 01:08:30.590
 you'll be in his office tomorrow morning at 8:00. " 

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.543
 For all of you who know Nico, 

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:35.539
 This is really scary. 

01:08:35.539 --> 01:08:36.573
 So I'm in Nico Haberman's office 

01:08:36.573 --> 01:08:37.596
 the next morning at 8:00 pm, 

01:08:37.596 --> 01:08:40.516
 Story with me, and frankly, 

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.573
 I do not seem to grow up for that meeting. 

01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:44.516
 I do not think he's a little enthusiastic either. 

01:08:44.516 --> 01:08:50.523
 And he says, "Randy, why are we here now?" 

01:08:50.523 --> 01:08:54.573
 And I say, "Why did Andy call you?" 

01:08:54.573 --> 01:08:59.516
 And I said, "Well, in the meanwhile since you refused me, 

01:08:59.516 --> 01:09:01.503
 "I won a scholarship. 

01:09:01.503 --> 01:09:02.576
 "The Naval Research Bureau, 

01:09:02.576 --> 01:09:04.530
 "It's a very distinguished society. 

01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:05.550
 "I won a scholarship, 

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:07.560
 and that was not in my papers when filing (on fakltet). " 

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.596
 And Nico replied, "Money from society, we have a lot of money." 

01:09:11.596 --> 01:09:15.563
 That was still at that time. 

01:09:15.563 --> 01:09:17.503
 He said, "We have plenty of money. 

01:09:17.503 --> 01:09:18.586
 "Why do you think that you own a scholarship 

01:09:18.586 --> 01:09:20.573
 is there any difference to us? " 

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:21.593
 And then he looked at me. 

01:09:21.593 --> 01:09:24.536
 There are moments in which life is changing, 

01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:25.573
 and ten years later, 

01:09:25.573 --> 01:09:28.526
 if you retrospectively recognize some of such moments, 

01:09:28.526 --> 01:09:29.566
 you are blessed, 

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:33.570
 But be aware at the very moment 

01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:38.536
 Nico is watching you through the soul ... 

01:09:38.536 --> 01:09:39.576
 Then I replied, "I did not intend to imply 

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:41.513
 "anything related to money. 

01:09:41.513 --> 01:09:42.536
 "I just say that it was an honor to receive it. 

01:09:42.536 --> 01:09:43.590
 "These scholarships were distributed only to 15 across the country, 

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:45.513
 "and I wanted to say it was an honor 

01:09:45.513 --> 01:09:47.583
 "how this is something commendable, 

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:52.513
 and I apologize if it was drastic. " 

01:09:52.513 --> 01:09:55.583
 He smiled, and that was fine. 

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:58.513
 So then, how do you get people to help you out? 

01:09:58.513 --> 01:09:59.539
 You can not get to that myself. 

01:09:59.539 --> 01:10:02.566
 People will help you, and I believe in karma. 

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:03.566
 I believe in backlinks. 

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:04.576
 You get these people to help 

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.573
 telling the truth, honestly. 

01:10:06.573 --> 01:10:10.513
 Each time I prefer to choose honestly through a cheerful person - hit, 

01:10:10.513 --> 01:10:11.530
 Because it's cheerful in the short term. 

01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:13.580
 Honestly in the long run. 

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.506
 Excuse yourself because when you make a mistake and focus on other people, 

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.516
 Not to yourself. 

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:21.573
 I was thinking about how to do it 

01:10:21.573 --> 01:10:24.510
 a concrete example of this? 

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:25.563
 We have a concrete example 

01:10:25.563 --> 01:10:27.573
 focus on someone else there? 

01:10:27.573 --> 01:10:29.539
 Could they bring it that way? 

01:10:29.539 --> 01:10:31.590
 You see, my wife was a birthday yesterday. 

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:34.560
 If ever there was a moment I got the right 

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.573
 be focused on yourself, 

01:10:35.573 --> 01:10:38.536
 then that would be the Last Lecture. 

01:10:38.536 --> 01:10:40.510
 But I feel bad 

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:42.516
 which my wife did not have the opportunity to celebrate her birthday properly, 

01:10:42.516 --> 01:10:44.593
 And I thought it would be nice if 500 people-- 

01:10:44.593 --> 01:10:47.586
 [applause] 

01:11:04.543 --> 01:11:07.553
 everyone is singing: Happy birthday you. 

01:11:07.553 --> 01:11:08.560
 Pausch: Her name is Jai. 

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.596
 everyone is singing: Happy birthday you. 

01:11:11.596 --> 01:11:16.556
 Happy birthday, dear Jai. 

01:11:16.556 --> 01:11:20.573
 Happy Birthday to You. 

01:11:20.573 --> 01:11:23.566
 [congratulations and applause] 

01:11:29.566 --> 01:11:31.560
 Pausch: You have to put them out. 

01:11:38.536 --> 01:11:39.556
 Alright. 

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:42.550
 [applause] 

01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:50.560
 Now you will have another additional reason 

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.560
 to come to the reception. 

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.556
 Remember, the walls allow us to show their perseverance. 

01:11:57.556 --> 01:11:59.530
 They are here to separate us 

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:01.510
 of people who do not really want to 

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:02.573
 to achieve your childhood dream. 

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:04.546
 Do not quit. 

01:12:04.546 --> 01:12:07.510
 The best gold is at the bottom of a full-barreled barrel. 

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:10.503
 [laughter] 

01:12:12.523 --> 01:12:18.583
 Steve did not tell you about the academic free year at EA. 

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:22.519
 I was there for 48 hours and loved ETC. 

01:12:22.519 --> 01:12:23.533
 We were the best. 

01:12:23.533 --> 01:12:24.560
 We were favorites, 

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.570
 And then someone pulled me upside down and said, 

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:27.596
 "Oh, by the way, 

01:12:27.596 --> 01:12:29.573
 "We're getting $ 8 million in USC 

01:12:29.573 --> 01:12:31.519
 "to develop the program just as you have. 

01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:33.523
 I hope you will want to help them get started with that. " 

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:36.516
 [laughter] 

01:12:38.546 --> 01:12:39.586
 Then Steve met him and said, 

01:12:39.586 --> 01:12:42.556
 "They said what? Oh, my God." 

01:12:42.556 --> 01:12:46.593
 And to quote the famous man, "I'll fix it." 

01:12:46.593 --> 01:12:48.519
 That's what he did. 

01:12:48.519 --> 01:12:50.513
 Steve was an incredible partner, 

01:12:50.513 --> 01:12:51.556
 and we both have a great relationship, 

01:12:51.556 --> 01:12:53.570
 personally and professionally, 

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.526
 and he was undoubtedly a forehead 

01:12:55.526 --> 01:12:59.560
 in creating game factors to facilitate the learning of millions of children, 

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.506
 and you know, that's unbelievable. 

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:04.593
 But, you know, it would be sensible 

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:08.530
 that after these 48 hours I went to the free academic year, 

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:11.500
 but it would not be the right thing to do, 

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.573
 And when you do the right thing, 

01:13:12.573 --> 01:13:16.576
 Good things somehow come back. 

01:13:16.576 --> 01:13:18.596
 Make a feedback and listen to it. 

01:13:18.596 --> 01:13:21.550
 The back link can be even a foolish graph I used to use, 

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.503
 or it can be a great person 

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:25.500
 which tells you what you need to hear. 

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.526
 The hard part of it is to listen to it. 

01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:29.553
 Everyone can be proud. 

01:13:29.553 --> 01:13:32.533
 Rare are the people who say, "Oh, my God, you're right," 

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.580
 Unlike, "Do not Wait, The Real Reason Is What" - 

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.526
 That's what we all already heard. 

01:13:36.526 --> 01:13:39.580
 When people provide feedback, appreciate it and use it. 

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.566
 show gratitude. 

01:13:41.566 --> 01:13:44.510
 When I got an employment contract for an indefinite period, I took my entire development team 

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:45.596
 in Disneyland for a week, 

01:13:45.596 --> 01:13:48.500
 Another professor from Virginia University asked, 

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.506
 "How can you do that?" 

01:13:50.506 --> 01:13:51.586
 I told him, "These people broke my teeth for me 

01:13:51.586 --> 01:13:53.566
 "and got me the best job in the world for the rest of my life. 

01:13:53.566 --> 01:13:57.503
 How could I not do that? " 

01:13:57.503 --> 01:14:00.553
 Do not grieve; Just work harder. 

01:14:00.553 --> 01:14:02.506
 This is Jackie Robinson's picture. 

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:03.560
 In his contract he stated that he should not complain, 

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.560
 even if the fans spit on it. 

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.526
 Be good in something; This makes you precious. 

01:14:11.526 --> 01:14:13.536
 He works diligently. 

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:15.519
 I got a contract for an indefinite year, as Steve noted. 

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:16.580
 Younger employees of the faculty knew to tell me, 

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.510
 "You've got an earlier contract on indefinite terms. 

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.526
 What is your secret? " 

01:14:20.526 --> 01:14:21.556
 He would say, "It's very easy. 

01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:23.546
 "Call me any Friday evening at the office at 22:00, 

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:26.519
 and I will tell you. " 

01:14:26.519 --> 01:14:27.530
 Find the best in everyone. 

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.563
 One of my things Jon Snoddy, 

01:14:28.563 --> 01:14:30.513
 As I mentioned, what he told me 

01:14:30.513 --> 01:14:33.580
 is that you may have to wait a long time, sometimes for years, 

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.550
 but people will show you their good side. 

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:40.593
 Just keep waiting, no matter how long it takes. 

01:14:40.593 --> 01:14:42.590
 Nobody is completely harm. 

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.590
 Everyone has a good side. 

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:44.590
 Just keep waiting. 

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:45.593
 That will come out. 

01:14:45.593 --> 01:14:47.519
 And be ready for it. 

01:14:47.519 --> 01:14:50.586
 Happiness is what happens when the preparedness meets the occasion. 

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:54.513
 So today's speech was about dreams from childhood, 

01:14:54.513 --> 01:15:00.516
 realizing the dreams of others, and some lessons learned. 

01:15:00.516 --> 01:15:05.503
 But did you make a headache? 

01:15:05.503 --> 01:15:07.550
 It was not about how to realize your own dreams. 

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:10.523
 It was about how to lead a life. 

01:15:10.523 --> 01:15:11.596
 If you live life in the right way, 

01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.576
 Karma will take care of herself. 

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:16.553
 Dreams will come to you yourself. 

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:21.576
 Did you make a second headache? 

01:15:21.576 --> 01:15:22.593
 Speech is not intended for you. 

01:15:22.593 --> 01:15:24.503
 It is intended for my children. 

01:15:24.503 --> 01:15:26.560
 Thank you all. Good night. 

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.553
 [applause]
