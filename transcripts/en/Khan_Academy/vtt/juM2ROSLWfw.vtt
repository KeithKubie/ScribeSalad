00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.360
So we already know that if we
start off with a glucose

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.240
molecule, which is a 6-carbon
molecule, that this

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.880
essentially gets split in half
by glycolysis and we end up 2

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.760
pyruvic acids or two
pyruvate molecules.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.230
So glycolysis literally
splits this in half.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.200
It lyses the glucose.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.770
We end up with two pyruvates
or pyruvic acids.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.350
ruby And these are 3-carbon
molecules.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.580
There's obviously a
lot of other stuff

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.480
going on in the carbons.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.470
You saw it in the past. And
you could look up their

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.210
chemical structures on the
internet or on Wikipedia and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.940
see them in detail.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.220
But this is kind of the
important thing.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.770
Is that it was lysed,
it was cut in half.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.020
And this is what happened
in glycolysis.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.650
And this happened in the
absence of oxygen.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.210
Or not necessarily.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.860
It can happen in the presence
or in the absence of oxygen.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.520
It doesn't need oxygen.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420
And we got a net payoff
of two ATPs.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.270
And I always say the net there,
because remember, it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.980
used two ATPs in that investment
stage, and then it

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.060
generated four.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.980
So on a net basis, it generated
four, used two, it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.790
gave us two ATPs.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580
And it also produced
two NADHs.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.540
That's what we got out
of glycolysis.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.160
And just so you can visualize
this a little bit better, let

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.610
me draw a cell right here.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.520
Maybe I'll draw it down here.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.340
Let's say I have a cell.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.010
That's its outer membrane.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.460
Maybe its nucleus, we're
dealing with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.000
a eukaryotic cell.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.400
That doesn't have
to be the case.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.780
It has its DNA and its chromatin
form all spread

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.040
around like that.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.490
And then you have
mitochondria.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.000
And there's a reason why people
call it the power

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.810
centers of the cell.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.610
We'll look at that
in a second.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.290
So there's a mitochondria.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.100
It has an outer membrane
and an inner

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.370
membrane just like that.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.820
I'll do more detail on the
structure of a mitochondria,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.380
maybe later in this video
or maybe I'll do a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.800
whole video on them.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.870
That's another mitochondria
right there.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.120
And then all of this fluid,
this space out here that's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.890
between the organelles-- and
the organelles, you kind of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.710
view them as parts of the cell
that do specific things.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.700
Kind of like organs
do specific things

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.220
within our own bodies.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.050
So this-- so between all of the
organelles you have this

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.480
fluidic space.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.090
This is just fluid
of the cell.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.340
And that's called
the cytoplasm.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.560
And that's where glycolysis
occurs.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440
So glycolysis occurs
in the cytoplasm.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.610
Now we all know-- in the
overview video-- we know what

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.150
the next step is.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.990
The Krebs cycle, or the
citric acid cycle.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.761
And that actually takes place
in the inner membrane, or I

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:03.340
should say the inner space
of these mitochondria.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.820
Let me draw it a little
bit bigger.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.890
Let me draw a mitochondria
here.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.590
So this is a mitochondria.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.340
It has an outer membrane.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.960
It has an inner membrane.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.950
If I have just one inner
membrane we call it a crista.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.430
If we have many, we
call them cristae.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.565
This little convoluted
inner membrane, let

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.410
me give it a label.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.430
So they are cristae, plural.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.540
And then it has two
compartments.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.930
Because it's divided by
these two membranes.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.880
This compartment right here is
called the outer compartment.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.340
This whole thing right there,
that's the outer compartment.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.660
And then this inner compartment
in here, is called

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.910
the matrix.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.270
Now you have these pyruvates,
they're not quite just ready

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.220
for the Krebs cycle, but I
guess-- well that's a good

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.920
intro into how do you
make them ready

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.590
for the Krebs cycle?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.430
They actually get oxidized.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.900
And I'll just focus on one
of these pyruvates.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.740
We just have to remember that
the pyruvate, that this

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.730
happens twice for every
molecule of glucose.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.660
So we have this kind
of preparation step

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.870
for the Krebs Cycle.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.120
We call that pyruvate
oxidation.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.860
And essentially what it does
is it cleaves one of these

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.320
carbons off of the pyruvate.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.650
And so you end up with
a 2-carbon compound.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.000
You don't have just two carbons,
but its backbone of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.740
carbons is just two carbons.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.990
Called acetyl-CoA.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.100
And if these names are
confusing, because what is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.590
acetyl coenzyme A?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.380
These are very bizarre.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.030
You could do a web search on
them But I'm just going to use

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.360
the words right now, because it
will keep things simple and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.790
we'llget the big picture.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.240
So it generates acetyl-CoA,
which is

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.500
this 2-carbon compound.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.500
And it also reduces some
NAD plus to NADH.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.010
And this process right here is
often given credit-- or the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.000
Krebs cycle or the citric
acid cycle gets

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.070
credit for this step.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.470
But it's really a preparation
step for the Krebs cycle.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.870
Now once you have this 2-carbon
chain, acetyl-Co-A

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.750
right here.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.200
you are ready to jump into
the Krebs cycle.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.080
This long talked-about
Krebs cycle.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.670
And you'll see in a second
why it's called a cycle.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.970
Acetyl-CoA, and all of this
is catalyzed by enzymes.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.900
And enzymes are just proteins
that bring together the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.540
constituent things that need to
react in the right way so

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.970
that they do react.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.260
So catalyzed by enzymes.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.280
This acetyl-CoA merges with
some oxaloacetic acid.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.540
A very fancy word.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.880
But this is a 4-carbon
molecule.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.580
These two guys are kind of
reacted together, or merged

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.570
together, depending on how
you want to view it.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.640
I'll draw it like that.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.100
It's all catalyzed by enzymes.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.000
And this is important.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.210
Some texts will say, is this an
enzyme catalyzed reaction?

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.740
Yes.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.070
Everything in the Krebs
cycle is an

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.720
enzyme catalyzed reaction.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.675
And they form citrate,
or citric acid.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.470
Which is the same stuff
in your lemonade

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.810
or your orange juice.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.330
And this is a 6-carbon
molecule.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.990
Which makes sense.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.160
You have a 2-carbon
and a 4-carbon.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.520
You get a 6-carbon molecule.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.000
And then the citric acid
is then oxidized

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.110
over a bunch of steps.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.450
And this is a huge
simplification here.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.540
But it's just oxidized over
a bunch of steps.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.910
Again, the carbons
are cleaved off.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.430
Both 2-carbons are cleaved
off of it to get back to

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.410
oxaloacetic acid.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.630
And you might be saying, when
these carbons are cleaved off,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.620
like when this carbon
is cleaved off,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.560
what happens to it?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.000
It becomes CO2.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.890
It gets put onto some oxygen
and leaves the system.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.840
So this is where the oxygen or
the carbons, or the carbon

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.260
dioxide actually gets formed.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.390
And similarly, when these
carbons get cleaved

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.170
off, it forms CO2.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.720
And actually, for every molecule
of glucose you have

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.980
six carbons.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.760
When you do this whole process
once, you are generating three

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.505
molecules of carbon dioxide.

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:14.630
But you're going
to do it twice.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.000
You're going to have six carbon
dioxides produced.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.970
Which accounts for all
of the carbons.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.090
You get rid of three carbons
for every turn of this.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.360
Well, two for every turn.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.400
But really, for the steps after
glycolysis you get rid

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.395
of three carbons.

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.490
But you're going to do it for
each of the pyruvates.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.350
You're going to get rid of all
six carbons, which will have

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.800
to exhale eventually.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.930
But this cycle, it doesn't
just generate carbons.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:43.150
The whole idea is to generate
NADHs and FADH2s and ATPs.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.430
So we'll write that here.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.820
And this is a huge
simplification.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.930
I'll show you the detailed
picture in a second.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.730
We'll reduce some NAD
plus into NADH.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.130
We'll do it again.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.860
And of course, these are
in separate steps.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.240
There's intermediate
compounds.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.200
I'll show you those
in a second.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.130
Another NAD plus molecule
will be reduced to NADH.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.040
It will produce some ATP.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.170
Some ADP will turn into ATP.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.190
Maybe we have some-- and not
maybe, this is what happens--

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:30.150
some FAD gets-- let me write
it this way-- some FAD gets

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.100
oxidized into FADH2.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.950
And the whole reason why we even
pay attention to these,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.850
you might think, hey cellular
respiration is all about ATP.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.850
Why do we even pay attention
to these NADHs and these

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.910
FADH2s that get produced
as part of the process?

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.430
The reason why we care is that
these are the inputs into the

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.870
electron transport chain.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.730
These get oxidized, or they lose
their hydrogens in the

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.530
electron transport chain, and
that's where the bulk of the

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.500
ATP is actually produced.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.910
And then maybe we'll have
another NAD get reduced, or

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.890
gain in hydrogen.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.780
Reduction is gaining
an electron.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.760
Or gaining a hydrogen whose
electron you can hog.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.870
NADH.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.170
And then we end up back
at oxaloacetic acid.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.570
And we can perform the whole
citric acid cycle over again.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.460
So now that we've written it
all out, let's account for

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.180
what we have. So depending on--
let me draw some dividing

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.890
lines so we know what's what.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.880
So this right here, everything
to the left of that line right

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.130
there is glycolysis.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.760
We learned that already.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.520
And then most-- especially
introductory-- textbooks will

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.480
give the Krebs cycle credit for
this pyruvate oxidation,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.500
but that's really a
preparatory stage.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.090
The Krebs cycle is really
formally this part where you

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.310
start with acetyl-CoA,
you merge it

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.400
with oxaloacetic acid.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.190
And then you go and you form
citric acid, which essentially

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.210
gets oxidized and produces all
of these things that will need

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.750
to either directly produce ATP
or will do it indirectly in

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.030
the electron transport chain.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.790
But let's account for everything
that we have. Let's

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.630
account for everything
that we have so far.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.490
We already accounted for the
glycolysis right there.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.110
Two net ATPs, two NADHs.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.360
Now, in the citric acid cycle,
or in the Krebs cycle, well

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.730
first we have our pyruvate
oxidation.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.680
That produced one NADH.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.040
But remember, if we want to say,
what are we producing for

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.600
every glucose?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.430
This is what we produced for
each of the pyruvates.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.510
This NADH was from just
this pyruvate.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.630
But glycolysis produced
two pyruvates.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.130
So everything after this, we're
going to multiply by two

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.570
for every molecule of glucose.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.680
So I'll say, for the pyruvate
oxidation times two means that

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.080
we got two NADHs.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.900
And then when we look at this
side, the formal Krebs cycle,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.800
what do we get?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.150
We have, how many NADHs?

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.110
One, two, three NADHs.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.730
So three NADHs times two,
because we're going to perform

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.520
this cycle for each of the
pyruvates produced from

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.960
glycolysis.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.170
So that gives us six NADHs.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.640
We have one ATP per
turn of the cycle.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.730
That's going to happen twice.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.410
Once for each pyruvic acid.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.980
So we get two ATPs.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.260
And then we have one FADH2.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.490
But it's good, we're going
to do this cycle twice.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.390
This is per cycle.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.020
So times two.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.430
We have two FADHs.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.030
Now, sometimes in a lot of books
these two NADHs, or per

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.400
turn of the Krebs cycle, or per
pyruvate this one NADH,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.030
they'll give credit to the
Krebs cycle for that.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.170
So sometimes instead of having
this intermediate step,

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.560
they'll just write four
NADHs right here.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.590
And you'll do it twice.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.020
Once for each puruvate.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.390
So they'll say eight NADHs get
produced from the Krebs cycle.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.120
But the reality is, six from the
Krebs cycle two from the

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.940
preparatory stage.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.130
Now the interesting thing is we
can account whether we get

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.360
to the 38 ATPs promised by
cellular respiration.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.170
We've directly already produced,
for every molecule

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.200
of glucose, two ATPs and
then two more ATPs.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.990
So we have four ATPs.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.880
Four ATPs.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.820
How many NADHs do we have?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.360
2, 4, and then 4 plus 6 10.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.850
We have 10 NADHs.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.380
And then we have 2 FADH2s.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.710
I think in the first
video on cellular

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.070
respiration I said FADH.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.860
It should be FADH2, just to be
particular about things.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.690
And these, so you might say,
hey, where are our 38 ATPs?

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.720
We only have four
ATPs right now.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.600
But these are actually the
inputs in the electron

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.350
transport chain.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.370
These molecules right here get
oxidized in the electron

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.460
transport chain.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.460
Every NADH in the electron
transport chain

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.900
produces three ATPs.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.120
So these 10 NADHs are going
to produce 30 ATPs in the

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.530
electron transport chain.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.810
And each FADH2, when it gets
oxidized and gets turned back

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.170
into FAD in the electron
transport chain,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.610
will produce two ATPs.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:25.050
So two of them are going to
produce four ATPs in the

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.320
electron transport chain.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.140
So we now see, we get
four from just what

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.960
we've done so far.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.200
Glycolysis, the preparatory
stage and the Krebs or citric

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.220
acid cycle.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.330
And then eventually, these
outputs from glycolysis and

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.930
the citric acid cycle, when
they get into the electron

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.690
transport chain, are going
to produce another 34.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:48.380
So 34 plus 4, it does get us
to the promised 38 ATP that

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.840
you would expect in a
super-efficient cell.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.630
This is kind of your theoretical
maximum.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.830
In most cells they really
don't get quite there.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.120
But this is a good number to
know if you're going to take

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.680
the AP bio test or in most
introductory biology courses.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.570
There's one other point
I want to make here.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.790
Everything we've talked about
so far, this is carbohydrate

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.370
metabolism.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.300
Or sugar catabolism,
we could call it.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.850
We're breaking down sugars
to produce ATP.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.780
Glucose was our starting
point.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.030
But animals, including us, we
can catabolize other things.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.870
We can catabolize proteins.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.230
We can catabolize fats.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.090
If you have any fat on your
body, you have energy.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.300
In theory, your body should be
able to take that fat and you

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.730
should be able to do
things with that.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.750
You should be able
to generate ATP.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.250
And the interesting thing, the
reason why I bring it up here,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.880
is obviously glycolysis is of
no use to these things.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.200
Although fats can be turned
into glucose in the liver.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.210
But the interesting thing is
that the Krebs cycle is the

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.000
entry point for these other
catabolic mechanisms. Proteins

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.900
can be broken down into amino
acids, which can be broken

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.430
down into acetyl-CoA.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.550
Fats can be turned into glucose,
which actually could

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.070
then go the whole cellular
respiration.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.020
But the big picture here is
acetyl-CoA is the general

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.300
catabolic intermediary that can
then enter the Krebs cycle

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.200
and generate ATP regardless
of whether our fuel is

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.890
carbohydrates, sugars,
proteins or fats.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.750
Now, we have a good sense of how
everything works out right

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.210
now, I think.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.890
Now I'm going to show you a
diagram that you might see in

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.700
your biology textbook.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.250
Or I'll actually show you the
actual diagram from Wikipedia.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.650
I just want to show you,
this looks very

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.940
daunting and very confusing.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.570
And I think that's why many of
us have trouble with cellular

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.670
respiration initially.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.720
Because there's just so
much information.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.660
It's hard to process
what's important.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.640
But I want to just highlight
the important steps here.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.200
Just so you see it's the same
thing that we talked about.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.070
From glycolysis you produce
two pyruvates.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.300
That's the pyruvate
right there.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.040
They actually show its
molecular structure.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.880
This is the pyruvate oxidation
step that I talked about.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.570
The preparatory step.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.670
And you see we produce
a carbon dioxide.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.520
And we reduce NAD
plus into NADH.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.910
Then we're ready to enter
the Krebs cycle.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.230
The acetyl-CoA and the
oxaloacetate or oxaloacetic

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.490
acid, they are reacted
together to

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.860
create citric acid.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.180
They've actually drawn
the molecule there.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.110
And then the citric acid is
oxidized through the Krebs

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.260
cycle right there.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.220
All of these steps, each
of these steps are

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.590
facilitated by enzymes.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.100
And it gets oxidized.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.900
But I want to highlight
the interesting parts.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.960
Here we have an NAD get
reduced to NADH.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.950
We have another NAD get
reduced to NADH.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.960
And then over here, another
NAD gets reduced to NADH.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.750
So, so far, if you include the
preparatory step, we've had

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.550
four NADHs formed, three
directly from the Krebs cycle.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.120
That's just what I told you.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.220
Now we have, in this diagram
they say GDP.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.310
GTP gets formed from GDP.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.760
The GTP is just guanosine
triphosphate.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.130
It's another purine that can
be a source of energy.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.570
But then that later can be
used to form an ATP.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.530
So this is just the way they
happen to draw it.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.680
But this is the actual ATP
that I drew in the

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.069
diagram on the top.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.210
And then they have
this Q group.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.210
And I won't go into it.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.260
And then it gets reduced
over here.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.660
It gets those two hydrogens.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.400
But that essentially ends
up reducing the FADH2s.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.270
So this is where the FADH2
gets produced.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.119
So as promised, we produced,
for each pyruvate that

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.280
inputted-- remember, so we're
going to do it twice-- for

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.990
each pyruvate we produced one,
two, three, four NADHs.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.550
We produced one ATP
and one FADH2.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.050
That's exactly what
we saw up here.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.000
I'll see you in the
next video.
