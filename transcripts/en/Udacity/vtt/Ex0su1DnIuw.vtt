00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And here's my answer: this is all initialization over here, so we shouldn't touch it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But from here on, we want to do things twice.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So we're going to put a "for" loop here,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for t in range(T)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then you have to indent all the stuff below.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I indent all the way to the final statement,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but I only want to print the final distribution.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's run it--and surprisingly,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the orientations aren't really that well worked out.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If I go down I find, still fairly random orientations here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But if I go to 10 steps forward,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which means the robot really moves quite a bit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
across its environment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I hit the run button--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I actually get orientations that all look alike.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So you can see, they're all about 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.7.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can see the "y" values are all about the same

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and the "x" values are all about the same.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.022
So this is the particle filter working.
