00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
So, in order that you save a little time compared to Alice, Bob, and Carol,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.820
our first quiz this unit is going to be what should you do when you can't find

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
and polynomial time algorithm for some important problem that you're working on.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.660
Here are your options when you can't find a polynomial time algorithm

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.180
for a problem you're working on.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.890
You can do some research on the problem.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.620
You can try to show that your problem is NP complete.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.790
You can give up right away.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.050
You can discuss the problem with friends and possibly also experts

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.140
if they are available to you, and you might also think about settling for a suboptimal algorithm--

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.050
some algorithm that works but probably doesn't produce the best possible solution,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.230
at least if the stakes aren't high.

00:00:41.230 --> 99:59:59.000
So, which of these options do you think could be recommended in general?
