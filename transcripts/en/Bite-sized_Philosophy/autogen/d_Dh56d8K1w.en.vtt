entity that exists in a web of
connections the fact that its signified

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
connections the fact that its signified
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290
connections the fact that its signified
by paper is almost completely irrelevant

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
by paper is almost completely irrelevant
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.260

because your limbic system is a lot

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
because your limbic system is a lot
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.560
because your limbic system is a lot
smarter than your perceptual systems and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
smarter than your perceptual systems and
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660
smarter than your perceptual systems and
your perceptual systems say well that's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
your perceptual systems say well that's
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250
your perceptual systems say well that's
a piece of paper and your limbic system

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
a piece of paper and your limbic system
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.440
a piece of paper and your limbic system
says nah for sure dragan right right and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
says nah for sure dragan right right and
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420

and so instead you pull out the piece of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
and so instead you pull out the piece of
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899
and so instead you pull out the piece of
paper maybe and you think okay why did I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
paper maybe and you think okay why did I
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.300
paper maybe and you think okay why did I
get this c-minus

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
get this c-minus
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.590
get this c-minus

these are bottomless pits often when you
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.910
these are bottomless pits often when you
when you're in the world if something

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
when you're in the world if something

objects to you then in the entire

that's why it's the great dragon of

that's why it's the great dragon of

that's why it's the great dragon of
chaos it's everything that's outside of

chaos it's everything that's outside of
 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.479
chaos it's everything that's outside of
your conceptual structure and what is

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
your conceptual structure and what is
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.550
your conceptual structure and what is
that it's everything that lurks outside

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
that it's everything that lurks outside
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.580
that it's everything that lurks outside
of your of your walled city and it's

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
of your of your walled city and it's
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530
of your of your walled city and it's
manifested itself like the snake in the

say I'm not having anything to do with
 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.190
say I'm not having anything to do with
that but the problem with that is well

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
that but the problem with that is well
 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.080

you get your c-minus and you don't do

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
you get your c-minus and you don't do
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.310
you get your c-minus and you don't do
anything about it maybe you're a little

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320
anything about it maybe you're a little
 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.199
anything about it maybe you're a little
bitter and more resentful in your study

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209
bitter and more resentful in your study
 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.610
bitter and more resentful in your study
habits get a little worse so the next

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
habits get a little worse so the next
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.490
habits get a little worse so the next
time you get like a d-plus and then you

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
time you get like a d-plus and then you
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020
time you get like a d-plus and then you
collect a bunch of FS and then you stop

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030
collect a bunch of FS and then you stop
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.270
collect a bunch of FS and then you stop
going to school then you stop showering

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
going to school then you stop showering
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.759
going to school then you stop showering
right then you end up jumping off the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769
right then you end up jumping off the
 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.100
right then you end up jumping off the
bridge and so that's a that's that's how

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110
bridge and so that's a that's that's how
 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.720

the dragon eats you when you don't pay
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.699
the dragon eats you when you don't pay
attention to it and so it's no bloody

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709
attention to it and so it's no bloody
 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.259
wonder that people avoid you know it's
really no wonder that they avoid because

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269
really no wonder that they avoid because
 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.440
really no wonder that they avoid because
error messages contain within them the

error messages contain within them the
 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.490
error messages contain within them the
implicit world now the upside of that is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
implicit world now the upside of that is
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.510
implicit world now the upside of that is
while they contain within them the

and the world isn't all negative and so

and the world isn't all negative and so
maybe you get your c- and that's

actually the best gift you ever got
 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.090
actually the best gift you ever got
because somebody finally took you and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100
because somebody finally took you and
 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.930
because somebody finally took you and
went whack you no clue in and so you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
went whack you no clue in and so you
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.220
went whack you no clue in and so you
take that apart and you think oh I don't

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230
take that apart and you think oh I don't
 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.080
take that apart and you think oh I don't

know like maybe I'm working at 2%

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
know like maybe I'm working at 2%

would suspect that you know some of you

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
would suspect that you know some of you
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.690
would suspect that you know some of you
aren't doing that but I bet you that I

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700
aren't doing that but I bet you that I
 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.060
aren't doing that but I bet you that I
bet there's thirty thirty to fifty

percent of the people in the room are
working at two percent efficiency it's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700
working at two percent efficiency it's
 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.580
working at two percent efficiency it's
like you got it that's so low to find

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590
like you got it that's so low to find

that out is so optimistic I mean if

that out is so optimistic I mean if

that out is so optimistic I mean if
you're barely hanging in there but

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280
you're barely hanging in there but
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.010
you're barely hanging in there but
you're only working out 2% you might

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020
you're only working out 2% you might
 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.840
you're only working out 2% you might
imagine what you could have as a life if

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850
imagine what you could have as a life if
 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.350
imagine what you could have as a life if
you work it at like 50 percent so so

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360
you work it at like 50 percent so so
 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.510
you work it at like 50 percent so so
that the c-minus can be the best gift

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520
that the c-minus can be the best gift
 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.100
that the c-minus can be the best gift
you ever had and that's the goal that

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
you ever had and that's the goal that
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.870
you ever had and that's the goal that
the Dragon hoards right that's exactly

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880
the Dragon hoards right that's exactly
 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.040
the Dragon hoards right that's exactly
what that means and so well so you're

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050
what that means and so well so you're
 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.200
what that means and so well so you're
moving from point A to point B in your

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210
moving from point A to point B in your
 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.790
moving from point A to point B in your
little circumscribed world you've made

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800
little circumscribed world you've made
 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.920
little circumscribed world you've made
everything invisible and as long as that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930
everything invisible and as long as that
 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.930
everything invisible and as long as that
works then your theory is good enough

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940
works then your theory is good enough
 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.400
works then your theory is good enough
it's accurate enough it's true enough

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410
it's accurate enough it's true enough
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.710
it's accurate enough it's true enough
you're in your little paradise but if

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720
you're in your little paradise but if
 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.770
you're in your little paradise but if
something comes up an object well that's

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780
something comes up an object well that's
 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.510
something comes up an object well that's
where your character is tested

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520
where your character is tested
 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.610
where your character is tested
fundamentally that's the character test

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
fundamentally that's the character test
 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.440
fundamentally that's the character test
it's like what do you do with messages

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450
it's like what do you do with messages
 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.290
it's like what do you do with messages
of error and that's a tricky issue okay

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300
of error and that's a tricky issue okay
 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.590
of error and that's a tricky issue okay
so here's the solution to that here's

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600
so here's the solution to that here's
 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.830
so here's the solution to that here's
what not to do I am a bad person I go to

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840
what not to do I am a bad person I go to
 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.630
what not to do I am a bad person I go to
see my I'm a bad person I'm out I'll

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640
see my I'm a bad person I'm out I'll
 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.580
see my I'm a bad person I'm out I'll
just go jump off the bridge it's like no

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590
just go jump off the bridge it's like no
 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.260
just go jump off the bridge it's like no
that's not good because what that means

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270
that's not good because what that means
 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.900
that's not good because what that means
is that every time every time you try to

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910
is that every time every time you try to
 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.920
is that every time every time you try to
learn something you're going to make a

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930
learn something you're going to make a
 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.510
learn something you're going to make a
mistake because what do you know so

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520
mistake because what do you know so
 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.130
mistake because what do you know so
you're going to make mistakes and if the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140
you're going to make mistakes and if the
 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.630
you're going to make mistakes and if the
rule is every time you make a mistake

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640
rule is every time you make a mistake
 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.830
rule is every time you make a mistake
you're going to go jump off the bridge

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840
you're going to go jump off the bridge
 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.250
you're going to go jump off the bridge
then that's not a useful problem solving

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260
then that's not a useful problem solving
 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.770
then that's not a useful problem solving
strategy and so when you make a mistake

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780
strategy and so when you make a mistake
 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.020
strategy and so when you make a mistake
you don't get to beat yourself to death

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030
you don't get to beat yourself to death
 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.840
you don't get to beat yourself to death
with a club it's a bad strategy and

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850
with a club it's a bad strategy and
 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.280
with a club it's a bad strategy and
you'll have your internal tyrant in

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290
you'll have your internal tyrant in
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.140
you'll have your internal tyrant in

there who's perfectly happy about doing
that that's the you know overactive

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250
and so
 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.430
and so
you've got a problem something has

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440
you've got a problem something has

objected to you then the question is
 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.200
objected to you then the question is
well what does that mean well maybe

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210
well what does that mean well maybe

maybe your goals are wrong maybe you're
not acting properly it's okay so the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030
not acting properly it's okay so the
 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.090
not acting properly it's okay so the
question that arises when an obstacle

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100
question that arises when an obstacle
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.740
question that arises when an obstacle
emerges is which part of this structure

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750
emerges is which part of this structure
 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.890
emerges is which part of this structure
needs attention and the first answer

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900
needs attention and the first answer
 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.460
needs attention and the first answer
can't be all of it which is why when

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470
can't be all of it which is why when
 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.720
can't be all of it which is why when
you're arguing with someone in an

intimate relationship and you're angry
at them and you want to win which is a

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290
at them and you want to win which is a
 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.180
at them and you want to win which is a
big mistake

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190
big mistake
 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.260
big mistake
you want to win you say well your this

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270
you want to win you say well your this

is what you're like here's another ten
examples of how you've done that in the

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940
examples of how you've done that in the
 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.360
examples of how you've done that in the
past and I can enumerate more of them if

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370
past and I can enumerate more of them if
 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.070
past and I can enumerate more of them if
you'd like and so it doesn't that's

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080
you'd like and so it doesn't that's
 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.960
you'd like and so it doesn't that's
actually what you like and I tried

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970
actually what you like and I tried
 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.370
actually what you like and I tried
fixing you and didn't work and so it

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380
fixing you and didn't work and so it
 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.300
fixing you and didn't work and so it
looks like you're going to be like that

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310
looks like you're going to be like that
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.770
looks like you're going to be like that
up into the future and you're basically

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780
up into the future and you're basically
 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.510
up into the future and you're basically
saying to them well you're a bad person

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520
saying to them well you're a bad person
 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.430
saying to them well you're a bad person
and the only thing they can do is either

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440
and the only thing they can do is either
 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.370
and the only thing they can do is either
collapse or punch you and punching you

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380
collapse or punch you and punching you
 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.320
collapse or punch you and punching you
is actually better than collapsing but

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330
is actually better than collapsing but
 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.370
is actually better than collapsing but
you don't you know what I mean it's such

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380
you don't you know what I mean it's such
 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.170
you don't you know what I mean it's such
a counterproductive way of arguing they

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180
a counterproductive way of arguing they
 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.850
a counterproductive way of arguing they
you don't leave the person any out and

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860
you don't leave the person any out and
 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.400
you don't leave the person any out and
so maybe while they're civilized so it

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410
so maybe while they're civilized so it
 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.500
so maybe while they're civilized so it
doesn't get physical well maybe that's

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.510
doesn't get physical well maybe that's
 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.150
doesn't get physical well maybe that's
good and maybe it isn't but then they

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160
good and maybe it isn't but then they
 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.980
good and maybe it isn't but then they
end up either really not happy with you

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:51.990
end up either really not happy with you

you might think well let's let's assume

you might think well let's let's assume
it's a little piece to begin with that's

it's a little piece to begin with that's
 

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.400
it's a little piece to begin with that's
the right mechanism it's like okay you

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.410
the right mechanism it's like okay you
 

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.149
the right mechanism it's like okay you
got to see - that doesn't prove that

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159
got to see - that doesn't prove that
 

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.790

you're stupid and now it implies that
you might be stupid but it doesn't right

you might be stupid but it doesn't right
 

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.850
you might be stupid but it doesn't right
really it does and that's why you don't

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860
really it does and that's why you don't
 

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.230
really it does and that's why you don't
want to look at it maybe it implies that

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240
want to look at it maybe it implies that

look at the micro routines it's okay

00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.230
look at the micro routines it's okay
 

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.470
