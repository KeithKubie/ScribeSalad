00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:04.287
(bright music)

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.630
- Our Howison Lecturer for
this year is Fred Dretske,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.400
one of the leading figures
on the contemporary scene

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.900
working on problems in
the areas of epistemology

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.780
and philosophy of mind.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.400
Professor Dretske received the BSEE degree

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.110
in Electrical Engineering from
Purdue University in 1954.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.530
His graduate studies were conducted

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.460
at the University of Minnesota,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.540
where he was rewarded the MA
degree in Philosophy in 1958,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
and the PhD in 1960, also in Philosophy

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.993
with a minor in Mathematics.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.640
Professor Dretske taught

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740
at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison from 1960 to 1990,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.293
and at Stanford University
from 1990 to 1998.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.190
At the latter institution,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.440
he was the Bella and Eloise

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.173
Mabury Knapp Professor of Philosophy.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.990
He now holds the title
of Professor Emeritus

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.910
from both Wisconsin and Stanford,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.780
and in addition, since 1999,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.220
Professor Dretske has been
affiliated with Duke University

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.093
as a Senior Research Scholar.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.680
Professor Dretske's work is focused on

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.850
some of the central issues

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.060
in contemporary epistemology
and philosophy of mind,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.550
and his contributions
have had a profound effect

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.050
on the contemporary
understanding of these issues.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.330
An animating concern of his has been

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.210
to make sense of
knowledge, rational action,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.370
and conscious experience
in naturalistic terms

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.963
as phenomena that are possible
in a materialistic world.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.680
Professor Dretske defends
a form of externalism

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400
in both epistemology
and philosophy of mind,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.050
arguing that the contents
of thought and experience

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.000
are fixed in part, by the external,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.260
i.e., causal and historical relations

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.033
between subject and environment.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.800
For instance, he has proposed
a non-epistemic account

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.920
of the content of visual experience

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.350
according to which, we see many
things that we do not notice

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.570
at the time when we see them.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.170
Similarly, knowledge on
Professor Dretske's account,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.940
is a matter of being
connected to the facts

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430
in the right way,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.863
not having justifications
for one's beliefs.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.930
More recently, Professor
Dretske has defended

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.190
a representationalist account

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.550
of the character of phenomenal experience,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.250
which holds that content and quality

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.910
of our conscious experiences

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.823
depend, in part, on our
biological histories.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.910
Conscious experience remains a focus

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.333
of Professor Dretske's ongoing research,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.880
including, in particular,
the problem of understanding

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.943
how knowledge of one's own
conscious states is possible.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.210
Professor Dretske's many
influential publications include

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.440
several books that have
become classics in our field:

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.220
Seeing and Knowing from 1969,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.000
Knowledge and the Flow
of Information from 1981,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.830
Explaining Behavior from 1988,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.463
and Naturalizing the Mind from 1995.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.380
A selection of his influential
philosophical essays,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.570
Perception, Knowledge and Belief

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.973
was published by Cambridge
University Press in 2000,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.130
and we're also, of course,
delighted to welcome him

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.690
to Berkeley today as this
year's Howison Lecturer.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.763
He'll be speaking to us on What We See.

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:54.750
(audience applauding)

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.033
- Thank you very much, Jay.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.140
Well, as Jay mentioned,
this has been a topic

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.500
that has been with me

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.963
for 40 years, off and on,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.040
and I return to the topic now,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.730
not because I've changed my mind,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.610
but because

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.650
the view I espoused 40 years ago

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.730
requires a much different sort of defense

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.250
than it did 40 years ago.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.920
So much has happened in
the last 20 or 30 years

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.730
in psychology and cognitive
neuroscience on perception,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.210
that one can hardly

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.830
advance anything without
addressing some of the issues

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.770
that are raised by that research,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.040
and so, this is what I am doing today, I'm

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.000
giving you

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.360
what Jay described as a view
of non-epistemic seeing,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.850
but simultaneously trying to
address some of these issues

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.933
that arise in cognitive neuroscience.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.720
Now, I've got a subtitle here,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.470
The Texture of Conscious Experience,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.970
because I wanted to clarify

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.570
that what I'm interested in here,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.070
is what's going on in your head

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.603
at the time you see something,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.950
I'm calling that a conscious experience,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.510
something you can extinguish
just by closing your eyes

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.960
and make reoccur by opening your eyes,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.403
it's that, that I wanna talk about.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.950
What I'm interested in is what I'm calling

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.453
the texture of that.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.840
I'm looking at an audience,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.360
there are, I don't know how
many people in this room,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.890
at least a hundred, say,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.030
how much of that richness
that's in the world,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.270
how much of that detail,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.400
how much of that texture that's out there

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.793
occurs in here, in a conscious way,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.810
when I look out at the world?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.540
That's the issue that I'm concerned with,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.350
and I'm concerned with that issue because

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.280
recently, in the last 10 or 20 years,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.420
so many different strands of thought

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.040
have started converging on the idea that

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.490
our subjective impression
of seeing so much detail

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.490
and texture of the world in
brief glances, is an illusion.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.910
There is detail and texture out there,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.040
but it's an illusion to
think that it occurs in here,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.000
and the illusion is fostered

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.940
by the easy availability of details

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.750
because we can just flick our eyes around

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.820
and pick up any information we care to,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.740
and the impression is fostered

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.290
that all that detail

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.710
that is so easily accessible in the world,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.180
is occurring in the head,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.480
even during brief glances,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.130
and that is an illusion.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.360
Some of you, perhaps,
know of Dan Dennett's,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.330
well-known example of staring at a wall

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.320
filled with Marilyn Monroe pictures,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.170
hundreds of pictures, and Dan says that

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.720
it's hard to resist the feeling that

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.210
you see hundreds of pictures,
just with a brief glance,

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.250
but he says, no that's a mistake,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.433
that's an illusion.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.840
There is that out in the
world, it's not in your head.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.780
All that's in your head is the ability

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.690
to access that detail by moving your eyes.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.690
So, that's the kind of position
I want to argue against.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.720
I've got just a few pictures of here

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.633
of some of the, these are
just examples, you could,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.180
you all know that picture.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.670
Now, just looking at that very
briefly for a few seconds,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.720
you have the impression of enormous detail

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.450
and you're aware of that detail.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.053
This is a street in New Delhi.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.670
This is not tonight's sky you'll see

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.610
with the undated eye, this is
through the Hubble Telescope,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.713
but just looking up at the night sky.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.540
The impression is that you see hundreds,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.180
perhaps, thousands of stars,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.740
in one brief glance.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.740
Then here's a pine
forest in North Carolina,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.630
and the

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.010
subjective impression is
that just in a few seconds

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.053
you see many, many trees.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.990
Alright, let me start then, by,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.140
and I'm going to start here

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.690
by talking, I'm gonna make some,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.630
and philosopher's love to
do this and I'm gonna do it,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.280
make some distinctions, some

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.160
linguistic distinctions

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.490
because you can't talk
about visual perception

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.150
without at least

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.860
at the outset, making it
clear to your listeners,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.590
exactly how you're going
to use these words.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.870
So, I'm going to start by
saying that I'm going to use,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.870
I know psychologists and
certainly, neuropsychologists,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.460
use perception

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.080
to mean, roughly speaking,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.920
the pick up of usable information

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.700
from the light by the eyes.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.430
Without any preconception

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.440
of whether that information
is ever embodied

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.720
in a conscious experience.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.270
So that, for example, down here

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.370
you have unconscious perception,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.420
perception of an object without
awareness of that object,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.380
in such a thing as blindsight,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.650
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with blindsight.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.270
It's

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.770
a case where

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.560
damage to the brain, the
person denies seeing anything,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.090
but can be demonstrated to
be picking up information

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.770
that he can be, that he uses
in making certain choices,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.300
what are called forced choices.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.230
So, when you ask him questions,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.150
he gets an amazingly number
of those questions right

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.490
about the stimulus,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.053
even though denying seeing anything.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.210
Alright, that's blindsight,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.460
and then there's other

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.780
discoveries from the last 20, 30 years,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.150
different streams in which
visual information is processed,

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.610
dorsal and ventral,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.973
ventral is conscious, dorsal is not,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.050
but I'm going to be
using the verb, to see,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.640
to mean conscious perception.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.950
When you pick up usable information

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.720
about your environment with the eyes,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.610
and this information is
given conscious embodiment,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.843
the kind of experience you're
now having of me, I hope.

00:10:51.093 --> 00:10:52.670
A conscious experience.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.960
So, when I talk about what you see,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.580
I'm not going to be talking about

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.620
jut getting information about something,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.820
but when that information

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.820
gives rise to a conscious experience.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.510
Alright then, let's start by talking about

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.033
the different things we see.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.830
We talk about seeing objects,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.830
sticks, stones, stars,
people, houses, stop signs,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.980
and when I talk about seeing objects,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.400
I'm going to include, although
they're not really objects,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.410
events, football games,

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.070
movements, so you're not
seeing not only my hand,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.470
but the movement of my hand.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.090
I'm going to count those
both as objects for

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.170
this purpose.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.780
I'm going to treat as an object

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.940
anything that exists or occurs

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.673
at a particular place and time.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.260
So, the movement of my hand,
occurs now, in this room.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.983
So, I'll count it as an object.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.093
Alright, that's one thing we see, objects.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.140
We also speak of seeing properties.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.423
Properties of the objects we see,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.250
color of his tie, the size of the house,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.050
position of his pawn,

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:21.000
and I'm going to include
as objects, relations.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.630
We see three things and we see one of them

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.500
as between the other two,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.580
or on top of something,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.923
or inside of something.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.683
One thing occurs before another.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.920
See these relations between things.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.310
Alright, properties,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.740
are what philosophers
call abstract objects.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.713
They don't occur to place and time.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.050
They are universals,

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.180
nonetheless, we speak of seeing them.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.180
I could see the color of his
tie, the shape of his nose,

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.683
the size of his car, and so on.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.423
Alright,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.633
thirdly,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.600
sorry, this is just a illustration of

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.300
in the top, we speak of
seeing different objects

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.789
and the same properties.

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:15.090
That is, I've got Judy
and Trudy as twins here,

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.030
supposing you see Judy and she's,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.590
has an identical twin, Trudy,

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.290
this is a case where you
see different objects,

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.610
but since they look exactly the same,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.130
you see the same properties,

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.113
same shape, same colors.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.830
Everything looks the same,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.390
so that the properties
you're aware of are the same,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.710
nonetheless, you're aware
of different objects.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.150
You see different objects,
see the same properties.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.870
On the bottom, we have
seeing the same object,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.710
but different properties.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.070
You have a white drum,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.710
then you bathe the white
drum in blue light,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.040
so now, what you're aware
of is the same white drum,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.350
but what you're aware of
is not the color white,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.463
but the color blue.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.240
That's the color you actually perceive,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.130
and then, of course, you squash the drum,

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.190
and you see a different shape,

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.793
and this is the final,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.817
this is the white drum

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.610
at a great distance, at that distance,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.430
the white drum looks
like just a black spot,

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.320
you can barely see it, you can,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.420
might say to yourself, "What
is that I see over there?"

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.290
As you get closer,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.680
you can see, perhaps,
that it's a white drum,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.770
but from that distance, it looks,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.860
the shape is not visible,
it's color is not visible,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.043
nonetheless, you do see the white drum,

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.610
if you kept your eye on it and walked up,

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.750
you would confirm that
that's what you were seeing

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.920
at a great distance.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.680
So, this is, just shows
you the independence

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.373
of seeing objects and properties.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.273
Finally, we speak of seeing facts.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.620
Now facts, seeing, the facts we see,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.083
are simply the things that
we come to know by seeing.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.310
I see that his tie is blue,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.363
that her keys are on the table,

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.783
that, that, what I see
over there, is a squirrel,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.073
that A and B are different or the same,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.400
that A is moving.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.280
Now, ordinarily, the facts we see,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.713
the things we come to know by seeing,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.370
we come to know them by seeing

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.930
by seeing objects and their properties.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.090
I see that his tie is blue,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.830
I see that fact, I come to know that fact

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.540
by seeing an object,
his tie, and a property,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.623
the color of his tie,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.530
and then, about magically,
I know that his tie is blue.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.363
How do I know it?

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.280
I can see that it's blue.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.350
I see a certain fact by seeing the object

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.920
and the property of that object.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.430
Now often, of course, we see facts

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.810
that aren't facts about
the objects we see.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.360
I see that I'm almost out of gas,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.830
my gas tank is almost empty.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.640
I see that, not by seeing my gas tank,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.740
or the gasoline in it,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.030
but by seeing the fuel
gauge on the dashboard.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.470
So, sometimes, we see a fact
about an object over here,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.750
by seeing an object
here in its properties,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.710
that as, would tell us
what's going on over there,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.370
carries information about that.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.580
That's what measuring
instruments do for us,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.380
or photographs, or television, newspapers.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.060
I see that there's violence
in the Middle East,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.120
not by witnessing the
violence in the Middle East,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.520
but by reading the newspaper.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.220
All I see is the newspaper and the print,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.140
but I speak of myself as being able to see

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.693
that certain thing as so, in that way.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.100
Alright, now, those are the distinctions

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.660
I want you to keep in mind,

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.650
seeing objects, seeing
properties, and seeing facts,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.720
and now, I'm just going
to list a few dangers,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.900
which over the years,
I've found are dangers

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.930
if people don't keep those
three things distinct.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.060
The first danger

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.550
is, it's not really a danger,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.930
it's the kind of, only a
danger for philosophers,

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.190
but it's, if you're a skeptic,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.130
you're gonna end up as an idealist

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.000
if you don't keep

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.730
this distinctions in mind,

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.410
because this is the way
the argument would go.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.447
Supposing you're a skeptic, you say,

00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:37.387
"I cannot be sure, I
don't know for certain

00:17:37.387 --> 00:17:39.947
"that what I'm aware of is a real apple.

00:17:39.947 --> 00:17:41.603
"After all, I could be dreaming.

00:17:42.737 --> 00:17:45.327
"Some Cartesian demon
could be deceiving me.

00:17:45.327 --> 00:17:48.413
"I could be hallucinating,
I can't be sure, can't know.

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:51.987
"Therefore, when looking at a real apple,

00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:53.930
"I cannot see that

00:17:55.327 --> 00:17:57.123
"it is a real apple.

00:17:58.687 --> 00:18:01.857
"I can't get knowledge
by seeing the apple.

00:18:01.857 --> 00:18:04.357
"Therefore," and here's
where the confusion comes,

00:18:04.357 --> 00:18:05.913
"I do not see a real apple.

00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:10.327
"What is it that I am aware of then?

00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:13.117
"Well, it must be a mental image,

00:18:13.117 --> 00:18:16.147
"a sense-datum, something
mental in nature."

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.990
Now that's a progression
from skepticism to

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.420
a conclusion about what we see

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.330
that confuses the facts,
which you can't see,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.803
according to the skeptic,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.103
with the perception of objects,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.960
a fallacy, that is simply a confusion

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.253
of seeing two quite different things.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.940
Second danger, mistaking
property blindness

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.140
for object blindness.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.170
Now, we all know enough about

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.350
the retina to know that
in peripheral vision,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.200
you're blind to the colors of
things in peripheral vision.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.650
They all land on

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.580
rods, which have no color sensitivity.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.030
Now, one shouldn't conclude, however,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.990
that because you cannot see the color,

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.740
a property of objects in
peripheral vision, or night vision,

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.250
that therefore, you cannot
see the colored objects,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.250
in peripheral vision.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.490
It doesn't follow that because
I can't see the blueness

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.160
of that object over there,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.360
that I can't see the
blue object over there.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.860
That would be confusing
the properties of it

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.310
with the thing that has those properties,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.120
and although, I may not
be able to see the color,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.340
maybe even not the shape
of objects over there

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.283
in extreme peripheral
vision, it doesn't follow,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.853
that I don't see those objects,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.523
and finally, and this
is a danger, I think,

00:19:46.523 --> 00:19:48.750
with people who do

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.600
the kind of experiments
with change blindness

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.603
that, perhaps, many of
you are familiar with.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.500
Some people are careful

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.490
in describing the results
of these experiments,

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.870
but I think some people
tend to be careless,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.160
and so, I just want to
call attention to the fact

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.680
that we don't want to mistake ignorance of

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.680
or failure to notice or
detect objects and properties,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.273
as a failure to see them.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.640
So, this is the way one
might commit this fallacy.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.700
You say that a subject does
not see, detect, or notice

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.710
the difference between
stimulus A and stimulus B,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.793
that is, does not see the
fact that they differ.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.500
Alright, so they're
blind to a certain fact,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.100
the fact that A and B differ.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.650
What do you conclude from that?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.920
That they are blind to
the objects or properties

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.160
that make them different?

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.563
That's to confuse a fact
with an object or a property.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.130
You should not confuse
the perception of facts,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.990
the fact that A and B differ,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.640
with the perception of
the objects and properties

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.243
that make A and B different.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.870
Now, I'm gonna come
back to change blindness

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.550
a little later with some examples

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.010
because I think it's change blindness or

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.330
results like that that
convince many people

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.210
that

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.293
they see less than they might,
otherwise, suppose they see.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.980
Alright, here's a case
of change blindness.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.140
I'm gonna show you this for a few seconds,

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.610
then I'm going to show you
that for a few seconds.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.030
Did you all see the difference

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.380
between those two figures?

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.720
Now, if you're like me,

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.713
you probably didn't see the difference.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.823
I'll even show them to
you again, although ...

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.263
Alright, here was the first figure.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.580
Here is the second figure.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.943
Now, perhaps, some of you
spotted the difference there.

00:22:02.943 --> 00:22:04.483
Now, supposing you didn't,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.530
then, there's a certain
fact you didn't see.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.763
The fact that those two
arrays were different.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.763
Next question.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.077
Did you see the object?

00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:21.860
And here, I just have,
I call the object Sam.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.903
Sam was in the second array,
it wasn't in the first.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.790
Now, question,

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.310
I know you didn't see the difference,

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.350
but that's not the question,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.260
I'm not interested in what facts you saw,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.000
I'm interested in what objects you saw.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.913
Did you see Sam the second time?

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.730
The fact that you didn't see that

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.053
Sam was a newer object in
the array is irrelevant.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.630
One should not conclude from the fact

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.290
that you didn't see

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.800
that there was a difference

00:22:55.925 --> 00:22:58.040
'cause the conclusion that
you didn't see the object

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.513
that made the difference.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.240
Now, I'm going to argue

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.490
that your conscious experience,

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.740
when viewing the second array,

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.223
was different than it was the first time.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.483
It had a richer texture.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.433
It, in fact,

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.880
had a representation of Sam,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.330
even if you didn't realize that it did,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.480
even if you didn't
notice, could not detect,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.610
that your conscious
experience was different,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.650
it was different, even
though you weren't capable

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.023
of noticing or detecting the difference.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.990
One point about the texture
of your conscious experience,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.860
the facts you see don't
contribute in any way

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.330
to the texture of your experience.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.997
Amy and Arnie see the
same object (a sunflower),

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.490
or a bunch of sunflowers,

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.340
and the flowers look the
same to both of them.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.580
They see the same properties,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.610
yet Amy sees that it is a sunflower,

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.940
she sees this fact,
that it is a sunflower,

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.010
and Arnie, ignorant of such things,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.593
does not see that fact.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.930
Yet, their conscious
experience is the same

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.480
even though the facts they
see are quite different.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.510
What this illustrates

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.110
is that it's the objects
and properties you see

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.310
that constitute the texture
of your conscious experience.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.043
The facts you see are irrelevant,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.780
and I think most people, intuitives,

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.100
that fact perception is,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.810
starts

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.880
after

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.367
you see objects and properties,

00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:45.060
and then, the mind does something

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.280
with its visual experience,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.600
and manufactures knowledge out of it,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.000
but it, whether it manufactures
that knowledge or not

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.978
doesn't, itself, necessarily
change the experience

00:24:56.978 --> 00:24:59.320
which that knowledge

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.153
comes out of.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.260
Often, of course, the texture
of your conscious experience

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.790
is made different because
you see more objects

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.990
the second time, than
you do the first time,

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.100
but sometimes you can
see the same objects,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.970
and a different texture is there

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.970
because of properties of those objects.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.270
Here are nine squares or boxes,

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.200
supposing these boxes are piled up,

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.450
you see all nine boxes,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.930
and then, you see the same nine boxes,

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.180
they're all painted blue,

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.930
and they're bunched together so closely,

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.073
you can't even see their edges.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.533
Now,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.990
I'm going to claim you
see all nine boxes here.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.653
Of course, you can't see their edges.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.473
You see this box, although,
you don't see its edges.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.640
If someone wants to argue,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.963
and perhaps, someone
will, someone always does,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.763
argue that you don't see
the nine boxes there,

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.463
I'm going to ask which box don't you see.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.940
If you say, "I don't see this one,"

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.390
I'm wondering what your
visual experience is like

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.400
if you can't see this box,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.403
do you see what's behind that box?

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.310
I don't think you do,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.850
I think that box is
occluding whatever's behind

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.500
and if it occludes what's
behind it, you must see it.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.730
Well, this, then raises the question

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.070
which I think is the important
question for my purposes,

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.580
this is a question that's
bothered me for a long time now

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.490
because what I've given you so far

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.240
is a view of object perception
and property perception,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.050
which makes what you
know, what you detect,

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.453
what you notice,
irrelevant to what you see,

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.850
even if you don't detect it,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:05.930
even if you don't notice it,

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.690
even if you don't know that
you're seeing different things,

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.320
even if you don't see the difference,

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.290
the fact that there is a difference,

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.610
you still might see

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.510
the objects and properties
that make the difference,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.010
you just don't realize you do.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.560
Well, if that's the conclusion

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.100
of the first part of this talk,

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.470
then the question arises,

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.667
and I've been asked this
question often enough,

00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:32.847
"Well, Fred, what then
makes your perception

00:27:32.847 --> 00:27:36.637
"of something conscious, if
you don't even have to realize

00:27:36.637 --> 00:27:39.537
"that you're conscious of
something to be conscious of it?

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:43.967
"What kind of test can we use

00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:46.537
"for our conscious perception of an object

00:27:46.537 --> 00:27:49.687
"if the person who's doing the perceiving,

00:27:49.687 --> 00:27:51.647
"doesn't even have to know

00:27:51.647 --> 00:27:54.360
"that they're conscious of something?"

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.190
There used to be a problem of other minds.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.490
How do we know other bodies
are inhabited by minds?

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.790
This looks like it's
starting to produce a problem

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.430
of one's own mind, that is,

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.940
how does one find out about
one's own conscious experience,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.210
then, what, that one is, in
fact, conscious of things

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.130
if one doesn't have to
notice them or detect them

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.343
to be conscious of them?

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.520
That's a serious question.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.730
It's a serious question

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.800
if you want to do a
science of consciousness,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.240
of conscious experience,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.980
because without some kind of test,

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.460
without some way of telling,

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.630
that a person is conscious of something,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.320
it looks like this question

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.270
of whether they're conscious of it just

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.290
doesn't get any traction at all,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.350
sounds like a philosopher's question,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.990
not a question that scientists
can legitimately raise.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.240
Alright, so that's the

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.650
question that I'm now going to address,

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.073
and I'm going to propose to you a test.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.230
Alright, this is a test
for seeing objects.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.700
I'm going to suggest a
simple minded test here.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.020
I mean, it's based on this idea

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.910
why is your experience of me conscious?

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.943
Because it gives you knowledge of me.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.940
You know I've got a blue jacket on,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.733
I'm waving my hands around,
I'm standing up behind,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.533
there's all kinds of things
you know about me right now,

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.300
and the reason you know them about me

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.680
is because you can see me,
you're conscious of me,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.763
and of various properties of me,

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.980
giving you knowledge,
so the proposed test is

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.450
that you're conscious of an object,

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.703
if for appropriate values
of the property symbol, F,

00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:50.840
a person directly sees, and
therefore, knows the fact

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.960
that X is F.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.050
Your experience of an object is conscious

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.110
if it gives you knowledge of that object.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.340
This is the test.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.810
I'm going to try to explain some of those

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.310
key words a little more
detailed in a moment,

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.100
but that, I wanted to give
you the capsule statement

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.373
of the view anyway.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.720
So, consciousness of an object,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.330
if gives you conscious
knowledge of that object.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.350
This isn't circular

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.100
because I'm defining
consciousness of objects

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.813
in terms of conscious knowledge
of facts about that object.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.460
So, the idea was this,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.450
when you, I'm now going through that

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.380
little toy example of change blindness.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.263
Here was the first, here was the second.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.903
Now,

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.110
I'm claiming

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.880
you knew something about Sam

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.450
when you saw that second figure,

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.850
what did you know about Sam?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.590
Well, that it is the same
color as the other ones.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.453
He was blue.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.133
He wasn't red.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.480
You knew that, in fact, not only of Sam,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.030
but you knew that of all
the objects in that array,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.773
that none of them were red.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.800
This is what it would look
like if Sam had been red.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.600
You would've spotted it immediately,

00:31:27.253 --> 00:31:29.710
and you know Sam wasn't red.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.870
You know and knew when you saw it,

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.460
that none of them were red.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.253
In fact, you knew also,

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.193
that none of them were star-shaped.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.160
You knew something about
each and every object

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.483
in that array,

00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:51.033
that it wasn't red, and
that it wasn't star-shaped,

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.220
if you knew something about

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.000
each and every object in that array,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.830
then, you must have seen each
and every object in that array

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.423
according to this test for awareness.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.940
Now, this test for awareness is not

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.010
just an informational test
that you're aware of something,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.990
conscious of something
if you get information,

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.350
usable information about it,

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:23.190
because the blindsighters don't know

00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:26.460
about the objects they perceive

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.760
without being conscious of them.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.480
They get the right answers
when they're forced to choose,

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.480
but they take themselves to be guessing.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.130
With you, there was no
guessing about that.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.720
You knew, I suggest, when you
saw those array of objects,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.293
that none of them were red.

00:32:48.903 --> 00:32:51.780
There's some piece of knowledge
about each and every object

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.300
in that 30-element array.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.850
There was no guessing about it.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.520
Now, let me explain a bit about that test.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.750
You have to be careful
in applying this test,

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.000
and here, I'm making some

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.713
philosophical moves.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.253
I know you

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.670
you can know something about
an object without seeing it,

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.270
I gave you already examples.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.333
I know things about my gas
tank without ever seeing it.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.640
I know things about where George
Bush is without seeing him.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.890
I read the newspapers,
so I know things, where

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.180
our President is, he's
back in Texas or something.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.240
Often, of course, we
know things about objects

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.263
without seeing them.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.560
So, when applying this test, I mean

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.320
you have the information from the object,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.140
it has to be direct, not
delivered via some intermediary,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.370
like an instrument, or a
message, or a photograph,

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.120
or a television image of something.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.760
So, the information you get
from an object has to be direct.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.290
Like, I can get information about you

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:07.530
without ever seeing you.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.263
I look into an empty room and
I know you're not in there.

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:14.500
So, I know something about you

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.630
that you're not in this room,

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.250
'cause, I look in the room, it's empty.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.010
Does that mean, according to this test,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.240
that I see you?

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.110
Because I now know something about you

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:24.943
by looking in the room?

00:34:24.943 --> 00:34:26.180
No, because

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.420
I know something about you
not by the way you look,

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.933
but by the way the room looks.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.063
The information is not delivered directly.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.830
Alright, one more example

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.483
to illustrate the way this
test is supposed to be applied.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:50.900
Fito has fleas and I'm
told that he has fleas.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.710
I can't see any of the fleas,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.840
but I'm, let's say,
know, that he has fleas.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.730
Now, I look at Fito,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.230
and I can see that none
of the fleas on Fito

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.983
are as big as a basketball.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.090
I just looked, somebody says,
"How big are those fleas?"

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.337
I said, "Well, I don't
know how big they are,

00:35:09.337 --> 00:35:12.820
"but I know none of them
are as big as a basketball."

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.550
I can just see that, if they
were as big as a basketball,

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.580
I could see the flea,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.400
but I can't see the fleas.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.870
So, I know they're not.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:21.703
Now,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.880
that's a misapplication of the test

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.773
because the size of something
effects its visibility.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.253
If you make something bigger,
you make it easier to see.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.320
Color and shape don't effect
an object's visibility,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.340
that's why

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.410
I use examples only of color and shape.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.900
If you change the color of something

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.660
you change its noticeability.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.493
If you make

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.240
among those blue objects,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.430
if you make one of them red,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.540
you'll notice it right away,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.523
it'll pop out, as they say,

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.020
but by changing the color of
something from blue to red,

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.193
you don't make it visible,
you just make it noticeable.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:16.160
Likewise, if I look into a room of people,

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.393
and someone's naked in the
room, I notice them immediately,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.560
but taking off their clothes

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.563
doesn't make them visible, it
just makes them noticeable.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.580
You know, someone with clothes
on, in a nudist colony,

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.490
would be very noticeable, but once again,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.180
changing, removing, or putting clothes on

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.330
doesn't change an object's visibility.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.620
It just changes its noticeability,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.390
so when you apply this test,

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.110
I'll ask you to keep that in mind,

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.470
that I'm only gonna deal with properties

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.560
that you can know something has

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.430
that don't affect the thing's visibility,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.030
just noticeability.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.920
Alright, one more last
comment before I come to

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.983
the example that I'm really after here,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.990
and that's about the kind of knowledge

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.070
that I'm talking about.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.640
I'm claiming you knew
something about each and every

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.133
element in that multi-element array.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.540
Now, this is a funny, perhaps,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.890
use of the word, knowledge,

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.590
but let me give you an illustration

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.610
of the kind of knowledge I have in mind.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.263
I was out to dinner with
a person the other night,

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.973
and

00:37:39.713 --> 00:37:42.600
a perfectly ordinary
dinner, and the next day,

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.580
had someone ask me, they didn't,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.297
but supposing someone
the next day asked me,

00:37:47.297 --> 00:37:50.930
"Well, did your friend have
a hat on during dinner?"

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.727
I'd say, "No."

00:37:52.727 --> 00:37:53.877
"How do you know?"

00:37:53.877 --> 00:37:57.107
"Well, I sat right across from the table.

00:37:57.107 --> 00:37:59.990
"I could see that he
didn't have a hat on,"

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.697
and they said, "Did you think
about that at the moment?

00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:03.930
"Did you think to yourself,

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.030
'Gee, he doesn't have a hat on.'"

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:10.127
I said, "No, at the time
I didn't think that,

00:38:10.127 --> 00:38:14.617
"but now that you raised
the issue, I know he didn't,

00:38:14.617 --> 00:38:16.747
"and I didn't just learn he didn't.

00:38:16.747 --> 00:38:19.627
"I knew since last night he didn't

00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:21.247
"because I saw him,

00:38:21.247 --> 00:38:23.300
"I could see that he
didn't have a hat on."

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.280
See, the idea here is, I knew
something about my friend

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.560
that he didn't have a hat on last night,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.030
even though the first time
I even thought about that

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.560
was when my friend raised the question.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.490
Then, I said, "Oh, yes,
he didn't have a hat on."

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.480
That's how I know that
when I got up this morning

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.040
there weren't any giraffes in my bedroom.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.570
You know, if someone,

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.100
I didn't think about giraffes
this morning when I got up.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.570
I didn't think that at all,

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.300
but if someone asked me

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.180
were there any in your
bedroom this morning?

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.027
I'd say, "No."

00:38:53.027 --> 00:38:54.577
"How do you know, Fred?"

00:38:54.577 --> 00:38:57.337
"Well, I can remember what my
room looked like this morning.

00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:59.877
"There just weren't any giraffes in it.

00:38:59.877 --> 00:39:02.107
"I didn't just learn
there weren't any giraffes

00:39:02.107 --> 00:39:04.290
"when you asked me."

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:05.280
Now, what this suggests

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.650
is you don't have to kind of actively

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.833
think something to know it.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:17.540
The knowledge you get, I'm
gonna call this tacit knowledge,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.800
if you will, there's a great
many things you know tacitly,

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.050
not because when you
acquired the knowledge,

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.650
you're actually thinking
about it or believing it,

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.780
but because you've had the
kind of experience of it,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.350
which, if you do later think about it,

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.210
will tell you what you need to know.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.880
So, that's how I know my friend last night

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.390
was not wearing a hat at
dinner the other night

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.210
because when I'm asked about it,

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.220
I can recall what he looked like

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.720
and I know he didn't have a hat on,

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.216
and that's why I know and
knew since this morning

00:39:52.216 --> 00:39:54.423
that there were no giraffes in my bedroom.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.080
Alright, that's the kind of knowledge

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.710
I'm attributing to you about
that multi-element array.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.307
When you saw that array, you
didn't think to yourself,

00:40:03.307 --> 00:40:06.157
"Gee, none of those elements are red.

00:40:06.157 --> 00:40:08.460
"None of them are star-shaped."

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.990
Nonetheless, once I remove the array

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.160
and asked you were any of them red,

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.910
were any of them star-shaped?

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.150
You could tell me, authoritatively,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.010
on the basis of what you saw,

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.400
that none of them were.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.630
You had that knowledge,
call it tacit knowledge,

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.873
but it was knowledge.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.910
Alright, I'm going, whoops, I'm gonna go,

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.570
what I'm going to show you now

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.673
is

00:40:39.638 --> 00:40:42.270
a brick wall,

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.420
think of it as a brick wall,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.293
of course, it's just a picture,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.890
but it's going to have,
it's gonna be very complex

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.600
that it's gonna have at
least 350 elements in it,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.630
350 bricks.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.930
I'm gonna show it to you
for a couple seconds,

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.400
then I'm gonna show it to you again,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.800
and it's gonna be different,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.530
and I don't know some of
you may see the difference,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.420
but nobody I've ever shown this to

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.073
has ever seen the difference.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.363
So, test yourself.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.730
Did you see the difference?

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.800
Alright, now the question here is

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.070
not whether you saw the difference,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.990
because seeing the
difference is seeing the fact

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.050
that those images were different,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.850
and I'm assuming none
of you saw that fact,

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.210
but I'm not now interested
in what facts you saw,

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.080
I'm interested in what bricks you saw

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.120
'cause what I wanna know

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.240
is whether the ones in your
head are conscious experience

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.880
of all those bricks,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.500
whether your conscious experience
is as rich and textured

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.853
as is, the image on this screen,

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.513
and I want to argue that it was.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.647
Alright, how do I argue that it was?

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.920
By suggesting that you know something

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.433
about each and every brick in that wall.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.670
What do you know about each
and every brick in the wall?

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.910
Well

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.743
you know

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.003
that this is the, this is
the added brick, by the way.

00:42:26.898 --> 00:42:28.143
We call that brick, Sam.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.500
That's a brick that was
there the second time,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.050
it wasn't there the first time.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.230
Now, I think you know
something about or when you saw

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.643
the second figure, you
knew something about Sam,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.610
and in fact, you knew something

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:44.220
about every brick in that wall.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.130
What did you know?

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.340
Well, you've already, I've given away

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.800
the kind of thing I'm
gonna claim you knew.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.093
You knew, for instance,
that none of them were blue.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.690
This is what the wall would've looked like

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.560
had Sam been blue,

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.080
and you would've spotted Sam immediately,

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.363
if Sam had been blue.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.950
So, you know Sam wasn't blue.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.053
In fact, you know they were all orange.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.280
You know that none of them were blue,

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.700
and you know, in fact, that
none of them were tilted.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.963
They were all horizontal.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.040
You would've spotted a tilted one.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.623
So, this is what you knew when
you saw the second figure,

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.023
that each and every brick
in that wall was orange.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.040
I'm not using orange very strictly here,

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.630
just think of orange as
not blue, or black, or

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.540
all the other colors it might have been.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.373
Let's just say

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.480
that it wasn't blue

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.480
and it was horizontal, that
it wasn't tilted like this.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.860
Those are things you knew
about the bricks, each brick.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.170
Now, I've got to argue here

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.350
that not only did you know that about Sam,

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.730
but you knew it about each
and every brick in that wall,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.830
and the argument's going to
be fairly straightforward.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.740
I'm going to claim that you had 350

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.943
distinct pieces of knowledge,

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.743
one for each brick in the wall.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.400
Now,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.760
you didn't have one piece of knowledge

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.000
of something general in nature,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.330
you didn't know that none
of the bricks in the wall

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.363
were blue or tilted.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.890
You didn't have that
piece of general knowledge

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.540
because you couldn't see

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.240
whether those were all
the bricks in the wall.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.640
For all you know,

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.280
I gave you a snapshot
of one part of the wall

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.300
and maybe there were other
parts that you couldn't see

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.030
in which, there were
blue and tilted bricks.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.060
So, you couldn't see that
none of the bricks in the wall

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.830
were blue or titled
because you couldn't see

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.040
that you were seeing all of the bricks.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.300
Nonetheless, if those were
all the bricks in the wall

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.570
and I assure you they were,

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.730
then you could see of each
and every one of them,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.733
that none of them were blue or tilted,

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.353
as I indicate,

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.110
and logicians express this,

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.760
this is kinda the array
knowledge versus the de dicto

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.210
that for all x, if x
is a brick in the wall,

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.020
you could see that x is
neither blue nor tilted.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.463
That's what you could see.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.230
Something about each and
every brick in the wall.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.000
You do not see

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.400
that for all x, if x
is a brick in the wall,

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.770
well then, it's neither blue nor tilted,

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.390
you don't, you can't see something

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.790
general in nature like that,

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.230
but you do know something
about each and every brick,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.830
but it's a distributed sense of all,

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.563
not a collective sense of all.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.753
Alright, conclusion.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.510
Therefore, those of you

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:06.510
of normal vision, now, this
is not a priori philosophy.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.040
I don't know.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.920
I'm making a claim about
everyone in this room

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.740
that you all knew something

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.720
about each and every brick in the wall.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.140
I don't know whether that's true or not

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.610
because I don't know that much

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.300
about your individual visual capacities,

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.330
maybe some of you are colorblind,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.560
maybe some of you could
barely see this screen,

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.723
let alone see each brick up there.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.100
Maybe some of you looked with only one eye

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.760
and looked so briefly

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.060
that some of the bricks
fell on your blindspot.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.780
You didn't actually
see some of the bricks.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.120
All kinds of things
could've prevent individuals

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.320
from seeing what I'm claiming

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.830
people of normal vision would
have seen if they looked.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.653
So, this is a, an
empirical claim I'm making,

00:46:53.653 --> 00:46:56.460
that if you had normal vision,

00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:00.920
and if you let, looked
for several seconds,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.750
several seconds, by the way,
is enough time for the eye

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:07.740
to execute six or seven saccades

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.280
making different parts of that brick wall

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.760
fall on the sensitive part
of the retina, the fovea.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.220
So, if you looked at that brick wall for

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.300
just two or three seconds,

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.510
chances are, the eye
executed enough saccades

00:47:25.762 --> 00:47:28.380
to make most of the bricks anyway

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.840
fall on that very sensitive discriminating

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.790
part of the retina,

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.030
but this is an empirical claim I'm making,

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.190
if, it would have to be tested.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.270
What I would do is show
you those brick walls,

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:43.290
take each individual one by one,

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.850
show you them again and again

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.100
and see if you could tell,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.770
whether any brick was blue or tilted

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.313
in a two-second exposure.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.090
My bet is that people of vision

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.460
will be able to tell

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.510
and then, know whether
any brick in that wall

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.080
is blue or tilted in two-second exposures,

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.930
no matter which brick we're talking about.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.450
If that's true of you,

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.950
and whether it's true of you or not,

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.910
it's an empirical question,

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.640
then, I'm going to
claim you know something

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.370
and could see that something was true

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.263
of each and every brick
in the wall, hence,

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.410
according to the proposed test

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.700
for consciousness of an object,

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.270
you were conscious of
every brick in the wall,

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.050
350 different bricks,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.050
and that tells us something
important about the texture,

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.890
the richness of your conscious experience

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.290
of a complex stimulus, like a brick wall,

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.740
and I think it tells us something about

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.970
our everyday experiences
of the complex stimuli

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.240
we look at everyday.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.273
Thank you very much.

00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:54.554
(audience applauding)

00:48:56.161 --> 00:48:57.589
- That was wonderful.

00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:58.623
I want to ask you,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.420
I don't know what you would say

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.400
to the following proposition,

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.400
but you can sometimes see
global facts about an array,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.030
good in front of you,

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.070
without dividing that from your seeing

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.913
of lots of local facts about the array.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.613
What I mean is,

00:49:16.613 --> 00:49:19.420
for example, if you took
your geometric display

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.727
for change blindness and you asked us

00:49:22.727 --> 00:49:24.830
"Is this symmetrical?"

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.780
You know, "Is there an axis
about which this is symmetric?"

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.320
Then, one way to do it

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.032
would be to see where each and
everything in the display is

00:49:35.032 --> 00:49:37.410
then write all that down,

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:41.610
and then, derive from that by
some geometric calculation,

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.100
whether the thing is symmetric,

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.070
but actually, that's not what we do.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.920
You just look and have a glance,

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.903
you can see this global fact,
the display is symmetric.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.310
So, let me just ask you,
how do you feel about that?

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:01.260
Seeing a global fact, instead of an array.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.210
- That sounds exactly right,
the way you described that.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.510
In this case, you're
seeing a fact about the,

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.950
the set or the array, not
a fact about any individual

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.630
in the array, yup.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:13.350
- [Participant] And what I wonder is,

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:17.100
isn't everything in the
array being the same color,

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.970
like that, a global property of the array?

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.100
You just look at it

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.570
and you say, "Yeah, it's
all the same color,"

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:28.040
but I didn't derive that
from a lot of local facts

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.580
about the color of this,
and the color of that,

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.700
and the color of that.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.763
- Alright, yeah.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.980
Well, if you didn't derive it,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.753
see, let me,

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.782
well, the brick wall,

00:50:44.782 --> 00:50:49.673
if I put a piece of masking
tape over any brick,

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.050
I would destroy your knowledge
that none of the bricks

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.710
were blue or tilted.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.380
You could no longer tell,

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.200
you would no longer be a reliable teller,

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.170
whether none of the
bricks were blue or tilted

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:07.080
because I had obscured
an individual brick.

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.840
I conclude from that,

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.260
oh, I guess we're, I conclude from that

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.720
that it was, in part, at least

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.163
the way that brick looked,

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:21.910
that told you what you now
know about all the bricks,

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.470
that none of them were blue or tilted,

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.450
and if I obscure any brick in that wall,

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.240
it's going to destroy the
knowledge, which you have,

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.120
I take it that means that

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.620
each brick, looking some way to you,

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.600
was instrumental in what you came to know.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.600
- [Participant] Okay, I see the move,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.310
but I wouldn't go in indefinitely,

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.570
but I see the move,

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.910
but I guess what I wonder is,

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.160
if that is the right quantifier,

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.967
in all the bricks in the wall,

00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:51.260
and what I see at a glace is
that all the visible bricks

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.650
are the same color,
and if you occlude one,

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.400
that's fine it doesn't count anymore.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.160
It's no longer a visible brick,

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.320
but what I'm still getting at a glance

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.840
is this global property
of the whole array.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.070
All the visible bricks are the same color.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:09.020
I mean, (chuckles) forgetting
global properties of an array,

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.330
vision is just gonna tell
you about what's visible.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.290
You know, it will do its best,

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.930
and if you go around to occluding things,

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.017
well its just by itself.

00:52:18.142 --> 00:52:19.140
- Yeah, I guess

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:21.393
this is good.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.510
I think what I have to
argue here, I won't,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.270
is that this is not a
global fact about the array.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:32.770
You're, when you say

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.560
you're able to tell
something about the array

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.800
that none of them, none
of the visible ones,

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.650
that seems to me a distributive claim

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:43.530
about each and every brick.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.490
It's not a fact about,

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:49.490
well, it adds up to a fact
about all the visible ones,

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.710
but the general fact
that you reach comes from

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.060
what you know about each
and every brick, but

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.383
nice question.

00:53:01.305 --> 00:53:04.310
- If you allow yourself to talk
in such an unrestricted way

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:07.440
about seeing facts, it looks
like you're committed to saying

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.050
that we see an infinite number of facts

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.680
because if you can see
that there are no giraffes

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.890
in your bedroom,

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.560
well presumably, you also
saw there were no elephants,

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.540
no aardvarks, no hippopotamidae,

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.940
no Chevrolet station wagons, et cetera,

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.820
and you saw that there
weren't three giraffes,

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.150
there weren't four giraffes, et cetera.

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:27.370
So, it looks like you've
got an infinite number.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.603
That's an enormous visual capacity.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.510
And then, my second question is

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.970
one feels uncomfortable
with your handling of the

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:41.610
of the change blindness cases

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.100
because it looks like there's
some slight of hand involved,

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.180
and I wonder how you
would deal with cases like

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.190
the change blindness experiment

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:52.410
where they throw the basketball

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.570
and then, the guy walks through wearing a

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.340
an orangutan costume.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.990
Are you committed to the
viewer that you do see the guy,

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:02.610
even though you were not aware of it?

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.480
- Yeah.
- And how do you deal,

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.930
what's the knowledge you get?

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.080
- Well the, he

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.003
he wasn't wearing a
clown suit or you know,

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:17.323
I don't know.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.120
I would have to find something
you knew about the gorilla.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.390
Alright this, John's eluding to the

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.730
kind of change blindness experiment where

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.150
subjects are asked to watch
people throwing basketballs

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.200
and concentrate on how
many passes this team made,

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.974
and while they're doing this,

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.720
somebody dressed in a gorilla costume

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:44.720
walks through the scene and
exits and people have said,

00:54:44.757 --> 00:54:47.470
"Did you notice anything funny going on?"

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:50.037
Often people, often than
not, there are people saying

00:54:50.037 --> 00:54:52.590
"No, I didn't see anything, what's funny?"

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:57.040
I was with the group that, the
girl, woman next to me said,

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.780
she's with, we all knew

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.000
when we were watching for the gorilla,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.580
so, but she said she
didn't see the gorilla.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.400
Now, John's asking me

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.330
am I going to claim she
did see the gorilla,

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.220
just didn't notice him.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.403
I think it's likely she did see him

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.340
and didn't notice him.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.140
It's like my wife at the farmer's market.

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.870
I did see her, I just didn't notice her.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.330
I thought she was wearing a red sweater,

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.550
so I didn't pay any attention

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.093
to the blue sweaters and
so on, yep, I did see her.

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.500
I think this person was
concentrating on the passes,

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.100
just didn't notice that gorilla.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.010
How I would argue it,
given the thesis here,

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:43.660
I would have to show
that there's something

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.460
the person knew about the gorilla

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.880
that, that could be demonstrated

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.660
and I don't know what that could be.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.580
I'd have to think up something,

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.673
but your first question was, yeah.

00:55:55.673 --> 00:55:56.720
- [Participant] It relates
to the first question.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.980
Namely, it looks like it's going to be

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.470
some negative thing that you know,

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.170
like, she wasn't

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.170
as big as a Cadillac station wagon,

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.710
'cause if she had been,
then you would have noticed

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:09.910
- Yeah.
- [Participant] The gorilla,

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:12.170
but then it, then it looks like,

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.840
well now, if we allow ourselves to talk

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.430
in an unrestricted way
about seeing negative facts,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.730
it looks like you see an
infinite number of negative facts

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.280
whenever you open your eyes.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.323
- Yeah, I,

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.170
but I'm not worried
about all this knowledge

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:28.240
since it all comes free, kind of,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.110
that is, given that you
don't have to believe it,

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.400
no active belief

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:37.100
because that's the sense, in
which, the guy I was having

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:41.400
dinner with last night, I
knew he wasn't wearing a hat.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.840
Well, I knew he wasn't naked,

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.990
I knew he wasn't in a clown costume, and

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:48.690
all these infinite things,

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:51.090
but they all come free

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.480
because the information, which
supports the knowledge claim

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.850
was all there in the experience

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.840
and that's what tacit knowledge is,

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.960
knowing things, which is
supported by the experience,

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.770
in this case, the remembered experience,

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.180
you gotta remember the experience enough.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.920
If you forget what he looked like,

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.440
and somebody says, "Was he wearing a hat?"

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.807
And you said, "I don't think so,

00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:16.347
"but I actually don't remember.

00:57:16.347 --> 00:57:18.670
"I wasn't paying that
much attention to him."

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.600
But, if you were paying
attention, then you know,

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.030
and that's a free piece of knowledge

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:29.030
and if it's free, that free,
infinite doesn't matter.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:29.953
You get it all.

00:57:33.112 --> 00:57:36.279
(audience applauding)

00:57:38.032 --> 00:57:40.699
(bright music)
