Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today, well today we're going to tell you a story which we hope does not become your future, but it raises a simple question. We all have computers, we love computers, we depend upon computers. But what if the cost of using your computer becomes more than you're willing to pay two stories today, which suggest that we might be at the very beginning of a nightmare to first comes from a journalist, Alina Simone and her mother ina. I mean do you want to start with my mom? Cause it really happened to her,

Speaker 2:          00:32          her, you know, she, she only got in touch with me maybe on day six. [inaudible] Huh? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Okay. So, well yeah, day one. What was the first, first thing

Speaker 2:          00:41          it happened on day one, one tampon that I called Tufts university a t services because my husband, folks at Tufts complaining that my computer is unbearably amber

Speaker 1:          00:57          bliss. Slow stills it, I don't know what's going on. Every time I try to open a window it's like click, click full, practically stop to working. What do I do?

Speaker 2:          01:08          Checked whatever I said and I'm probably nothing rebooted, so did nothing basically. Then she went away for the weekend and when I came back I turned the computer on and like it was doing something and they so many, many windows covering your screen and those windows multiplied. I cannot open any of them and I could not figure, but it was very late at night

Speaker 1:          01:42          so she went to bed, got up the next day called [inaudible] Gan asking for help. They had no idea what was going on. No, she says at this point, whatever the computer had been doing, it was done. All the windows disappeared except now anytime she tried to click any of her files, pictures, videos, I cannot open any of them. Instead, every time this message would pop up

Speaker 2:          02:07          and the message says,

Speaker 3:          02:09          what happened to your files? My files, all of your files have been protected with a strong encryption encrypted using crypto wall. This means that the structure and data within your files have been irrevocably changed and in order to get them back to unlock files, you must pay 500 US dollars. If you really value your data, then we suggest that you do not waste valuable time searching for the solutions because they do not exist.

Speaker 1:          02:40          You're saying that somebody went into your computer and locked up all of your things?

Speaker 2:          02:44          Yeah, they gave me the exact clown,

Speaker 3:          02:48          5,726 files encrypted

Speaker 1:          02:52          live. When you say they, did you have any image in your head of who? My first thought was Russia or Ukraine,

Speaker 2:          03:00          which is even better. Why? Because you know, everybody talks about excellent, fantastic education there, especially math. I'm from the, I know, you know, she's right. They surpassed the u s and educating their kids when it comes to math and science and they've got a severe underemployment problem, especially outside of the major cities, which is where these viruses often trace down to not Moscow and St Petersburg. But we're talking about, you know, backwater. I was so positive that, uh, it comes from that part of the world that I wrote them in Russian family. The criminals had provided her a link to a website where she could send them a message, you know, customer sport. I rode them [inaudible] I don't know how to translate it in English. [inaudible] SAMHSA, like I wish you all die. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:57          in Russian language [inaudible] to die for humans or in other word for animals said use the animal one. Yeah, it's not a curse, but they got the message now ina says she thought about a just wiping the computer clean so that she wouldn't have to pay. Then it occurred to her that her husband had all these files on there, which he needed, you know, like business receipts that he hadn't filed yet and she's lazy to do. So he has [inaudible] and she's right that like, you know, she has this tax information, this reimbursement information and ultimately it's worth more than $500. My husband did not want to buy overall themes,

Speaker 3:          04:39          so ina decides to follow the instructions, basically one download and installed horror browser. So she goes and installs this browser called Tor, which apparently is more traceable to Rhonda Browser in Wade for initialization. She does that three type in the address Bar, k Pie, seven YCR, seven j x Q, and she's directed to a site where it basically tells her, look, if you don't trust us, we can decrypt

Speaker 2:          05:05          one of your files for free as a sample that when you pay us, you would know that you could really get all your files back. Huh. And I was curious, I decided that I will try it. So she clicked the button that said yes and we got one file back. But as soon as I did the glocks, that chicken, literally, she says, a little clock appeared at the top of the browser. They gave me exactly seven days,

Speaker 3:          05:41          167 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds. So you decrypt the thing and then suddenly it's a countdown.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Yes. They say, if you won't pay by this day, then the fire a little bit of both. And if the wound bed in one more beat, then you will lose your files forever and you will never get that back.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Now in the message that it told INA that she had to pay that $500 fine, not in dollars, but in Bitcoin,

Speaker 2:          06:15          you know, I, this was the first time in my life ever, I heard the term bit corns. So I um, found this website called coin cafe where you can buy bitcoins in to buy this bitcoins is a nightmare

Speaker 1:          06:36          for what? Yeah, what she needed to do with exchange 500 bucks for the requisite amount of bitcoins. And at the time, uh, 500 bucks equals 1.37 bitcoins. But before she could even make that exchange, she had to fill out all these forms of all these questions.

Speaker 2:          06:52          What happened? What is the reason to buy bitcoin and reasons were listed. One of them was ransom. So then yes, it would the first reason to pay a ransom to the criminals. She says after you fill out all the forms, you have to make a big chair and send them a photograph through the Internet. Okay. I did not have a camera because your camera happened to be in the shot or one of them that I have to make a picture of. My husband called in a driver's license, Sam them this picture back, so they was banquet the criminals. This is the people who sell you bitcoin in exchange for your money. I told you that it's a torture. It's unbelievable,

Speaker 1:          07:51          but eventually she was able to find a neighbor, borrow the camera, take the picture she needs to take. Then she had to get the money she wanted to exchange to coin cafe and it turns out the preferred way to do it, the most secure way to do it is not online, but through a money order. They sold the day before. Nothing's given Wednesday, still had about six days before the deadline, so she thought, all right, I'll just pop down to the post office, get the money order,

Speaker 2:          08:15          but Lexington and the whole Massachusetts [inaudible] terrible, terrible,

Speaker 1:          08:24          no storms. For a lot of us, this could be the biggest storms so far. This winter, drivable road and significant snow, a wet snow at that. I had to go to the post office so she plows through the snow, almost kills herself but gets there and gets everything together, sends it off

Speaker 2:          08:41          and it's like, all right, so finally I sent everything out. The post office assured me that they will get it on Friday, which is the first working day after the sense given. Okay, so one Friday she called coin cafe.

Speaker 3:          09:00          They did not get it on set of the, they did not get it on Monday in the morning, nothing was delivered and I was desperate because my deadline was Tuesday. Samson like 12 o'clock and I start calling the post office, whatever, nobody knows and they sing. They said yes, two days, but there is no guarantee.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Finally Walk Block in the afternoon on Monday, but 24 hours before the deadline, they got it and they send me bitcoins in exchange because they got my money. But she says when she went online to check her bitcoin account, I am $13 [inaudible] nearly 400 and and I start calling them, I basically the exchange rate of change on her. She had bought it at 500 now it was worth four 87 I asked them how often do we change the exchange rate in this at every minute. It's not a joke. Yeah, every minute. I said, are you crazy? I was a double victim. I was with them. Square cube. You see what I mean? Because driving was terrible. I have to stand on my head to get a camera and then I was struggling to Sam them. That's the problem with this crime. Like the criminals need a better way to get money from the victim, but everything else is traceable. I'm on the edge of my seat here. So you're $13 short.

Speaker 2:          10:42          I'm calling they, they said there is one more way. One more way. And what does it, we have a ATM machine. You said what? Yeah, became an ATM machine. One live one and I said, where is it? It's in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, New York. 200 miles away. Wait a second, I don't understand this. There is one ATM that is in the borough of Brooklyn where you do not live, but luckily her daughter, Alina lives in Brooklyn. You asked me how my daughter got involved that Scow, so she calls Alina. Yeah. My mom called me the night before the Ranson was due. So are you aware of any of this attack point at this point? No. No. I remember, you know, I was at night, I had the TV on and I have a toddler, you know, always all these things going on. I was probably on my laptop too.

Speaker 2:          11:32          I was doing like 12 things and my mom called and she was like upset with a capital u. She started ranting about criminals and ransom and I literally thought she was like talking in air quotes. I'm like, Oh yeah, I know when I go to tech sir. And like, yeah, they're threats, extortion. And my mom was like, no, like no, really around some dope. They're really criminals. Her mom told her Google crypto wall. I was like, holy, this is really a thing. Plus I started googling as she suggested I do and found out that police departments had paid this, that a sheriff's department and Dixon, Tennessee had just paid it to unlock like, you know, 70 plus thousand case files. And I was like, yeah, go after police department. I've gone after governments, universities, corporations, police departments. Question ever come up in your mind like why my mom?

Speaker 2:          12:22          No, not at all. Cause like a million people in the u s have been infected with criminal. Yes. Anyhow, next day was it six hours left to Alina, please go to this ATM so we can just, you done with this whole thing? You can cut it later but they can tell you that in the morning. She said, I have a date for my granddaughter date to play date. I won't be able to do it until 12 o'clock and they call again. I said I was crazy. I don't have time. So I go out to Greenpoint, this ATM and you know I just want to add that to your head. Your plate like handled my po. I didn't t I called you. You shorten it. You might get okay. Right. Okay. So should I cut my playdate short? Sorry. Forget that crucial detail. And I go out to Greenpoint and they have an ATM and I'm just worried that there's going to be 57 people all lined up at this single ATM that you're there.

Speaker 2:          13:25          We're totally not 57 people. I mean most people do take care of this remotely. Like there was no one at this ATM. I mean what was funny about the ATM is like I'm expecting like, yeah, I've been to an ATM, like I have a capital one account, I know what an ATM is, you know, but this was on like the second floor of a workshare space in Brooklyn. It was like in the hallway there was like a bike hanging from a wall kind of blocking it and there was like a paper sign taped to the wall that just had a printout from a computer that just said Bitcoin ATM, all lower case letters and an arrow to this phone booth. It looked very Soviet. Like if you've seen photos of those phones with no buttons and there's just a receiver and it's totally scary. It's like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:06          Like you just pick it up and like somebody is always on the other line or something. It was like that. It was just this box with a screen and no buttons and a camera eye. And what you do is you hold up your QVC Code, is that what they're called? QVC? What are they called? QRC. Yeah, it's like a barcode. So there's this QRC code and my mom had emailed it to me and it was like, you need to print this out and this is a sent. This essentially gives you access to my account to top it off, you know? And so I put this QRC code up to the camera on and it kind of went bloop and then it was like we are accessing your account. And then I got a spinny wheel, the wheel of death, funny wheel elitist, starts frantically dialing her mom.

Speaker 2:          14:53          The guys at Queen Cafe, I called, you know, I left like three phone messages. I left five. So finally they called me back like 20 minutes later said, okay, we're sending a technician over to fix the machine. Which was very cool. I didn't think that would happen. And so, you know, the technician was there and he fixed the machine and he helps me deposit these $25 and then, um, it, we start talking and he was, he was like, yeah, you know, he knew my mom cause you know, he'd been talking to her on the phone. He's like, I feel so bad for your mom. We've been getting so many of these cases. And I'm like, why are you, why a lot of these cases, yeah. I was like, why are you guys getting so why is everyone coming to you? And he's like, oh, I know why. Because in the ransom note that they give a list of preferred vendors and we are number one or two.

Speaker 4:          15:40          What does the introduction with a bad introduction to Bitcoin, like we're going to hold you ransom for all your information until you, you know, use this new currency to pay us off. I mean, that's so terrible.

Speaker 1:          15:52          This is Mike Coats and John [inaudible]. They are the co owners of coins.

Speaker 4:          15:56          I had a few weeks back, a grandmother who was in tears. She was going to lose all of her family photos and because the deadline was coming up, you know, crawling on the phone to me and it got it. It felt horrible.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Now clearly people who sell bitcoin just believe that there should be a digital currency that is decentralized. It doesn't rely on the banks, but unfortunately it has become the currency of choice for ransom. And so they, they're in this weird position.

Speaker 5:          16:21          So it's a tricky thing because like, I can't sell bitcoin to someone who I know is going to do something illegal with it, right.

Speaker 1:          16:28          That's will wheeler who runs a bitcoin exchange called express coin. And he says he and the other exchanges are really worried right now that if they keep helping the little guys pay the ransom in order to get their files back, they are in effect making themselves accessories to a crime.

Speaker 5:          16:41          I finally got a call back from a fin cen, uh, which is the federal authority for Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They said that we could perceive paying a ransom as unlawful activity. And so they might choose to use that against the company who helps out, right. And likely until we get a straight answer from Vince and we'll take the, uh, overly cautious approach and start declining these transactions. Even though in your heart you want to help. Well, yeah, I mean, do I want to risk being indicted for helping you get your, uh, travel receipts reimbursed from your company? And I mean, to me the answer's no.

Speaker 1:          17:19          In any case, after Alina deposits the extra 25 bucks in her mom's bitcoin account, ina the mom goes online, [inaudible] leaked

Speaker 2:          17:32          and it was gone. But then about an hour later, I went to my computer and [inaudible] the message that you are Lynn Jones out that I was doing the half hours late,

Speaker 3:          17:52          you have to pay

Speaker 2:          17:54          $1,300 roughly. I did not have anybody to turn to.

Speaker 1:          18:01          So she went to that same website where you can write them a message.

Speaker 2:          18:04          I wrote them that I was late, but I mentioned the snow storm, the things given, which they probably [inaudible] off. And the, of course, the wonderful u s uh, mail service. I said that I tried and I was only two hours late and then all of a sudden

Speaker 6:          18:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:32          I am getting the message you paid in full

Speaker 6:          18:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:38          without any explanation. Nothing you pay. That's it. And I got all my files back.

Speaker 6:          18:47          Oh,

Speaker 3:          18:47          do you think that they took pity on her eye? Maybe I felt that

Speaker 2:          18:53          it's over. Finally. It's really over.

Speaker 6:          18:57          No. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:04          it does make you wonder like who these people are. Leave a story about that up next

Speaker 6:          19:16          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          20:42          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. So here's the next obvious who did this to

Speaker 7:          20:48          you know like do we know anything about them? When we put that question to a Joseph men investigative reporter for Reuters, done a ton of work in this area and his hunch was that Inas right? We're talking people, Russian speaking folks. By and large you had a book called fatal system error, which is sort of a deep dive into the Russian hacking scene and much of it is as you'd expect, you know, young guys, early twenties kind of Grubby by and large, they do not live a lavish lifestyle. There are guys at the top of these criminal organizations that are very flashy

Speaker 8:          21:21          there like sort of pop icon, some of them in the same way that rap stars are in the u s there's a hacker magazine with Gino as has has guys with their sports cars and the supermodels and whatever, you know, buying bottle service, you know discos at three in the morning. Those are the guys who hire the 20 year olds. They hired the 20 year olds where they're their franchise and he says the 20 year old brants working

Speaker 7:          21:44          office parks. Yeah, it's like a call center type of atmosphere. Is there like you know that's pretty Sir Kelsey Padgett Ivan in a cubicle at his computer board. He has a meeting later with Judy in HR and he's mad about it. Is that the kind of like environment that these people are in? For the most part? I think so, yes. The larger point is that it's not just like you're a lone wolf pimply faced hacker anymore. Cybercrime is now super organized. It is often corporate. It is big business in the whole sort of economy seems to revolve around these secret sites where people come together to buy and sell, things like that. Ransomware from our last story there, these underground web forms, the end, there's a variety. Some are available. You can reach you on the open Internet. The more impressive ones are password protected. You know, you have to know somebody to get in the really, really fancy ones. You have to have a couple of people vouch for you. You actually have to apply with your resume, your hackers resume. Here are the things I can bring. These are the kinds of hacking exploits that I've had and therefore I should be part of your exclusivity

Speaker 9:          22:50          club.

Speaker 7:          22:53          That Stina Temple rast in NPR, cyber crime correspondent. She's been tracking the government's attempts to shut down some of these sites, which she describes as sort of a hackers black market. Bizarre. So let's say someone is looking for a bunch of credit card numbers that have been stolen. You can get it there. There's at one price, if they're mastercard gold and another price for you know, a higher level credit, whatever. Let's say you wanted to know about a boss or an employee or a girlfriend, you can get this piece of software that allows you to turn on their phone at any, anytime. You could basically ease drop on them cause you're in their pocket and for $300 a month you would actually get customer service and the prices actually keep coming down. It's a very, very evolved fluid marketplace. There's feedback and there's escrow. There are feedback forms coming that CIF was not really, there was like didn't, didn't do the fee, the robbery. Right. Absolutely. Particularly for something. You'll see it a lot for

Speaker 10:         23:46          um, freshness of credit cards. Cause you know, it's easy to say, you know, here are 10,000 credit card numbers, but if their credit card numbers had been out for awhile and get declined, everybody you've just wasted your money and these people were called rippers a is in there ripping you off and they will get banned from the form. Wow. It's reputational. Just like everywhere else. Yeah. And it's, it's as good as Ebay. If you feel safe doing business on Ebay, there's no reason you shouldn't feel safe doing business with the criminals.

Speaker 7:          24:11          Now, uh, all of this to me frankly felt like just a sexy hacker talk until a couple of months ago, Dina started telling us about this one particular site. Actually the biggest of these kinds of sites. It's out there. It's called dark code. Yeah. The way it has been described by law enforcement is sort of an amazon.com for hackers. Actually, here's specifically how us attorney David Hickson described to her in an interview.

Speaker 11:         24:33          Uh, dark code is the largest English speaking criminal cyber crime forum in the world.

Speaker 7:          24:40          And one of the, I think most people know Silk Road and they know, for example, you could get a contract hit a a from Silk Road and drugs and guns and everything else. So would it be right for me to say that this was sort of a Silk Road for hackers?

Speaker 11:         24:52          Yeah, I wouldn't want to draw that direct comparison. I think it's probably accurate. I would say that all measure of cyber crime that you see and watch around the world was in some form or fashion connected through it.

Speaker 7:          25:04          So we got really interested in this world of this site, dark coat in the people in it. And so with Deena we started calling around trying to find anyone that would talk. And after weeks of searching and calling and lawyering, we found a guy who agreed to go on the record. My name is Daniel [inaudible] and uh, I am a reformed hacker as far as we know. Dan has never talked about this publicly. So how did you get involved with Darko? Well, I was one of the people who created it a very long time ago. Daniel story begins, not in Russia, but in Milwaukee. Sure. Well, let me, let me start with a little bit of con's. Small Middleclass suburb right outside of Milwaukee. Do you have brothers and sisters? Two younger brothers and two younger sisters. Big family. You have to share rooms with them or were you in your own little kingdom? [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          25:51          I shared a room with both my brothers for a lot of years. In fact, that sort of plays into the story cause he says what he would do to sort of escape is go to the basement and play video games. So yes, the, the stereotypical hacker in his parent's basement. I know, I know. It's quite hilarious. Dan says his hacking began innocently enough when he would monkey with games like age of empires. I hadn't changed the graphics change, the artificial intelligence of the game, the way it plays, um, rework it, create new maps, that type of thing. Um, something I enjoyed. And slowly, uh, throughout my teenage years that developed into something more

Speaker 12:         26:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         26:33          I, uh, did not get along well with a lot of my peers in, in grade, in middle school. So I spent, um, a lot more time know on the computer and on myself than I did, um, socially at least at that age. And he says one day he was in a chat room and internet chat room was called game search, talking with a bunch of other people about video games. And um, at some point along the way he meets this guy, you know, this, this particular guy was into, you know, botnets. Oh yes. Botnets. We all cry. Yeah. Just remind us what, what, what's going on there. Botnets are, you know, malware viruses installed on computers and um, botnets, you know, are the way to centrally control a whole lot of infected computers. Just to, to put this in context for saying, cause I think this is totally fascinating. Joseph Mens says that this whole

Speaker 7:          27:24          botnet situation, it started with spam. One of the easiest ways to make money on the Internet back pre 2000 a was spam. Spam is in and out, penis extensions, all that stuff. What happened was that the, in the olden days, most servers mail servers, uh, acted as open relays, meaning the mail people wouldn't really pay attention to who was sending what. So the spammers with spam, with abandon, and then spam got to be enough of a problem that the techies of the world decided that's it. They started to block people. Like if they found a guy who they thought was sending too many product emails or whatever, they would block his IP address so that he couldn't send any more mail. So what the spammers and their contractors then needed to do was to have a bunch of clean IP addresses and send spam from that. So what they did, which is totally genius, totally evil, is they hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of viruses, disseminated those viruses across the internet.

Speaker 7:          28:21          People would accidentally click or open something, get them onto their computer, and then suddenly the spammers could now remote control our computers at a distance whenever they wanted for maybe just an hour or two a night to send out their spam because these were clean IP addresses. Of course. What happened is that once the spammers had these botnets, they started thinking, Hey, I could do something else with this. And the next thing that came along was denial of service attacks. You can have all of them tried to contact ebay.com at the same time and knock over Ebay.

Speaker 13:         28:53          This first gentleman that I ran into, he had a botnets of um, well over a thousand computers, which you know, at the time was amazing to me, you know, by today's standards, a thousand for. And that is nothing now they can get up into the millions. But um, you know, back then it was quite incredible to me and cause he says he was in this chat room, this guy was there and this guy would get into fights with people. And anytime he did, he'd point his 1000 computer drone army at that enemy and bet few, man, I'm gonna Knock your Internet offline and there's nothing you can do about it. You know, if it was something in a game, he could knock the game server that they were playing on offline, you know, stop their game. Things like that. Take away years ball back in 1935.

Speaker 13:         29:32          That is exactly it. Taking away someone else's ball over the internet. So this for some reason intrigued you? Yes. It was amazing to me. I'm like, you have of a thousand computers. Wow. You know, how, how did you do this? You know, I, I had, at the time I had never heard of botnets. I didn't know about any of this stuff. Like how did you, how did you get the software to do this? How did you get it onto all these computers? And he was quite happy to tell you all that. Oh, he certainly was this, this particular gentleman had a very large ego. And did you see him as a bad guy? Um, yeah. To be honest, I, I think at that age I didn't really, uh, think about it that deeply. It's the Internet. It's a lot harder to, um, kind of quantify right and wrong there. I mean, now doesn't mean it's easy to look back at that and say, yeah, this is wrong, but it's not like going up to someone and punching them in the face. There's no human connection there. You don't see these people or feel these people. He says at the time it was just sheer curiosity.

Speaker 6:          30:32          Okay.

Speaker 13:         30:32          So he says he asked this Pied Piper guy to send him some with the Bot software that made the botnet go. And that really intrigued me, you know, digging through the source code, trying to understand what is this thing doing, how does it work, how does it tick? And this guy, was he a good coder? Like is he good at it? Was he good at it? Yeah. Uh, no, no, I, I would, uh, you know, in hindsight now, you know, he's what I would classify as a script kitty. You know, someone who that is, but it's a whole new curse to read off a script Kiddie. So a script kitty is someone who has just enough technical ability to Kinda take some tools and software that other people have created and just use them. Yeah. To fast forward. As Dan went the opposite direction of the script kitties and got better and better and started making these botnets that could literally spy on people as they were using their computers.

Speaker 13:         31:24          Interesting to see all the porn that people are watching, that type of thing. He says he found himself in another chat room that was called Bach Talk. This kind of place where hackers swap tips. Brag like, Hey, look what I did. I had to face this website, take a look, and he says, one day he was talking with a coder friend of his guy named is there though we were talking and why don't we set up a community where we can really filter who gets to join and to let all these script kitties and idiots in, I actually chose the name. I came up with that a nice lame name. I actually think it's pretty little name again. Dark Code. Dark Code. It's like with the carer. K. O. D. E I think. Right? It seemed cooler with the k. Yes. So we chose the name and started getting the site set up the rules where it would be invite only.

Speaker 13:         32:08          So you had to have an invite and each new person would be required to demonstrate their skill. You know, here's a piece of software that I created, or here's a video of my botnet and action. And at some point I'm not too long after it was created, it was decided for one reason or another that you know, hey, we got all these programmers on here, that's great, but you know, they also want to be able to sell some of the stuff they're making. So let's invite some people who would be willing to buy some of this stuff. This now begins to sound like a fair, you said, well, I have a burglar's tool. Do you a door, you want a burgle and then I'll rent you my tool. That's a simplification. But yeah, people would post and say, I'm looking to buy x, or here's this piece of software I created. Here's all the things it does, here's some screenshots of it in action and here's the price. Could be a certain type of botnet software. It could be buying a botnet itself. You know, if you don't want to build one yourself, you want to buy us one that somebody else already created and has going. I mean, I can get you onto 200,000 or 20,000 computers just giving me a check. Yeah. What they called them were installs, installs, you know, hey guys, I've got installs and they're $10 per 1000 something like that.

Speaker 1:          33:22          Now this is something that's sort of surprising to us that when it comes to botnets that there's this whole rental market that's frighteningly affordable. Yeah, it's bargain basement. In fact, we were talking with one reporter, Kelly Jackson Higgins, who is the executive editor of dark reading.com which is a cyber security new site, and she told us you can actually rent a botnet if you really wanted to. You could rent a botnet for one hour for about $38 a month in some cases as I was 20 yes. As low as $20 a month. I can go rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month. You could. It's like renting space here or you want to use this to go do damage somewhere or you want to make a statement or you have some plan for, do you want to send some spam? Here you go. You could go online right now and probably find somewhere out there on the net, somebody who will sell you access to computers for cents a piece and these are like people's computers, like your computer, my computer and Dan says as dark code got bigger and bigger, he began to see more of this kind of activity on the site.

Speaker 1:          34:17          Like some guy would have a bot net of 5,000 computers. Another guy would have some software, like the ransomware software guy would then rent the botnet from guy one install his ransomware ransom. These poor people then move on.

Speaker 13:         34:28          You know, some of the people were, you know, doing some pretty unpleasant things, you know, moving more into the kind of financial crimes territory, you know, which is, you know, something that I really never had a desire to be involved in.

Speaker 1:          34:41          It was largely because of that. He says that in 2009, he decided to get out,

Speaker 13:         34:47          but unfortunately, the next year I got a lovely visit from the FBI. Um, they promptly, uh, was it a like kick down in your door type situation? They knocked, they knocked, so, okay. What was that like? Ah, pretty terrifying. You know, what, uh, what's going to happen to me? What's gonna Happen next and what did happen next? I don't know how much of that I can talk about, but, um, I did cooperate with the government and I have cooperated with them for the last, you know, five plus years now was a kick in the butts. You know, my parents, uh, kind of kicked me out. Not that kicked me out, but, uh, assisted me with a rapid move out and, uh, I've been living on my own since then and, uh, became gainfully employed, had a few jobs, um,

Speaker 7:          35:38          became a little bit more and more serious, uh, with my, my then girlfriend who is now my wife. So, um, you know, it's given me an opportunity over the last five years to really make some serious changes to my life. [inaudible]. Meanwhile, over the same five years, dark code grew into this massive cyber criminal swat mean where tens of thousands of stolen social security numbers were bought and sold. Huge databases of personal information and emails were bought and sold. Malware and software of various kinds are bought and sold. And this continued coin to Dina Temple and right up until July 15th of this year, July 15th, 2015

Speaker 14:         36:17          today marks a milestone in our efforts to bring to justice some of the most significant cyber criminals in the world.

Speaker 7:          36:23          What ended up happening on July 15th is that the FBI had actually gotten into Darko with a number of intelligence services from around the world, and they had an 18 month investigation in which they took down, right? In the end, 28 people.

Speaker 14:         36:37          The FBI has effectively smashed the Hornet's nest, and we are in the process of rounding up and charging the Hornets.

Speaker 7:          36:46          But here's, here's what's amazing, right? So they take down a more than two dozen people. Two weeks later,

Speaker 6:          36:53          dark code is up again, which just popped back up, just popped back up.

Speaker 7:          37:08          A deep gratitude to NPRs Dina Tempo Reston, who's reporting really got us going on this whole project. Yeah. Props to Kelsey paget do produce our first segment and emails who produced their second segment and who can from memory give you the extended family tree of dark code. It's just right out of his head, right of his head. You got original music this hour from dub mood and Bianco Bay. Yeah. Wow. Thanks. Also to Andrew Zali, Michael Shammo, Gunther Omen, Lynn leading happy rotor. Elsa Cathy too. Don't forget attorney David Vaccaro and the whole crew at the Microsoft Cyber Crimes Unit and to you, Robert, thank you to you. Hi. Way me because you're part of my botnet cause I'm Jeff from Ryan Roberto, which thanks for listening.
