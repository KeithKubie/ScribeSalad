can see from this this is actually a
 

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.850
can see from this this is actually a
pretty easy to remember URL but it's

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860
pretty easy to remember URL but it's
 

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.130
pretty easy to remember URL but it's
taken me more time to type this in then

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140
taken me more time to type this in then
 

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.110
taken me more time to type this in then
I really have patience for and if I've

I really have patience for and if I've
misspelled this and then it's kind of

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860
misspelled this and then it's kind of

there thinking well I've got an action

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:19.950
there thinking well I've got an action

there thinking well I've got an action
that I want to take show me to put on

that I want to take show me to put on
 

00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:23.389
that I want to take show me to put on
the action bar and this is a good

00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399
the action bar and this is a good
 

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:25.279
the action bar and this is a good
example of when it's okay to break the

example of when it's okay to break the
 

00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:29.419
example of when it's okay to break the
rules there are actions that you're

00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:29.429
rules there are actions that you're
 

00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:32.419
rules there are actions that you're
taking on content where the content in

taking on content where the content in
 

00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:34.639
taking on content where the content in
the screen is the most important thing

00:28:34.639 --> 00:28:34.649
the screen is the most important thing
 

00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:40.129
the screen is the most important thing
and those actions are far and away best

00:28:40.129 --> 00:28:40.139
and those actions are far and away best
 

00:28:40.139 --> 00:28:41.599
and those actions are far and away best
suited to the action bar absolutely

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:41.609
suited to the action bar absolutely
 

00:28:41.609 --> 00:28:44.570
suited to the action bar absolutely
however there are some actions that are

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580
however there are some actions that are
 

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.489
however there are some actions that are
either extremely contextual so you put

00:28:46.489 --> 00:28:46.499
either extremely contextual so you put
 

00:28:46.499 --> 00:28:48.289
either extremely contextual so you put
them next to the content directly next

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299
them next to the content directly next
 

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:53.089
them next to the content directly next
to the content or so Universal that they

00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:53.099
to the content or so Universal that they
 

00:28:53.099 --> 00:28:54.469
to the content or so Universal that they
really don't belong in the action bar

00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:54.479
really don't belong in the action bar
 

00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:57.320
really don't belong in the action bar
because there they are themselves the

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:57.330
because there they are themselves the
 

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.180
because there they are themselves the
most important thing and in this case I

00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.190
most important thing and in this case I
 

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.969
most important thing and in this case I
would argue that the transport for any

00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:01.979
would argue that the transport for any
 

00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:03.979
would argue that the transport for any
app that plays audio the transport is

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:03.989
app that plays audio the transport is
 

00:29:03.989 --> 00:29:05.719
app that plays audio the transport is
the most important thing absolutely in

00:29:05.719 --> 00:29:05.729
the most important thing absolutely in
 

00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:07.549
the most important thing absolutely in
fact it should be on every screen you

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559
fact it should be on every screen you
 

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:09.200
fact it should be on every screen you
never want to be in a position where you

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.210
never want to be in a position where you
 

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.820
never want to be in a position where you
can't access the transport because if

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:10.830
can't access the transport because if
 

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.469
can't access the transport because if
nothing else you might need to pause

00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:12.479
nothing else you might need to pause
 

00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:14.779
nothing else you might need to pause
that audio exactly and this is a good

00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:14.789
that audio exactly and this is a good
 

00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:16.399
that audio exactly and this is a good
example so again and this is the theme

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:16.409
example so again and this is the theme
 

00:29:16.409 --> 00:29:17.869
example so again and this is the theme
that I'm going to continue to come back

00:29:17.869 --> 00:29:17.879
that I'm going to continue to come back

point it does introduce the controls
 

00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:46.210
point it does introduce the controls
along the bottom which is nice they are

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:46.220
along the bottom which is nice they are
 

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.070
along the bottom which is nice they are
absolutely tiny yeah which makes me

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080
absolutely tiny yeah which makes me
 

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.629
absolutely tiny yeah which makes me
think well I was gonna say it makes me

00:29:50.629 --> 00:29:50.639
think well I was gonna say it makes me

think this was designed for a fine but

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080
think this was designed for a fine but
 

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.680
think this was designed for a fine but
we have the tab the tablet layout with

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:54.690
we have the tab the tablet layout with
 

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.049
we have the tab the tablet layout with
fragments so they're halfway there

00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059
fragments so they're halfway there
 

00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:58.609
fragments so they're halfway there
and I get the impression I think this is

00:29:58.609 --> 00:29:58.619
and I get the impression I think this is
 

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:00.320
and I get the impression I think this is
even an alpha release so it's it's early

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.330
even an alpha release so it's it's early
 

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.210
even an alpha release so it's it's early

pointed out these need to be big buttons

00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179
pointed out these need to be big buttons
 

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:07.460
pointed out these need to be big buttons
they need to be front and center this is

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:07.470
they need to be front and center this is
 

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.680
they need to be front and center this is
the key to what your app is doing

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:09.690
the key to what your app is doing
 

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.800
the key to what your app is doing

talking about the transport mechanism
 

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.980
talking about the transport mechanism
because I think this is a good point and

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:15.990
because I think this is a good point and
 

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.060
because I think this is a good point and
I want to talk a little bit more about

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:17.070
I want to talk a little bit more about

that if if we switch to the to the
camera phone or the phone camera I

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:22.560
camera phone or the phone camera I
 

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.410
camera phone or the phone camera I
should say then would you be able to

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:24.420
should say then would you be able to
 

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.550
should say then would you be able to
look at some of these apps on a phone

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:25.560
look at some of these apps on a phone
 

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.440
look at some of these apps on a phone
and I'd I'm going to do that because I

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:27.450
and I'd I'm going to do that because I
 

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.150
and I'd I'm going to do that because I
want to highlight a couple of specific

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:29.160
want to highlight a couple of specific
 

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.930
want to highlight a couple of specific
things so if I start playing an app here

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940
things so if I start playing an app here
 

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.330
things so if I start playing an app here
in dog catcher there's a few things I'm

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340
in dog catcher there's a few things I'm
 

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.560
in dog catcher there's a few things I'm
going to look for straightaway so as

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:36.570
going to look for straightaway so as
 

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.330
going to look for straightaway so as
soon as I navigate away from that app I

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340
soon as I navigate away from that app I
 

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.220
soon as I navigate away from that app I
still want to be able to control that

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:40.230
still want to be able to control that
 

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.560
still want to be able to control that
meet that audio from anywhere so the

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:42.570
meet that audio from anywhere so the
 

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.670
meet that audio from anywhere so the
first thing I'm going to check is to see

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:43.680
first thing I'm going to check is to see
 

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.950
first thing I'm going to check is to see
whether or not I can control it on the

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960
whether or not I can control it on the
 

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.110
whether or not I can control it on the
lockscreen which I can which is nice we

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120
lockscreen which I can which is nice we
 

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.170
lockscreen which I can which is nice we
even have the album art which is tidy

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:51.180
even have the album art which is tidy
 

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.320
even have the album art which is tidy
had the ability to pause play skip hello

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:54.330
had the ability to pause play skip hello
 

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.990
had the ability to pause play skip hello
again skip doesn't actually do anything

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000
again skip doesn't actually do anything
 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.960
again skip doesn't actually do anything
in this no it does it does straight it

00:30:59.960 --> 00:30:59.970
in this no it does it does straight it
 

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.280
in this no it does it does straight it
is tricky it's like I want to be able to

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:01.290
is tricky it's like I want to be able to
 

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.600
is tricky it's like I want to be able to
skip this so I'm getting bored and

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.610
skip this so I'm getting bored and
 

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.640
skip this so I'm getting bored and
listen to either the next the next

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:04.650
listen to either the next the next
 

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.000
listen to either the next the next

podcast in that particular album or skip
 

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.920
podcast in that particular album or skip
to a completely different podcast if you

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:09.930
to a completely different podcast if you
 

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.360
to a completely different podcast if you
know if that's the better option it

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.370
know if that's the better option it
 

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.000
know if that's the better option it
makes sense so let's let's unlock this I

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.010
makes sense so let's let's unlock this I
 

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.530
makes sense so let's let's unlock this I
also want to be able to do that in the

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:15.540
also want to be able to do that in the
 

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.760
also want to be able to do that in the
notifications and again this is

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:16.770
notifications and again this is
 

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.320
notifications and again this is
something that the dog catcher is done

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:18.330
something that the dog catcher is done
 

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.910
something that the dog catcher is done
well so I can actually pause directly

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:19.920
well so I can actually pause directly
 

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.610
well so I can actually pause directly
from the notification now you'll note

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620
from the notification now you'll note
 

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.140
from the notification now you'll note
that by doing so they've actually

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:24.150
that by doing so they've actually
 

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.970
that by doing so they've actually
removed the notifications straightaway

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980
removed the notifications straightaway
 

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.220
removed the notifications straightaway
right which is a little weird it is a

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:28.230
right which is a little weird it is a
 

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.020
right which is a little weird it is a
little weird now this is kind of tricky

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.030
little weird now this is kind of tricky
 

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.100
little weird now this is kind of tricky
right because the reason the

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.110
right because the reason the
 

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.390
right because the reason the
notification is there when it's playing

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:32.400
notification is there when it's playing
 

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.230
notification is there when it's playing
is because you need an ongoing

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240
is because you need an ongoing
 

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.150
is because you need an ongoing
notification if you have a service

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.160
notification if you have a service
 

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.470
notification if you have a service
running and when I've paused at that

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480
running and when I've paused at that
 

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.150
running and when I've paused at that
service isn't running so let's take it

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:38.160
service isn't running so let's take it
 

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.810
service isn't running so let's take it
away thing is give me a chance here you

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820
away thing is give me a chance here you
 

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.490
away thing is give me a chance here you
know maybe I just pause it because you

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500
know maybe I just pause it because you
 

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.660
know maybe I just pause it because you
know I want to yell at someone out the

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:44.670
know I want to yell at someone out the
 

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.950
know I want to yell at someone out the
window you cut me off

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960
window you cut me off
 

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.000
window you cut me off
and I want to be able to press play

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.010
and I want to be able to press play
 

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.100
and I want to be able to press play
again straight away and you'll note that

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.110
again straight away and you'll note that
 

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.720
again straight away and you'll note that
it's it's gone from everywhere so if I

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:50.730
it's it's gone from everywhere so if I
 

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.940
it's it's gone from everywhere so if I
go back to the lock screen again there's

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:52.950
go back to the lock screen again there's
 

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.040
go back to the lock screen again there's
no way to restart the audio until I

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.050
no way to restart the audio until I
 

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.980
no way to restart the audio until I

big red button and that's too aggressive
 

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.150
big red button and that's too aggressive
well this would be great if they use

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:05.160
well this would be great if they use
 

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.740
well this would be great if they use
jellybean rich notifications because
