LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.150
Today we're going to be
talking with Alan Huang.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.432
He's here from the
Android TV team

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:10.140
that brings Android
into your living room

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.930
and allows you as an
application developer

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.030
to reach people in
their living room.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.700
Android TV is one
of these products

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.709
that I think we all know
a little bit about it,

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:21.500
but maybe we don't know
exactly what it is,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.070
so could you tell us
exactly what is Android TV?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.570
ALLEN HUANG: What
we're really doing

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.090
with Android TV is we're
bringing Android, this OS that

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.300
is widely popular
and people are super

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590
familiar with because they're
using it on a day-to-day basis

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.510
all the time, and bring that
experience to the living room

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
and across a variety of
devices on actual smart TVs

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.671
that you're buying, you know,
60 inch televisions, as well as

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:45.420
boxes that you connect
to your television,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.910
whether that's a box that's
coming from whoever's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000
giving you your cable television
or a box you're connecting

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
to stream different content.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.080
Now, one of my favorite features
in Android is Google Now.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.160
That gives me like
personalized recommendations.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.400
And one of my problems
with TV at the moment

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.210
is that there's so many
different, either channels

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.670
on cable or different
sources of on demand video

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.190
and trying to find what I want
to watch is really difficult.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.690
Is there some kind
of recommendation

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.700
engine that thinks about
what I like to watch

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120
and maybe bubbles that
to the top in Android TV?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.440
ALLEN HUANG: One of
our big focus areas

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.914
when we were thinking about
what Android TV should be was,

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:21.580
we centered around
this concept of, when

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.070
you get home after a long day at
work, your IQ almost goes down,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.654
right?

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:28.070
You're sitting in
front of the TV.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.653
The last thing you
want to think about

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:31.400
is, OK, what am
I going to watch?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.770
And look through
a ton of listings

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.590
and try to just figure
all of that out.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.960
And so what we've done
is, the centerpiece

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.410
of the home screen on Android
TV is this recommendation show.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.360
And what we're doing
there is combining

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.530
a few pieces of information.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.070
We're taking all of the stuff
that the apps that you have,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
the TV providers that you have,
taking all of that information

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.250
and then mixing it
together to showcase, OK,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.640
what are the things that we
think you'll want to watch.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.580
The apps provide
these recommendations.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.620
And then we sort of
rank based on what apps

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.970
you've been using in the past.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.000
Cool.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.670
Now, I understand that
you were down in Las Vegas

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.960
at CES, launching some Android
TV stuff quite recently.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.140
And we all know how
crazy CES can be.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.934
But what happened?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:15.600
What did you do?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.440
What did you launch?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.480
What was going on?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.430
ALLEN HUANG: For Android TV,
the main reason we were there

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.310
was helping support our
partners as they were launching

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.900
the first really
Android TV devices that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.680
are going to be outside of
our own Nexus player device.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.280
And so, what we saw
was Sony announcing

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.840
that their entire Bravia 2K
and 4K TVs in this coming 2015

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.010
line-- they're all going
to be running Android TVs.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.120
So Sharp also announced
that their 4K televisions

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.740
would be running Android TV.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.810
And then Razer is working
on a gaming console that's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.510
running on Android
TV and features

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270
a wide variety of games.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.989
And they actually
won the best of CES

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.530
in the gaming category, as well
as the People's Choice Award.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.420
And we have these
partners developing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.507
these incredible devices
on the Android TV platform.

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:03.090
For me, it was really
exciting to see.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, that sounds cool.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.825
Now, you mentioned
the gaming console.

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.680
Is that out yet or
is that coming soon?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.120
ALLEN HUANG: Razer is
working hard in order

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.870
and we're getting to
that point where that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.000
should be coming very soon.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.820
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now my understanding

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.470
is because that runs Android
TV, it has a version of the Play

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.450
Store so then anybody
who can build a game

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.190
and put it into
the Play Store now

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.840
has a console that
they can build for.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.990
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah, the
experience for a developer

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.100
is that Play Store works much
the same way that you would

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.785
expect on a phone or a tablet.

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:29.910
You're using the same Play
Store developer console.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.300
You're creating
just Android apps,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.850
with a different interface,
with a different UI.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.874
But really it's the
same Android API.

00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:42.540
It's the same Android
development model.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.120
And it's just going to
transfer from device to device.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.703
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so if I'm
an existing Android developer,

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:50.350
building for phones and maybe
building for tablets, then if I

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.310
want to reach the
form factor of the TV,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.120
I'm pretty much
using the same APIs?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.328
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah absolutely.

00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:57.710
I mean, Android TV
is on Lollipop, just

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.360
like every other device.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.500
And all of the
APIs that you know

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.959
and love that you're
using already,

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.374
they're just going
to work, right?

00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:07.490
Like one of the big
differences with Android TV,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.270
compared with the
other efforts, is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.640
that we're on the same cycle
as phone, as tablet, as ware,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.499
as auto, and I think we talk
about how if the Android TV

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.670
team doesn't finish the
work that we need to finish,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.820
we're going to delay everything.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.200
All of Android is--

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: No pressure.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.090
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah,
no, no pressure.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.180
We're a core part there.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.746
And so with that comes
just tons of benefits.

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.370
It makes a lot of
sense for developers.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.578
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:37.460
So now there must
be some differences

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.410
though when building for
the Leanback form factor,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.940
the TV as opposed to the small
device that's in your hand.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.021
Like what kind of challenges
do you see developers facing

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:49.520
and what have you
done to help them?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.478
ALLEN HUANG: One you
don't have a touch screen.

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:54.230
Maybe one day, our partners are
going to build a touch screen

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.280
TV and that'll be really cool.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.590
But for the most
part, these TVs are

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.890
things that are you're
interacting with a D-pad.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.027
So left, right, up,
down, center click.

00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:04.610
You'll have the back
and home that you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.170
have on every Android device.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.160
And that's the basic interaction
model, and it's very simple.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.969
It matches that sort
of whole mentality of,

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.260
I'm in front of my living room.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.676
I'm not really
thinking that hard.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:18.880
I don't want a computing device,
I want an entertainment device.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.980
The other thing beyond
sort of the interaction

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.680
is that you are sitting 10
feet away from this screen.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.290
And you know the
font sizes need to be

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.860
the size that they need to be.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.841
All the images that are on
screen need to be bigger,

00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:35.090
and you need to think about
them being more cinematic.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.940
And people have a
certain expectation of,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.490
on television things being
sort of moving, and cinematic,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.030
and it being that sort
of engaging experience.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.300
And so, that's all
things that we're

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.802
thinking very carefully about
as we're developing Android TV.

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:52.510
As far as what we've
done for developers,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.426
we've tried to make this
really easy for them.

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:57.230
And so we have this model
of having support libraries

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.860
that we've published
and made available

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.840
along with the Android SDK to
make it really easy for people

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.540
to just have that sort of
UI and interaction model.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.175
So these support libraries
provide almost sort

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:10.670
of templates that people could
plug in their information,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.840
take their Android tablet
app, and plug that in and have

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.110
this rich, engaging, immersive
UI, and have it displayed,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.070
and have all the transitions
and animations that I

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.390
was talking about.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.200
From there, a developer can
take that and run with it

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.260
and publish it to Play
Store almost immediately.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.680
Or they can do lots of
things like customize it,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.780
sort of make it their
brand, take those and then

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.237
just build upon that.

00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:39.570
And then we also have developers
that will start totally

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.111
from scratch.

00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:42.820
They're like, oh hey, yeah,
this support library is great,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.430
but I'd rather just
create a whole experience.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.270
And they're just
developing an Android app.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
kind of mind blowing

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
when you think about it.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.300
That when, in the past if you're
building for a TV set-top box

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.895
or for a console, it was an
entirely different world.

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:58.020
What you're bringing now
is the same world into it.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.978
And yes, there are some
differences, of course,

00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:02.684
but you're trying to mitigate
the difficulties that might

00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:03.850
come from those differences.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.390
Cool.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.120
What about like any
kind of scenarios

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.752
for interesting types of apps?

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.960
ALLEN HUANG: I'm really
excited about what's to come,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.410
what developers are going to do.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.780
For phones and tablets, people
who built the operating system

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.270
never imagined, sort of the
possibilities of what people

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.540
would go and create
and have become just

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.970
absurdly popular-- ways for you
to get picked up from anywhere

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.940
and be able to take
you to any other place.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.220
Other really amazing
stuff that I've seen

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.060
is, so Dish just
announced their Sling app

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.490
that you can have physical this
subscription experience where

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.760
you're getting a core
set of channels, getting,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.100
for me, like the ESPN,
all of that is amazing.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.090
I've seen really fun apps.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.810
E24 is a good example,
where they've made it

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.180
so that you can actually
order food from your TV screen

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.797
and order it and have it
delivered to your home.

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:56.880
It sort of runs the gamut.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.963
Our team's goal is to
provide the tools for people

00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:01.930
to build whatever they
can imagine and then see

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.100
where it goes from there.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm
waiting for the 3D

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.690
printer that can print a pizza.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.407
And order that through my TV.

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:08.990
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah,
immediate delivery.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
would be crazy So thinking

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.030
of like developers, and we're
saying that like the experience

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.160
is very familiar.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.870
As an Android developer, do you
have any words like for anybody

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.940
who wants to get started today?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.856
Maybe they're not an
Android developer already

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:24.030
or maybe they've been
building for phones.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.690
What advice would you give to
folks who want to get started?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.530
ALLEN HUANG: Absolutely take
a look at our support library.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.870
The feedback we get from a lot
of developers is like, oh man,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.703
that was a lot easier
I thought it would be.

00:08:32.703 --> 00:08:34.289
And just to get
started that way,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.780
messing around
and experimenting,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.055
and trying a few things
out, especially when

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:40.319
we've provided some
of the basic templates

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.110
so that you don't have
to worry about that.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.650
I think it goes a long way.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.490
Being quite honest,
there are lots

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.560
of apps that aren't very
good, but at the very least,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.810
you're developing out the
skills, the experience,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.562
and then it's like sort of an
iterative process, I think.

00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:56.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
are really only at day zero.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.200
Right?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.090
There's great stuff
still to come.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.221
And try, if you're going
to fail, try again.

00:09:03.221 --> 00:09:05.220
If you're going to fail,
try again and just keep

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.920
getting better incrementally.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.904
I mean for developers.

00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:11.070
So actually one question
that I had, I was thinking,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.340
because I've played a
little bit with development,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.010
but I have like the hardware.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.840
I mean, is there like an
emulator or something like that

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.930
so if people don't
have the hardware,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.360
that they can see what things
would look like on a TV?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.250
ALLEN HUANG: So as
part of Android Studio,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.800
and all those tools, we have the
emulator available for Android

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.950
TV, alongside all about
emulators that you have,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.340
so you can see that experience.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.620
We had the ADT-1 give
away and hopefully

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.890
many of the early developers
got their hands on one

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.306
and were able to
start development

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:38.390
using this device that we
internally know and love

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.056
because we used it
for quite awhile just

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:41.190
to get people started.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So we've had a lot

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.750
of success in the living
room with Chromecast,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.100
which is a fabulous product.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.399
But how does that fit
in with Android TV,

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.190
in particular from a
developer perspective?

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.190
What should developers
be thinking about?

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.672
ALLEN HUANG: Cast has been
incredibly successful in sort

00:09:53.672 --> 00:09:55.880
of introducing this new
model for how people interact

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.838
with their living room.

00:09:56.838 --> 00:09:59.295
Tying back to what I said
about the living room being

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:01.160
this really simple space,
where people aren't looking

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.576
for computing devices, being
able to take something and so

00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:05.130
easily throw it
onto your screen,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.810
it's just very
intuitive for people.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's magical.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.720
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.219
It is.

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:10.030
I mean, I've heard
people say that.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.890
It's like, oh, my god,
how did that happen?

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.730
And it's something
we want to continue.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.070
I think that
interaction model, we

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.250
baked Google Cast as a
core part of Android TV.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.910
So everything that works
with the Chromecast,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.400
you're able to take that and
then cast, pick up your phone

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.360
and then cast it to
any Android TV device.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.017
Then from a developer
perspective,

00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:31.600
you have these two
models where you're

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.750
developing this
cast-integrated experience,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.822
as well as this Android
TV app, and developers

00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.780
are going to ask, well,
that seems like there's

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.960
a lot of stuff going on.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.650
One of the key
things is that you

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.010
want to be able to interact
with your service, your app,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.590
in a variety of different ways.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.760
You have this first
screen app, this

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.170
on phones, and for
similar reasons why

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.414
you want to have a
tablet experience too,

00:10:54.414 --> 00:10:56.330
that's why you'd want
to have a TV experience.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.054
So if you're just
streaming content,

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:00.220
casting make a lot of sense.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.210
And having that experience
gets you the ability

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.560
to get your content on all the
Chromecast devices, as well

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.090
as all the Android TV devices.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.500
But then beyond
that, if you want

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.360
to have suggestions on
screen or recommendations

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.860
or integration into search,
or just even like auto

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.930
playing to the
next video or being

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.280
able to show multiple
videocasts at once,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.700
I think that's where you have
this Android TV native app

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.200
experience.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.074
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:11:26.074 --> 00:11:27.640
But as a developer,
if I've invested

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.450
in the skills and building
for cast, they're not wasted.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:30.600
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: I can continue
building for Android TV.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.130
I could just extend
my skills set.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.560
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.750
Yeah.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.340
Totally.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.110
ALLEN HUANG: I'm so
excited to see what

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.560
they're going to come up with.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.250
And you know, personally,
I joined this team

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.660
about a year ago and the living
room is an exciting space.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.400
I think it's right
before-- I mean,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.990
we are already
seeing lots and lots

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.890
of changes in this
environment and ecosystem.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.950
More and more people are
just streaming content.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.210
And--

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cord-cutting
is becoming commonplace, right?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.300
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.925
And there's a meme
that people are just

00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:03.710
moving all their time to tablets
and to phones and to computers.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.120
At least for me, I still
watch like multiple hours

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.280
of television every day.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.880
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Absolutely, me too.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.050
ALLEN HUANG: For me, this is
almost embarrassing to say,

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.230
I fall asleep to the
television quite often.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.860
I think there's room for
so much progress in how

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.130
we watch television.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.300
But just keeping in
mind like, hey, this

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.930
is about making it
simple and easy.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.922
And for me, that's a
really fun challenge.

00:12:24.922 --> 00:12:26.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool, cool.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.050
Well, thanks, Allen.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.460
And this has been a really
fun chat that we've had.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.270
And everybody,
thanks for watching

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.890
this episode of "Coffee with
a Googler" with Allen Huang.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.692
We spoke about Android TV.

00:12:36.692 --> 00:12:38.150
We learned about
all the great ways

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.410
we can get started with
developing for Android TV,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.440
using our existing
Android skills.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.360
We have some links after
the end of the video

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.820
and they'll be in the
description below.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.820
And again, thank you so
much, Allen, for coming.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.120
ALLEN HUANG: Yeah,
cool Thank you.
