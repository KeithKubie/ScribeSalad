00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.173
- Upbeat Music

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.720
- [Narrator] We as a teaching staff,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.230
we're going to learn best
when we learn from each other.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.940
- It was there, they just
don't trust themselves

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.830
- [Narrator] Because we participate

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.820
in small groups called flocks,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.110
we have this profound sense that

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.477
we're not alone in this work.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:23.644
- Upbeat music

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.870
- At Pearlcone, we have
a really clear structure,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.500
because when you're
consistent room to room,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.270
hallway to hallway, academy to academy,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.330
kids know what to expect,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.220
and so they feel safe
within that structure,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.570
and are quicker to learn.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.210
- I feel like we've built a culture of

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.750
you know what the expectation is.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.080
- [Jessica] The flock was developed

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.920
by a group of teachers
born out of the idea

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.010
that we want consistency across the board,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.040
also the level and rigor of instruction.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.210
- Part of the goal is teamwork

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.920
and making sure that
everyone participates, right?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.320
- [Narrator] We are really
clear about our expectations,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.140
so we have five core values.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.550
They are in every hallway
and in every classroom.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.580
So they see it all the time,
and they hear it all the time.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.600
We also have non-negotiables
that are really specific.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.200
We always look for; are we
promoting the core values

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.610
within our classrooms and

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.310
are we holding kid to
behavioral expectations

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.040
called the non-negotiables.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.840
So the flock was born out of trying to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.080
gain a consistency classroom to classroom

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.380
with those expectations for kids.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.260
- Alright you guys know
what's expected of you today,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.641
correct?

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.474
- Yes.

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:42.210
- We took a model of
looking at peer feedback

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.100
and how we could really support each other

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.340
for the sake of our
kids we have teachers of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.410
various disciplines and
various years of experience.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.300
We're looking at classroom
behavior, classroom culture.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.690
Looking at those core values
we can kind of check off

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.430
what's being adhered to, or broken.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.300
The rubric is both
qualitative and quantitative.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.390
So you're able to write
notes on what you see and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.330
writing that evidence down

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.230
to have more meaningful conversations.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.030
And then we talk about what we've seen.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.200
When we look at the core values,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.160
a lot of what we saw was
evidence of others first.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.850
Just how they responded to each other

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.660
was a sure example of that.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.870
So having that conversation
is really helpful,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.880
because we get a lot of feed back.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.650
- You watched hands go like this.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.940
- But as they were talking to each other

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.770
you see some of the
hands kind of slide down.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.640
- They feel like there
should be a right or a wrong,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.620
but you're trying to get them
to see their own identity,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.020
and I think that that's
where you're pushing them.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.160
- When I get feedback
from my colleagues, like,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.198
"hey immediately you
had three or four table

00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:37.500
groups that raises their hand,"

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.022
I now am more aware
going into another class

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:42.037
am I answering that question,

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.310
or am I posing another question

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.000
that allows the student to dig deeper.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.170
You guys are working,
you've got 15 to 20 minutes.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.517
- We've seen just huge
reductions in off task behaviors

00:02:54.517 --> 00:02:55.970
- What about rays?

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.630
- [Jessica] I think one
of the biggest benefits

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.649
to the consistency is
there's a common language,

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.726
when a kid hears me say,

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:05.930
"good job, you really showed grit there

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.260
and persevered through it."

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.700
And they go to another classroom

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.107
and they hear the same
thing, there's no confusion.

00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:17.107
We are able to instill in
them a changed perspective.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.010
It allows us to access the resources

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.670
that are already in them, going,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.670
"hey you have this great
capacity to learn, and grow."

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.860
- I'm not going to say
it defines who I am,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.960
but to the world, yes.
