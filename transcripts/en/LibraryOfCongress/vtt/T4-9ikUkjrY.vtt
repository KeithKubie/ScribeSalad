00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.430
My name is David Plyler.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm a music specialist at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.120
And it is my pleasure to speak
with you this evening primarily

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.800
about Schumann, and
in particular,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.310
a work that we don't
get to hear too often.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.100
I know it will be a wonderful
treat for me to be able

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.920
to hear this tonight by a
pianist like Richard Goode.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.300
So I know you're
all in for a treat,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.920
not only with the solo piano
work, the "the "but also the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
"Second Piano Trio" of Schumann

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.100
and the "Second Piano
Quartet" of Brahms.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.820
But we will focus mostly
on the solo piano piece

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.800
and some interesting ways in
which it interfaces with Brahms

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.780
in particular, not necessarily
the piece that we're going

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.870
to hear tonight, but the young
Brahms who came to know Schumann

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.300
through his early piano music.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.330
One thing to note about Schumann
is that he tended to work

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.600
in spurts on particular
types of genres.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.330
So the 1830s were
primarily focused

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.350
on the writing for solo piano.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.490
In fact, the first 23 published
opuses are solo piano music.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.090
And then we shift
into lieder, art song.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.890
In fact, in 1840, he writes
over half of his lieder output,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.180
so 140-ish songs in one
year, 13 months or so.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.210
And then he moves onto chamber
music and whatnot in 1842,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.410
especially in 1847, and tries
his on other larger works

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.380
like symphonic works and
opera and things like that.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.100
Some of those things
went well for him.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.960
Some did not.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.050
Firstly, I just want
to check and see.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.020
How many of you know
the "Humoreske?"

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.010
And I'm just going to
call it "Humoresque" just

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.140
to Anglophy [phonetic] it here.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.640
So several people but
maybe not a lot of people

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.400
in the audience are really
familiar with this work.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.370
And I think that's a shame
because it's a real gem.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.590
And I think there are
certain reasons why it is not

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.730
as well-known as one
would like it to be.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.870
And I'll talk about a few of
those in the course this talk.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.860
But first, I wanted to read
to you just a little bit

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.730
of what kind of criticism
was being written

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.840
about Schumann's work at the
time, while he was alive.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.370
And this comes from 1844,
I believe in a translation

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.190
by Susan Gillespie of
Karl Kasmalle [phonetic].

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.300
And he has, I think, a
very modern way of looking

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.930
at criticism and
what it should be.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.950
Karl writes, "One of
the most difficult tests

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.390
of the aesthetic
philosopher will always be

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.070
to express musical effects
in words, to use paraphrase

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.420
to explain and give
recognizable form

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.120
to what is indescribable
and immaterial.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.460
Whatever most intelligent, fine,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.660
and well considered thoughts
he may offer in this case,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.410
they will always appear
imperfect, inadequate, cold,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.580
and forced compared
with their subjects.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.940
But this will not deter us
from at least making attempts

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.820
to sketch the impression that
the "Humoreske" made on us.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.200
Even if the results should
be nothing but a half measure

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.960
and an imprecise one at
that, if the sketch turns

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.870
out to be a purely subjective
product of individual emotion

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.110
if we ourselves depart
in our interpretation

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.120
from the actual intentions
of the composer,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.880
we will find solace in the
general lot of commentators

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.220
who are often clever when it
comes to discovering a number

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.370
of things that the artist, in
the rush of emotions and fired

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.960
with enthusiasm,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.720
has unconsciously
incorporated into his work.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.480
But on the other hand, may also
fail to notice other things

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.180
that the artist inserted
into the work

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.090
with full awareness
and clear intent.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.730
In addition, it is
quite conceivable

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.240
that there could be several
different interpretations

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.160
of the same work, each one
eminently sensible, appropriate,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.460
intelligent, and capable as it
were, of opening some new door

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.710
to understanding and
providing the key

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.600
to hitherto hidden
secrets of the spirit."

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.920
So I read a rather
long quote from that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.790
because oftentimes criticism,
especially music criticism,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.920
tends to look at very specific
things that people value

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.740
as here's something
that somebody did well.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.820
This is an example of great
counterpoint or something

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.890
like that, or worse, here's an
example of bad counterpoint,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.080
here's a case where
Schumann failed in this.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.270
Like this is a kind of a
common trope with discussions

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.800
of Schumann's orchestration,
in particular.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.370
It would be interesting to
have had that conversation

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.930
with Schumann at the
time he was writing

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.100
and see just how far
our conceptions might be

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.930
from what he was
actually going for.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.490
But back to the "Humoreske."

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.810
This work is a very long one.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.670
It's some 25 to 30 minutes
depending on who's playing it.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.220
It's ostensibly in a
single movement but has well

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:07.660
over 20 different tempo
markings and changes in tempo,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.790
and that's not counting the
types of gradual changes

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.650
that you get with accelerandi

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.000
and retards and things
like that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.180
So how does he manage all that
time that passes in one swoop?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.770
Other composers down the
road later than those --

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.170
15 years later, 13 years
later, for instance Liszt,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.930
would write a single
movement piano sonata

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.860
that is clearly divided
into subsections, say,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.190
three major ones, although
that's debatable too.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:57.230
In the case of "The Humoreske,"

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.590
we have so many different
divisions that it runs the risk

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.770
of being just a hodge-podge
of ideas that are just kind

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.610
of presented willy-nilly.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:15.560
So how is it that
Schumann manages this?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.770
One of the things that he
does is uses what I'm calling

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.860
musical landmarks.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.810
You might think this is similar
to what you might find in, say,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.190
a rondo structure in which
you have a single idea

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.350
that comes back time and again
and it serves as kind of a way

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.540
to re-orient to familiar
territory.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.940
We don't have exactly
that happening

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.560
but what we have
are blocks of time

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.010
in which Schumann will book-end
a section with a familiar idea.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.750
So, for instance, the
very opening serves

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.230
as sort of an introduction.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.950
And roughly five or
six minutes later,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.880
we have that same material
is kind of referenced again

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.930
in a look back before moving on.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.430
That looking back is something
that's going to be important

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.910
in a little bit when I speak

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:20.260
about Brahms' relationship this
piece in particular in speaking

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.860
of his third Piano Sonata in
F Minor, the Opus 5 piece,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.070
that has five movements,
including one

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.210
that is literally
a backward glance.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.640
The fourth movement
is a backwards glance

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.940
at earlier material.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.730
Another way that
Schumann manages

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:46.520
to hold things together is by
making kind of simple ideas

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.170
that don't have to be presented

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.810
in the same form every
time that you hear them.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:57.280
So for instance, on the
left you'll see a baseline

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.910
that has a particular
rhythm that pops

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.940
out when you listen to it.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.210
You'll hear it all
over the place.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.540
In fact, it pervades this entire
large section of the piece.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.550
Then we have some
40 measures later.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.440
We have a triad.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.730
In the left hand,
you'll see this.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.040
It's doing the same rhythm

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.100
but it's no longer
melodically important in terms

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.830
of the relationship
that matters.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.580
It's the rhythmic one.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.030
Schumann gets to that point by
first isolating a single note

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.550
and repeating it, and then
doing a third and repeating that

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.170
and then finally doing a
triad and repeating that.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.660
And these types of little
things that are catchy

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.350
and familiar help to link
different sections that may

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.560
or may not have other types
of musical material in common.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.880
Just to start getting into the
relationship between Brahms

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.470
and Schumann in this particular
piece, I wanted to point

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:10.850
out what I see as a clear
relationship between the type

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.130
of the gesture that
Schumann would do.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.670
Again, this is in 1839, versus
what Brahms would do in, say,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.170
1853 when he is still young
and trying to impress Schumann.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.170
A good way to do that is
to write like your mentor.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:35.800
Just to illustrate this example,
let's hear track 2 starting

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.180
at 426, and this
should be the example

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.510
that you see on the left.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:11:07.120
[ Music ]

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.480
The thing I want you
to notice there is

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.480
that you have two
iterations of this idea.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.740
You hear them into
different registers.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.300
You hear what are
marked as triplets.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.600
You hear that and kind

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.900
of the middle register
on the right-hand.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.100
And then you hear them an
octave lower in the left-hand.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.900
Jumping up about 14 years to
Brahms' First Piano Sonata,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.510
let's listen to track 13, 121.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:51.330
[ Music ]

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.930
So the types of things
that you'll see here,

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.800
it's more exaggerated
in the case of Brahms.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.720
He thinks, even though
there are many similarities

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.880
between the way that
Brahms and Schumann write,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.560
they actually have very distinct
personalities at the keyboard.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.450
And in this case, Brahms
is taking greater use

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.610
of registerable [phonetic]
differentiation.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.710
But you'll see these types
of pairs of ideas coming back

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.790
at kind of conditional
transitional moments.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.510
And I think what's
interesting about it is

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.920
that it shows how both composers
are thinking about the piano

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.110
in an orchestral
way and I don't mean

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.990
like they're assigning the
viola to this one or that,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.090
but they're actually
orchestrating for the piano,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.300
recognizing the timbre
[phonetic] advantages

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.440
and disadvantages
of different ways

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.740
of setting the musical material.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.190
All the best piano
composers today

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.450
and all the way back
were very aware

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.500
of what the possibilities
were, especially register wise.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:07.930
What other kind of
point of junction

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.680
between the young Brahms
and the older Schumann comes

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.460
in the way of familiar textures.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.160
And what becomes
striking to me is

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.220
that Schumann is essentially
a really progressive composer

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.200
who's writing stuff that,
even now, I am fascinated

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.030
by the complexity and the
depth of what he is doing.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:37.390
Brahms, on the other hand, I'm
also fascinated by everything

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.780
that he does, but he
tends to not to put it all

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.320
out on a limb like
Schumann does.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.890
But you do find in early
Brahms that he takes some

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.220
of what Schumann is doing
and tries to manipulate it

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.580
in his own way in his own music.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:00.880
In particular, I thinking of --
just to give you an example --

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:07.600
we'll look at the opening of
the "Humoreske," the movement

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.950
in "Der Nacht" from
[Inaudible] the Opus 12,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.670
which is a little bit
earlier in the late 1830s.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:20.400
And then the Fourth Ballade
of Brahms is Opus 10.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.510
So first let's take a listen
to just the opening of track 1.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:57.940
[ Music ]

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.990
This kind of material, there we
hear it in a very slow fashion,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.850
but basically featuring
broken arpeggios,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:13.000
that kind of give us a sense
of the harmonic rhythm,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.530
is something that we
find throughout the

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.900
"Humoreske," all throughout it.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.400
So that's something
to be aware of.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.870
Let's go back to
the "In Der Nacht."

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.110
This is in the central section.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.180
This is track 14.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:16:00.590
[ Music ]

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.240
What do you start to notice in
these types of accompaniments is

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.690
that the accompaniment itself
has a certain crunch to it

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.490
in terms of harmonically it
has some distance in there,

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.590
and it competes with
the melodic statements.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.530
Skip ahead to Brahms.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.830
This is going to be the Fourth.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.130
He wrote a set of four Ballades.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.070
And in some ways, they're
among his more experimental

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.370
early works.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.250
And this was his Opus 10, so
let's listen to the opening

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.510
and then the section
at track 15.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:17:09.170
[ Music ]

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.300
So would you go home and sing
that tune to somebody, you know,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.730
after hearing it once?

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:41.700
Probably not.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.350
And this is one of the things

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:50.240
that makes these
particular types of kind

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:57.860
of coloristic settings really
interesting in the young Brahms

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.990
and the more mature Schumann
at the time, because they start

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.100
to explore harmony and just
kind of atmosphere in a way

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.800
that wouldn't really be
done again until later

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.810
in the 19th century, and of
course in the 20th century.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.050
It's not at the expense
of melodic material.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:25.230
It's just that it seems to be
subsumed, often with the conceit

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.920
of some contrapuntal types
of activity going on,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.760
especially [inaudible]
canonic activity

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.830
or just imitative
gestures in general.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.360
So that's what I mean by
familiar textures in terms

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:48.000
of this period of 1839
Schumann and early 1850s Brahms.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:56.110
Now we get to a very interesting
subject for tonight that has

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.920
to do with several of the
pieces on the program.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.970
We often talk about quotation
and music and we seem

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.670
to know what we're
talking about.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.510
But there's speculation as
to whether or not things

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.930
that we identify as quotations
would've been perceived

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.800
as such back in the time.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.750
One of the more famous ones
that a really great speaker

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.520
that we had, a scholar -- she
won a Mendelssohn scholar.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.250
Larry Todd has written about
is the allusion to [Inaudible]

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.650
in the Schumann fantasy.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:36.340
That's a critical reception
that did not have any legs to it

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.860
until the 20th century.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.060
So it's one of those
things that we accept

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.100
and we see this being there
but it may or may not have been

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.460
in terms of what that means.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.260
So it might be something that's
more meaningful for the receiver

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.390
than it is necessary
for the composer.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.550
But let's take a look at some
examples of obvious quotes.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:09.330
So Schumann's Opus 2 is
his first big collection

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.650
of concerti pieces
that go together.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.400
Each one is very
short little piece

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.100
and has a very specific
character is a character

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.070
piece intimates.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.690
He continues to write in this
small character piece form

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.990
for a long time.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.220
I mean, he puts in a smattering
of sonatas here and there,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.930
but he's mostly writing
these small character pieces.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.230
By the time he gets

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.060
to "Carnaval" his Opus
9, he's quoting himself.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.160
And what's funny about this is

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.830
that he literally
is writing it -

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.210
this is the Florestan
movement from "Carnaval."

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.040
There's a passage that feels
exactly like the "Papillion"

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.010
that you see on the left,
but he just keeps going.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.010
And he thinks better of it
and it's like "Papillion"

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.710
and he actually writes in there

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.600
"Papillion" with
a question mark.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.290
And that's the end of the score,
so it's a very obvious quote,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.290
but it makes you think is he
just thinking of this on the fly

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.360
as he's writing this music?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.660
And it's very interesting.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.580
I think, just so you
can get a kind of sense

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.070
of this fleeting
reminiscence of something

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.180
that has a very specific
meaning,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.850
let's just hear what we're going

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:45.360
to be listening for,
which is number 8.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.510
Just the opening.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:22:08.140
[ Music ]

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.510
Just play number
9 then let it go.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:43.040
[ Music ]

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.550
So you literally have a change
in, it's not just a quote

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.410
within the context, is a
literal change of tempo,

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.510
change of everything, just to
make this reference very clear.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.090
So that's one that a given,
because Schumann writes it --

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.160
we know that one for that one.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:06.590
For the next one, this is one
that's a generally accepted one

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.380
as a quote in the Piano Trio

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.680
that you're going
to hear tonight.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.950
In the first movement,
kind of once you get

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.050
to the second major area, you
hear something that sounds

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:23.450
like the intermezzo
from "Liederkreis,"

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:29.160
from Schumann's song cycle
"Liederkreis" Opus 39.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.810
I neglected to bring an example
of this song unfortunately,

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:41.580
but you can hear the
combination of this

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.400
if we go to track 16, 145.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.950
You'll at least hear the melody

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.380
as you would hear
it in the song.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.510
It's pretty close, at least
the first seven notes.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:24:08.040
[ Music ]

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.660
And then we had the
imitation going on.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.660
This is a [inaudible]
active piece, Schumann's.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.400
But one of the points that I
want to bring up is that, okay,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.740
if we accept that this is
a quotation, if we accept

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:28.670
that he wants us to think,
oh, I know his song cycle

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:34.420
from X number of years ago,
from 1840, seven years past.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.920
I'm so familiar with Schumann's
work will make this connection

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.800
and I'll know what the words
are that are being spoken of

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.200
and then it will have a
different sort of meaning to me.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.930
That's one way to look at it.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.100
The other question is how much
of the referent do you take?

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.900
I've bracketed the sections

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.760
that are not included
in the quoted part.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.040
So you see, it's a little
bit of a fluffy translation.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.900
But the "I hold in
my depths of heart,"

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.750
that component is bracketed

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.750
because it's not
actually quoted.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.830
But you don't need to
put an entire symphony

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.960
to reference a symphony, right?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.680
But the question is then, does
it extend to the song itself?

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.280
Does it extend just
to the phrase?

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.030
Does it extend to the cycle?

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.930
Where does it stop and what is
actually meaningful about it?

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.930
I don't know the answer to that,
but that's the kind of question

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.450
that I like to ask whenever
there's a quotation,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.360
especially one that feels --

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.390
sometimes we feel ones
that might be frivolous

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.390
or somebody is just
airing something and trying

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.440
to make us hear it that way.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.560
But it is pretty darn close.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.040
It could very well be
an intentional one.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.820
You know, composers have,
especially in tonal music,

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:59.640
have a reservoir of material
that they're working with and,

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.480
you know, if you're going to
write a scale, there's only

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.190
so many ways to do it before
you're going to be starting

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.250
to refer to that other scale
that you wrote, you know.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:14.170
So there are things like that to
think about and you have to see

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.970
where they are in a
piece, the importance given

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.590
to the context, and
things like that.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:30.310
I'm going to give you an
example of a speculative quote.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.440
Schumann wrote the "Humoreske"
while he was in Vienna

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.980
and he had two other pieces
and had two other pieces

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.760
that he wrote around
the same time,

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.040
on one of which is
the "Arabesque."

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.680
And there's this moment towards
the end of the "Humoreske"

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.930
where he starts to move
into a different material

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.090
that we haven't heard before.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.390
And let's listen to that.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.510
This is track 6, 35.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:12.060
[ Music ]

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.610
And then, listen to the
opening of the "Arabesque,"

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.020
which is written
about the same time.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.820
Track 10.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:33.220
[ Music ]

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.720
So if you were to compare those
- I didn't engrave these ones

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.390
for you, but if you were to
compare them side by side,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.700
would see certain
traits that they share,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.120
especially the little
grace notes

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.010
and the ornaments
and things like that.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.960
But they don't look
exactly the same.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.590
It's rather the affect
that they create,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.390
it seems to be part
of the same world.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.370
And I think it's most likely
that it's just something that's

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.150
in Schumann's ear at the time

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.840
and that's the kind
of stuff he's ready.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.040
I don't know that it's
a direct, we're supposed

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.810
to think arabesque and then have
that mean something different.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.710
But it does conjure
up that other world,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.620
which might insight us
to go and actually listen

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.620
to that other piece, which is
-- if we happen to know it,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.920
that's another problem.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.470
If you know these
pieces, if you're going

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.190
to get the references.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:29.340
Then we get to a very special
moment in the "Humoreske"

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.950
that most people aren't aware
of unless you look at the music.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.820
And this is where
Schumann actually puts

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.650
in hidden messages.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.970
A lot of people know the
stories about "Carnaval"

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.060
with the sphinxes, where they
are written out spellings

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.310
of initials, of names,
and things like that.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.110
That's one type of thing,
but what Schumann does in the

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.970
"Humoreske" is he actually
writes out a melody

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.060
that you're not supposed
to hear,

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.360
or rather that you're supposed

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.240
to be imagining as
an inner voice.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:09.300
What we see -- this is
second [inaudible] hastily,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.920
the part that says
[Foreign Language]

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.210
that basically means
inner voice.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.730
You can't play it and it keeps
going for I think 24 measures

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.720
or something like that.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.020
So your right hand
plays the top part

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.300
and your left hand
plays the bottom staff,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.390
and there's some sort of
psychological process going

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.940
on in which you're
imagining that middle line.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.780
Sometimes you have certain
things as you come through

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.380
and you do hear some
things actually

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.130
because they are articulated.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.560
You also might be tricking
ourselves into hearing it.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.610
But this is what is often
called music for the eye.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.000
So let's just hear
what this sounds like,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.510
just the opening of track 2.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:20.170
[ Music ]

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.820
Very beautiful music, and
doesn't need the inner melody

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.620
in terms of meeting
another voice.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.720
But one could imagine singing
it or having it in your ear

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.960
and you are articulating
it in certain ways.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.510
If you look at the left-hand,
you will see that that D,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.910
for instance, is
playing on the off beats.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.770
So you do here that
D in some context.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:45.030
But not with the particular
markings that Schumann puts in.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.260
He actually has crescendi and
things like that with this voice

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.980
that you're not supposed
to hear.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.830
He has accents on a
couple of the notes.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:59.560
So this is a very strange
concept and kind of comes

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.480
to this idea of why do we
call this a humoresque.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.280
Why would he call it this?

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.050
Is it because he thought it
was very humorous and whatnot?

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:18.680
It has a lot of depth, this
piece, and a lot of angst in it.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.660
But it does have
moments of humor.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.720
And I think that that humor
is a type of musical irony

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.440
in that it sets up certain
types of expectations

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.650
and then flips them
on their head

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.000
so that we have juxtaposed
things

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.860
that we wouldn't
normally put together.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.440
And then he plays these
sort of poetic tricks.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.430
He was also a very
talented writer.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.550
And so he has these
sorts of equivalence

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.610
in a musical sense
that he puts here.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.450
And this would be the same as
like when you're reading a poem

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.900
and it's in the shape
of something.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.470
If you are being read this poem
and it's in the shape of a heart

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.190
or something, you're not going
to know that it's in the shape

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.870
of a heart unless you're looking
at it as you're reading it.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.010
And that's the kind
of analogous thing

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.310
that Schumann was doing here.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:15.610
Then he flips it and I don't
know how many people comment

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.340
on this, but what's interesting
is there's this really beautiful

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.400
moment of repose that comes
a bit later in this section

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.840
where what you see
doesn't tell you much,

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.010
but what you hear is
related to the baseline

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.970
of what we just heard.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:42.510
So let's give this a
listen, 246 of track 2.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:33:04.090
[ Music ]

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.910
And let's just hear the
beginning of tract 2 again,

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.210
just to you can hear again.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.010
Just listen to the base.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:19.190
[ Music ]

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.510
So what's kind of popping
out is something that's going

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.190
to be cleared to somebody

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.990
if they follow the
peddling directions,

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.870
which is not always going to
be the case with pianists,

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.570
and if they're really thinking
about how this is related

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.710
to other parts of the piece.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.540
So it really requires a very
thoughtful pianist to be able

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.410
to pull this kind of a
work off because you have

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.150
to have the visual
things happening

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.650
and also the aural
things happening.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.320
That sounds like a
pretty empty statement

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.080
because pianists all should be
doing that all the time, right?

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.690
At the same time there's the
care with which he does this

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.280
that I think is quite
fascinating.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:06.910
So in what way does Brahms
interact with this sort of play

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.490
on what we're supposed to hear

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:10.560
and what we think
we're supposed to hear?

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.370
Well, I found one in particular,
and this is related again

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:17.090
to the Third Piano Sonata and in
particular the first movement,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:23.480
that I want credit for if
anybody wants to run with this.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.540
Basically one of the things
that happens when you talk

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.490
about musical information
theory, you have sets

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.970
of expectations that you put
forward and then you either live

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.530
up to them or you don't.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.490
And the less that
you live up to them,

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:39.820
for more information
you're providing.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.810
It's too scattered, you're
not going to be able to kind

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.520
of partake of whatever
is being conveyed to you.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.630
But if it's different enough to
where it becomes interesting,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:56.650
that's when we have perhaps good
music and a cultural context

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.060
that has certain patterns
that it recognizes.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.650
That's all to say that
if you play a tune

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:07.460
and if you keep it going and
it goes the same way for most

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.240
of the piece, the times that
you deviate become important.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.510
So let's just hear the
opening of tract 13.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:38.060
[ Music ]

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.150
Everybody's awake now.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:49.190
One of the things that
[inaudible] a second area

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.300
that has a triple pattern
that keeps getting repeated,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.350
but what we hear here is this
very clear dum-da-da-dum.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.950
And it's that "dum,"
the second one,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.570
that is very important
accented as you can see.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.120
And that plays a big role
in the entire movement

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.410
of this really great piece.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:12.930
Gradually, Brahms plays a
trick that composers do,

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.950
where they will slow something
down, maybe extend things a bit,

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.740
augment the durations so that it
has the same basic sound to it

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.260
but it feels like
it naturally fits.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.490
And what Brahms does
is he eventually slows

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.630
down to the point where
you expect to hear

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.900
that dum-da-da-dum,
that last part,

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.920
and potentially you
might be feeling it

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.970
in your head even
though it's not there.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.880
And so, I'll show
you what I mean.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:53.380
A little bit later in the piece,
we start to have this kind

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.910
of an offbeat thing in the
right hand, and we have an idea

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:02.080
of that motive in the left
hand that's just partial.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.710
And I swear that you start

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.450
to hear the resolution
of this idea.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.880
So see what you think.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.510
This is track 13, 713.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:35.040
[ Music ]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.640
So if I had started that
a little bit earlier,

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.800
it even makes it
a bit more clear.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.700
But he actually eventually
starts to put it in there

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.670
which makes you think that
either the pianist missed it,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.290
they missed the notes they
were supposed to play earlier,

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.890
or maybe it was partially there.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:54.130
And so this is, I feel, I
have no way to prove this,

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.850
but I think it's a case in which
Brahms is playing with this idea

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:01.840
of expectation and what
you're supposed to hear

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.140
and what you actually hear.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.990
And I think that he
learns that from Schumann.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.850
Going back to Schumann in the
types of kind of musical plays

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.140
on words that he would do,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:21.100
he'll turn an accompanimental
[phonetic] figures

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.450
into dual role types
of materials.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.910
Kind of [inaudible]
between purposes.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:36.700
So in this section which is
kind of an intimate section,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.390
you'll see those little
dotted bracket parts are kind

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:45.320
of secondary ideas disk, just
kind of [inaudible] ideas

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.480
but they occasionally line
up with the melodic ideas.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.780
And this is kind of a way

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.790
that he threads things
together very craftily.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.550
See what you think.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:04.510
This is track 4.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:21.150
[ Music ]

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:26.180
And by the way, this is one of
those bookends kind of sections

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.720
that comes upon either
end of a larger section.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.760
But what you see especially
towards the end where you have

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.090
that rising scale
that turns into,

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.240
this is just continuing
the scale and it turns

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.690
into melodic scale as opposed

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.820
to just an accompanimental
[phonetic] one.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.440
This type of inner voice
work is highly characteristic

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.610
of Schumann's piano
writing and also a Brahms,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.800
and I feel this is also
where Brahms gets a lot

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.110
of that inspiration for
writing in that manner.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.080
As I get to the close
here, this is going

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.310
to be a bit more speculative
than where I was before.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:17.190
Schumann has a lot of
self-awareness, I feel,

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.230
in his music, like
other composers do.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:25.230
You have Richard Strauss,
who referred to his own music

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:29.330
in other pieces and
many others too.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:33.820
But Schumann seems to be
dealing with a vat of material

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.920
that comes back always
in a creative guise,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.700
always in a new set of trappings
but still feels like it's

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.040
from the same kind of
font of creativity.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:52.720
And I just wanted to share
a couple examples that come

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.960
from towards the end
of the "Humoreske."

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.390
And what I see this as
is kind of a moment,

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:02.280
again just this isolated -- it
actually happens three times

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.420
in a row -- of this isolated
idea just before the very end

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.850
of the piece.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.160
And then I want to show
you an earlier work

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.380
where he does something
similar, and then a later work

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.680
where he does something similar.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:23.600
So this is the last gesture
that you actually hear,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.890
but you actually hear
this three times.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.510
Let's listen to track 6, 532.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:42:07.220
[ Music ]

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.980
And then there's sort
of this just wonderful,

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.390
very brief fast coda
that ends the piece.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.690
But I'm not going
to show you that.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.920
You'll get to hear
that in a little bit.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.680
Rather, have that in the back
of your minds, and if we go back

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.420
to the 'Kinderszenen,"
Opus 15, number 8.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:34.190
Let's just play the
opening of that, track 11.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.510
Yeah, just the opening.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:58.290
[ Music ]

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:02.360
Okay, so that's a much faster
setting of the material.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.420
It may or may not sound
immediately like the other one,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.990
but what you'll start to notice
as you listen to more and more

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.030
of Schumann's music is
that he starts to kind

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.070
of have the same sorts of
gestures that he'll draw on.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.830
And sometimes it's faster music
and sometimes it's slower music.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.640
We won't listen to another
slower one but let's listen

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.570
to what he does in "Waldscenen."

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:30.500
As I said at the beginning of
this talk, Schumann wrote most

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.750
of his piano music that
everybody knows in the 1830s.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:38.100
He started to write more some
didactic works and things

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:43.070
like that for his daughters in
the 1840s, and then he came back

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.910
to writing some character
pieces.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.180
And one of the great sets
of late Schumann is the

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.260
"Waldscenen," the
"Forest Scenes."

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:55.120
I didn't include the opening
movement but that's one

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.240
where the repose is
just magnificent.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.910
But let's hear the sixth
movement, just the opening.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.510
This is track 12.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:21.610
[ Music ]

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.000
So what you might notice and all

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.510
of these things is a
rising scale followed

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:26.960
by a descending one.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.460
Sometimes there at
the same pitch level.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.110
Sometimes they're not.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.950
But it's all kind of a
gestural [inaudible] contour

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:40.390
that Schumann would draw from.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:44.190
And writing a lot
of this often joyful

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:49.170
and very thoughtful
reflective kinds of music.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:54.910
I think that when you're
listening to all the pieces

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.790
and then the trio that
also not many people know,

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.920
the "F Major Trio," Opus
80, is a magnificent piece.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.860
And I think you're
really going to enjoy

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.970
that if you haven't
heard that before.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.270
That's also a [inaudible] piece.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.110
I just don't have the
time to really go into it.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.930
The "Humoreske" you're
going to enjoy

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.520
if you haven't heard it before.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.140
There are lots of melodies
that might seem familiar to you

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.810
if you haven't heard the piece.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:25.160
Again, I think because of the
sort of communal dramatic pot

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.960
from which Schumann draws.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.960
And, of course, the Brahms
quartet is a very important work

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.980
for Brahms because it
signifies in many ways a part

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.520
of his maturity written
about back to back

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.840
with the first piano
quartet, the G minor,

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.680
after Schumann was gone.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.210
But we have Brahms
coming of age.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:55.850
I think it's interesting and I
would encourage you to go back

00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:01.060
and listen to early Brahms, and
some of these Schumann cycles,

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.600
just to see how they're kind
of feeding off of each other,

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.530
or rather Brahms is
feeding off of Schumann,

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.330
but in a very positive way.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.340
So in particular the
Opus 10 Ballades.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.640
Also the Opus 1,
2, and 4, and 5.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.430
The Opus 1 and 2 and 5 are piano
sonatas and Opus 4 is a scherzo.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:25.150
And you can really
find the Schumann

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:27.870
in these early Brahms works
and they're really rewarding.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.850
So thanks so much, and
if you have any questions

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.650
that I could try to
answer, I'd be happy to.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:50.620
[ Applause ]

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.620
&gt;&gt; I was interested in
the hidden messages.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.650
That bar of music that
isn't really played.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:04.020
Does any other composer do that?

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
you know, they do.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.190
People do.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:13.480
It more often happens
with text being inserted.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:19.430
So to answer firstly from
a musical standpoint,

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.610
lots of heavily contrapuntal
music will often have this sort

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.780
of implied voice that comes
through that we might imagine

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:36.030
or that a composer intuitively
or purposefully will kind

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:41.950
of intimate, especially with
a solo violin or a solo cello.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.950
They'll put in things
so that we fill in lines

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:51.500
where it is possible necessarily
to have continuous lines.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.990
So it's kind of taking advantage

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:58.670
of a psychology of
music perception.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.110
Other composers have done this,

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.830
especially with the
case of text.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.990
And what I mean by
that is that --

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:14.970
one of the most clear ones
would be with sacred music

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:20.050
when composers will put in, say,
biblical quotes or something

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.050
like that, that are not
articulated in any way.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.370
Perhaps this is an
instrumental work.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.530
Liszt does this all the time.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:33.880
Brahms does this in the
Second Piano Sonata.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.080
He puts the words to a song
above the second movement.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.180
&gt;&gt; But the song is not heard.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.480
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But
we don't hear the song.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.640
You hear some of the melody
and the player sees it,

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.690
but the person listening,
unless they are looking

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.640
over the shoulder of the
performer, isn't aware of it.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.570
And so I call this
[inaudible] text.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.100
And there's a lot
of that going on.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:02.300
And it can be very interesting
because it what it implies is

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.070
that there's more to a
relationship with a work of art

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.410
than just passively
taking it in.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.650
You can actively
kind of contribute

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.250
to your experience by, you know,

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.230
working with the
score or however else.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:29.590
&gt;&gt; I was curious about the
term "humoresque" because sort

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.850
of in my mind I expected
a shorter piece.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:36.040
But I wondered generally
what the implication

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.280
of that term would be.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.850
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So
that's a tough one to cover

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:46.030
because before Schumann did
this piece, I don't know

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.300
of any other musical
work that has this title.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.820
He was very interested in Jean
Paul [phonetic] and other people

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.870
who were writing and
doing interesting work

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.310
with this aesthetics

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:05.680
and basically literary
theory and things like that.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.900
I don't have it in front
of me but there's a quote

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.040
from Schumann saying that
as he is writing this,

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.570
he feels simultaneously
overjoyed

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.760
and deep sadness
at the same time.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.450
I the idea of an
ironic sort of humor,

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:31.440
in that it's not just a
knee-slapper type of joking

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.180
that he is trying to do,
but rather, you know,

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:41.300
he uses like terms
"with humor' in lots

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.760
of his other works
at different points.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:51.350
So he is kind of tapping into
an adjective that he uses,

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:56.140
but again, what's interesting
about those is the contrast

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.430
between the moments
that have that marking

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.590
and what comes before
and what comes after.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.840
It's some sort of switch
that happens in the character

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.330
of the piece, and that's the
best way I can describe what I

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.630
think is happening.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.910
And so I think it's rather than
fleeting passage of moods rather

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:22.900
than the happy-go-lucky sort of
thing that maybe you would think

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.640
that that title implies.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.630
&gt;&gt; So in terms of
the quotations,

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:35.100
we know that in the literary
world they do analyses

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:39.340
of word patterns and
use of certain words,

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.640
and I'm wondering --

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.470
to determine if a piece
is by the same author,

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.460
they've done this to Shakespeare
and some manuscripts.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.210
I'm wondering if there's
a similar situation

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.970
with musicians.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:52:01.840
Is there like a fingerprint
of certain ways of phrasing?

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar:
That's a good question.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.180
It's one that's actually
still relevant today.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.590
I can't remember
who the parties were

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:13.230
but just a few days ago I was
reading that somebody settled

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.390
on what seemed to be
too much of a closeness

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.290
between two pop songs.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.790
One that was written
a long time ago

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.550
and one had just been composed.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.570
And the two parties settled.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:29.790
One other example from
the pop world would be

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:33.430
"Under Pressure"
and "Ice Ice Baby."

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:40.140
I don't know if you know this.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.600
Those two are extremely close

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.110
and which one's copying
the other.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:47.790
And those are actually
legal questions

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.440
that are hard to answer.

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.530
Sometimes people win
and it makes sense.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.930
Sometimes people when and
it doesn't make sense.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.970
But what you're talking
about is, I think,

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:01.990
more of a historical
marker or determining

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:06.290
if a piece is authentically
related to a given composer.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.850
And there are people who just

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:10.870
to know a particular composer
inside and out so much

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:15.470
that they can say with a
certain degree of certainty

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.750
that a work is authentic or not.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.190
But really, it takes
a specialist.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:25.900
I'm sure there are people who
have algorithmic processes

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.620
for exploring these things.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.710
I don't know about them
personally but I'm sure

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:33.420
that people are doing
that as part of analysis.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.260
Again, a lot of the
types of connections

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.570
that one can make are not
just based on the parameters

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.440
that you might initially
expect to have in place.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.790
Just like just an aural
perimeter or just a visual one.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.090
So it's hard.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.390
I don't think it's ever
going to be possible

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.840
to take away the human
element of being able

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:59.980
to parse things in
a particular way.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:06.390
&gt;&gt; Speaking of hidden messages,
there are often times in music,

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.800
words actually spelled
like Dimitri Shostakovich

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.500
with the DE flat and so on.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.710
And so the same is
true for Bach.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.420
And I think Brahms did that too,

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.360
and the story just
slips my mind.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.820
I think he had a
woman that he admired

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.990
in Gottingham [phonetic] named
Agnes, and he did a motif on AG.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.540
I don't know what did
for N, then e flat.

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:32.200
Can you verify that?

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.810
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: This
is a common practice.

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:36.290
I mean, one of the most
famous examples is Bach.

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:41.510
So what she's speaking of is
Bach, who the B would be B flat

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.630
in the way of our nomenclature.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:48.500
A would be A. C would be C
and H would be B natural.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.180
And so, you have
something similar happening.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.600
Shostakovich would do
this with his name.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.360
Because of the Germanic spelling
of particular note names

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.400
and that's how you
get the initials,

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.950
people do this all the time.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.920
I think you're thinking

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.140
of the Agnes [Inaudible]
something like that.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.190
That doesn't sound right to
me actually, now as I say it.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:17.140
But yeah, this was a
game that people played.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:21.290
Schumann played it very
prominently in the [Inaudible],

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:27.560
the movements from "Carnaval,"
the sphinxes that spell

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.290
out little names that
are of meaning to him.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.250
And then we have
interpreters now,

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.570
170 years later,
trying to figure out.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.270
"Well, do I play that
in concert or do I just,

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:42.570
you know, go past it?"

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:48.410
but sometimes those things
can be kind of musical keys.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.840
I think that Shostakovich
thought of it that way,

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.410
in the sense that it
provides some sort

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.410
of mode of entry into a work.

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:00.120
And certainly it does for
Bach, because when you look

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.050
at those permutations
[inaudible], you do kind of feel

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:10.810
like that it's an interesting
enough motif to be worthy

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:14.520
of Bach, and so [inaudible].

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.280
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Brahms?

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.990
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, so Brahms
never -- he said, you know,

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:26.980
there are two things that he
never tried, opera and marriage.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:35.220
So he had different interests,
but nothing ever in the end lead

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.520
to marriage or things.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.910
But he certainly had interests.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:45.110
&gt;&gt; In terms of quotes,
I wondered --

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.160
you made a comment about
how one of Brahms' quotes

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:55.320
that you cited was demonstrating
a different orchestral quality

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.490
and sort of texture.

00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:01.830
I wonder if that or other
examples of these have anything

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:03.970
to do with advances
in the instrument

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:05.760
from one to the other?

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.630
Or was it such a short period
of time, it didn't matter?

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:12.930
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Absolutely.

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.230
I should say yes and no.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:18.200
I'm not an expert on
this by any stretch,

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.890
but eventually you're having
the expansion of the size

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.220
of the keyboard so that
you're adding a base.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:28.620
And eventually it even goes
lower than your typical Grand.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.530
You have the Bosendorfer
Imperial Grand

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.690
that has a few extra
notes on the very bottom.

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:36.000
Even today, that's still
not entirely standard,

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.450
although it generally is
with 88 keys, as you know.

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:44.490
But you have different factors
that go into the construction

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:50.680
of the piano and control
that the performer has,

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.240
especially performer/composers
that absolutely needs them

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.380
to exploring different types
of things compositionally.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:01.860
By the time you have
Brahms in the 1850s kind

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.150
of pounding away a bit, you've
got more sizable instruments

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:08.080
than early Chopin

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.340
and Mendelssohn would
have been working with.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:18.780
I think then they kind
of rise to the occasion.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.690
For instance, I can give you
-- and I'll stop talking --

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.700
but one clear example
would be the difference

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.850
between a piano that's light
to the touch and a piano

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:30.050
that is heavy to the touch.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:34.190
In the 19th century, in general,
pianos had a lighter touch.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:36.960
And so you have certain pieces,
especially some of, let's say,

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.450
Liszt's etudes, that
are much more possible

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:44.770
on those instruments and
making it really quite --

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:46.650
I'm thinking of [Inaudible]
for instance,

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:49.030
one of the "Transcendental
Etudes."

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:51.800
It's quite an interesting
feat to see somebody playing

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.200
that on a modern Steinway.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.890
But of course, the pianists
are also trained and brought

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.980
up to -- they're living
now, so they're working

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.810
with what we have now and they
have so many different resources

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:04.460
with modern instruments that
those types of differences --

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.330
they are if you find it.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:08.460
People treating those
instruments

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.110
differently [inaudible].

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:13.840
Especially with before we were
doing stuff inside the pianos

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.140
and things like that.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.350
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.740
Okay, I think I'm done.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.200
I have been rambling a bit.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.510
But thanks so much, and I
hope you enjoy the show.
