DANA VIGUE: When I
enrolled in this course,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.540
I expected it to be
a traditional one

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.080
professor, large population
of students sort of dynamic

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.710
in a seminar style.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.960
But what I found was
that we had half a dozen

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.060
different professors
or more over the course

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.440
of the semester.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.910
And I've never been in a
class in that style before.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.450
So it was a new
environment for learning.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.480
And I wasn't sure how what we
learned in class day to day

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.850
would be able to carry
over in a cohesive way

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.340
as we switched
lecturers, but what

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.310
I found was that a
common thread was woven

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.350
throughout the course
of the semester,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
and that thread drew from
diverse individuals who

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.160
have expertise in
diverse fields of study,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.670
and who have used that
expertise in diverse ways

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.790
to work and collaborate with,
again, diverse groups of people

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.840
throughout the world.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.060
And I think that ended up being
the central theme of the class,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.700
that the black
experience, you know,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.730
this sort of overused phrase
that we might hear just

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.800
as colloquially is
monolithic compared

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.300
to the diversity of
experiences that this class was

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.850
able to demonstrate
to each of us.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.350
ELENA ALBERTI:
Bouncing off of that,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.240
I think something that
was also interesting

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.790
was not only the multitude
of voices in the professors,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.870
but the multitude of different
voices within the student

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.790
population.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.530
When we were
introducing ourselves,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.059
I think most of us
are different majors,

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:35.850
and we also come from
different backgrounds

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.045
and different ethnicities
and different sexualities

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:39.040
and genders.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.230
And I think having
such a group discussion

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.790
with different
professors allows you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.680
to get a lot of
different perspectives,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.640
not only from the
professorial side,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.140
but from the student experience
and what you're experiencing

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.382
here as different individuals.

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:56.090
LORRAINE WONG: Yeah,
I really appreciated

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.660
the different courses of
everyone in the class,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.410
but also in the professors,
so some of our guest lecturers

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.130
were from women's and gender
studies, or CMS, which

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.949
is comparative media
studies, writing, literature,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.670
so we had all these different
perspectives, like Fox

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.620
Harrell's Phantasms and the
virtual reality project,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.790
to Professor Helen Elaine
Lee's writing workshops,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.480
and when we had to delve deep
into what our parents taught us

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.355
and how we were raised,
and all these things.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.370
And I think each of them
brought such important facets

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.980
to the conversation
that we could explore

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.140
within ourselves and
within the outer world,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.732
and how black matters isn't just
anthropology or just history

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.190
or something, but it's all of
these different things, which

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.502
is why it's so important
to the real engagement.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:50.510
COLIN GODWIN: Yeah, it was
like each speaker brought

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.620
a different view on emancipatory
literacy to the class,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.380
and just showed us
the different ways

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.060
we could dissect
everything we see.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.800
ELENA ALBERTI: Also,
I think hearing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
from the different professors
also, as a sophomore,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.250
opens me up to taking more
classes in different areas.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.484
I didn't realize how many
actual parts go into this class,

00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:13.775
because I remember when I
was looking through the class

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:15.275
list it's like, oh
yeah, this counts

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.640
for CI-H, HASS-A,
like everything.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.370
And I was like, why?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.200
And then you realize, with
all the different professors.
