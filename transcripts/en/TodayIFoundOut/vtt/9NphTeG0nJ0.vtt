00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.880
Imagine getting the idea one day to sell everything
you own, take the money to Las Vegas, and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
bet it all on a single spin of the roulette
wheel.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.110
It sounds crazy.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.250
The risk of losing is very real, and you could
very well be walking away with just the clothes

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.250
on your back.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.059
In fact, the chance of winning in an all-or-nothing
red/black bet on an American roulette wheel

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.559
is 47.3% (48.6% if playing on a European wheel).

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.530
Ashley Revell of the United Kingdom decided
to take that risk when he sold everything

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:12.390
he owned and bet the resulting £76,840 (about
£105,400 or $164,286 today) on red in Las

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.140
Vegas during April of 2004.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.549
Thirty-two year old Ashley Revell’s journey
to risking his life savings in Vegas began,

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.080
by his own admission, over drinks in a pub
with friends.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.970
One friend brought up the idea of betting
everything on a single spin of the roulette

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.729
wheel, and the slightly inebriated group agreed
it sounded like a good idea.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.380
Despite the conversation being alcohol induced,
the next day, the idea still stuck out in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.380
his mind.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.729
He later told the Telegraph, “I thought
what an amazing experience it [betting all

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
of his money] would be.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.310
At the time I wasn’t married, I didn’t
have kids.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.850
I was completely single.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.780
It was now or never.”

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.030
It should not be surprising that not everybody
supported his plan, and both of his parents

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.030
opposed the idea.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.039
Revell’s father, Mick, told his son that
he was a “naught boy”, that he shouldn’t

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.319
go through with it, and “He should work
like all the other kids do.”

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.109
Ashley spent time convincing them to support
him in the endeavor.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.850
His father caved first, but his mother took
a bit more persuasion before agreeing to support

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.850
her son.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.210
So he took the next step and began selling
all of his possessions and raising a bit of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.250
extra cash any way he could.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.920
His BMW car, a Rolex watch, golf clubs, and
even sentimental items were either sold at

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.770
auction or during boot (trunk) sales.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.900
Some items were harder for him to part with
than others, especially soccer trophies and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.680
a cricket jumper he received while playing
in high school.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.860
Afterwards, Revell admitted he regretted selling
those items.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.760
Eventually a television crew from the British
TV channel Sky One heard about his plan and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.690
created a TV mini-series titled Double or
Nothing.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.450
Tallying it all up, after selling everything
and acquiring funds from other sources such

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.040
as being sponsored to change his name to “Ashley
Blue Square Revell” by a UK online bookmaker,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.870
he managed to compile a very respectable total
of £76,840.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.680
With the money in the bank ready to be wired
over, he boarded a flight for Las Vegas with

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.450
the camera crew, his friends, and parents
in tow.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.180
He didn’t even technically have the clothes
on his back at this point as what he was wearing

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.630
was a tuxedo he rented specifically for the
occasion.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.260
Plans to place the bet at the Hard Rock Hotel
fell through after negotiations broke down

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.370
with the casino.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.310
However, the owners of the Plaza Hotel and
Casino seized the opportunity for publicity

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.790
and agreed to host the roulette game, though
directly before he placed his bet told him

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.710
that they did not advise that anyone, including
him, go through with something like this.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.990
Despite the risk, the night before making
the life-changing bet, Revell slept well and

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.230
later said did not doubt his decision to go
through with it.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.100
Despite the odds technically being slightly
against him, he stated, “Thinking back it

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.440
seems crazy but I was so convinced I was going
to win.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.970
I was literally going down there to collect
my winnings.”

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.920
However, he still had not decided the answer
to an important question: would he bet everything

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.890
on black or on red?

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.360
He waited most of the morning for a sign telling
him which to choose but none came.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.880
In the end, according to Revell, directly
after the ball began to spin, “The first

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.280
thing that came into my head was red, so I
just pushed all my chips forward.”

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.330
With many family and friends there with him
watching, along with the audience of Sky One‘s

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.480
show back home, the ball circled the board
before landing on a number- seven, a red color.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:33.840
Revell had doubled his money on one spin,
giving him £153,680 (about £210,800 or $328,572

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.210
today).

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.930
He admitted after the experience that, “… it
was a mad thing to do.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.910
And I’m thinking back now about what would
have happened if I lost.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.740
I’d have had nothing to go back to, nothing
to wear.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.759
But I’d still have my friends, my family,
and they’d always be there for me.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.169
So they gave me the security to be able to
do this.”

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.800
Unlike most who win big in gambling, Ashley
decided that tempting fate once was enough

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800
for him.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.740
He declined to bet a second time and cashed
in his chips at the table and walked away.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.639
As for what happened after, Revell spent a
small portion of his winnings on a motorcycle

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.050
trip around Europe, where he met a girl while
in Holland.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.610
“I took her back to England with me, we
married and now we’ve got two children.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.080
You could say I have my bet to thank for finding
me a wife.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.080
”

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.980
One of the many viewers who watched Ashley
Revell on the Sky One television program was

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.009
Simon Cowell.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:50.430
Cowell was inspired by Revell’s all or nothing
bet to 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:01.969
create 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:28.840
the television game show 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.970
called Red or Black.
