CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.590
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.460
My name is Claudio.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.600
I'm one of the engineers on the
Google Drive SDK Developer

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.060
Relations team.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.330
And today, I'm going to do a
review of an application that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.450
very recently, just last week,
at the end of last week, was

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.490
released on our Chrome Web
Store on a collection of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.940
Drive-enabled application.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.250
This application is called
Spreadshirt Designer for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.970
Google Drive.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.210
Many of you might know
Spreadshirt already.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.070
It's a well-known product that
allows anyone to go on their

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.030
web page and design their own
T-shirt mug, hat, any kind of

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.210
promotional items or gadgets
or clothing where you can

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.400
print something on it.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.630
So you can have your own
personal design.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.010
And the new thing, what they
just launched, is a way for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.920
you to upload your files
directly from Drive.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.900
So, for instance, you can have
your own image that is on

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.170
Drive, or that someone shared
with you and use it to be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.200
printed on your T-shirt.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.910
We wanted to show you this
application because we have a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.410
lot of applications that do a
lot of creative things with

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.550
the Drive API, and we think
this is one of them.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.800
This is something that goes
beyond your computer.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.040
So you start from the computer,
and you get a real

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.190
object, a real item that
can use your files.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.650
Let's see how this works.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.210
The application is new
and is available in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.450
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.530
I have the listing page
in front of me.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.480
What we can see here,
there is a number of

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.120
screenshots and a video.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.270
The flow is that you install the
application, grant access

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.580
to it, and then you can pick any
of the files you have on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.470
your Google Drive account,
and send it directly to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.950
Spreadshirt.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.220
There's some small things we
would like to be improved or

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.120
changed, and I'm going
to address all of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.690
them, one by one.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.420
So if you open the Chrome Web
Store and you check this

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.350
collection, the Drive
collection, it will find this

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.470
application.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.150
When you click on it, you will
see this listing with some

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.080
screenshots to show how to use
the application, and what the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.840
final result could
be, and a video

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.920
explaining the same things.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.880
You can also check
the reviews.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.060
The application still has a
small number of reviews, but

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.700
they're all positive.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.360
So we are confident this
application will be liked by

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.350
many of you.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.170
As usual, the selection process
is very, very easy.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.330
You just open the listing like
I've done, and then you have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.130
this big blue button that
says Add to Chrome.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.725
If I click on it, I have to
confirm that I want to add

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.270
Spreadshirt Designer
for Google Drive.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.690
I say Yes.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.820
That's the only step required
to install an application.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.890
The result, if you're using
Chrome, is that a Spreadshirt

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.430
Designer icon is added
to your new tab page.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.590
Remember, you can add Drive
applications using any

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.900
browser, not just Chrome.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.100
So if you visit the Chrome Web
Store, let's say with Firefox

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.300
or Internet Explorer, you can
still install the applications

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.630
on your Drive account.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.950
The only difference will be
that, of course, there will be

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.480
no Spreadshirt Designer icon in
your new tab page, because

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.000
each browser has its own concept
of new tab page.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.520
This is something that is very
Chrome specific, but this is

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.250
not a requirement.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.780
We would like to stress this,
because this is a common

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.410
question we get.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.550
So the takeaway is that you can
install Drive applications

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.440
using any browsers, and you
can use those applications

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.770
with any browsers.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.180
So if I click on this now, what
happens is that I'm taken

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.760
to a Spreadshirt page that
explains what you can do with

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.420
Spreadshirt and how to use
it integrated with Drive.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.970
Their instructions are easy.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.850
You start from Drive.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.200
You select a file you want
to use with Spreadshirt.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.670
Then you're brought to the
Spreadshirt page, do all the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.920
editing, choose the T-shirt
you want, choose the mug,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.130
choose the item you want,
and that's it.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.490
And then, well, you buy
and get it delivered.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.010
So from here, instead of
launching the application

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.880
directly, they want you
to go back to Drive.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.260
This is something that
can be improved.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.870
This user experience
can be improved.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.580
We would expect the application
to be launched

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.150
when you click on the icon
in a new tab page.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.180
And then from inside the
application, you should still

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.350
be able to interact
with Drive.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.620
But let's see how it works right
now, and then we will

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.460
get back to our suggestions
for improvement.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.870
So if I click on this button, I
launch Drive, which means I

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.200
get redirected to Drive.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.670
This is my Drive account.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.180
If I see in the Manage
Apps dialogue--

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.530
I see all the applications
I have installed, and

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.920
Spreadshirt is here.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.050
I had this installed before, so
I didn't see a new message

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.870
in the dialogue saying that I
just installed Spreadshirt.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.300
And this is something
else we would like

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.940
Spreadshirt to change.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.800
Let me explain.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.320
When you install Spreadshirt
for the first time, it will

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.750
set itself as the default
application for all supported

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.170
file types.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.520
Spreadshirt supports all
image file types.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.590
But I don't think that's what
a lot of users want as the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.270
default viewer for images.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.170
Let me show what
happens if this

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.170
application is set as default.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.980
I set it as default.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.120
I have an image here.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.420
As a user, what I would expect
by clicking on this image is

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.640
that the image is open
in the viewer.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.720
But now if I click on it and
Spreadshirt is the default

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.770
application, when I do
that, I'm brought

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.250
into Spreadshirt directory.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.620
So let me make this bigger.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.450
This is the first time I
ran the application, or

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.050
Spreadshirt.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.060
And the application has to
request access to some of my

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.090
data, for instance, the file
I just tried to send.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.410
So this is the standard
auth dialogue.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.560
It is important, as always, to
read what the application

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.670
wants from you.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.760
So the application is requesting
permission to view

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.110
basic information about
my account.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.860
That's normal.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.520
So it wants my name It wants
some other information.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.580
They are all bundled together.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.810
So if they want my name, they
have to get all this

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.550
information together.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.530
But this is normal,
so I'm fine.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.230
They want to see my
email address.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.770
This is totally fine.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.950
They might want this to link
my account to their

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.230
Spreadshirt account.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.730
Remember that Spreadshirt is
a website that lives there

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.910
without Drive.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.390
So you as a Spreadshirt user can
go there directly instead

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.570
of starting from Drive.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.420
And maybe you have an account
there already.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.500
So with this information, they
can realize that you are the

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.540
same user that already
has an account there.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.450
And finally, the third piece of
information they want from

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.940
me is the ability to view and
manage Google Drive files that

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.310
I've opened or created
with this app.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.330
This is a very good.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.360
They're following our
recommendations.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.400
What they're asking here is to
have access to those files

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.610
that I'm sending to Spreadshirt
and only those.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.270
They don't want access
to all my files.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.840
They don't need access
to all my files.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.980
They only need access to that
specific image that I send to

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.600
Spreadshirt every
time I do it.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.360
And this is exactly what
this permission

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.740
request is asking for.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.320
So this is perfect.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.250
I'm going to allow
access to them.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.850
When I do, my file is
going to be loaded

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.750
into Spreadshirt which--

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.510
it's not working at the
moment, which is fun.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.049
So, well, let me explain
how this works.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.289
So maybe we try this again.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:42.559
When we go back to Spreadshirt,
what we get is

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:48.940
Flash application that you can
use to design your item.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.690
With this Flash application,
you can select the item.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:59.320
You can move your design, your
drawing at the center, the

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.400
back, everywhere.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.450
You can rotate the item and
see what they look like.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.210
You can change items,
of course.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.600
And you can add text.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.630
When you're done, you can
request it to be shipped--

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.720
well, printed, and shipped--
to you in a single item or

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.320
multiple items.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.910
Something that we would like
them to fix here, let's see if

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.610
it's still down.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.870
It is, unfortunately.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.620
Maybe we will show
it later again.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.590
But something that happens here
when you use Spreadshirt,

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.970
starting from Drive, is that
from inside the Spreadshirt

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.280
application, there's no way
to get a file from Drive.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.330
So if you start from Drive,
pick a file and send it to

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.320
Spreadshirt, that
works correctly.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.290
If you start from Spreadshirt
and want to get a file, that

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.480
is not supported.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.520
We covered this use case in our
documentation, and now I

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.090
have it open here, so
that I can show it.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.270
What they should use, what
Spreadshirt should use and

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.760
what we recommend a lot of other
applications to use is

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.020
the Google Picker API.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.640
This is a JavaScript API that
is part of the Google Drive

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.400
SDK that allows applications
to open a standard file

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.610
dialogue, the same file dialogue
that Google uses and

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.130
that all other applications
use.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.250
So it's well known
to the users.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.040
And this dialogue allows
them to open files

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.470
or even upload them.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.540
Spreadshirt probably doesn't
need to upload files back into

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.180
Drive, but they might need to
open a file from Drive.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.700
So all applications that can
open files from Drive should

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.910
probably implement
these two flows--

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.680
open a file directly from Drive,
and also embedding the

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.130
picker inside the application so
that the user doesn't have

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.520
to leave your application.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.860
Remember that if the user has
to leave your application,

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.230
they might not come back.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.040
So you don't want them to
leave your application.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.370
That's why you should embed
the picker in your

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.100
application.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.665
And this is one of our
suggestions for Spreadshirt.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.050
Let's see.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.720
Another thing we want them to
do, and this is documented

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.370
here, is to add the ability to
save your products whenever

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.050
you design a product in
Spreadshirt back to Drive.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.030
So right now with Spreadshirt,
with the application, you can

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.510
save your products in your
Spreadshirt account.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.720
So there is a way
to save them.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.130
But we think it would be natural
to store those edits,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.840
those designs, those products
you've created-- say, your

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.070
T-shirt with your
company logo--

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.850
into Drive.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.840
When you save a file
into Drive you have

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.050
basically two options.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.860
You can save the actual file, or
you can save a shortcut to

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.630
a file that is saved
somewhere else.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.580
We don't know anything about
the file format that

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.080
Spreadshirt supports, how
they're saving their designs

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.520
in Spreadshirt.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.470
And as they already have a way
to save those files in their

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.500
back end, I don't think it
really makes sense for them to

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.520
save some files into Drive
and some other files into

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.810
Spreadshirt.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.320
What does make sense is
to save what we call a

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.250
shortcut to a file.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.500
So remember, this is a new
thing we have in the

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.560
Google Drive SDK.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.010
You can save a pointer, a link
to a file that is stored

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:34.450
somewhere else.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.750
We call it shortcut.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.330
So what I think Spreadshirt
should do is, whenever you

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.800
want, whenever you want to store
a copy of your design,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.050
they should allow you to
save it into Drive.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.140
When you're saving to Drive,
what you actually save is a

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.530
shortcut that contains just an
ID or something that is unique

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.540
for Spreadshirt, and
that allows them to

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.190
restore that item.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.040
So they save a shortcut,
and they then link the

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.020
shortcut to the files.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.580
For the user, the user
experience is exactly the same

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.590
as if they were just storing
a file, the real file.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.660
But for the developer, this is
different, because they're not

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.700
sending us their files.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.920
They're only sending us
IDs or a link to them.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.130
Another new thing we just added,
we announced it last

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.690
Thursday right here in GDL,
Google Developers Live, is the

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.220
ability to add thumbnails
to files.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.120
Let's say Spreadshirt
saves the files to

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.860
Drive, as I just suggested.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.910
They're going to save
a shortcut.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.600
Being the file a shortcut,
Google cannot know anything

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.970
about the file content itself.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.740
So Google cannot generate a
thumbnail for that file.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.370
What a developer can do is
provide us with a thumbnail

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.650
that they generated.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:59.290
So Spreadshirt knows what any
given product is and how it

00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.940
looks like.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.820
For instance, if it's a T-shirt,
they can send us a

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.200
thumbnail that looks like a
T-shirt so that users can

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.940
easily spot them when they look
for a specific item in

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.650
their Drive list.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.760
This is also documented.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.425
So we covered it last week,
so you can watch the

00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.530
video if you want.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.180
But it's also covered by
our documentation.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.850
So we have a specific section
on uploading thumbnails.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.680
We support different file
formats, so you can upload the

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.920
thumbnails as PNGs, or
a GIF, or JPEGs.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.970
Now, we have some restrictions
on the file size and so on,

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.650
and you can read all of them
in the documentation.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.580
It's very easy.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.510
It is just an additional
field in your request.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.660
And if you're using one of our
client libraries, all of them

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.260
are updated to support it.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.510
So we strongly recommend
developers with their own

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.730
custom file format or developers
with shortcuts to

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.330
store a thumbnail for
us so that the user

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.150
experience is better.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.530
And users will--

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.380
well, are more likely
to-- spot your files

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.630
in their file list.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.760
Just before I try again to run
Spreadshirt, otherwise, we

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.200
just wrap it up here and maybe
we cover it again later, maybe

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.340
when they address all
these comments.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.940
Maybe they're good,
maybe they're not.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.080
I mean the comments.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.850
I said that one of the things
that the application does that

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.230
we'd like it to change is that
it sets itself as the default

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.650
application.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.690
I showed it in the Manage
Apps dialogue of Drive.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:44.180
So what I would like is not to
set itself as default, but

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.580
only to set itself as a
secondary application to open

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:50.980
those files.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.140
So let's say I uncheck this
used by default checkbox.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.490
What I see here is that if I
try to open an image from

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.780
Drive, it opens in the viewer,
which is what most people

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.860
would do, because they probably
have photos, and they

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.290
want to see them first.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.290
But if I want to open them in
Spreadshirt, all I have to do

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.580
is right click, select Open
With, and select one of the

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.210
application that supports
this file type.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.340
And Spreadshirt is
one of them.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.910
So same flow, and
I still open the

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.990
application from inside Drive.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.570
And the application
is now working.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.930
There was some issues--
temporary issues.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.046
So I can show you what
I was talking about.

00:16:35.046 --> 00:16:38.030
Oh, still not working properly,
because it should

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.480
show my image here.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.210
So this is the application.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.460
Well, assume you have
my image here.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.620
You can select any item, and
then you can, assuming this

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:59.220
was one of my designs, you can
have it here in the center of

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.640
the T-shirt.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.060
And then you select the size,
select the item, and then

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.990
you're done.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.300
So I was saying about the
default file type, and that's

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.869
my last suggestion for today.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:14.714
So when you write an application
and you write your

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:19.790
listing, you select what file
types and extensions you want

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.380
your application to open as
default or as secondary.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.079
This is done in the Google API's
console, and this is

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:31.960
documented in our Google Drive
SDK documentation.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.040
So what Spreadshirt I guess is
doing is setting the image

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.590
file types as primary types.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.540
Instead, I would recommend
them to list them

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.440
as secondary types.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.330
To show you how this is done,
I have the Google API's

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.460
console open.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.310
This is where you configure all
the marketplace Google Web

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.350
Store, Chrome Web Store listing
details for your

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.910
application.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.690
For instance, what the
application icon is, and you

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.220
define some of your parameters
like credentials and so on.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.270
And the thing I'm talking about
is the default MIME

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.790
types, and default file
extension, and secondary MIME

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.920
times and secondary
file extension.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.900
I think they should set them
here instead of default ones.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.770
And that will probably provide
users with a slightly better

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.740
experience.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.140
Or at least, I don't want some
user to be annoyed by the fact

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.030
that their default file viewer
is being overwritten by

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.240
another application.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.630
So just another comment.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:37.020
OK, so to wrap it up,
Spreadshirt Designer is new.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.040
It's on the Chrome
Web Store now.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.140
You might probably know it
already, because you used it

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.860
to print your T-shirts.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.930
If you want now, you can use
it with Google Drive.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.680
And I'm pretty sure it's going
to be better and better with

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.850
our suggestions and maybe
your suggestions.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:55.520
Remember that with the Chrome
Web Store, you can and are

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.230
invited to write reviews.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.330
So if you have suggestions,
please write them down here in

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.390
the Chrome Web Store page.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.760
And if you have any comments or
questions for us or if you

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.180
want your application to be
featured in one of our Google

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.220
Developers Live events, please
reach out to us.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.300
We are always available on
Google+, and on Stack Overflow

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.910
for technical questions.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.830
With that, thank you for
joining me at Google

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.370
Developers Live.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.560
I hope you liked it.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.180
And see you next time.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.430
Bye bye.
