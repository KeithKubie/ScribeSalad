[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:06.410
SPEAKER 1: Please
help me welcome

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.000
to the stage Jon Rudnitsky,
Hallie Meyers-Shyer, and Reese

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Witherspoon.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.395
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.120
Welcome.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.870
JON RUDNITSKY: Hi.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.637
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:19.470
SPEAKER 1: Have a seat,
any seat you'd like.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.317
Welcome.

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:21.650
REESE WITHERSPOON: Any seat, OK.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.960
SPEAKER 1: Any seat
except for mine.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.245
So reviews came
out this morning.

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:27.620
I don't know if
you've read them,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.360
or if you guys don't read them.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.110
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
I don't read reviews.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.931
SPEAKER 1: No?

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.930
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: No.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.932
SPEAKER 1: What is that
noise-making device?

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:37.140
REESE WITHERSPOON: That
means the reviews were great.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410
SPEAKER 1: Yay, applause.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.507
I actually want
to read one, which

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.090
I guess will lead into the whole
talking about the story here.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.157
"The unquestionable
feel-good movie of 2017."

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:47.990
Have you heard that?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.510
Pete Hammond,
"Deadline Hollywood."

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.250
Congratulations on writing
an incredible story.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.440
Hallie, this is your writing
debut, yes, directing debut,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.800
and film debut in general?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.882
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, it's my debut.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.160
Yeah.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.130
SPEAKER 1: So I guess, where
did the idea come from?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.382
Where did this originate?

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.090
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
It came from a bunch

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.170
of different places.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.100
I had had the character of Alice
in my head for a long time,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.050
of this woman who had sort
of made a lot of decisions

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.780
early in life, and then
started questioning them,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.910
and that kind of
post-separation, post-divorce

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.120
time in a woman's life.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.361
And I had a friend who had three
guys move into her family's

00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:33.860
house growing up,
and I just thought

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.140
that was such an interesting
idea, and a great setting

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.870
for a comedy.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.430
So I sort of put this
character in that scenario,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.110
and it all came from there.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.740
SPEAKER 1: So in real life,
was there the sexual tension

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740
that ended up happening?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.864
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: I
actually don't know anything

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:51.350
about what actually happened.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.430
It is a fictional film.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670
SPEAKER 1: Sure it is, right.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.710
And Reese and Jon,
how did the two of you

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.660
get onboard the film yourselves?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.570
REESE WITHERSPOON: I read the
script, and I just loved it.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.960
I thought it was such an
original idea, and the idea

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.615
that a decision you make
at 25 isn't necessarily

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:11.490
the right decision for
the rest of your life.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.073
And I think a lot of people are
at crossroads at certain times

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:17.340
and trying to figure out
chapter 2 of their life.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150
And so I met with Hallie,
and she was wildly impressive

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.320
and had a great vision for it.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.070
And we went ahead.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.820
SPEAKER 1: And Jon,
what about you?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.986
JON RUDNITSKY: I mean, same.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.990
I read the script
and was blown away.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.250
It's also about three young
filmmakers who move out

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.600
to LA hoping to make it.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.460
And me, Nat, and Pico can all
relate, obviously, to that.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.729
So you know, I was honored
to be a part of it,

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.020
getting to work with these two.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.561
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Jon came
in on our first day of casting,

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:48.620
which is very special.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.980
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.710
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.160
SPEAKER 1: And so none of you
knew each other beforehand?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.326
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: No, no.

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:55.100
Not really.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.559
JON RUDNITSKY: I'd heard of you.

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.350
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
We knew who Reese was.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.966
JON RUDNITSKY: I'd
heard of you, yeah.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:03.570
I had seen you in something.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.320
REESE WITHERSPOON:
What'd you think of me?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.270
SPEAKER 1: Right, so Reese,
you've been acting since,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.480
what, you were 14, 15?

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.670
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah, 14.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.820
SPEAKER 1: And so with hits--
gosh, "Pleasantville" still

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.280
one of my all-time favorites
from when I was younger,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.360
"Cruel Intentions," "American
Psycho," "Legally Blonde,"

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.235
"Sweet Home Alabama."

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.340
[CHEERING]

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.305
This is the "Legally
Blonde" section over here.

00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:31.680
"Sweet Home Alabama," "Walk
the Line," with which you won

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.430
the Academy Award.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.480
Again, congratulations.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.640
REESE WITHERSPOON: Thank you.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.210
SPEAKER 1: So I guess you've
been putting out a movie

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.450
a year since you
were a teenager.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.456
REESE WITHERSPOON: I guess so.

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:46.830
SPEAKER 1: You
were a child star,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.300
and then went to
be an adult star.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.520
How did you navigate
that complexity

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.790
without sort of going a little
bit typically child-star crazy?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.035
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
mean, I don't know.

00:03:58.035 --> 00:04:00.154
I wasn't really
a big child star.

00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:01.570
I worked in movies,
and my parents

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.403
were very adamant that
I stay in high school

00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:04.600
and that I went to college.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.620
So I didn't really start working
with any kind of regularity

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.470
until I was about 19.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.620
I got a big audition
when I was at Stanford,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.230
and then I had to drop
out to do the movie.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.480
And then I got another movie,
and I got another movie.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.938
And so it just
started working out.

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:22.050
But I thought I was
going to be a doctor.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.870
I'm not the kind of person
who would move to LA

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.350
and live in a car.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.320
SPEAKER 1: Your parents
are doctors, right?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.500
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah, my
parents are both doctors.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.310
Yep.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.290
SPEAKER 1: So did they
want you to be doctors?

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.829
Because my parents
were always like,

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:34.620
you can act with a
computer science degree.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.787
You can't do computer science
with an acting degree.

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:38.953
Which was the only advice
I really ever listened to,

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:39.960
which landed me here.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.501
So thank you, Mom and Dad.

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:44.610
REESE WITHERSPOON:
That's pretty good.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.930
Yeah, they wanted
me to be a doctor.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.780
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.780
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.919
I'm pretty sure they still
want me to be a doctor.

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.210
SPEAKER 1: Do they call you
after they see your movies,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.430
and like, Reese, we
really wish that you

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.112
had become a brain surgeon.

00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.820
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Less after the movies,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.080
more after I do a talk show
and I talk about them a lot.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.663
They're like, really
wish you wouldn't

00:05:03.663 --> 00:05:05.520
talk about us all that much.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.989
But they're good sports.

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:09.780
SPEAKER 1: You grew up
in the South, right?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.780
REESE WITHERSPOON: I grew up
in Nashville, Tennessee, yeah.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.404
And my dad was in the military,
so we were all over the place.

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:16.320
SPEAKER 1: How'd you
kick the Southern accent?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.737
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh, well, I
got advice when I was about 18.

00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:21.570
I went into a casting
office, and they said,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.150
you're never going to get work
with that terrible accent.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.770
So I watched a lot of
TV shows, like "90210."

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.500
And I went to watch the way
that they would articulate,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.562
and I would copy
them, like that.

00:05:35.562 --> 00:05:38.039
So really it's Shannon Dougherty
I owe my entire career to.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.580
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
You got it down.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.580
SPEAKER 1: Never would
have guessed that.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.538
REESE WITHERSPOON: Tori
Spelling, Jennie Garth.

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm just going to
leave it there.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.615
SPEAKER 1: That's crazy.

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:47.490
JON RUDNITSKY: And Luke
Perry, and on and on.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.180
SPEAKER 1: What's that?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.545
JON RUDNITSKY: We're just
going through the entire cast

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:50.570
of "90210."

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.865
REESE WITHERSPOON:
The original cast.

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:53.950
SPEAKER 1: And Jon.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.370
So dude, SNL.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.340
People dream about
being on that show.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.930
How did you make the crossover
from, I guess, sketch comedy TV

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.670
into this movie business?

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.420
JON RUDNITSKY: Well, I wouldn't
have gotten the opportunity

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.280
to even audition for this
had it not been for SNL.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.000
That kind of helped put me in
a room with Hallie and Nancy

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240
to begin with, which
was pretty crazy to even

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.620
have an opportunity to be
considered for this movie.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.287
But my background is in acting.

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:27.870
I've been doing
theater my whole life,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.570
and I studied theater at USC.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.370
So I really have
always wanted to act.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.060
I just happen to do comedy in
addition to that, you know?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.768
SPEAKER 1: (MOCKING)
Happen to do comedy.

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:42.170
JON RUDNITSKY: I happen
to do comedy, you know?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.128
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: He's
not from the Midwest,

00:06:44.128 --> 00:06:46.298
so we're not sure where
the accent comes from.

00:06:46.298 --> 00:06:48.548
SPEAKER 1: It's like this
weird Michael Keaton accent.

00:06:48.548 --> 00:06:48.976
JON RUDNITSKY: Is it?

00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:49.476
Is it?

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:51.220
SPEAKER 1: Or Jack
Nicholson, yeah.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.905
I happen to do comedy.

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:55.030
JON RUDNITSKY: I don't know
where it's coming from,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.530
I don't know.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.570
Do I do it all the time,
or is it just sometimes?

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.903
REESE WITHERSPOON: No, he
does lots of different voices.

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:01.860
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, he's a comedian.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.818
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah,
there's just certain words

00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:04.550
that I just like.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.240
Like, I like to
say about "a-boat"

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.260
even though I'm from Jersey.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.124
But it's more fun
to say "a-boat"

00:07:11.124 --> 00:07:12.290
and I'm going to the "bahr."

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.890
Like, I'm going to the "bahr."

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.442
Why wouldn't you choose
to say it that way?

00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:19.650
You could, just take what
you like from every accent,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.067
I guess.

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:23.150
SPEAKER 1: Like "I pahked
the cah at Havahd Yahd."

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.699
JON RUDNITSKY: There you go.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:25.740
SPEAKER 1: So Hallie now.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.100
You turned 30 pretty
recently, yes?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.840
I don't want to out
you here, your age.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.260
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
No, that's fine.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.297
I'm good with it.

00:07:31.297 --> 00:07:32.880
SPEAKER 1: I bring
this up because you

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.100
make me feel really
insignificant with my own life

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.080
decisions.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.570
Being older than that
and having seen now

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.499
what you have
accomplished, I guess

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:44.790
it makes me feel like I've
had a few wrong choices when

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.100
I was 25.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.170
But you started your
own acting career

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.217
when you were like, four, yeah?

00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:52.800
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Well, it's funny.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.770
I'm being asked that
a lot, but I wasn't it

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.060
in no way a child actor.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.400
My parents forced me to be
in their films basically.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.070
But I'm very grateful,
because now it's

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.614
kind of like I have
this personal connection

00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:06.030
and a little bit
of a photo album.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.220
But no, I was always
on their sets,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.904
so they'd throw me in the movie.

00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:11.820
But it wasn't because I
wanted to be an actor.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.524
SPEAKER 1: And who
are your parents?

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:14.940
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Nancy Meyers,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.490
the producer of our
movie, and my dad

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.940
is Charles Shyer, who was her
partner for a lot of my life.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.020
SPEAKER 1: A long time.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.050
And for those who don't
know, the two of them

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.327
have produced many things, such
as "The Intern," "The Holiday,"

00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:30.660
"It's Complicated," "Parent
Trap," "Baby Boom," "Private

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.940
Benjamin," "Father
of the Bride."

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.299
If you've heard of any of those,
came from this family lineage.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.120
And now the apple has not
fallen far from the tree.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.027
This movie is
absolutely incredible,

00:08:41.027 --> 00:08:42.360
and you're standing on your own.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.310
So thank you for
continuing this.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.310
And it is such a fun movie.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.190
Was it as fun to write as--

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.310
I guess the question is,
was it as fun to write

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.750
as it was for us to watch?

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.010
JON RUDNITSKY: Oh, boy.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.380
Got a little over-excited.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.149
SPEAKER 1: That is
a literal mic drop.

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:02.440
JON RUDNITSKY: Come on, Google.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.980
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: It was
very fun to make the movie.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.650
I love writing.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.490
It's where I identify most
in the filmmaking process,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.855
is with writing.

00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:14.980
I mean, in my case, I don't
have a writing partner.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.230
So you're completely alone
with these characters,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.420
and there's so much
fun to be had there.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.420
But it's really
challenging writing a movie

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.180
and layering your characters.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.610
And

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.180
I think I did probably upwards
of 30 drafts of this script.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.450
I did 15 on my own, then
I gave it to my mom.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.487
Then another 15
came out of that.

00:09:39.487 --> 00:09:41.820
REESE WITHERSPOON: Is that
scary, giving it to your mom?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.275
I'd be like,

00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:42.774
[SHUDDERS]

00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:45.190
SPEAKER 1: Just hands it
back with a big, red X on it.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.773
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
No, because she's

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:48.340
the only person I give it to.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.359
I gave it to her, and she has
such thoughtful, good notes.

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.650
I think good notes is just
raising the right questions.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.941
She never said, you should
do this, you should do that.

00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:58.546
It would just say,
why did they break up?

00:09:58.546 --> 00:09:59.920
Just raising those
questions that

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.550
make you go home and think for
so long, like, oh my god, why?

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.557
I don't know, and I
have to figure this out.

00:10:06.557 --> 00:10:08.140
So I don't even
remember the question,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.884
but yeah, writing is a lot
of work and super rewarding.

00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:11.800
SPEAKER 1: Was it fun?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.133
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: It was fun.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.530
I love to write.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.360
There's this great
Joan Didion quote,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.800
"I don't know what I'm thinking
until I write it down."

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.260
And I really identify with that.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.676
Sometimes you just don't know
how you feel about something

00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:24.370
until you just write it down.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.440
SPEAKER 1: That's interesting.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.530
As someone who writes because
I have to answer emails,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.858
I appreciate someone who
does it for recreation.

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:38.530
You grew up in the
industry, you grew up

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.220
around very successful parents,
and being on sets all the time.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.150
Obviously you have written
a maturity into this film

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.610
that I wouldn't have
expected from someone

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.890
I guess as young as you are,
from a certain perspective.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.620
So where did that
maturity come from?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.172
Where did your larger view on
relationships and life happen?

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.130
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: You
know, I think for me I

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.530
was trying a little bit to
honor the medium of film,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.820
which I respect so much.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.290
Film is forever,
and I didn't want

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.970
to write about trivial issues.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.330
So for me, the themes of
family and divorce and starting

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.930
over are important.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:21.280
So that's kind of why I think
Alice's story and crossroads is

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.700
a little bit weightier and
realer then the issues of sort

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.520
of which guy.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.420
The kind of like,
20-something story.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.420
SPEAKER 1: And I
enjoy in this that it

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.420
doesn't take the normal
slapstick kind of silly turns

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.820
that romcoms--

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.210
romantic comedies--
do in most cases.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.480
So it was a pleasant surprise.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.650
And I think that's
why, of course,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.700
today the reviews
are coming out,

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.949
and they're all very positive.

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:50.560
So you've done a good job there.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.210
Regarding the
characters, I guess.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.970
So we saw in the preview
there's lots of other people

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.780
in it, obviously.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.655
It's not just the three
of these people here.

00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:00.160
Or the two of them
and a director.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.100
Michael Sheen is
Alice's husband.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.720
Candice Bergen is Alice's mom.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.110
We've got Lake Bell, who's
a wonderful addition.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.060
How did all of these
wonderful people

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.710
come to get attached to this
first-time director's film?

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.134
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Well, casting

00:12:16.134 --> 00:12:17.800
is such an important
part of the process

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.680
because you're sort of handing
your character off to somebody

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.138
and letting them
make it their own.

00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:26.650
So it's such an important thing,
and we thought really deeply

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:27.250
about this.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.680
And it was a really
nice mix, I think,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.760
of newcomers and
seasoned actors.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.670
And I think that mix
added something fresh

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.450
to the equation.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.820
It really felt like there
was different generations

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.460
in this movie.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.910
And I have to say, we
sent it to these people.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.270
And sometimes you think
you'll never hear back.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.830
And a lot of them responded.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.570
And my mom had worked with
Bell before, so we knew her.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.360
But the rest of the actors in
this movie were just good old

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.390
fashioned sending in the script
and hoping they'll say yes.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.020
REESE WITHERSPOON:
You have to realize

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.770
as an actor you don't
get a lot of scripts

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.590
where you get to play
a character anymore.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.100
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.849
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Yeah, it's pretty rare.

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:05.647
And to have a fully fleshed-out
character with a beginning,

00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:07.480
and a middle, and an
end, or a real journey,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.570
or real lines to say,
or humor is really

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.939
an anomaly these days.

00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:13.480
I mean, you're
honestly just reacting

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.510
to a green screen going,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.002
[GASP]

00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:18.460
And then to the director you're
like, what am I staring at?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.959
And he's like, I'm not sure,
we're going to put it in later.

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:25.060
But just give me six
different reactions to it.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.610
So most actors are
starving to do something

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.680
really meaningful and deep.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.440
SPEAKER 1: I guess
I didn't realize

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.120
that the bad guy
with the green screen

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.250
was never preconceived
beforehand.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.833
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Sometimes they are,

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.330
and sometimes they have no
idea what's coming next.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.862
SPEAKER 1: So working
with the Three Stooges--

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:49.570
was there any parallel
there, by the way?

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.320
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: No.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.450
SPEAKER 1: Why three guys?

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.380
I'm sidetracking here.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.100
Why three guys?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.630
Why not one?

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.997
Why not two?

00:13:55.997 --> 00:13:58.330
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: I think
good things come in threes.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.354
It just was always going to be
a trio for me, I don't know.

00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:02.020
SPEAKER 1: Fair.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.470
OK, so back to my
original thought.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.420
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
It was always three.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.410
SPEAKER 1: So this
is a little bit of a.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.299
Spoiler some of you
have seen the movie.

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:08.590
We screened it here last night.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.219
So at the end, I was
pleasantly surprised

00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:12.760
to find that at the
end of the story,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.850
Alice doesn't choose
any of the men.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.217
Which is great.

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:20.800
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
They just gasped.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.898
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh no.

00:14:22.898 --> 00:14:24.470
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Imagine that.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.870
SPEAKER 1: You don't
need a man to be happy?

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.710
And it's refreshing to
see a romantic comedy

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:35.730
where the female protagonist
finds happiness on her own.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.564
Jon, I'd choose you.

00:14:36.564 --> 00:14:38.813
REESE WITHERSPOON: Do you
know how many people come up

00:14:38.813 --> 00:14:40.120
to me like, what about Jon?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.595
What about the
guy, that Jon guy?

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:43.970
SPEAKER 1: I did think that
you were going to go for Jon.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.010
That Alice would go for Jon.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.940
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: So many
people say that to me, too.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.170
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah,
I'm writing a sequel

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.211
where we end up together.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.150
"Home Again, Again."

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.940
SPEAKER 1: "Still Home Again."

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.700
I guess is one of the
most powerful things

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.370
about this movie, is that I
feel every woman is portrayed

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.360
as a strong woman, even like the
smaller supporting characters.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.170
None of them are typically
your frail, weak sort

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.632
of women that are
often portrayed.

00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:16.840
Was this a conscious choice
when you were writing it?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.850
And I guess for you,
Reese, was this something

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.620
you noticed in the script that
attracted you to the role?

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.080
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah, I
don't play a lot of weak women.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.240
I don't really know
any weak women.

00:15:34.877 --> 00:15:37.210
My mother used to always say,
if you want to be a woman,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.415
you'd better be tough.

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:40.630
And that's the only
kind of women I know.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.377
That's what Hallie writes.

00:15:42.377 --> 00:15:43.960
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
I wouldn't have--

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.130
I don't know.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.460
I also don't know
any weak women.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.630
It wouldn't have come
naturally to me to write that.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.770
She's vulnerable,
that's for sure.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.500
And she gains
strength by the end

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.470
of the film, and
self-confidence, and feeling

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.130
like she's going to
be OK by the end.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.510
I wasn't consciously thinking,
this is a strong woman.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.710
I just thought, this as a
woman, and women are strong.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.890
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I agree.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.640
Very well written.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.910
And so Erika--

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.600
Olde?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.356
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah, Olde.

00:16:12.356 --> 00:16:13.730
SPEAKER 1: Produced
this as well.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.030
So she's only been producing
for just a few years, too.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.946
She's a new producer.

00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:20.320
And I was reading
up on her, too,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.670
and she produces films
primarily made by women as well.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.010
So how did you find her?

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.654
How did she become attached?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.820
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: After
I had written the script,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.770
we gave it to our
agents, who wanted

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.660
to help us get the
financing for this movie.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.670
And Erika was the
right person, I think,

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.810
because her whole company is
based around women's stories.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.780
And I think she
has a particular--

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.720
she loves these kinds
of movies, and she

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.690
wanted to tell women's stories
and help female directors.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.370
So it was a really nice pairing.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.540
And she's a young woman
herself, and it was great.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.740
SPEAKER 1: That's wonderful.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.690
So Reese, a little
side question, I guess.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.880
Over the last few
years, so you've

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.470
been getting into
producing yourself.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.970
And you produced
"Big Little Lies,"

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.849
which now you have a bajillion
Emmy nominations for that,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.040
which is wonderful.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.380
What made you want to
get into producing?

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.619
REESE WITHERSPOON: Well,
about five years ago, I

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.420
read probably the
worst script I've ever

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.960
read in my entire life.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:26.859
And the part for a woman was
just absolutely dreadful.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:27.634
Opposite a guy.

00:17:27.634 --> 00:17:29.050
And I called my
agent, and I said,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.410
well, this is just
a piece of crap,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.576
and I don't want to do this.

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:35.410
And she said, every actress
in Hollywood wants this part.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.280
And I thought, we deserve
better than these parts.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.489
And so I was like,
I can either start

00:17:41.489 --> 00:17:43.780
complaining about it, which
isn't going to do any good,

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.290
or I can do something about it.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.460
So I started buying books
and turning them into movies.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.610
And my first two were
"Wild" and "Gone Girl."

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.400
And so I just started
from there, and creating

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.180
parts for other women as well.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.030
And that's sort of been the
next chapter of my life.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.720
SPEAKER 1: So do you enjoy
performing still more?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.825
Or are you aiming more
towards the producer side

00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:04.450
moving forward?

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.660
REESE WITHERSPOON: No,
I like being an actor.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.460
I really love it.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.390
It's my first love.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.070
I get on set, and
I get all excited.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.920
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
She's so good at it.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.690
REESE WITHERSPOON: I enjoy
it, but I love producing.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.960
And I'm really a big
reader, so I read a ton.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.887
And I kind of have
an eye for what

00:18:20.887 --> 00:18:22.970
is actually going to remain,
and what's cinematic.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.534
Because not every book is--

00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:26.950
things can be
beautifully written,

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.530
but just it's not
going to happen.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.790
And I think those
two things together

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.824
really help create a
successful producing career.

00:18:33.824 --> 00:18:35.365
SPEAKER 1: You should
produce a movie

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:36.910
you star in where
you play a doctor,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.520
and it would satisfy everything.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.270
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
should, you're right.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.520
SPEAKER 1: Be a brain surgeon.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.690
"Thanks, Mom."

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.580
Going back, I guess,
to the casting,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.940
you have two wonderful
children that you cast.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.260
Lola Flanery and
Eden Grace Redfield.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.950
Is it harder to cast
roles for children

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.210
or to cast roles for adults?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.730
And specifically for these
two kids, how did you find it?

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.980
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: It's
really hard to cast children

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.610
because their parents
rehearse it with them.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.807
So it's hard sometimes-- when
I was watching the auditions,

00:19:09.807 --> 00:19:12.390
it would be like they've had a
very specific way of saying it,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.330
and a specific rhythm.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.750
And you feel like you might
have to undo that a lot.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.920
But these two kids,
you could just

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.110
feel that there was
something supernatural--

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:25.260
not supernatural, but
very natural about them.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.760
SPEAKER 1: They
were sort of ghosty.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.468
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Well, the little one

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:31.570
caught my eye, honestly,
because she was Reese's twin.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.820
And we were like, that's
just a little Reese.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.910
And then she happened to have
this fantastic comedic timing

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.840
and be super unique.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.370
And Lola, I really
wanted somebody

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.305
in that part that could play
the comedy of being anxious,

00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:48.430
but you wouldn't actually
be super worried for her.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.170
You just felt like
this was a stage

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.378
she was going to come out of.

00:19:51.378 --> 00:19:54.600
And I think Lola has kind of
an inner happiness to her.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.980
She's very sweet, and then
the sweetness comes through.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.880
And I think they just
both were so natural.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.120
They didn't feel child actory.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.890
SPEAKER 1: And Jon, I
guess your character--

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.520
you and Lola have great
onscreen chemistry.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.980
Were you like that
off the camera, too?

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.870
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah,
we really hit it off.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.370
We would sing Adele a lot.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.880
We were tight.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.760
We all got along.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.370
It was one big family almost
instantaneously, I would say.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.710
Because the guys
actually ended up

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.960
living together during
the making of the movie.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.880
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, they live together.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.210
REESE WITHERSPOON: They
decided when they got cast,

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.418
they would all live together.

00:20:35.565 --> 00:20:38.190
JON RUDNITSKY: You didn't think
that would be such a good idea.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.320
REESE WITHERSPOON:
It was a bad idea.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.450
JON RUDNITSKY: But it
turned out all right.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.680
It did, it turned out OK.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.350
SPEAKER 1: Are you
still speaking now?

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.450
JON RUDNITSKY: Well,
yeah, a little bit.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.260
No, we are.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.670
We're talking, we are, we are.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.330
Well, Nat's busy working
around the globe.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.830
SPEAKER 1: Still
owes you some rent.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.288
JON RUDNITSKY: But
no, we all talk.

00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:54.695
We all love each
other a great deal.

00:20:54.695 --> 00:20:56.070
SPEAKER 1: You
touched on family.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:00.542
I guess the whole cast does
to me seem like a family,

00:21:00.542 --> 00:21:02.250
like we're watching
this family literally

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.885
and figuratively on screen.

00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:07.260
When was the first time that
everybody sat down together,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.051
that everybody met?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.190
Was there one point when
everybody got together?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.565
REESE WITHERSPOON:
The rehearsals

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:15.820
and costume fittings.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.725
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah.

00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:20.100
There's a lot of intertwined
relationships in this movie,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.840
so we did a lot of rehearsals
with the different--

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.087
like Jon and Lola, and then
Jon and Reese, and then

00:21:25.087 --> 00:21:25.670
Reese and Nat.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.740
It's like everyone has
a different relationship

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.380
in this movie, so we all
got together and talked

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.750
about those different dynamics.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.464
I think that's when it
first started jelling.

00:21:35.464 --> 00:21:37.130
SPEAKER 1: When did
you realize that you

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.570
had something
really special that

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.860
was kind of bubbling up here?

00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:44.350
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That's a great question.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.860
I think there was a really
great energy on the set.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.640
It felt like we were
making a feel-good,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.380
I thought, when we
were making the movie.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.100
It had a nice energy.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.860
My mom was the producer, which
added another family element.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.250
It really, literally
was a family.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.010
Reese's kids would come by, and
Jon's parents, and you know,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.840
it was fun.

00:22:09.684 --> 00:22:10.700
Why is that so funny?

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.991
JON RUDNITSKY: I had to work
on my lines with somebody.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.570
The tone of the movie really
matched the tone on set,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.330
honestly.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.090
It really did.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.030
SPEAKER 1: Oh,
that's incredible.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.250
I would have loved to be a
fly in the room, I guess.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.150
You don't do a table read
or anything for the movies,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:27.680
do you?

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.010
For this?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.884
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
think we did, didn't we?

00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.140
Did we do a table read?

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.367
One of y'all came in-- somebody
who was auditioning it goes,

00:22:34.367 --> 00:22:35.700
I read this with all my friends.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.620
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Oh, Nat.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.280
Nat did a table read.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.210
REESE WITHERSPOON: Nat did
his own reading in his house

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.175
with actor friends.

00:22:40.175 --> 00:22:41.300
I was like, that's amazing.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.090
Why didn't you invite any of us?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.950
He was like, well, we all
just debated about this word

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.080
that none of us could say.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.580
And we were like,
what was the word?

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:57.530
He was like, C-H-A-I-S-E.
I was like, oh, "shez."

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.709
And then Jon was like--

00:22:58.709 --> 00:22:59.750
JON RUDNITSKY: "Schwooz."

00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:04.030
REESE WITHERSPOON:
What do you call it?

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.836
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: A "shayz."

00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:06.030
SPEAKER 1: A "shayz."

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.082
A chaise lounge.

00:23:07.082 --> 00:23:07.440
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
was like, it's a "shez."

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.570
And he's like, it's a--

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.990
JON RUDNITSKY: "Schwooz."

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.740
REESE WITHERSPOON: And
she's like, it's a--

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.804
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
It's a "shayz."

00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:14.220
REESE WITHERSPOON: That was
one of the big debates on set.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.340
So every time that
it was in the room,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.752
they'd be like, there's the--

00:23:17.752 --> 00:23:18.960
JON RUDNITSKY: The "schwooz."

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.210
REESE WITHERSPOON: The "shez."

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.790
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: It had
to be a chaise because you

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.250
sleep on it that night.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.070
REESE WITHERSPOON:
That's why it's a "shez."

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.278
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: So you
couldn't sleep on a chair

00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:31.010
that night.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.051
REESE WITHERSPOON: You
know, in the South we call

00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:38.047
it a sofa bed, a pullout couch.

00:23:38.047 --> 00:23:39.130
SPEAKER 1: A sofa bed is--

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.600
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: A
sofa bed is different.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.540
REESE WITHERSPOON: I don't know.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.310
SPEAKER 1: It's
totally different.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.550
Heard

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.518
REESE WITHERSPOON: I don't know.

00:23:43.518 --> 00:23:45.940
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: A
chaise is like a long chair.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.930
REESE WITHERSPOON: Well, it's
definitely not a "shooz."

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.950
JON RUDNITSKY: A "schwooz."

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.160
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Jon is wrong.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.240
That's the only thing I know
about the word "schwooz."

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.906
JON RUDNITSKY: But
you wish I was right.

00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:57.520
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, a chaise
doesn't have a pullout.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.140
That's I guess that's
the difference.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.556
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
You're fancy.

00:24:00.556 --> 00:24:04.300
SPEAKER 1: It's got the little
swoopy arm thing, doesn't it?

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.020
Maybe?

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.980
Am I wrong?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.146
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: It can.

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:08.207
It can have a swoopy arm.

00:24:08.207 --> 00:24:10.540
JON RUDNITSKY: These are the
smartest minds in the world

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.085
right there.

00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:12.565
What is it?

00:24:12.565 --> 00:24:14.190
SPEAKER 1: And we
have random applause.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.240
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: We should
just google it, I guess.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.100
SPEAKER 1: You can Bing it.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.790
You'll get in
trouble here, though.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.996
JON RUDNITSKY:
Nobody's Binging it.

00:24:21.996 --> 00:24:23.910
Not a single person Bings it.

00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:33.051
What Q&amp;A are they
doing right now?

00:24:33.051 --> 00:24:33.550
They're not.

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.802
Just the clown from
"It," and that's it.

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.550
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Him and the balloon.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.133
JON RUDNITSKY: Just
him and a balloon.

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:49.573
And a bunch of scared kids.

00:24:49.573 --> 00:24:50.948
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Any questions?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.600
I kill me.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.170
SPEAKER 1: I'm now picturing
somebody on a stage over there

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.540
with a balloon with a
little face drawn on it.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.890
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: So scary.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.785
SPEAKER 1: OK, so the whole
movie takes place in LA.

00:25:09.785 --> 00:25:11.160
Where did you
actually film this?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.150
Was it actually in LA?

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.890
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yes,
it was actually in LA,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:14.940
on the west side of LA.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.710
And

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.210
SPEAKER 1: Whose house was that?

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.604
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: A
lovely gentleman named Bill.

00:25:20.604 --> 00:25:22.770
JON RUDNITSKY: It used to
be Cindy Crawford's house.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.032
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah, it
kind of a Hollywood history

00:25:24.032 --> 00:25:24.220
in that house.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.900
JON RUDNITSKY: Jennifer
Garner's before that, right?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.090
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.740
I found the house--

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.276
I googled "Spanish houses on
the west side of Los Angeles,"

00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:34.650
because I knew that's where
we wanted to shoot the movie.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.400
And I found it on a
real estate listing.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.930
And we left a note
in their mailbox.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.510
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Is that crazy?

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.380
That stuff doesn't happen.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.580
Ever.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.900
It was really lucky.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.970
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, very lucky.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.640
REESE WITHERSPOON:
It's crazy good luck.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.180
SPEAKER 1: I guess talking
back to the family lineage,

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.810
everything your
parents did, too,

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.174
was set in these massive
just beautiful houses.

00:25:58.174 --> 00:26:00.090
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
They got to build theirs.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.840
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.790
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, back in the heyday

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.344
of the romantic comedy.

00:26:04.344 --> 00:26:05.510
They would build their sets.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.270
So The nice thing about
building your sets

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.100
is when you write a scene, and
you say, she enters this way,

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.090
and he enters this way.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.720
And then you can build that,
and it tells your story

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.892
through the set.

00:26:16.892 --> 00:26:18.600
But what was amazing
about this house was

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.430
I had storyboarded
the whole movie.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.100
And I was so nervous to find
a location because you write

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.139
things-- he fixes this
and this, and they

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:26.180
look through that window.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.805
So I was like, I'm
going I have to find

00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:30.280
a house full of windows.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.010
It's kind of a visual
motif in the movie,

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.551
is people are looking
through windows

00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:35.010
and seeing things happening.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.990
And then I got to this
house, and the windows

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.200
were all in the right places.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.350
I was like, this is it.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.350
This window house.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.220
SPEAKER 1: And it had
a guest house, too?

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.020
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: And it had
a guest house, which was great.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.130
SPEAKER 1: That's crazy.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.050
And so was it empty?

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.890
Did you stage it?

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.065
Or was anything original--
this guy Bill, you said?

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:53.370
Does any of Bill's furniture
make it into the movie?

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:53.600
REESE WITHERSPOON: No.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.390
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
I don't think so.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.440
We fully furnished it.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.790
REESE WITHERSPOON: We
dressed the whole thing.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.081
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Some of
Jennifer Garner's curtains

00:26:59.081 --> 00:27:00.690
are in the movie.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.140
REESE WITHERSPOON: Thanks, Jen.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.869
SPEAKER 1: Does
she get a credit?

00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:05.910
Thanks to Jennifer Garner
for providing curtains?

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.060
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: For
having good taste, yeah.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.226
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I guess so.

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:13.320
Bill wasn't living there.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.790
What happens to the
person when you're

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.225
displacing them for-- how long
did it take to shoot this?

00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:18.300
REESE WITHERSPOON: No,
he doesn't live there.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.740
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
He didn't live there.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.610
REESE WITHERSPOON: He
was about to renovate it.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.130
And I think we got to him right
before he was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.035
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Right before, yeah.

00:27:24.035 --> 00:27:25.590
It was very lucky
that he didn't--

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.140
that's also an unusual thing.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.890
Usually you have to
put that person up

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.104
when you inconvenience
them in such a way,

00:27:31.104 --> 00:27:32.520
but he didn't
actually live there.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.355
I don't know, something in the
stars were aligning for that.

00:27:36.355 --> 00:27:37.980
REESE WITHERSPOON:
It was very special.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.882
JON RUDNITSKY: Supernatural
is what it was.

00:27:39.882 --> 00:27:41.340
SPEAKER 1: Because
It was the kids.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.902
The kids brought it.

00:27:41.902 --> 00:27:42.115
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Like the kids.

00:27:42.115 --> 00:27:43.740
JON RUDNITSKY: Like
the kids, yeah.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.017
SPEAKER 1: How long
were you shooting?

00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:47.600
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
30 days, I think.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.750
SPEAKER 1: You shot the
whole thing in a month?

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.880
REESE WITHERSPOON: Mm-hmm.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.735
SPEAKER 1: Wow, that's crazy.

00:27:55.614 --> 00:27:57.030
REESE WITHERSPOON:
How long do you

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.440
think it takes make a movie?

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.940
SPEAKER 1: I don't know, green
screens and stuff takes like,

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.212
eight months.

00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:04.170
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Actually, when we wrapped,

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.650
my mom was like,
I mean I usually--

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.890
I have five more
months after this.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.319
It was amazing.

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:14.610
REESE WITHERSPOON: I think
a lot of movies are 30 days.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.090
SPEAKER 1: What else?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.380
REESE WITHERSPOON: 30, 35--

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.850
almost every movie
in my entire career.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.742
Movies that don't have monsters
and blasters and aliens.

00:28:24.742 --> 00:28:25.666
Superheroes.

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:29.346
You could actually just shoot
people writing and talking.

00:28:29.346 --> 00:28:31.264
Yeah, it usually takes
about 30 to 40 days.

00:28:31.264 --> 00:28:33.180
SPEAKER 1: With rehearsal
and everything, too?

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.750
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.570
SPEAKER 1: Wow,
that's incredible.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:36.690
I did not know that.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.500
Learned something
new, thank you.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.179
Audience, if you
guys have questions,

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:41.470
there's two mics in the aisles.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.315
You can begin to line up here
and ask anybody anything,

00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:46.440
whatever you would like to.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.020
Oh, yes, we got one already.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.650
Hi.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.780
Hi, guys, thanks for coming.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.330
Before I ask my
question, Jon, I actually

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:02.760
saw your mom perform
stand-up comedy two weeks ago

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.725
at the Comic Strip.

00:29:03.725 --> 00:29:04.710
JON RUDNITSKY: Wow, OK.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.043
AUDIENCE: Yeah, she told a
story about how she messed up

00:29:07.043 --> 00:29:08.430
your camp clothes.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.891
JON RUDNITSKY: This is crazy.

00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:12.765
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
This all sounds amazing.

00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:14.848
REESE WITHERSPOON: This
is great, is what this is.

00:29:14.848 --> 00:29:17.170
JON RUDNITSKY: Do you want
me to comment on that?

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.750
Yeah, my mom--
first of all, my mom

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.670
is 57 and just started
doing stand-up.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.654
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah.

00:29:24.654 --> 00:29:25.570
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That's so great.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.778
REESE WITHERSPOON: Go, Karen.

00:29:26.778 --> 00:29:28.550
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.760
She's going to freak when she
finds out that you asked this.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.480
And yeah, my mom tells
a story about when

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.360
I went to sleepaway camp.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.110
My parents are divorced,
and my dad's very Type A,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.580
and my mom's a total mess.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.750
And my dad called her.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.100
He was like, you put Jon's
name on all the clothes, right?

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.564
You labeled his name
on all the clothes?

00:29:50.564 --> 00:29:52.480
My mom was like, oh yes,
of course, of course.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.890
And she immediately hired
somebody to put the labels on.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.710
But when they were all
done, it said my name

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.830
on the front of everything.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.910
So it was like, down my zipper
and across my hat and stuff.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.370
My mom's whole joke is when
I got back, I was crying.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.670
And I said, I didn't
make any friends,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.460
but everybody knew my name.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.835
AUDIENCE: It got
a lot of laughs.

00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:20.334
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That's amazing.

00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:22.026
AUDIENCE: But my
question is for Reese.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.144
REESE WITHERSPOON:
That was so funny.

00:30:31.144 --> 00:30:33.060
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That was just her opener.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.030
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah,
that was really funny.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.196
JON RUDNITSKY: That's great.

00:30:35.196 --> 00:30:39.530
You should do an open mic at
the Comic Strip with my mom.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.280
AUDIENCE: So I'm also
a really big reader.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.872
In fact, on Pacific
Standard's last movies

00:30:43.872 --> 00:30:46.080
have been my favorite books
from the last five years.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.800
So it's been really exciting.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.250
But my question is,
so how do know--

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.159
I'm a very big believer
that the books are always

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:54.950
better than movies.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.465
But it's been really
enjoyable to watch

00:30:57.465 --> 00:30:59.840
all of my favorite books in
the last couple of years been

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.730
these amazing movies and shows.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.760
So how do you know when
you're reading something

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.310
that this is going to translate
really well to the screen?

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.360
REESE WITHERSPOON: That's
a really good question.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.900
It's a little complicated.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.670
I think because knowing
what people will actually

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.250
buy and turn into a movie.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.560
If it's two sisters during
the French Revolution,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.300
it's just not going
to be a movie.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.110
It's too expensive,
it's too niche.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.240
So I think I try to
find things that are

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.920
universal, kind of relatable.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.540
And my main directive has
just been have a woman

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.550
at the center of it
doing something--

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.870
sort of telling another aspect
of the female experience.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.890
So "Gone Girl" is like, I
don't know, is she psychotic?

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.740
I don't know.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.120
But it's something that took
an idea of the perfect girl

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.680
and kind of flipped
it on its head.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.320
And "Wild," I loved the idea
of a woman versus nature.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.870
Because you see men versus
nature all the time, right?

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.030
And then I never really
thought about what's

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.300
the movie where women are
up against the environment

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.010
by themselves.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.130
So it's just stuff like that,
things that feel fresh and new.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.870
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.040
Over here?

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.500
So Reese, you talked about
the availability of roles

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.420
for men and women.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.439
Over your 20 years
in the industry,

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:19.980
have you seen that
evolve, and do you

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.396
feel like we're
at a point in time

00:32:21.396 --> 00:32:23.640
where there's a lot of
momentum for roles for women?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.744
Or how does that work?

00:32:24.744 --> 00:32:26.160
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Yeah, I mean, I

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.680
think it's a better
time than ever.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.670
But I have to say,
when I started,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.414
it was a good time
for women's movies.

00:32:33.414 --> 00:32:35.080
Women were the stars
of their own movies

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.810
at the time I came up.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.340
I was lucky I got
in a window where

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.381
I made "Legally Blonde"
and "Sweet Home Alabama,"

00:32:40.381 --> 00:32:42.840
and I could be the
lead of a movie.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.230
I think it's harder now,
particularly in movies.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.250
You don't see women being the
star of movies very often.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.530
I've heard people still
say straight to my face.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.410
"We have one movie that has a
woman starring in it this year,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.390
we don't need another one."

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.140
But the great news is with
all these streaming services

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:07.050
and the new platforms, now they
need content more than ever.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.020
And that creates opportunity
for women of all ages, women

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.580
of all color.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.700
So it's really kind of
broadening the spectrum

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.595
and creating more roles.

00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:17.481
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:18.814
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, back over here.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.190
AUDIENCE: I wanted to thank
you guys for being here.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.710
Hallie, you mentioned earlier
that you felt like you

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.320
were making a feel-good movie.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.230
And I feel like we all
need that right now.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.960
So thank you.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.640
And then Reese, I just wanted
to say I was thinking yesterday

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.822
while I was watching
the movie, you're

00:33:40.822 --> 00:33:42.030
one of my favorite actresses.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.821
What would I say if
you were actually here,

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.770
and actually at Google.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.080
And I was thinking
about how you've

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.050
had this history of
performing in "Election,"

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.280
in "Cruel Intentions."

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.400
All these women who are not
just strong but sort of strong

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.299
in ways that people
don't want them to be,

00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:00.090
or don't quite understand,
and that they're

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.540
successful in ways that
don't fit with expectations.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.170
And I think that's sort of
a really interesting message

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.980
for the women in Google
right now, many of whom

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.870
are in roles that people
don't expect them to be in,

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:18.050
or don't quite trust
them to be successful in.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.224
And it's your particular
history of performance

00:34:21.224 --> 00:34:23.570
is an interesting one right now.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.600
And I'm not shocked to see this
many women here in this room

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.540
and screaming for "Legally
Blonde" and Tracy Flick,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.550
although she was left
out of your recitation.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.370
So I just wanted to
thank you for that.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.675
And also, hi, Jon.

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:41.056
Your mom sounds cool.

00:34:41.056 --> 00:34:42.505
REESE WITHERSPOON: Thank you.

00:34:42.505 --> 00:34:43.471
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:43.471 --> 00:34:45.420
Thank you.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.864
JON RUDNITSKY: Sweet.

00:34:47.864 --> 00:34:48.907
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:48.907 --> 00:34:50.406
I feel like I have
so many questions

00:34:50.406 --> 00:34:52.489
to ask Reese, because I
feel like we would be best

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.250
friends if we ever [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.219
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
think we probably would.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:57.927
AUDIENCE: But you
actually said something

00:34:57.927 --> 00:34:59.950
that changed my whole
question dynamic before.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.170
You said there was a script
that you read that was

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.820
really crappy for the woman.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.530
Did that ever get made?

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.830
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Yep, sure did.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.072
Win an Oscar-winning
actress for the part.

00:35:10.072 --> 00:35:10.780
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.180
Are you able to say what movie?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.350
REESE WITHERSPOON: No, I'm not.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.426
JON RUDNITSKY: Did it do well?

00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:16.030
Or that got nominated
for Academy Award?

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.446
REESE WITHERSPOON:
No, it did not.

00:35:17.446 --> 00:35:19.030
I was a terrible movie.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.090
But you know, I've always
had a thing where--

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.519
back to your point
about being a woman who

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:25.810
does sort of unorthodox things.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.640
I turned down so
many parts where--

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.139
I got a lot of opportunity
after "Legally Blonde"

00:35:30.139 --> 00:35:31.930
to play the girlfriend
in superhero movies.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.599
Girlfriend,
girlfriend-- I was like,

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:35.890
why would I be the girlfriend
when I could be the lead?

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.306
I would rather take less money
and be the lead of a movie,

00:35:38.306 --> 00:35:40.720
show a girl that she can be
the center of her own story,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.140
than be a very
wealthy girlfriend.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.520
Because it doesn't
move the needle for me.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.200
And I also had a little
girl when I was 23.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.570
So it kind of shifted
my perspective

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.750
of what do I want
her to see on film.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:59.170
I grew up with Holly Hunter, and
Debra Winger, and Diane Keaton,

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.260
and Meg Ryan.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.890
And those were events for me
when they had movies coming out

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.730
on a Friday night.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:07.540
That's what I wanted to see,
a woman who's figuring it out.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.550
She doesn't know what
the next step of her life

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.390
is going to be.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.761
And I just think that's
what drives me every day.

00:36:12.761 --> 00:36:15.010
That's why I have a mission
just to create those parts

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.890
for myself, for other
women, for female directors

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.680
to have the opportunity to
tell women's perspectives.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.220
Because if we don't see
women's perspectives--

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.170
I mean, we've talked about this.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:28.750
Women in women's films
treat men differently.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.370
The men treat the
women differently.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.350
That's a narrative
that's important.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.670
And I would say the same
thing about women of color,

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.720
women of different generations.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.880
All different perspectives
need to be represented.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.020
And it's just enough.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.260
I've had enough of the same
people telling the same dang

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.580
stories.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.800
If we don't see some
new perspectives,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.630
society can't
change, and we can't

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.190
have different conversations.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.166
And that's how I feel about it.

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:55.958
JON RUDNITSKY: Wow.

00:36:55.958 --> 00:36:58.207
REESE WITHERSPOON: But I
don't really have an opinion.

00:36:58.207 --> 00:36:59.940
JON RUDNITSKY: No,
no, no, not at all.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.486
SPEAKER 1: And thank you to Jon.

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:02.694
JON RUDNITSKY: Also, hi, Jon.

00:37:02.694 --> 00:37:03.998
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:03.998 --> 00:37:05.392
And my mom, whatever.

00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:06.600
REESE WITHERSPOON: And Karen.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.870
JON RUDNITSKY: And
Karen, of course.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:08.930
SPEAKER 1: Back over here.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.721
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.580
My name is Brooke
Taylor, which is actually

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.365
a character in "Legally Blonde."

00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:17.689
Which made me super popular
in fifth grade, so thank you.

00:37:17.689 --> 00:37:19.980
And a question I got to asked
on my first day at Google

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.400
is if I could have lunch
with anyone dead or alive,

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.190
who would it be?

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.200
And I said Elle Woods.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.710
And that made me even more
popular, so thank you.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.810
Thank you very much for
the "Glamour" article.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.275
I'm sure that's been
circulating quite a bit.

00:37:33.275 --> 00:37:34.650
You have a lot of
ambitious women

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.200
in the room who are strong not
because they're strong women,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.590
but because we're women,
and that's what women are.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.340
Can you speak a little
bit to the article,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.927
and just give us some
advice, and even talk

00:37:43.927 --> 00:37:45.510
about how it's been
received if you've

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.862
gotten any sort of feedback?

00:37:46.862 --> 00:37:49.320
REESE WITHERSPOON: Well, thank
you so much for saying that.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.000
I worked really hard
on that article.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.300
I probably did 30
drafts, because I

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.250
think it's really
important what you say.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.650
Probably like,
three years ago, I

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.733
was asked to give a speech
at this "Glamour" event

00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:04.290
about ambition and women,
and why that's considered

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.480
a negative trait in women.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.280
And they did this
study at Columbia

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.050
that identified it as a
negative trait in a coworker,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.200
as a female coworker,
that she's seen

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.030
as selfish or self-serving.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.360
And I thought, why has
become such a negative thing?

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.320
I was always ambitious,
even as a little girl.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.140
I didn't know you were
supposed to hide it.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.300
So there's a new
Harvard study that women

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.760
who are seen as a vicious
hide it if they're single.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.550
That just drove me up a
wall, because I thought,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.320
run away from anybody
who doesn't like

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.780
your ambition, particularly
a guy or a partner.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.560
Because it should be encouraged.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.290
And it's not the
self-serving thing.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.100
It's like most women who are
ambitious have a bigger goal.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.910
We're community leaders,
we're strong family leaders,

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.910
we can change a lot and
create a lot of change.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.990
But we're stymied
because of this stigma

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.949
around being ambitious.

00:38:55.949 --> 00:38:57.489
I think it's why a
lot of women don't

00:38:57.489 --> 00:38:59.260
run for office, because
we look at women

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.464
and go, of course
she wants to win.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.380
Why shouldn't she win?

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.065
She's probably going to help us.

00:39:05.065 --> 00:39:06.440
And I think we
have to change it.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.856
We have to start
talking about it.

00:39:07.856 --> 00:39:10.350
And I've had a lot of response
from men at big companies

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.750
who wrote me and said, I never
thought about it that way.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.950
And I've heard women talked
about in boardrooms and stuff

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.280
as, boy, she's climbing.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.181
And he goes, I'm going to
change the conversation.

00:39:21.181 --> 00:39:22.680
You're talking about
your daughters.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.300
You're talking
about your sisters.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.080
We need women.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.150
We're 50% of the population.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.522
We're 50% of the change.

00:39:29.522 --> 00:39:30.480
AUDIENCE: Amen, sister.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.521
REESE WITHERSPOON: But I
don't have any opinions.

00:39:36.694 --> 00:39:38.130
AUDIENCE: Over here.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.140
SPEAKER 1: My question
is also for Reese.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.852
It's about "Big Little Lies."

00:39:41.852 --> 00:39:44.060
I'm actually born and raised
in Monterey, California.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.310
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh my gosh.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.260
AUDIENCE: I know, it's rare.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.470
And I wanted to ask
you about the decision

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.060
to change the
setting of that book

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.820
to Monterey, because it feels
really important to the story.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.400
So why Monterey?

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.474
Why that story in particular?

00:39:58.474 --> 00:40:00.390
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh,
that's a good question,

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.330
because it's set in
Sydney, Australia.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:08.542
The writer set it there, and
we decided to Americanize it.

00:40:08.542 --> 00:40:09.750
Because I wanted to be in it.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.480
So there's that, and I do a
terrible Australian accent.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.240
And then Monterey
because we wanted

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.700
it to be in a coastal
town that wasn't

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.160
Los Angeles, because that
has its own identity.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.480
The writer was--

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.690
David Kelley is from that
area, and lived in that area.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.090
And the director,
Jean-Marc Vallee,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.770
wanted to use
water as a metaphor

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:37.440
for the dark,
mysterious unknown that

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.009
lies inside of us, the secrets
that lie underneath the calm.

00:40:41.009 --> 00:40:42.550
I don't know if you
all have seen it,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.640
but the last episode
is you see why

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.070
he's always filming the ocean.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.885
So yeah, it's a metaphor.

00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:49.760
SPEAKER 1: Wonderful.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.100
Yeah?

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.060
JON RUDNITSKY:
That's really cool.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys,
thank you for being here.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.300
I'm Katie.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.070
So my question is a little
interactive in nature.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.540
Reese, it's directed
towards you,

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.228
but I would love it if you could
maybe use Jon as your student.

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:05.722
REESE WITHERSPOON: OK.

00:41:05.722 --> 00:41:07.720
JON RUDNITSKY: Wow, all right.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.050
AUDIENCE: So as I'm sure
you guys have heard,

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.990
as well as a lot of us in
this room have experienced,

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.285
dating in New York is
notoriously pretty tough.

00:41:15.285 --> 00:41:16.451
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh, gosh.

00:41:19.397 --> 00:41:25.231
AUDIENCE: A girl or a guy
could use all the help

00:41:25.231 --> 00:41:25.980
that we could get.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.350
So I was wondering
if you would be

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:31.230
able to give us all a
refresher on the bend

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:38.976
and snap from "Legally Blonde."

00:41:38.976 --> 00:41:41.253
Maybe using Jon as your student.

00:41:41.253 --> 00:41:42.669
REESE WITHERSPOON:
OK, you want me

00:41:42.669 --> 00:41:43.960
to teach Jon the bend and snap?

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.672
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:44.672 --> 00:41:46.130
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Well, first, you

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.180
have to know why
you're doing it.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.435
JON RUDNITSKY: Sure.

00:41:47.435 --> 00:41:49.160
REESE WITHERSPOON: You're trying
to get someone's attention.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.860
JON RUDNITSKY:
Right, motivation.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.068
REESE WITHERSPOON: OK, right.

00:41:51.068 --> 00:41:53.804
So you pretend that you dropped
something on the ground.

00:41:53.804 --> 00:41:54.221
JON RUDNITSKY: Uh-oh.

00:41:54.221 --> 00:41:55.804
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Uh-oh, there it is.

00:41:55.804 --> 00:41:59.880
And so then you lean
forward like this.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.850
And then you snap.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:03.350
Yes.

00:42:06.254 --> 00:42:07.222
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:07.222 --> 00:42:08.597
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Good job, Jon.

00:42:08.597 --> 00:42:10.391
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Well done.

00:42:10.391 --> 00:42:11.390
JON RUDNITSKY: The paws.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.080
REESE WITHERSPOON: The paws.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.121
JON RUDNITSKY: Oh my god.

00:42:15.746 --> 00:42:19.215
AUDIENCE: I don't know how
I follow that question.

00:42:19.215 --> 00:42:20.840
We've talked a lot
about the importance

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.510
of having really powerful,
strong female characters

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.910
represented in the
narratives we tell on screen.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.794
But there's so much
work that goes in--

00:42:27.794 --> 00:42:29.960
whether that's on the part
of producers, or writers,

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.480
or cameramen-- on the
back side of things

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.300
to make those characters
appear onscreen.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.090
What advice do you have for--

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.590
there are lots of
creatives that are

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:42.530
at Google who, outside of our
9:00 to 5:00, are like myself,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.590
or screenwriters, or work on the
production side or the editing

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.430
side.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.407
What advice do you
have for trying

00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:50.990
to get your material in front
of the right eyes in an industry

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:55.770
where there are so many barriers
to entry, especially for women?

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.080
REESE WITHERSPOON: Do
you want to take that?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.380
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Well,
I mean, in my opinion,

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.880
the best way to get
your content out

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.040
there is A, to have a
very original voice,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.010
and to not be afraid to
tell your specific story.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.540
Because then it feels very you.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.030
And I think, like
Reese mentioned,

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.450
it's a really good time to be
a content creator, I think,

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.550
because there's
so many platforms.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.930
So I think just not being
afraid to cold email people,

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:23.880
send your material out there.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.710
I mean, I know it's
idealistic, but I

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.330
am a big believer
in good material

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.160
gets found and gets
recognized, you know?

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.535
And like Reese
mentioned, there's

00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:33.300
not a lot of strong
roles for women.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.120
And so if you are,
I hope, writing

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.880
those kinds of characters, I
think it will be recognized.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.690
And from YouTube, to
Amazon, to Netflix,

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.610
I think all of these places
have their own content now.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.560
I don't know if
we're-- or Google.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.825
Wherever you want to
send your material to.

00:43:51.825 --> 00:43:52.783
SPEAKER 1: YouTube Red.

00:43:52.783 --> 00:43:54.870
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Yeah, YouTube, yeah.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.992
So I mean, that
would be my advice.

00:43:56.992 --> 00:43:58.950
REESE WITHERSPOON: And
just start making stuff.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.180
Don't get stuck.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.310
Even if you make a
short with your friends,

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.330
or you get everybody
together on a weekend

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.340
and make a short film,
you're getting actual film

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.240
and experience under your
belt. And there are so many--

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.300
New York Film Festival has a new
program for female directors.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.280
Warner Brothers is
doing a pilot program

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.740
for female screenwriters that
want to be directors that--

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.220
you write a 10-minute
short and submit it.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.990
There's a lot of
those kinds of things.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.020
And yeah, you just start making.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.995
But don't get stuck.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.980
I don't know, I just see a lot
of creative people get stuck.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.840
And it's good sometimes
to work in a group,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.506
too, because it pushes
you out the door.

00:44:38.506 --> 00:44:39.500
You have a partner.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.080
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah, yeah, and
when I was first starting out,

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.770
YouTube was how I--

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.380
I mean, that's how
I got my agent,

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.770
was from making
sketches with buddies.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.409
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That's great.

00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:52.200
And I think it is--

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.060
I mean, even though
the statistics

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.540
are terrible about
being a female director,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.850
I do think, because of
people like Lena Dunham,

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:04.750
people think that young women
might be great at what they do.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.500
And I think she's paved the
way for a lot of young women

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.580
for people to recognize.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.120
I do think it is, in
some ways, a good time

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.726
to be a female content creator.

00:45:15.726 --> 00:45:16.674
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:16.674 --> 00:45:17.340
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.010
I looked down and looked up,
and there's 5 million people

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.550
asking questions again.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.545
Yeah, Molly, hey.

00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:25.050
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Molly.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.890
Super excited that
you're here, all of you.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.615
Thank you.

00:45:27.615 --> 00:45:29.810
So my question is for
Reese, I think you can--

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.595
Hallie and Jon, you
can both answer it.

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:34.020
Reese, you've done so
many different movies,

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.220
different genres, production
company, Draper James.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:38.940
What's next?

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.824
What is one thing
you'd love to do?

00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:42.490
And Jon and Hallie,
what's next for you?

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.114
What's your next big
project, something

00:45:44.114 --> 00:45:46.577
you would like to
do outside the box?

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.160
REESE WITHERSPOON: Well, I just
extended my production company

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.000
into digital and
mobile programming.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.960
So I'm going to be capable of
making more short-form content,

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.480
because I do think that's
the first step to finding

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.350
new female voices.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.810
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
That's great.

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:02.710
I mean, I don't know if I'm
doing anything outside the box.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.480
But I'm definitely going to keep
trying to do what I did here

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.350
and make comedies,
which seem to be

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.090
fewer and further between now.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.880
And put women at the
forefront of them.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.160
So yeah, more of the same.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:16.671
Jon?

00:46:16.671 --> 00:46:18.920
JON RUDNITSKY: I'm working
on the show with my writing

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.010
partner for Comedy
Central at the moment.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:26.790
And then I'd like to do more
good movies, keep working.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:27.440
It'd be nice.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.240
This is my first, really.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.380
Our first.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.689
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.730
SPEAKER 1: We have time
for a few more questions.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.260
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you all for being here.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.860
So today there is an article
in the "New York Times"

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.960
about Rotten Tomatoes.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.420
Basically, there's a bunch
of people in Hollywood

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.260
who are putting blame on
Rotten Tomatoes for movies

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.850
not doing well.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.130
Basically saying when
these reviews come out

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.380
and they get an
aggregated score,

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.690
that kind of predicts movies not
doing well at the box office.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.300
If the critics are
saying it's bad

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.630
and it's surfaced on
different sites like Fandango,

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.590
or even when you search
a movie on Google,

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.540
which is relevant
to all of us here.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.586
So I'm curious what you think
about that, if that really

00:47:09.586 --> 00:47:11.210
is something that's
relevant, if that's

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:14.334
something we can lay blame for.

00:47:14.334 --> 00:47:16.250
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: I
don't know about blame.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.280
I mean, I think Rotten Tomatoes
is owned by Fandango, I think.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.060
So it's one and the same.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.030
You know, for me, I think
it's a part of the equation.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.350
But I don't think the actual
audience cares that much

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:30.920
about it.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.980
And I think Rotten
Tomatoes is largely men.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.160
So we made a movie
about a woman,

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.859
and so I don't know that
they are necessarily--

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:40.400
I don't know.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.450
For me, I wouldn't look at it.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.700
I wouldn't judge a film by it.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:48.607
But I am aware that it
is a big part of things.

00:47:48.607 --> 00:47:50.690
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think more men look

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:51.690
at the scores, too.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.596
Like, my boyfriend
would say, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:53.596 --> 00:47:54.720
And I'd be like, who cares?

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.837
REESE WITHERSPOON:
They've gamified art.

00:47:56.837 --> 00:47:57.920
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Yeah.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.430
REESE WITHERSPOON:
I think it does

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.012
have an effect in
certain capacities.

00:48:00.012 --> 00:48:01.970
If there's something
people really want to see,

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:02.969
they're going to see it.

00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:06.070
But I think it can drive a
movie that might be on a bubble

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.090
to people waiting till later.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:12.357
And certain movies like this,
we're coming on the box office.

00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:14.190
We need people to show
up and see the movie.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.640
And if you want more movies
with women at the center,

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.650
you have to show up
and buy the tickets.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:22.100
It's hard.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.960
It's data that the
studios look at.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.210
And they think, oh, well,
that one didn't do good,

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.170
and this one didn't.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.330
So they don't make more of
them It's just a numbers game.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.600
But I will say we need--

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.220
Ann Patchett wrote
this amazing essay

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.640
about like, don't let other
people make your judgments

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.840
for you, you know?

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.722
Have your own opinions about
art, and books, and music.

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:47.590
I hate-- I have a 14-year-old
son, and he's be like, well,

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:48.880
I heard it's not good.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.370
And I'm like, yeah, but
who did you hear it from?

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:53.260
And maybe you guys don't
have the same taste,

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.385
and maybe you're not
interested in the same things.

00:48:55.385 --> 00:48:58.240
So I really encourage people out
there, form your own opinions,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.515
have something to talk about.

00:48:59.515 --> 00:49:00.604
See movies.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.770
I loved seeing movies and
having a different opinion

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:06.509
than other people, because
that's what makes you you.

00:49:06.509 --> 00:49:08.050
And we've taken that
out a little bit

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.230
by reading too many reviews, or
listening to too many people's

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.390
opinions on Twitter and stuff.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.512
I think.

00:49:14.512 --> 00:49:15.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.420
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.000
Probably two more questions.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.850
Yeah.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Chloe.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.550
So all this talk about
this quote-unquote

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.861
"strong female character"
got me thinking.

00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:28.360
This is a question
mostly for Reese,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.318
but I would love to hear
Hallie's thoughts too,

00:49:30.318 --> 00:49:31.390
if you have any.

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.100
Obviously I love
"Legally Blonde,"

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.010
but one of my favorite movies
of yours actually is "Freeway."

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:42.220
I was thinking about
the how a lot of people

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.580
see women in action movies,
and how just a woman punching

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.250
someone or shooting someone
can be just enough for people

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.410
to give them the strong
female character label.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.150
But obviously
there's like-- you've

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.580
been doing so many
romcoms, and comedies,

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.504
and "Big Little Lies."

00:49:55.504 --> 00:49:56.920
And I was wondering
what you think

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:02.710
of the difference in value of
a strong woman in a comedy,

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:06.550
versus like a family drama,
versus an action movie,

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.350
like "Freeway," or
some more recent ones,

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.790
like "Mad Max" and
"Atomic Blonde."

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:15.470
REESE WITHERSPOON: All of
those genres are great.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.770
And I think more
that like looking

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.980
for strong or weak, and
look, I answer that question,

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.035
because I think of myself
as a strong person.

00:50:23.035 --> 00:50:26.260
But I'm just looking for
complexity, because women just

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.190
aren't good or bad.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.610
There's this whole rainbow
of other things in between,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:31.435
you know?

00:50:31.435 --> 00:50:36.370
They're complex, and confused,
and contemplating things.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:41.140
And some of them are just
plain strange, I don't know.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.060
I want to see every
color of the rainbow.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.800
I don't want to just see--

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.757
I don't know, sometimes I think
you just get watered down.

00:50:47.757 --> 00:50:49.840
It gets watered down because
they don't understand

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.298
the complexity of
the female brain,

00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:54.734
because you're not
a woman writing it.

00:50:54.734 --> 00:50:55.600
Yeah.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.500
What do you think?

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:56.950
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
I don't know.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.230
I mean, I don't see a
ton of action movies.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:03.670
It's just not, as an audience
member, my favorite genre.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.250
But I do think sometimes
the women in those movies

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.220
are considered strong because
they're acting like men.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.760
And for me, the characters
that have meant most to me,

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.176
the ones that Reese
has portrayed,

00:51:13.176 --> 00:51:16.060
are strong because they're
complex, and they're real.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.980
There's something
real about them.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.438
I don't think you see a woman
in an action movie and think,

00:51:20.438 --> 00:51:21.520
that's me.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.237
I'm just like her
in "Atomic Blonde."

00:51:24.237 --> 00:51:26.320
Even though it can be super
entertaining and great

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.600
to watch, for me,
it's the relatability

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.880
of a character that--

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.190
if you see Reese on
screen being strong,

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.170
and she's going
through separation,

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.580
that might give you--

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.690
I can do it, too.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.150
And I think that's, for me,
where the strength comes

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.890
from on screen.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.926
SPEAKER 1: Jon, do you
have a favorite genre?

00:51:44.926 --> 00:51:45.760
JON RUDNITSKY: Favorite genre?

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.945
SPEAKER 1: Movie genre?

00:51:46.945 --> 00:51:48.000
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: You know
the right answer to that,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.500
right?

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.650
JON RUDNITSKY: Not really.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:54.770
I'm not really into
superhero action movies.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:52:01.430
I do like smaller stories,
typically, but drama or comedy.

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.510
I just finished "Ozark."

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.090
I thought that was real good.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:04.850
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh,
that's really good.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:06.440
JON RUDNITSKY:
Really good, yeah.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.454
Something like that's--

00:52:07.454 --> 00:52:08.495
SPEAKER 1: Cool with you?

00:52:08.495 --> 00:52:08.990
JON RUDNITSKY: Yeah.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.865
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:52:09.865 --> 00:52:11.697
So we have time for
one more question here.

00:52:11.697 --> 00:52:12.530
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.654
So first of all, thank you.

00:52:13.654 --> 00:52:16.712
"Cruel Intentions,"
favorite movie of all time.

00:52:16.712 --> 00:52:18.170
So that's part of
working at Google

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:19.730
is our colleagues
are incredible,

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.600
and half of my meetings I'm
just in awe at how talented

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.190
the people are in the room.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:28.910
So I was curious about who you
guys have worked with where

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.490
you've had that moment of
like, oh my god, this person is

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:32.800
so impressive.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.355
Who's the most impressive
actor that you've worked with?

00:52:36.355 --> 00:52:39.640
Outside of Jon, obviously.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.616
REESE WITHERSPOON: I
mean, Jon Rudnitsky.

00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:42.657
JON RUDNITSKY: Thank you.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.410
REESE WITHERSPOON: Gosh,
I've worked with some really

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:52.590
amazing, talented people.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:54.680
But isn't a great that
you can be around people,

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.610
and you're like, wow.

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.230
And the great thing
about movies is

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.230
it's a collaborative experience.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.390
This movie was amazing.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.015
We had so much fun, and I loved
working with all these people.

00:53:04.015 --> 00:53:05.390
I'm trying to
think of one person

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.330
that I was like, oh my god,
this person is so incredible.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.830
AUDIENCE: Or maybe
super intimidated

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.920
when you found out they were--

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.525
you're like, I got this, but--

00:53:13.525 --> 00:53:16.108
REESE WITHERSPOON: Oh, I got to
work with Jack Nicholson once,

00:53:16.108 --> 00:53:18.801
and I could barely speak.

00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.050
And it got to his close-up,
and he was standing there.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:22.550
And I just kept inching into it.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.730
So he goes, hey, kid,
get out of my close-up.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.400
Because I'm a leaner.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.380
I tend to lean on people I like.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.450
He's like, get away from me.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.074
But I was pretty
starstruck about that.

00:53:37.074 --> 00:53:39.130
That was pretty cool, yeah.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.130
SPEAKER 1: That's funny.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:42.144
Jon, I guess on SNL,
too, you've had a lot

00:53:42.144 --> 00:53:43.310
of people coming through it.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.560
Have you experienced
anything similar?

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.080
JON RUDNITSKY: Well, I mean,
obviously on this movie,

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.880
getting to work with
these ladies and Nancy.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:59.810
At SNL, specifically Larry
David is my comedy hero.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:02.689
So getting to work with
him was pretty awesome.

00:54:02.689 --> 00:54:03.730
SPEAKER 1: See the movie.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.773
It comes out in theaters
tomorrow, September 8.

00:54:06.773 --> 00:54:09.188
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:10.654 --> 00:54:12.570
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER:
Such excellent questions.

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.670
REESE WITHERSPOON: Yeah,
can I say thank you?

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:14.711
You guys have been great.

00:54:14.711 --> 00:54:15.550
That was so fun.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.542
This was awesome.

00:54:16.542 --> 00:54:18.250
SPEAKER 1: Help me
thank them for coming.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:18.850
Thank you.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.150
JON RUDNITSKY: So funny.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:24.600
REESE WITHERSPOON:
That was awesome.
