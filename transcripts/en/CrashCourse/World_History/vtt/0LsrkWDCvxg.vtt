Hi there my name’s John Green; this is Crash
Course World History, and today we’re gonna

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.930
talk about Alexander the Great, but to do
that we’re going to begin by talking about

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.379
ideals of masculinity and heroism and Kim
Kardashian and the Situation.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.289
Mr Green, Mr Green, Mr. Green! Which Situation?

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.270
Oh, Me from the Past, I forgot you wanted
to go to Columbia. Me from the Present regrets

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.420
to inform you that you do not get in.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.300
But since you live in the past, you have no
way of knowing who I’m talking about, and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.940
it occurs to me that this video may be watched
in some glorious future when Kim Kardashian

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.290
and the Situation have mercifully disappeared
from public life, and the supermarket tabloids,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.649
instead of talking about celebrities, talk
about Foucault and the Higgs-Boson particle,

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.989
so Kim Kardashian is a professional famous
person who rose to notoriety by skoodilypooping

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.890
with someone named Ray Jay, and Mike “The
Situation” I forgot his last name is a professional

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.540
stupid person with big muscles. They’re
both known by millions, lives in luxury, and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.160
people literally pay to own their odors.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.290
Why do these people crave fame? Why do any
of us? Well, I’d argue it’s not about

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.239
money. If it were, our tabloids would be devoted
to the lives and times of bankers. I think

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.519
we all want to leave a legacy. We want to
be remembered. We want to be Great.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.580
[theme music]

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.300
For a long time, history was all about the
Study of Great Men, and it was common to call

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.219
people as “the Great,” but these days
historians are less likely to do that, because

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.159
they recognize that one man’s Great is generally
another man’s Terrible.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.590
And also “the Great” has some misogynistic
implications, like, it’s almost always men

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.649
who are called "the Great". You never hear
about Cleopatra the Great or Elizabeth the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.849
Great. There was, of course, Catherine the
Great of Russia, but for her masculine Greatness

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.119
she was saddled with the completely untrue
rumor that she died trying to skoodilypoop

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.979
with a horse. Saddled? Get it? Anybody? Saddled
with the rumor?

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.880
Anyway, they could’ve soiled Catherine the
Great’s name just by telling the truth:

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.660
which is that like so many other Great men
and women, she died on the toilet. Get it?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.620
soiled? Toilet? Yes? Yes!

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.880
So, quick biography of Alexander of Macedon,
born in 356 BCE, died in 323 BCE at the ripe

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:11.300
old age of 32. Alexander was the son of King
Philip the 2nd, and when just 13 years old

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.380
he tamed a horse no one else could ride named
Bucephalus, which impressed his father so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.910
much he said: “Oh thy son, look thee at
a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.810
for Macedonia is too little for thee.”

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.340
By that time, he was already an accomplished
general, but over the next decade he expanded

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.400
his empire with unprecedented speed and he
is famous for having never lost a battle. Today we’re

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.540
going to look at Alexander of Macedon’s story
by examining three possible definitions of greatness.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.700
First, maybe Alexander was great because of
his accomplishments. This is an extension

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.700
of the idea that history is the record of
the deeds of great men. Now, of course, that’s

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.030
ridiculous. For one thing, half of people
are women; for another, and this is important,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.240
there are lots of historic events that no one can take
responsibility for, like for instance the Black Plague.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.780
But still, Alexander was accomplished. I mean,
he conquered a lot of territory. Like, a lot.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.850
His father, Philip, had conquered all of Greece,
but Alexander did what the Spartans and Athenians

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.540
had failed to do: He destroyed the Persian
Empire. He conquered all the land the Persians

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.620
had held including Egypt, and then marched
toward India, stopping at the Indus River

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.820
only because his army was like, “Hey, Alexander,
you know what would be awesome? Not marching.”

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.950
Also, Alexander was a really good general,
although historians disagree over whether

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.319
his tactics were truly brilliant or if his
army just happened to have better technology,

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.069
specifically these extra long spears called
sarissas. Much of his reputation as a general,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.580
and his reputation in general, anybody? Puns?
Maybe I should stop? OK. Is because of Napoleon.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.819
Napoleon, like many other generals through
the Millennia, was obsessed with Alexander

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.750
the Great, but more on that in a moment.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.510
That said, Alexander wasn’t very good at
what we might now call empire-building. Alexander’s

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.319
empire was definitely visually impressive,
but it wasn’t actually much of an empire.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.000
Like, Alexander specialized in the tearing
down of things, but he wasn’t so great at

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.319
the building up of institutions to replace
the things he’d torn down. And that’s

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.569
why, pretty soon after his death, his Empire
broke into three empires, called the Hellenistic

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.760
Kingdoms. Each was ruled by one of Alexander’s
generals, and they became important dynasties.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.650
The Antigones in Greece and Macedonia, the
Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Persia,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.269
all of which lasted longer than Alexander’s
empire itself.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.279
A Second Greatness: Maybe Alexander was Great
because he had an enormous impact on the world

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:29.879
after his death. Like King Tut, Alexander
the Great was amazingly good at being a dead

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.900
person. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.660
So, After Alexander of Macedon died, everyone
from the Romans to Napoleon to Oliver Stone

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.180
loved him, and he was an important military
model for many generals throughout history.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.499
But his main post-death legacy may be that
he introduced the Persian idea of Absolute

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.789
Monarchy to the Greco-Roman world, which would
become a pretty big deal.

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.029
Alexander also built a number of cities on
his route that became big deals after his

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:59.819
death, and it’s easy to spot them because
he named most of them after himself and one

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.939
after his horse. The Alexandria in Egypt became
a major center of learning in the classical

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:10.569
world, and was home to the most amazing library
ever, which Julius Caesar probably “accidentally”

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.749
burned down while trying to conquer a bunch
of land to emulate his hero, Alexander the Great.

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.800
Plus, the dead Alexander had a huge impact
on culture. He gave the region its common

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.139
language, Greek, which facilitated conversations
and commerce. Greek was so widespread that

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.719
archaeologists have found coins in what is
now Afghanistan with pictures of their kings

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.180
and the word “king” written beneath the
pictures — in Greek. This is also why, incidentally,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.159
the New Testament was eventually written in
Greek.

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.719
Although Alexander was mostly just conquering
territory for the glory and heroism and greatness

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.189
of it all, in his wake emerged a more closely
connected world that could trade and communicate

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.559
with more people more efficiently than ever
before. Alexander didn’t make those things

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.449
happen, but they probably wouldn’t have
happened without him.

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.319
But here’s a question: If you’re watching
Jersey Shore and get so involved in The Situations

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.789
romantic conquest that you leave the bath
water running, thereby flooding your apartment,

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.509
and you have to call a plumber, and the plumber
comes over and you fall in love with him and

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.689
get married and live happily ever after, does
that make The Situation responsible for your

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.120
marriage? Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.580
Okay, a third definition of greatness: Maybe
Alexander is great because of his legend:

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:21.039
Since no accounts of his life were written
while he lived, embellishment was easy, and

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.789
maybe that’s where true greatness lies.
I mean the guy died at 32, before he ever

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.520
had a chance to get old and lose battles.
He was tutored by Aristotle, for God’s sakes.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.759
Then there’s Alexander’s single-minded
Ahab-esque pursuit of the Persian King Darius,

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.059
who he chased across modern-day Iraq and Iran
for no real reason except he desperately wanted

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:44.759
to kill him, and when Bessus, one of Darius’s
generals, assassinated him before Alexander

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.620
had the chance, Alexander chased Bessus around
until he could at least kill him.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.119
These almost-comical pursuits of glory and
heroism are accompanied in classical histories

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:59.099
by stories of Alexander walking through the
desert, and then suddenly raining, and these

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.889
ravens coming to lead him to the army he’s
supposed to fight, and stories of his hot

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.309
Persian wife Roxana, who supposedly while
still a teenager engineered the assassinations

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:10.419
of many of Alexander’s fellow wives.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.449
And even at his death, people tried to make
Alexander live up to this heroic ideal. Like,

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:19.550
Plutarch tells us that he died of a fever,
but that’s no way for a masculine, empire-building,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.599
awesome person to die! So rumors persist that
he died either of alcohol poisoning or else

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.949
of assassination-y poisoning. I mean, no great
man can die of a fever. Speaking of Great

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.490
Men, it’s time to strip down for the Open
Letter.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.770
So elegant. But first let’s see what’s
in the Secret Compartment today. Oh. It’s

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:47.229
Kim Kardashian’s perfume. Thanks Stan. I’ll
wear this. I’ll check it out, I’ll give

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:53.379
it a try. C’ah. Wow. That is... mmm... it’s
like all the worst parts of baby powder and

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:56.889
all the worst parts of cat pee. An Open Letter
to the Ladies.

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:58.380
Hello, Ladies,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.820
You’ve really been unfairly neglected in
Crash Course World History and also in World

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:06.009
History textbooks everywhere. Like, there
will be a whole chapter exploring the exploits

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:10.409
of great men and then at the end there will
be one sentence that’s like “also women

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:14.979
were doing stuff at the time and it was important,
but we don’t really know what it was, so

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:16.919
back to Alexander the Great…”

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.599
History has been very good at marginalizing
and demeaning women and we’re going to fight

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:26.469
against that as we move forward in the story
of human civilization. Ladies, I have to go

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:30.119
now because my eyes are stinging from the
biological weapon known as Kim Kardashian’s

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.639
Gold. Seriously, don’t wear it.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.300
Best wishes, John Green

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.890
So in Alexander the Great we have a story
about a man who united the world while riding

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.380
a magical horse only he could tame across
deserts where it magically rained for him

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.340
so that he could chase down his mortal enemy
and then leave in his wake a more enlightened

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.810
world and a gorgeous, murderous wife.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.660
But of course it’s not just Assassin’s
Creed and Call of Duty that celebrate the

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.630
idea that ennobled violence can lead to a
better world. And that takes us to my opinion

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.870
of how Alexander really came to be Great.
Millennia after his death in 1798, Napoleon

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.770
invaded Egypt, not because he particularly
needed to invade Egypt but because he wanted

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.630
to do what Alexander had done.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.700
And long before Napoleon, the Romans really
worshipped Alexander, particularly the Roman

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.590
General Pompey, AKA Pompeius Magnus, AKA Pompey
the Great. Pompey was so obsessed with Alexander

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.350
that he literally tried to emulate Alexander’s
boyishly disheveled hair style.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.990
In short, Alexander was Great because others
decided he was Great. Because they chose to

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.570
admire and emulate him. Yes, Alexander was
a great general. Yes, he conquered a lot of

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.350
land. The Situation is also really good at
picking up girls... of a certain type. And

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.100
Kim Kardashian is good at- Stan, what is Kim
Kardashian good at?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.620
We made Alexander Great, just as today we
make people great when we admire them and

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.370
try to emulate them. History has traditionally
been in the business of finding and celebrating

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.960
great men, and only occasionally great women,
but this obsession with Greatness is troubling

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.310
to me. It wrongly implies, first, history
is made primarily by men and secondly, that

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.230
history is made primarily by celebrated people,
which of course makes us all want to be celebrities.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.410
Thankfully, we’ve left behind the idea that
the best way to become an icon is to butcher

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.540
people and conquer a lot of land, but the
ideals that we’ve embraced instead aren’t

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.960
necessarily worth celebrating either. All
of which is to say we decide what to worship

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.450
and what to care about and what to pay attention
to. We decide whether to care about The Situation.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.700
Alexander couldn’t make history in a vacuum,
and neither can anyone else. Thanks for watching.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.600
I’ll see you next week.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.940
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller; the show is written by my high school

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.790
history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself. Our
script supervisor is Danica Johnson, and our

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.400
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.540
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Thinly
Sliced Trees". If you want to take a guess

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.920
at this week’s phrase or suggest new ones you
can do so in comments. If you have questions about

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.600
today’s video you can also ask those in comments
and our team of historians will attempt to answer them.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.540
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as they
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
