00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.638
Let's Roast!
{ding ding ding}

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.673
- Nicole used to be
a competitive skier.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:11.044
That's why she's so good
at taking double blacks.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.579
[groans and laughter]

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:17.917
- Uh, Andy was molested
as a young schoolboy.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.587
He graduated top of his class
and bottom of his teacher.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.423
[groans and applause]

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.158
- It was my babysitter,

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.427
and at least I got something
out of a hookup.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.861
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.696
- Nicole fucked the booker
at the Comedy Store,

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.198
and the only thing
she got on the wall

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.767
was her face
pressed against it.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.537
[crowd exclaims]

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.406
<i> - I'm so sorry.</i>

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.709
- Andy looks like a slave owner
who would be really bummed

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:46.345
if his slaves didn't want
to hang out with him.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.315
[laughter]

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.921
- That's not
how slaves work.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.857
They don't have a choice.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.692
- Whoa!
- Last joke.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.461
- You guys, Nicole's
actually pretty excited

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.029
about the Trump win,

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.298
because when he starts deporting
illegal immigrants,

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.333
she'll get more shifts
at the Costco

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.335
she passes samples out at.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.637
- Andy just hates Costco

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.774
'cause his ex-wife was
fucking guys in bulk.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.744
[laughter]

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.884
Andy and his ex-wife had
an open marriage.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.855
That's a hipster term for,
"I can't make my wife come."

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.723
[laughter]

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.858
<i> [glass shatters]</i>

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.459
- That'll do it, everybody.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.161
That's the last battle
of the night.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.395
Make it loud!

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.999
Nicole.
Andy.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.367
[cheers and applause]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.369
Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.371
- A lot of dirty laundry aired
in this one.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.173
- Definitely the vicious battle
of the night.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.508
Give it up for these two.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.675
- Yeah.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:52.478
[cheers and applause]
- So funny.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.714
- That was great.
Andy is super funny.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.016
I think--he's my homey,
and his standup is so funny,

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.885
but I thought
you cleaned him out, Nicole.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.087
I thought
you took him all the way.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.488
Yeah, no doubt, yeah.

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.056
Sorry.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.425
I mean, it was funny.
Both of them were funny.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.494
Some good jokes--
double blacks was really funny.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:11.130
But I thought that, Nicole,
every one was--

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.932
it was that fire,
and I'm not just saying that

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.233
as another Jew.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.768
I'm saying that
as a fan of you.

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.470
- Love Jew.
Love Jew.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.305
- Although it does not help

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:23.109
that Andy looks like
what Hitler jerked off to.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.411
- My first credit.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:28.748
[laughter]

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.583
- That was a good--
I enjoyed that battle.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.585
Andy, I appreciate
that you're wearing

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.253
the white-guy starter kit.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.688
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.089
- I liked Nicole
in this one, Andy.

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:38.624
- I get it.

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:40.326
- I did like your meanness
and everything,

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.929
but, you know,
she counterpunched

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.498
on one of your jokes,
on the Costco joke,

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.166
and that was like,
"Whoa, what the fuck?"

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.634
That was it right there.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.735
- No, that was great.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.370
As a comic,
I realized, like,

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:53.606
"Oh, she must have really worked
at Costco at some point

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.942
to have had such a quick"--

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.544
'Cause I was like, "Damn,
she's a fucking super genius

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.713
if she didn't work
at a Costco."

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.014
- I work at a Costco.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.182
- Currently, yeah.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:04.483
- Currently.
- Currently.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.952
- That was
a great callback, Nicole.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.253
I could see how hard you worked
on this.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.454
Andy.
- Yeah.

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:09.789
- You seem like you're gonna

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.257
fucking take out a gun
and kill us all.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.892
- No, no.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.394
I talk about my ex-wife
fucking guys onstage already.

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:16.963
- Andy just looks like that.
- Yeah.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.397
[laughter]

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.600
I'm very low
on the spectrum.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.237
- I know you're a great
"Roast Battle" fan, Andy.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.606
You're a super-funny comic,
and thank you for doing this.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.407
- Thanks, man.
- But I do think Nicole--

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.810
I got her an almost perfect
score tonight.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.545
So you owned him tonight.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:33.946
- Yeah!
- Congratulations.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.582
- Yo, winner
of the last battle of the night,

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.918
funny girl Nicole AimÃ©e!

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.486
[cheers and applause]
Hug each other!

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.054
<i> - She was just solid.</i>

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:43.656
She had great jokes
all around,

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.825
and I got--I got nervous,
you know.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.294
I'm not used to being
around women, so...

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:49.629
- Yo.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.297
- I'm not used to being
around vegans.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.898
- [laughs]
