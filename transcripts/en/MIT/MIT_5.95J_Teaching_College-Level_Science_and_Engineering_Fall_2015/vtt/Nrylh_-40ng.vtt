JANET RANKIN: Another
active learning technique

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.430
that can be very, very
effective in supporting

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.710
student learning is the jigsaw.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.640
And it gets its name from
the activity involved

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.490
when you do a jigsaw puzzle.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.620
And usually, most people
when they do a jigsaw

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.070
will look for the--

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.040
they'll find all
the edge pieces,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.010
or they'll find all
the blue pieces,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.930
or they'll find
all the pieces that

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.200
have a certain image on them.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.290
You do the homogeneous
aspects of the exercise.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.300
So you get all the edge
pieces, the blue pieces,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.880
the particular image pizzas.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.070
But eventually, you have
to take those pieces

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.180
and put them together.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.680
You have to link
them up with pieces

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.520
that don't look quite
like those pieces,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.190
so that's the heterogeneous
component of it.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.480
And so what you
do in a jigsaw is

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.570
you ask students to become
experts, if you will,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.890
homogeneous experts,
in a particular area,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.390
on a particular topic.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.950
And you can do this by giving
them a reading in class,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.480
or you can do this by asking
them to reflect on something

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.870
that you've addressed
in a previous class

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.630
or that they've addressed
in a previous homework.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.470
But they sit together,
or they group

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.870
together in this, what
I call, homogeneous

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.010
group, where everyone is talking
about the same particular

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.420
topic.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.680
And they just discuss that
topic and they become experts

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.750
in that homogeneous topic.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.480
And then you can have three
or four different topics,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.380
whatever, depending on
the size of the class.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.300
And you have these
local groups of experts,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.090
like the edge pieces, and the
blue pieces, and the picture

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.890
pieces.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.470
And then after giving them
a period of time, maybe five

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.750
minutes, 10 minutes,
depending on the class,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.690
you break them up into
heterogeneous groups.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.765
So you get one with one
representative from Group A,

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.630
goes with one
representative from Group B,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.370
and one representative
from Group C,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.440
and one representative
from group D.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.870
And now you have a new
heterogeneous group that has

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.490
an A, a B, a C, and a D in it.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.120
Or if we use the
puzzle analogy, you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.340
have a group that has
some person that's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.890
the edge expert, some person
that's the picture expert,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.990
and some person that's
the blue piece expert.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.240
And they're all in a group.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.550
And now they share what
they know individually

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.330
with each other and then
they combine that expertise,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.090
they synthesize that expertise,
to make something bigger

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.210
to come up with a more global
understanding of the problem.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.750
And then each group does
that in their own way.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.410
So the heterogeneous groups then
form a more holistic, or a more

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.670
heterogeneous, solution
to the problem,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.170
as if they're putting together
the different kinds of puzzle

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.190
pieces.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.160
And then again, as with
the other activities,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.670
we ask them to then report out.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.280
Before that I usually
will circulate in the room

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.110
the same way I do
with the pair share

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.330
to hear what each of
the groups are saying,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.850
to see if any groups are
having particular issues,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.070
or if they have some
particular breakthroughs that I

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.510
want to make sure they share
with the class as a whole.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.160
There are some
logistical issues.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.360
One, you want to make sure that
the students really can become

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.360
these homogeneous experts.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.480
So that if you have a
group of four people,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.270
that they've all really come
up to speed on the topic.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.320
So ideally, you would give
a pre-class assignment

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.250
and you'd say, yes.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.110
I need everybody to
read this article

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.212
and to be able to explain
this point, this point,

00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:32.920
and this point, and
you would assign that

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.710
to that particular
group of students.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.970
And then you'd do the same
with a few other topics.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.730
You're assuming then that the
students have read the paper,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.380
or have read the
article, whatever

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.720
it is you want them to read,
and that they understand it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.000
to the level that you
hope they understood it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.580
Sometimes you don't have
time for that or it just

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.470
doesn't work out,
so you give them

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.750
something to read within class.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.120
And again, that can be tricky.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.610
Students may not have the
same level of understanding,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.100
so groups may be a
little bit spotty.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.350
The other thing that can
happen with the jigsaw, which

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.340
is a really silly problem but
sometimes it just trips you

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.830
up, is if you have, depending
on the number of students,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.810
you have to kind of
think on your feet

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.200
about how many students are
in the homogeneous group

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.870
versus how many students are
in the heterogeneous group.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.320
If it's a perfect
square, it works fine.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.560
So if you've got nine students,
or 16 students, or 25 students,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.219
you know you have five
groups in one situation

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.260
and then five groups in
the other, that means you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.300
have to have the same number of
groups as heterogeneous topics.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.790
So if I went A, B, C, D, I
have to then have four groups

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.690
because I had to have four A's,
four B's, four C's, and four

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.190
D's.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.720
So sometimes just the number
of topics and the number

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.430
of students that you
have in your class

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.050
makes it kind of
hard to make groups

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.420
that don't have extra
people or aren't short

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.710
a particular expert.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.650
And that's just something
you want to plan beforehand.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.304
And if somebody
doesn't come to class,

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.720
if you know you have 25 students
in your class and someone

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.560
doesn't show up, then you
have to kind of deal with it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.520
on the fly.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.560
But that can be the trickiest
thing with the jigsaw,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.170
is just getting the
number of students right.
