00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.245
[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,
we've got a fun build idea.

00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:04.100
We're going to see
if we can build our very own

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.820
customized TKOR branding iron.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.840
[Music]

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.680
Guys, we just got a welder,
a MIG welder.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.860
I love welding,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.320
and this is going
to be a lot of fun.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.140
And as a first project,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.950
we are going to make
a branding iron.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.140
So I've got a steel bar.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.340
I've got some
steel square tubing,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.201
got a little bit
of all thread,

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.142
some wood, nuts.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:29.201
Goal is to be able

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.350
to have a little metal logo
that we can heat up in a fire,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.936
and then brand onto wood,

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:35.015
or maybe a steak,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.300
or whatever else we
feel really needs

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.800
our logo burned right into it.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.139
Not people.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.062
Probably not cows either.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.192
I don't think we have
any cows to brand.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.711
It's a pretty basic idea.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.136
We're going to cut
and shape the TKOR logo

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.860
out of some mild steel.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.880
Use a welder to attach them
together, and add a handle,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.084
giving us a branding iron

00:00:54.084 --> 00:00:56.020
that we can use
on all sorts of stuff.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.640
Now, I've gone ahead
and printed off the TKOR logo,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.650
and what I'm going
to be doing is attaching

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.600
that to our metal bar here,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.330
and I'm actually going

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.000
to take all four letters
and cut them up,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.450
and then we're welding stuff,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.485
we'll put them back together.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:09.550
That's just going to make
it a lot easier to get some

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.549
of the angles and stuff,

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.599
the down in the little
nooks and crannies.

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.129
So we're going to separate all
the letters, glue them down

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:16.150
to this piece of steel,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.800
and we're going to start
cutting them out.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:29.700
[Music]

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.520
Wood glue actually
does a fantastic job

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.340
attaching paper to metal.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:51.280
[Music]

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.512
Well, there's a few ways
you can cut this out.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600
I'm going to start
with a hacksaw.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.740
We'll see if I decide
to keep using the hacksaw,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200
or if I just move on
to using an electric grinder.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:13.680
[Music]

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.820
Who was it that said something
about a metal grinder?

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.100
Heck, I had a good idea.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:03:15.120
[Music]

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.140
Kind of got
the rough form cut out.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.380
Now, we got to start doing
a little bit finer details.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.620
Of course, we won't necessarily
do everything with a grinder,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.220
we'll get some files,
maybe a rotary grinder as well.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.340
We've got options.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:04:32.700
[Music]

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.640
I've got the four letter pieces
cut out for our TKOR symbol,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.596
and now I need to
start welding together.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.960
The T and K should be connected.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.580
The O and R should be connected.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.740
And so we want to do that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.334
before we put all the pieces
together with the backer rod,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.700
and then attach the handle.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.740
So we're just going
to be welding--

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.433
We're actually going
to do it on the front.

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.292
That is going to leave
a little bit of buildup.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.220
We're going to have to grind
that down afterward,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.660
but it should leave a nice
smooth connection

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.420
between the pieces when I'm done.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.980
A great connection?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.180
Hopefully, it's
enough connection.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.560
[Music]

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.060
Nice.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.120
That work great.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.180
There we go.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.740
We've got a weld right
across the seam.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.700
Hopefully, it's a good clean
weld all the way through,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.780
and when I sand that down,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.880
it will just be nice
and smooth with no bubbles

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.900
or anything inside.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:39.140
[Music]

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.960
So for those of you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.640
who may not know,
this right here,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.971
that's a magnet.

00:05:43.462 --> 00:05:45.686
This is great for holding all
of your pieces in place,

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:47.450
and it's got a nice
90 degree angle on it,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.160
gives you some
measures and stuff.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.540
This right here is what allows
it to complete a circle,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.609
and I'm pushing this button.

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:54.350
It's sending electricity
through both of these,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.713
and it welds because it's trying
to complete the circuit.

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:59.137
So this has to be in contact
with what you're welding

00:05:59.137 --> 00:05:59.850
ahead of time,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.601
and as it feeds this wire out,

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:03.542
the wire comes
in contact with it.

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:06.240
It makes an arc and
that's what welds.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.740
All right.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.920
Let's do a little bit clean
up on these two.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.100
Are they cool enough to touch?

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.800
They're not super burning hot,
but they're too hot.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:07:29.780
[Music]

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.040
Well guys...

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.580
Brands work in reverse.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.400
So this one looks
really good on camera.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.017
But if I brand
anything with it,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.240
it would read TKOR backwards.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.960
So I'm going to try and cut
off these weld marks.

00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:46.044
Weld this piece
to the other side,

00:07:46.044 --> 00:07:47.742
and then clean it up again.

00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:50.262
All right, we've
got some charcoal,

00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:52.158
what we're going to do is
we're gonna put our brand down

00:07:52.158 --> 00:07:52.958
in the charcoal,

00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:53.750
get it nice and hot,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.296
add a little bit
of extra air to just

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.754
really get that thing going.

00:07:56.754 --> 00:07:59.150
Hopefully, we can get
this really nice and hot,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.500
and then start
burning some stuff.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:08.220
[Music]

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.020
All right, now
it's not glowing red.

00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:12.972
Part of this
because it's daytime out here.

00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:16.700
But I'm guessing we have plenty
of heat to get a good brand.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.360
[Music]

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.600
Bam, that is beautiful.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:43.720
[Music]

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.820
It brands wood really well,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.960
but there's another thing
we want to try.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.940
Now, we're not going
to brand a live cow

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.650
because we don't have
one of those,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.160
and we don't own it,
and have no reason to brand it,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.100
but we do have
a steak from a cow.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.060
We're going to see

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.140
what happens if we try
and brand that steak.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:11.840
[Music]

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.400
Right as I braided
that, there's a cow.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.000
I don't know like
a few properties over.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.700
I swear it just...

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.972
It knew.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.020
It knew.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.780
[Music]

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.480
Yeah, that's good
branded right there.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:38.680
[Music]

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.760
Taste branded.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.200
It actually does,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.800
there's like an extra little bit
of charred flavor to it.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.812
It's quite good.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:53.600
[Music]

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.540
Guys, you've probably noticed
that since we introduced

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.840
Calli in our Captain
America shield video,

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.075
every new video
has had secret codes,

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:01.075
graphic glitches,

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:03.454
and other secret elements
hidden into it.

00:10:03.454 --> 00:10:04.909
Keep track of what you see,

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.140
and the timestamp
of when you see it.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.880
We've got some big
prizes to give away,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.000
and finding the codes
might make you our next winner.
