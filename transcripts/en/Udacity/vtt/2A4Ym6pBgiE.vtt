This would be considered a loss of function allele. Because

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.830
the ALDH2 is still able to perform its function, but it

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.980
has a much lower activity level. So because it's lost some

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.300
of its normal function we call it a loss of function.
