00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] So now I'd like you to fill in the rest of the definition for hand_rank.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have the values for 8 and 7.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Go ahead and fill in the remaining tests and return tuples for the values from 6 down to 0.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That will be the hardest assignment you've had yet.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It might take you a little while to work on it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Make sure you use the test cases, run the tests

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to make sure you have your hand_rank function working properly.
