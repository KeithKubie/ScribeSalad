00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.760
Ladies, when yer man says he’s too sick
to take out the trash, he may not be as lazy!

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.910
He might actually have an evolutionary disadvantage.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.820
Hey guys and dolls, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.070
It’s a pretty common trope that a cold or
the flu doesn’t really affect women as much

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.110
as it does men.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.269
There’s even kind of a pejorative name for
it, “the man flu”, which implies that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.509
men are just being babies.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.480
Now, of course this is a crazy exaggeration…
being sick sucks for everyone... except…

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.540
studies have shown this difference in experience
may have a hint of truth to it.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.890
Empirically, men tend to die more often than
women when they catch tuberculosis, and they’re

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.300
five times as likely to get cancer when infected
with HPV.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.400
There are a whole mess of viruses that seem
to be much faster and deadlier in men than

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.190
in women, or cause worse outcomes.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.620
Well, a paper, that came out in December of
2016 in the journal Nature Communications

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.350
studied a phenomenon where a certain virus
called HTLV-1 caused leukemia to develop and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.690
eventually kill approximately twice as many
Japanese men as Japanese women, but affected

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.190
both sexes equally when studied in the Caribbean.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.260
Researchers posited that the biggest explanatory
difference was that in Japan, breastfeeding

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.750
goes on for longer than it does in the Caribbean.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.020
Now that may seem unrelated, but think of
it from the virus’ perspective.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.050
Viruses need to spread from host to host to
survive, it doesn’t do them any good to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.870
instantly kill whoever they infect, because
that doesn’t leave enough time for them

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.780
to infect others.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.340
Although more research is needed, the authors
of the study suggest that maybe it is evolutionarily

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.700
beneficial for a virus to keep women alive
longer, and therefore affect them less severely,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.450
because they’re more likely to pass it onto
their children through breastfeeding.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.660
But, in societies where breastfeeding is less
common, and the risk is lower, the virus has

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.010
no such evolutionary imperative.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.250
Another study that came out in 2013 in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.860
found that when men and women were injected
with the flu vaccine, women showed an increased

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.769
antibody response, and more inflammation proteins
in their blood serum, than men did.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.219
Their explanation was that a cluster of genes
which actually make you worse at fighting

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:18.930
viruses are actually increased, or “upregulated”
when your body has higher levels of testosterone.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.389
In fact, men who had high testosterone showed
the lowest antibody response to the vaccine..

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:30.969
The researchers suggest that while this immunosuppressive
response in men does worse when dealing with

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.200
viruses, it can actually save lives when it
comes to bacterial infections.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.299
The idea is that men are much more likely
to catch bacterial infections.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.260
Now, those aren’t just dangerous because
they can spread, but because sometimes the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.609
body totally freaks out when it encounters
bacteria, and can lead to a cyclical immune

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.189
response called a “cytokine storm”, where
there are just too many immune cells trying

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.909
to fight at the same time and they overwhelm
your body, sometimes killing you.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.519
Since men are more prone to these infections,
it makes sense to avoid killing yourself fighting

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.519
them.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.529
What we’re trying to say is, both sexes
have a lot to deal with, but men, thanks to

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.510
testosterone, seem to suffer a little bit
more when they're sick.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.980
So, show a little compassion, stop calling
it “the man flu”.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.879
It's not just sickness that hits men harder,
it's also breakups.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.900

that out for you.
