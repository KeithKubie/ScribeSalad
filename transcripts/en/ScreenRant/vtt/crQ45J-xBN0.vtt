00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.530
When people go to the movies to see best friends
taking on incredible adventures, or beautiful

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.440
people sharing a passionate romance, they
don't usually stop to think if the actors

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.000
and actresses are actually as well matched
in person. And they definitely don't stop

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.080
to think if the cast absolutely hated sharing
the screen - but just managed to hide it.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.540
You'd be surprised just how many of your favorite
stars, teams, or couples kept their actual

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.680
feelings behind the scenes, instead of in
front of the camera. Here are 10 Movie Casts

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.950
That Hated Working Together.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.820
The Notebook
The romance between Noah and Allie became

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.250
a cultural phenomenon, but the actors were
a different story. From the moment Ryan Gosling

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.681
and Rachel McAdams met, they butted heads,
avoiding eachother outside of shooting, and

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:56.060
getting on eachother's nerves throughout the
movie's production. But it's proof that there's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.280
a thin line between love and hate: the pair
eventually wound up dating for years, mirroring

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.019
the movie couple's dramatic romance more than
planned.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.060
Mad Max: Fury Road
Actors don't have to hate eachother to have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.580
trouble working together, and in the deserts
for months upon months, Charlize Theron had

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.010
a... difficult time getting to know her co-star
Tom Hardy. Since he stayed in character between

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.190
scenes, and she didn't, the tension only built
as the shoot dragged on. Theron has since

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.979
admitted that Hardy is apparently a great
actor to work with most of the time, but this

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.870
role was a different animal altogether - which
means their fight scene probably looks so

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.960
convincing for a reason.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.570
Any Given&nbsp;Sunday
The movie may be remembered mainly for Al

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.479
Pacino's performance, but Oliver Stone's football
drama saw some real-life blows thrown between

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.020
rapper-turned actor LL Cool J and Oscar winner
Jamie Foxx. When LL decided to improvise,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710
giving his quarterback, Foxx, some shots to
his helmet, he gave him a fist in return,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.130
and the two were off to the races. The police
were even involved, but the two decided to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.840
get back to filming instead of pressing charges.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.030
Romeo + Juliet
The love between Leonardo DiCaprio and his

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.630
Titanic co-star Kate Winslet is still going
strong, but the same can't be said for his

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.399
other famous love, the Juliet to his Romeo.
Despite being just 17 at the time, Claire

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.290
Danes couldn't stomach Leo's immature energy,
joking and breaking character between takes.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.900
That meant their romance was even more faked
than usual, but you can't argue with the results.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.130
The Basketball Diaries
They may be blockbuster names these days,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.420
but when The Basketball Diaries was made,
Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg had yet

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.290
to kick their movie careers into high gear.
And after Leo felt that Wahlberg disrespected

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.840
him at a charity basketball game, he used
what little pull he had to try to get him

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.400
fired. Claiming there was no way he would
act in a movie beside "Marky Mark," he eventually

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.800
relented, and the two went on to bigger, better,
and less angry days.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.910
Dirty Dancing
When actress Jennifer Grey burst onto the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.200
scene as 'Baby,' it was her changing moods
and youthful giggles that won over fans - and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.531
irritated her co-star. Patrick Swayze took
acting and dancing pretty seriously, and since

00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:11.640
Dirty Dancing relied on both, Grey's inability
to stay in character, or keep serious apparently

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.760
strained his patience. He managed to keep
it off camera, or at least played it off as

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.430
the reaction of his character, not his own.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.959
Batman Forever
Val Kilmer's Batman film may be laughed at

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.390
these days, but at the time, he was just one
of several stars in the cast, with Jim Carrey

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.880
at the height of his popularity playing Riddler
opposite Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face. But when

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.530
Carrey sensed some tension from his fellow
villain, he found Jones at a restaurant near

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:44.220
the set to try to clear the air. Jones wanted
none of it, saying to Carrey's face: "I hate

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.830
you. I really don't like you. I cannot sanction
your buffoonery." Carrey didn't push him any

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.200
further.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.700
Blade: Trinity
Wesley Snipes has a reputation for a reason,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.099
and when he arrived on set, staying in character
as a vampire hunter was just the beginning.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.319
Only appearing on set for close-ups, telling
his director to quit, and even choking him

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.520
before he brought in bikers for security united
the film's crew against him. But there was

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.739
a plus side: his absence gave Ryan Reynolds
a bigger role, specifically telling jokes

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.740
to play off of the deadpan close-up shots
that Snipes had filmed separately.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.029
The Expendables 2
Sylvester Stallone's team-up franchise gave

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.311
a ton of aging action stars another adventure,
but judging by Bruce Willis' low energy and

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:42.180
refusal to say his famous Die Hard catchphrase,
he wasn't in it for the fun. Stallone confirmed

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.410
that was the case when Willis demanded $4
million to appear in the sequel - filming

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.680
for less than a week, and Stallone took his
feelings to Twitter. The pair eventually made

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.720
up, but his words of advice -&nbsp;GREEDY AND
LAZY ...... A SURE FORMULA FOR CAREER FAILURE

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.729
- will live forever.

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.469
Star Wars
You would think that actors Anthony Daniels

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.020
and Kenny Baker would have formed a bond squished
inside the droid bodies of C2PO and R2D2,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.879
but the truth is, the two hated eachother
during production, and haven't changed since.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.580
Over the years, Baker has accused Daniels
of avoiding most of the movie's cast and fan

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.610
base, and dismissing him as an actor and little
person, while Daniels mainly ignores it, but

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.580
has voiced his opinion that despite Baker's
performance operating R2, it might as well

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.590
have been a bucket. Who knew?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.560
Those are just a few of our favorite off-screen
feuds or tense movie sets, but which ones

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.740
