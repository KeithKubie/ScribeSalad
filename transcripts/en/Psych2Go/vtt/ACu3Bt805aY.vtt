00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
oh

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.889
You ever have those days where you can't get out of bed?

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.059
You can't go to work even meeting people is terrifying your normal strategies of making yourself. Happy don't seem to work

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
I know the day's bad when no amount of Stevie wonder can pick me up

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.670
Sometimes I'm just feeling sad and unmotivated for no good reason

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.410
It doesn't happen very often, but when it does it comes to two main issues

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.790
For starters, how do I know that? I'm having a bad day as an introvert. I prefer being alone. I have a people limit

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.450
Sometimes I really need company, but when I'm at my worst not enough friends or positive thoughts can make me smile

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.289
I've learned is a difference between not wanting to leave fun and not being able to leave bed as an introvert

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.789
It's hard for me to distinguish bad days in meantime, but I know that during me time

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.309
I think about myself when it's a bad day

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.279
There's nothing just a void after going through the motions so many times I learned that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.789
I need to be honest with my feelings. I can't ignore them until they go away

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.310
did something bother me that happened recently is a certain event affecting me is it hormonal have I reached a limit of people time if

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.479
All of the answers to these questions, and the others are no, I realize I've reached the no-man's land of I have no idea

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.469
Why I feel this bad, but I do or how I like to call it the Sonata

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.449
Meaning it helps normalize it and makes it feel less scary. It helps to feel like it's validated, so when this happens

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.960
I tell myself

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
I'm having a Sonata I've been through it before and I'll get through it again

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.399
But how do I deal with it calling a friend doesn't help for me

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.069
But it might for you different things help different people when I get like this my friends can boost my mood

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.959
But too much people time and I crash like I never left my bed to begin with nothing really cheers me up

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.199
I waste my day away doing nothing, but it's okay

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.619
I think that sometimes we need to have days where we feel bad for ourselves

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.718
We need to simmer in it and let the feelings run their course unless it interferes with your life

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.109
And the bad days become bad weeks or months you should be fine

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.309
I needed to accept that feeling bad is just as legitimate as anger or sadness

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.669
If you need to cry or punch something to get over something that happens the Sonata should be given the same treatment

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.350
I deal with it in my own way sometimes our brains in our hearts

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.190
don't work the way we tell them to as

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.210
A result we get stuck with feelings that we didn't ask for and had the potential to feel paralyzed. It sucks

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.489
I hate it and it throws off my schedule

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.229
It's an unnecessary weight that I need to carry it takes away from my life

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.690
But I need to allow myself to feel terrible sometimes

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.300
I admit that after I allow myself that it's easier to get through it I can get through, Senada
