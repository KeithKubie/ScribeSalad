00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.939
- LOOK AT ALL THESE
SHOTGUN SHELLS, MAN.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.409
HE'S BEEN SLAMMING THEM LIKE
NO OTHER HUMAN I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.178
- EXCEPT FOR ME,

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.180
BUT TO YOUR POINT,
I'M NOT FULLY HUMAN.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.082
MY UNCLE,
HE WAS A ZOOKEEPER.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.851
- [shouting]

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.520
- THE DERS!

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.995
- [burping]

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.297
IT SHOULD BE MY NAME
ON THAT BANNER!

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.367
- WHOA, HEY.
SPIDERS, MAN.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.369
WHY DON'T YOU SWOOP ON
DOWN HERE, BUDDY?

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.970
VERY SAFELY, THOUGH, PLEASE.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.339
- YEAH, WHY DO YOU WORRY SO MUCH
ABOUT BANNERS, DUDE?

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.308
DRAKE'S NOT RAPPING
ABOUT BANNERS.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.644
- YOU'RE REALLY INTO DRAKE, HUH?
- HE'S, LIKE, A REAL TALENT.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.280
I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM,
AND HE RAPS ABOUT TROPHIES.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.382
- [burping]

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:53.020
I COULD JUST PUT MY NAME
ON IT, RIGHT?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.122
I'LL JUST PULL IT DOWN

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:59.593
AND CROSS OFF TORPEY'S NAME
AND MAKE EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:02.462
- IF YOU DO THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY YOURSELF,

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.765
AND ACTUALLY, THAT'D BE
AWESOME TO WATCH, SO I VOTE YES.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.301
- NO, ANDERS,
OKAY, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.370
IF YOU'RE EVEN IN THERE ANYMORE,
JUST COME DOWN, DUDE.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.538
WE CAN FIX THIS.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.709
- I AM FIXING THIS.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.745
[shouting]

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.754
[all shouting indistinctly]

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.424
- I GOT IT!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.226
[laughs]

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.329
OH, MY GOD!
- YES, THE DERS!

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.130
YEAH.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:38.398
YES!

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.435
- THAT COULD HAVE GONE
WAY WORSE.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.136
- DON'T LOOK DOWN.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.606
- 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
AN ENTIRE TROPHY

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.975
STICKING OUT
OF YOUR FLUBBER.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.910
- OH, MY GOD!

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.112
WHAT DO I DO?
- JUST RELAX, DUDE.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.680
MY UNCLE BOBBY
ACTUALLY IMPALED HIMSELF

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.349
WITH A FIRE POKER
ONE CHRISTMAS.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.917
HE HAD IT IN THERE
UNTIL NEW YEAR'S.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:00.254
- OKAY, SO LEAVE IT IN.

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:03.056
- YEAH, HE'S FINE NOW.
- NO, NO, HE'S DEAD.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.725
THEY FOUND HIM DEAD
NEW YEAR'S DAY,

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:05.425
'CAUSE OF THE FIRE POKER.
