00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.450
- Emeritus of obstetrics, gynecology

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.120
and reproductive sciences
at the University

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.800
of California, San Francisco
School of Medicine.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.180
Retired from practice in
September, I didn't know that,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.260
after a 34 year career
as a clinician educator

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.330
of OBGYN and primary care residence

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.800
at San Francisco General Hospital.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.870
And since 2015, he's
been a clinical fellow

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.550
for the National Family Planning

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.380
and Reproductive Health Association,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.720
providing advice on clinical issues

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.250
and reproductive health policy,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.450
and I got his clinical
opinion at lunchtime.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.590
So Dr. Policar is gonna talk to us

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.300
about contraception and other topics.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.650
Dr. Policar.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.763
- Thank you.

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.013
(applause)

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.850
Nice to actually be back in this room,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.050
it's been quite a while.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.260
Thank you for the
invitation, and you've heard

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.390
a little bit about my
connection to this issue

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.690
of family planning and menstrual issues

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.070
as they come up for women with
a variety of disabilities.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.610
At our clinic, at the San
Francisco General Hospital,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.120
our women's health center on 5M,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.570
we were oftentimes a referral site

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.310
for women who had a variety of conditions

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.340
where they needed a gynecology consult,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.290
and we assisted in making the decisions

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.560
about whether to use hormones
or not and IUD or not,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.970
what type and so on.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240
So that is mainly the perspective

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.210
that I'm going to bring to you today,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.410
as well as kind of what's new in the world

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.580
of family planning so
that you can think about

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.360
how to apply that to your patients.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.850
However, before I jump in and get started,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.370
whenever I talk about contraception,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.337
sometimes when I talk about
it, everyone (mumbles).

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.270
I like to tell you about my bike team.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.610
So there are a number of us
at the San Francisco General

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.140
in the OBGYN department who have ridden

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.240
in the Waves to Wine,
which is a fundraiser

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.210
for multiple sclerosis.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.230
We've done that for 10 years, we've raised

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.500
almost a million dollars in doing that.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.450
But I thought you'd be really interested

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.125
in the name of our bike team.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.125
(audience laughter)

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.533
So that is the actual back of our jersey.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590
We're pretty well known
between here and Santa Rosa,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.620
which is the termination
of the Waves to Wine.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.440
Our bike team even has a team motto.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.409
We are the best bike team period.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
(audience laughter)

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.850
So I'm gonna be talking
about family planning,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.150
and we, you know, most of
the folks in the picture

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.630
are my family planning colleagues
at San Francisco General,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.230
and also talking a lot about bleeding.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.420
But before I jump into
that, I wanna tell you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.730
about our go-to guidelines, the Centers

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.610
for Disease Control, over the last decade,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.270
has developed some incredibly helpful

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.900
evidence-based guidelines when
it comes to family planning.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.790
And there are two in particular
that we use every day.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.520
And the reason that I tell you about them

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.140
is that some of the sections in both

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.970
of these different
guidelines have to do with

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.990
the safety and the efficacy
of contraceptive methods

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.460
in women who have a variety
of chronic medical conditions,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.320
disabilities or sometimes both.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.230
The first and most important is called

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.590
the CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.080
its most recent update
was a couple of years ago.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.750
And it mainly looks at safety,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.250
so tells us about 10 or
11 different categories

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.070
of contraception, and
then 60 different kinds

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.000
of chronic conditions and the safety

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.330
of using a contraceptive for each,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.100
a particular contraceptive
for each of those conditions.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.640
One of the reasons I tell you about it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.430
is that I'm going to be
using the MEC grading system

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.340
as we go through three
different case studies.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.780
But the way that this works is that,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.890
if it's MEC category
one or two, basically,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.530
it is safe to use a particular
method of contraception

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.380
for a woman who has the specified disease.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.180
If it's a category three, it means that

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.910
sort of an equal balance
of benefit and harms,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.880
but always it's safer to use
the method of contraception

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.270
than it is to become pregnant.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.790
And then the fours are the ones

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.060
where we avoid a particular
method of contraception

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.580
when a woman has an
underlying medical condition,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.003
just because the risk
of the method is more,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.110
is clearly more harmful than it is

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.840
for her to use it, sometimes even more

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.040
than the risk of pregnancy.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.090
But you'll see those numbers
again in just a moment.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.490
The other document that's important

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.550
is called the Selected
Practice Recommendations

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.720
for Contraceptive Use,
originally published

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.410
in 2013, but updated in 2016.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.130
That is much more oriented towards

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.780
each individual method,
about when to start,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.330
when to stop, specifically
how to use the method

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.210
and then using it in very
specific circumstances.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.020
So laid out in a slightly different way,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.240
but equally helpful.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.930
Now, the important thing is that,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.020
with your tax dollars at work,
the CDC actually put together

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.360
a wonderful app that combines both

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.300
the medical eligibility criteria

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.470
and the selected practice recommendations.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.370
It's completely free and the way to get it

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.310
in the Apple Store or
in the Google Play Store

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.800
if you have an Android
phone is just to type in

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.570
the search term CDC and contraception.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.470
You can download this, and it's just

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.920
an incredibly helpful tool to have

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.290
when you're thinking about
what method of contraception

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.199
might be the most
appropriate for your patient.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.750
And I know that our residents
at San Francisco General,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.170
most of the family planning people

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.290
that I work with just
constantly refer to this

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.760
as our evidence-based database
about safety and efficacy

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.350
of various methods of contraception.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.960
So what I've done, and
based on the literature,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.780
this wasn't entirely my
idea, is to put together

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.210
an algorithm that has to
do with two separate issues

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.850
that we might deal with in women

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.420
who have developmental disabilities.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.540
One is menstrual period, periods, rather,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.260
and irregular menstrual bleeding

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.250
and how to get that under control.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.860
The second is the issue of whether or not

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.560
that person needs a
method of contraception.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.970
And then we can basically
put together a matrix

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.220
that puts people in the
category of either having

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.060
bleeding problems or not,
needing contraception or not.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.050
But it looks like this,
that it starts with

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.360
a woman comes in for a visit
with her primary care provider

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.120
or a woman's health visit
in a family planning clinic

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.740
or with an OBGYN.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.530
We ask about her sexual activity,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.940
her menstrual pattern and hygiene.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.610
And let's say that she does
disclose or her caregiver

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.223
discloses that she is having problems

00:06:52.223 --> 00:06:54.930
with menstrual regularity,
maybe very heavy

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.550
menstrual periods that
are problematic for her.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.700
The next question is, is
she also sexually active?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.770
And if the answer is yes, there are

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.870
specific contraceptive methods

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.930
that I'll go through
with you in more detail

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.100
that will both reduce your bleeding,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.010
as well as give her very
effective contraception.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.930
On the other hand, she may
have menstrual problems,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.450
but she's not sexually active yet,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.660
and contraception is not at the forefront.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.610
So there's a slightly different list,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.000
and we'll talk about using NSAIDs as a way

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.160
of getting menstrual
bleeding under control,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.820
and then some of the other
hormonal methods you see

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.370
would be used less for contraception,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.240
but more for menstrual cycle control.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.840
On the other hand, we have women

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.770
who are not complaining
of menstrual problems

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.180
who have regular periods,
or the amount of bleeding

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.700
that they have is not
problematic for them.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.650
If they're sexually active, they can use

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.010
just about any method of contraception,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.860
with one or two exceptions
that I will cover.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.350
For example, using oral contraceptives

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.020
or a patch or a ring in a woman

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.070
who also has a problem
with a seizure disorder

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.450
because of the possibility of interactions

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.640
with her antiepileptic medication

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.310
and the use of pills, patch or ring.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.520
And then the last part
of that two by two table

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.320
is women who don't have menstrual problems

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.760
and who are not sexually active yet.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.010
And in that circumstance, of course,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.790
none of these hormonal approaches

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.510
would be appropriate at this time

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.840
until she discloses that she is interested

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.823
in becoming sexually active.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.890
Now, you may have noticed the asterisk

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.020
that was present on the question about

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.910
do you need contraception or not,

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.300
and Erica has done a really nice job

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.340
of how to have those initial conversations

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.030
about whether you are
sexually active, if not,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.110
whether you're thinking about
becoming sexually active.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.480
So the way we would
start in our OBGYN clinic

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.490
is to assess her capacity
to consent to having sex.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.950
And if she was having
non-consensual intercourse,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.070
then, of course, we would be
working with her caregiver

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.970
and probably going through the
process of reporting abuse.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.010
But on the other hand, if she was having

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.030
consensual sexual activity,
the kinds of topics

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.680
that we would be covering
would have to do with intimacy

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.070
and safety issues, physical
safety issues with her partner.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.420
Number two, whether there's a possibility

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.140
of having acquired a sexually
transmitted infection.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.410
Screening for that, of course,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.190
treating for it if it's
needed, as well as providing

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.423
some amount of education
about STD prevention.

00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.930
A slightly different conversation
about choosing a method

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.580
of contraception for many patients.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.990
That is a much more detailed conversation

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.520
based on shared decision making about

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.810
going through the whole menu
of contraceptive methods

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.530
and asking the question of
what are you really looking for

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.960
in a contraceptive method.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.730
Not what method do you
want, but what do you want

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.180
in a method, which is really
a much more important question

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.940
in helping people to decide
which method she would like

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.590
to be able to use.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.110
However, the kinds of things that

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.080
we're certainly gonna
cover in this discussion

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.580
is what are the available
methods of contraception,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.333
the pros and cons of ones that
might be most appropriate.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.310
Of course, the issue of informed consent,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.840
whether that can be done
by the patient herself

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.540
or whether there's a
guardian or a caregiver

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.950
that would help her with that,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.960
and instructions regarding the correct

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.650
and consistent use of the method.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.690
And then always, always
agreeing to a follow-up plan

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.390
so that, if she's having bleeding or pain

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.080
or other problems, that we
can address that promptly.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.440
So let's start with the
first of our three patients,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.240
she's Jena, 19 years old,
she was born prematurely

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.360
at 26 weeks, she had a
birth weight of 1,100 grams.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.230
She has both visual and
hearing difficulties

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.490
since childhood, which
may have been related

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.650
to her very low birth
weight and the months

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.760
that she spent in ICU.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.710
She now also has mood problems,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.210
she complains of irregular
heavy menstrual periods.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.010
Dysmenorrhea means that her periods

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.340
are also quite painful and crampy.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.960
In general, would really
like her periods to stop

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.340
if at all possible.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.770
She is sexually active
with a 19 year old male,

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.350
and she feels safe and
comfortable in that relationship.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.340
On physical exam, her body
mass index or BMI is 34,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.190
so she's somewhat overweight,
her blood pressure is normal,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.330
she has mild facial hirsutism.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.300
So when you put together
both her body weight,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.560
as well as her regular
periods and her facial hair,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.640
you think about chronic anovulation

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.470
or polycystic ovary syndrome as a reason

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.040
for her irregular menstrual periods.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.740
So with Jena, we have two
things that we wanna address,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.870
hopefully at the same time.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.170
Number one is to address her complaint

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.060
about her heavy and irregular
periods, and number two,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.630
the fact that she's sexually active

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.300
and wants protection against pregnancy.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.680
So here we are in this
part of the algorithm

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.670
where she does have menstrual problems,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.360
she is sexually active.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.340
And the most appropriate approaches

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.630
would be a Levonorgestrel
Intrauterine System or IUD;

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.810
DMPA, which is Depo-Provera;

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.410
extended cycle oral
contraceptives; or POP,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.010
stands for progestin-only
birth control pills.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.940
Before we actually get to those methods,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.810
I wanna just preface that with a few other

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.110
just quick remarks, and
then we'll talk about

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.480
how we're going to manage Jena.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.720
One is, what are the variety of things

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.210
that are available to us
in terms of helping her

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.610
with her heavy and irregular
periods, and this comes from

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.560
a really nice clinical practice guideline

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.930
written by the American
Congress of Obstetricians

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.580
and Gynecologists a few years ago

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.180
called Menstrual
Manipulation of Adolescents

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.950
with Physical and
Developmental Disabilities.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.980
I think it's the best
guideline written in the US

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.740
on that particular topic.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.550
So they first point out
that we can use hormones,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.970
sometimes even NSAIDs as a
way of making bleeding less,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.700
less frequent, later, but it's difficult

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.820
to actually completely
stop menstrual periods.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.170
But at least we can make
them way less frequent

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.330
and way less heavy.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.760
Number two is that a non-hormonal approach

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.940
is to use NSAIDs, that they
decrease ovulatory or even,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.130
for that matter, anovulatory
menstrual bleeding

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.320
by at least a third.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.900
And I didn't put it into your handout,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.110
but I knew I'd get a question about okay,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.810
which NSAID are you talking about?

00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:28.150
And the actual go-to NSAID
that we use to try to decrease

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.640
both menstrual bleeding
and menstrual cramps

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.163
is naproxen sodium in a
dose between 220 and 440 BID

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.130
twice a day during the
period of menstrual bleeding,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.160
that there's good evidence
that naproxen sodium

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.280
actually works significantly
better than Ibuprofen

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.900
in women to decrease
crampy menstrual periods.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.800
But of course, if that's not
available as Aleve or one

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.220
of the over the counter
naproxen sodium preparations,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.660
then Ibuprofen also
works not quite as well,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.260
but it's gotta be given
in an intermediate dose

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.550
of 400 to 600 milligrams
three times a day,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.620
but only during her menstrual period,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.230
only during the time that she's bleeding.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.490
She won't need it for
the rest of the month

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.400
in order to anticipate bleeding.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.840
And then the ACOG guideline also mentions

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.950
that we can give oral
contraceptives every single day,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.100
what's called continuous
combined oral contraceptives,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.910
over an extended period,
and I'll be telling you

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.770
more about that in a few minutes.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.010
Progestin-only pills, which are,

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.100
only one type is available
in the United States,

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.900
but that's one that
may go over the counter

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.430
in the next few years.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.770
Works well as a method of contraception,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.410
the one problem is the fact
that it's gotta be taken

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.900
at the same time every day.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.350
So if a person is in a living situation

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.930
where they may not be able to have

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.890
the consistency of a daily pill
at the same time every day,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.200
then this is a method that
might actually eventuate

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.740
in some amount of breakthrough bleeding.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.830
DMPA, you may know that
as a Depo-Provera shot

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.363
that's given every 12 weeks.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.520
Not only works really well
as a method of contraception,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.460
but it has a tendency to
completely stop periods

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.360
and induce amenorrhea by the fourth dose,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.150
and it very commonly is used for women

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.690
who have sort of more extreme
developmental disabilities

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.410
where the idea is to try
to completely dry out

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.050
menstrual periods if we can do that.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.710
The ACOG guideline also points out that

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.340
the levonorgestrel IUD,
you may know that one

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.670
by its trade name of
Mirena, but there are now

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.893
four different levonorgestrel IUDs,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.070
are also a very very good choice,

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.210
because they also induce
amenorrhea, as well

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.110
as being remarkably effective
as a method of contraception.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.960
Which now brings up the
question of efficacy.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.470
In the family planning
world for the last 10 years,

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.550
we have thought of
efficacy in three tears.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.680
Top tier are the methods that work so well

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.680
that there's less than one pregnancy

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.200
per 100 couples per year.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.680
And those are mainly
contraceptive implants,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.640
one implant that goes under
the arm called Nexplanon.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.960
Any of the IUDs and tubal
occlusion or tubal ligation

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.140
that we won't discuss
today in our patients.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.820
Middle tier are the methods
that have a failure rate

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.490
between 6 and 12 pregnancies
per 100 women per year.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.550
And those are drugs like Depo-Provera,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.650
the pill, the patch, the
ring and the diaphragm.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.640
And then the bottom tier,
with more than 18 pregnancies

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.960
per 100 women per year,
are barrier methods

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.760
and natural family planning.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.170
So in general, while it's
not the sole determinant

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.030
of the most appropriate
method for a woman,

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.920
if efficacy is really important
to her, then of course,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.500
we'd like to go in the
direction of using one

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.720
of the top tier methods.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.950
So for Jena, here are
the sort of pros and cons

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.680
of each of the methods
that are available to her.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.400
A levonorgestrel IUS or
IUD is tier one efficacy,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.270
it works extremely well.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.840
Its advantage is that,
among the various products,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.810
there's one that works for three years,

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.080
many of them are FDA
labeled for five years,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.650
the evidence says that they
actually work all the way

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.120
for seven years.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.080
So in particular, if a woman, let's say,

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.440
needs to go to a surgery
center to have an IUD inserted,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.940
you'd like to choose one that she can use

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.390
for the longest period of time,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.920
and even though Mirena, LILETTA,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.830
some of the others are
labeled for five years,

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.930
we know that they work for at least seven,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.890
probably even longer.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.150
As well as stopping menstrual periods,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.830
they also decrease pain
of menstrual periods,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.580
dysmenorrhea as well.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.370
The disadvantage is that
there are some women

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.510
with developmental problems
who may not tolerate

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.710
insertion of the IED in
an outpatient clinic,

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.540
I'm gonna give some ideas
about how that could be done.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.450
But if not, it's much better, I think,

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.400
to do it under conscious sedation,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.670
either in a special clinic
or in a surgery center.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.480
And as well, there might initially be

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.500
some breakthrough
bleeding, it has a tendency

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.400
to clear up fairly quickly.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.510
Next is DMPA or
Depo-Provera, it doesn't work

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.203
quite as well as IUDs.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.030
Its advantages are one
shot every 12 weeks,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.360
so that means only four
times a year, basically,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.050
a little over four times a year.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.290
Great job of reducing bleeding

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.150
and pain of menstrual periods.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.900
But one of the things you
may have heard about it

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.600
is that it can cause weight gain,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.860
particularly in adolescents.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.260
So if weight gain is an issue,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.920
maybe for someone who's already
on the obese side like Jena,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.920
it might not be the best approach.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.330
Next is extended oral contraceptives,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.930
and what that refers to is remember

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.960
that birth control pill
packs are 21 days of hormones

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.130
and then seven days of
a hormone-free interval,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.510
seven days off during which (mumbles)

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.280
have a menstrual period.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.400
But extended OCs means
using an active pill

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.720
every single day.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.590
One approach is to do
that for 84 days in a row

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.290
and then have a 7 day menstrual period,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.400
that means you'll have
four periods a year.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.650
Another approach is one
pill a day every single day

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.350
all year, just no break, basically,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.750
and therefore, no periods.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.640
That works really well for contraception

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.670
and really well for menstrual suppression,

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.550
as long as you can remember
to take your pill every day.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.960
And with progestin-only pills,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.890
I would say that that's
not as good a choice,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.320
because number one, it's
tier two in efficacy

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.870
and it has somewhat more
breakthrough bleeding,

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.980
it's important to remember
to take it every day

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.760
at exactly the same time.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.000
But one of its advantages is that

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.260
it has no estrogen-related side effects.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.600
So there are some women
who would like to use

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.570
the pill, patch or ring, but maybe because

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.890
they've had a DVT or a pulmonary embolism

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.940
or they don't like
estrogenic side effects,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.670
that they can use one of these methods

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.090
that has progestin only,
and then not have to deal

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.820
with the side effects of
something which is estrogenic.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.830
So bottom line is that for Jena,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.830
we have quite a number of
alternatives for her, both

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.960
for contraception and to get
her bleeding under control.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.830
And I think most OBGYNs would tell you

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.000
that the ideal approach for her,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.300
from our point of view, of course,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.380
it's ultimately her decision, it would be

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.120
a levonorgestrel IUD
because of its efficacy

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.300
and inducing either
light menstrual periods,

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.660
which are hypermenorrhea or amenorrhea,

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.600
they work remarkably well.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.240
And it takes virtually no input

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.060
from the patient herself
once the IED is in place,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.850
so it's what's called
forgettable contraception.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.550
So they have the IUD inserted
or the implant put in,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.690
and then you simply don't have to worry

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.700
about your birth control
method for the next

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.180
anywhere between three
years and seven years.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.860
The challenges, of course, as I said,

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.670
are a woman's ability to
tolerate a pelvic exam

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.090
in the outpatient clinic, if not,

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.610
needing to go to a place where she

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.080
can have conscious
sedation to have that done,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.060
and not only the exam, but
then the procedure itself

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.470
of putting it in.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.000
So I added a few slides about the wisdom

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
that we've learned from a
variety of sources and ACOG

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.840
and others about the pelvic exam itself

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.240
in women who have a
variety of disabilities.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.360
And this one is something that I'm sure

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.080
all of you live every day.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.460
We need some reminders sometimes

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.310
in the world of women's
healthcare that the women,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.190
woman herself is the one who
entirely guides the exam.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.750
And what we have to do first is to ask her

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.233
how she wants to be examined,
what position works best.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.660
Do you have any suggestions
for how we do this?

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.510
And of course, for me, it's not only true

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.880
as it relates to, let's
say, doing an IUD insertion,

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.610
but I do a lot of colposcopy for women

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.770
who have abnormal pap smears,
and significant number

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.360
of women who were referred to us,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.780
let's say, for example, in a wheelchair.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.030
And so always, my first question is

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.670
what works best for you in terms of

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.010
how we can transfer you to the exam table?

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.490
What's worked best for you when you have

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.240
a speculum inserted in your vagina

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.850
so that we can have a look
with a colposcope, for example.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.160
It's virtually never our
decision as clinicians,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.130
98% of the time, our patient
can tell us what's worked,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.710
what hasn't, and then we
follow her instruction,

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.540
so it's a matter of ask,
ask, ask in advance.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.800
And she has control.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.390
Can you lift the sheet so
that I can start the exam?

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.100
Asking permission before
each step in the exam,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.740
especially for someone who's
had sexual trauma in the past.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.910
Always lift the table
up so that she can see

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.900
what's going on instead of being supine

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.270
or flat on the table, we
offer our patients a mirror

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.110
so that she can look at
her vulva if she'd like to,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.290
and then bearing down with
the insertion of the speculum.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.100
So they're all the mini tricks

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.973
that we can do to help with the exam.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.460
Then another part of that is
a very thorough inspection

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.500
on the outside because of the possibility

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.430
of sexual abuse or self-mutilation.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.410
By the outside, of
course, I'm talking about

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.370
on the initial inspection of the vulva.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.570
And then remembering about
temperature instability

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.120
in some people and trying
to keep the room warm

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.930
and offering a blanket to
be able to keep her warm.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.730
Now, I mentioned that, with Jenna,

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.960
she had some problems since childhood

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.360
with both vision and with hearing.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.020
So there are some things that
we specifically try to do

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.250
in our clinic with patients
who are vision impaired,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.200
and that's particularly
important in terms of

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.710
where the helper, whether
that's a medical assistant

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.900
or someone that she's
brought with her will be

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.880
to be able to sort of explain to her,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.430
close to her ear, what's going on.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.150
We offer the opportunity of
feeling the speculum in advance,

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.410
and of course, being very clear about

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.730
what we're doing step by step.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.123
And for the hearing impaired patient,

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.400
we wanna know where her interpreter,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.230
if she needs someone to help with signing.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.090
We'll sit, usually it's sort of a triangle

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.600
between the clinician who's
at the end of the exam table,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.830
the person who's doing the sign language

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.420
and the patient yourself, but you can see

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.530
in this graphic about the
fact that she's sitting up,

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.500
which is a really important part

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.710
of being able to do this exam,
and by the way, it does not

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.493
impair your ability to do
a speculum exam at all.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.330
All right, now, the
last part of it then is

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.560
are there any things that you can do

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.540
to kind of help patients
with the discomfort

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.350
that they may have, especially
in the circumstances

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.010
that Erica was talking about a moment ago

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.570
where someone may be
hypersensitive to pain,

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:30.570
just the least amount of touch
is enough to feel painful.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.480
So we use a lot of
what's called verbicaine.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.600
I'll tell you more about
verbicaine in just a second,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.250
it just means talking to
people through their procedure,

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.763
whoops, and distraction.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.940
Moving slowly, sometimes
using a local anesthetic

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.900
at tenaculum side, we're
doing cervical block.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.800
Occasionally, we'll do oral
sedation in the office,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.640
but when we think that the
patient's not gonna be able

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.260
to tolerate that very well,
we'll use conscious sedation

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.823
in a surgery center.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.800
And then there's some controversies,
particularly with IUDs,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.660
about whether or not pre-medication works.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.010
NSAIDs probably don't help
very much with the procedure,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.710
although they help with
the cramping afterwards.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.900
And there's a medication
called Misoprostol,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.800
you may know of it as Cytotec,

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.820
which dilates the cervix and softens it.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.480
That's mainly in women who are pregnant.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.120
And in non-pregnant women,
doesn't seem to help as much,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.530
and there are six different studies

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.170
that look at it as a way of
helping with IUD insertions,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.970
it doesn't increase the success rate,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.210
it doesn't make the pain any less,

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.600
so we don't use it for that purpose.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.500
But verbicaine's important.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.000
Keep her talking.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.680
Calm, soothing vocal
tone, a slow, easy pace.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.920
I'll talk to her about how
are the (mumbles) doing,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.670
tell me about where you live, the weather,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.520
just a variety of things that help.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.740
And we love cell phones.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.760
And what I mean by that
is if I've got a patient

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.277
who's having colposcopy
or having an IUD inserted

00:25:54.277 --> 00:25:57.514
and she's texting on her cell
phone, I could not be happier.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:58.960
(audience laughter)

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.630
Just because of the fact that it is

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.060
a great form of
distraction, and of course,

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.760
I'll tell her what's going on, but

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.580
that's a way of self-medication,

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.280
and it usually will work very well.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.890
Now, just to finish up with Jena,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.830
Jena decided to have an IUD placed,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.520
but she missed her appointment.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.850
So she called and stated
that she had unprotected sex

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.260
with her boyfriend two days ago

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.900
and didn't use a method of contraception,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.150
and she asked about
the morning after pill.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.950
And this obviously may come
up in other circumstances

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.950
where one of your clients
has hopefully consensual sex,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.330
but wasn't protected and asks you

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.940
about emergency contraception.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.040
So there are two different kinds

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.210
of emergency contraceptive pills
that I will tell you about.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.400
And we can also use a copper IUD,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.300
which is actually, by far and away,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.140
the most effective approach
to emergency contraception.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.750
So the one that's been
out for the longest time

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.950
is a levonorgestrel
emergency contraceptive pill.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.570
It is a single dose tablet,
you may have heard it

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.540
referred to as Plan B.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.740
It's supposed to be used within three days

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.820
of unprotected intercourse.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.850
And it works reasonably well as long as

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.520
you give it within three days,

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.830
you can actually use that
all the way up to five days,

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.180
but there's kind of a drop off

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.850
between 72 hours and 120 hours.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.710
And as I mentioned, Plan B is the generic,

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.920
I'm sorry, the brand name version,

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.890
there are many many generic versions

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.187
that are available in pharmacies now.

00:27:27.187 --> 00:27:28.850
And you may have heard, remembered

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.110
that two tablet versions
of Plan B, or even using

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.460
birth control pills as
emergency contraception.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.670
Those are now considered to
be completely out of date.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.060
It's just a single tablet.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.290
The other form of emergency contraception

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.350
is called ulipristal acetate, UPA.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.410
So it prevents ovulation even right before

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.760
that egg is ready to leave the ovary.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.860
And it prevents implantation
of a fertilized egg,

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.780
although a much higher dose
of ulipristal is required.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.440
It's taken as a single 30 milligram dose.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.700
And it's labeled all
the way up to five days

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.450
from the day of unprotected intercourse,

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.890
and there's a single product
out there called Ella

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.550
and it has to be prescribed.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.310
And I've already mentioned
that a copper IUD

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.550
can be used within five days
of unprotected intercourse.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.090
It is an off label use,
but widely performed.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.330
And it's a very cost effective approach

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.350
for the person who needs
both emergency contraception

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.320
and then a longer term method
of contraception as well,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.990
and it works for a full 10 years,

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.580
according to the package labeling.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.030
It actually works longer than
that, probably up to 12 years.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.090
Now, an important question
is how can your patient

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.290
get a supply of emergency contraceptives,

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.000
and the answer is is that,
with levonorgestrel pills,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.540
they've been available
over the counter for years,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.420
there are no age restrictions.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.040
Men and women can buy them, a person

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.590
doesn't need to show an ID that has

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.586
anything to do with their age.

00:28:59.586 --> 00:29:04.580
The price range is anywhere
between $40 and $50.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.880
On the other hand,
ulipristal acetate or Ella

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.290
does require a prescription.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.830
The good news is is that, as part of

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.470
the Affordable Care Act,
women who have Medicaid,

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.050
who have commercial
insurance, are entitled to

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.700
18 different methods of contraception,

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.900
including emergency contraceptive pills,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.610
without any cost sharing.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.740
Thing is is that, in
order for the health plan

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.780
or Medi-Cal to pay for the
emergency contraceptive pills,

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.610
either type, prescription
has to be written,

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.880
that's mainly for bookkeeping purposes.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880
But there are no out of pocket costs

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.220
for emergency contraception, as long as

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.930
you're able to have a prescription for it.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.360
If you just buy it over the counter,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.884
then it may be that your health plan

00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:48.520
won't pay for it in that circumstance.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.010
One last thing to mention
about emergency contraception,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.330
and we'll go to our next patient,

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.160
is there is a relationship between

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.940
a person's body weight
and the likelihood that

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.230
the emergency contraception will fail.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.440
So remember, with Jena,
her BMI was over 30, okay.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.380
So basically, this algorithm is

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.430
a patient asks for
emergency contraception.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.960
We counsel her about whether or not

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.070
she'd be interested in a copper IUD.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.210
If she's not, then the next question

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.320
is what's her BMI, her body mass index.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.310
If she's got a BMI of under 35,

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.760
any of the emergency contraceptive options

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.160
are both acceptable and efficacious.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.030
If she's a little overweight,
which is a BMI of 26 to 29,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.080
the levonorgestrel is less effective

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.080
than the ulipristal acetate.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.000
For a BMI of 30 to 34, there's no question

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.460
that the levonorgestrel doesn't work

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.660
nearly as well as ulipristal.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.010
And many of us feel that
it shouldn't even be used

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.870
in a person who has a BMI of over 30,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.040
I would be way more in
favor of using ulipristal

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.570
with Jena than I would
be using levonorgestrel

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.320
because of her body weight
and the likelihood of failure.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.820
And then, for women who
have a BMI of over 35,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.980
neither of them work.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.670
And in that circumstance,
you really have to

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:11.300
use a copper IUD if you wanna
do emergency contraception,

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.560
'cause its efficacy has no
relationship at all to weight.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.460
All right, well, that's
what we'll do for Jena.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.370
The next patient is Paula.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.263
So she is a 24 year old woman who has

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.990
autism spectrum disorder.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.170
She's virginal, she has no
interest in sexual activity.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.980
But she does have unpredictable menses

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.580
and an aversion to
changing her menstrual pads

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.810
and she doesn't even wanna try tampon use.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.510
Given the fact that she's
never had intercourse,

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.970
she's not comfortable putting a tampon in.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.840
She's not had her first
pelvic exam, her BMI is 22.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.570
Her blood pressure is normal.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.100
And now we have two challenges

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.743
in regard to Paula, number one,

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.800
she's really interested in her
menstrual periods stopping.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.320
Doesn't need birth control.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.810
And the question comes up for

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.500
this 24 year old virginal woman,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.520
does she need to have a pelvic exam

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.210
in order to have her first pap smear,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.270
her first cervical cytology?

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.800
So she fits in this part of the algorithm,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.450
where she does have menstrual problems,

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.810
she's not sexually active, and
these are our four choices,

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.750
some of which we've already talked about.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:24.750
So NSAIDs by themselves will
decrease her flow and her pain.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.280
The only side effect are
some of the GI issues

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.420
of stomach irritation
that come up with NSAIDs.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.600
So that may be all she needs, basically.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.270
A levonorgestrel IUD
can potentially make her

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.440
entirely amenorrheic, but again,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.273
we've got issues regarding placement.

00:32:40.273 --> 00:32:42.720
Depo-Provera will do the same thing

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.210
when we're not so
worried about weight gain

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.060
in her circumstance because
she's slender already.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.670
But that's another alternative in terms of

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.630
completely stopping her periods.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.320
Or, again, she can go
with extended continuous

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.770
oral contraceptive use every day

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.400
as a way of stopping
her menstrual bleeding.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.790
So any of those are
reasonable choices for her.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.640
But in her circumstance, given the fact

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.740
that she's virginal, has
an aversion to having

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.100
anything like put into her vagina,

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.980
maybe isn't ready for
her first pelvic exam.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.720
I think in her circumstance,
probably the optimal approach

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.210
is continuous extended
oral contraceptives.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.150
And in that circumstance,
there's simply no reason

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.990
to insist that she have
a pelvic exam performed.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.340
Because it will give quite
effective suppression

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.363
of her menstruation if she's
able to take a pill every day.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.520
It's more forgiving or a
missed pill than cycling,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.820
which means that, if she did
need it for birth control,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.410
when you're taking a pill every single day

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.310
and then miss it for a day or two,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.773
you're unlikely to ovulate.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.890
Consistent every day pill taking

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.780
may be relatively easy or hard,

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.570
depending on her circumstances.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.330
No need for a pelvic examination,

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.160
but her challenges will be to remember

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.280
to take a pill every single day.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.260
Initially, acceptance of
breakthrough bleeding,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.000
which happens, usually,
for the first month or two

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.110
of continuous birth control pills.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.770
And then sometimes, there are problems

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.920
with getting a health plan, even Medi-Cal,

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.590
to pay for a whole year,
16 cycles, basically,

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.590
of oral contraceptives.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.970
They're very used to paying for 13 cycles,

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.780
they sometimes balk at the extra three.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.350
And the way to get around
that is really easy.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.000
You write a Medi-Cal TAR and say

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.730
I need continuous birth
control pills for this patient

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.250
and I need 16 cycles a
year, and the Medi-Cal TAR

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.360
field office will almost always say yes,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.190
as long as you explain why you
need it in that circumstance.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.720
Now, one last thing to mention
about her circumstance is,

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.500
does she need to have a first pap smear?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.670
So let me just take a
side bar for a second

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:50.410
and talk about cancer screening in women

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.010
who have developmental disabilities.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.960
And the first one is
specifically related to cytology,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.520
what I'm gonna tell you
about breast cancer screening

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.120
and ovarian cancer screening
relates to everyone.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.250
So in virginal women, and
that's defined as a woman

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.750
who's never had penetrative
vaginal intercourse,

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.410
the risk of dysplasia,
which is a precursor

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.120
to cervical cancer, is extremely low.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.240
But it's not zero.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.070
So if you compare that to women

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.980
who have had heterosexual
contact or who have had sex

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.400
with women where the risk
is probably somewhat less,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.050
and women who have never
had penetrative sex,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.430
we've known for 500 years that their risk

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.000
of cervical cancer is very low.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.520
But it can still happen,
it's just extremely rare

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.780
in that circumstance, okay.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.030
Now, most, I'm sorry,
it's missing a G there,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.170
it should say most recent
guidelines are silent

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.280
on whether or not virginal women

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.350
should have a cervical cytology or not.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.860
There was an ACOG guideline
that was published in 2010

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.960
that said that, for
women who are virginal,

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.050
irrespective of their
age, we should talk about

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.580
the pros and cons of screening

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.290
and leave the decision to
them as a shared decision.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.270
What I usually tell
virginal patients is that,

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.960
again, your risk of cervical cancer

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.390
is really low, it's not zero.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.230
It's perfectly reasonable if you do want

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.760
a cervical cytology, but
if you wanna postpone that

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.560
until you start sexual activity,

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.110
that is absolutely as reasonable a choice.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.900
And the guidelines would
say that as well, whoops,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.020
wrong direction.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.191
Next question is what about
breast cancer screening?

00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:25.130
You know, this is an
area of great controversy

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.960
at the moment, but basically,
the American Cancer Society

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.470
says that clinical breast
exam is not recommended

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.568
for women of any age.

00:36:34.568 --> 00:36:36.850
So a woman comes in
for a well woman visit,

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.310
disabled or not, ACS is
saying there's no evidence

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.300
to support doing a screening
breast exam for those women,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.430
I think they got it exactly right.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.100
Even ACOG is now saying
that that should be

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.810
a shared decision about
whether or not a woman decides

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.030
that she wants to have a
breast exam done or not.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.870
Now, this, of course, is a screening exam,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.040
not a diagnostic exam
if you have breast pain

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.220
or a breast lump, that sort of thing.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.020
And the mammography guidelines, of course,

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.904
are the same for all women.

00:37:06.904 --> 00:37:09.640
All the guidelines say
basically start at 50,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.430
but that women between 40 and
49 should be given information

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.900
about their pros and cons and be able

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.440
to make their own choice.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.600
Finally, what about
ovarian cancer screening?

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.920
And there's quite a
vigorous debate out there

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.200
about the value of screening pelvic exams.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.640
We are unquestionably
going in the direction

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.670
of abandoning the screening pelvic exam

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.560
in women who have no
symptoms, in women of any age.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.570
That it almost certainly
does more harm than good,

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.300
it's uncomfortable, there are
way too many false positives

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.800
and it doesn't change any outcomes at all.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.490
So if someone were to say okay, well,

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.410
our patient doesn't need a pap smear,

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.010
but doesn't she need a bimanual exam

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.710
to screen for ovarian cancer
or a fibroid or something else?

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.220
The answer to that is no.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.323
Whether she's disabled or not,

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.740
the guidelines are now
almost in uniform agreement

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.590
about the fact that screening pelvic exam

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.930
is unnecessary and probably
does more harm than good.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.250
All right, in our last patient then,

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.420
we'll talk about Elizabeth.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.210
She is 28 years of age.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.040
She has a history of cerebral palsy,

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.630
sorry about the term wheelchair bound,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.023
she needs a wheelchair,
she uses a wheelchair.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.670
But she also has an issue with epilepsy,

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.410
and that is controlled with carbamazepine,

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.610
which is an anti-seizure medication.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.010
She's sexually active with one partner.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.770
She wants to use oral contraceptives,

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.610
but she's open to using other methods.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.960
And here are the challenges
that we have with Elizabeth.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.010
Can she use oral contraceptives,

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.371
given the fact that she
uses an anti-seizure drug

00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:45.440
which induces hepatic
enzymes that would make

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.430
birth control pills less effective?

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.290
Number two, does she need a pelvic exam?

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.140
No.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.940
Number three is, how can
we do an IUD insertion

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.390
in a woman who needs a wheelchair

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.230
and are there any special
sort of accommodations

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.230
that we need to make in that circumstance?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.130
So this is the third and
the last of the pathways

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:08.670
that I'll refer to, so she does
not have menstrual problems.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.890
She is sexually active.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.330
And therefore, we have a whole variety

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.760
of contraceptive methods
that are available to her,

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.810
most of which you've heard about already.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.260
So in going through that
list, the tier one efficacy,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.840
the ones that will work the
best for her, are a copper IUD.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.470
We haven't talked about those much so far

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.690
except for emergency contraception.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.130
They work for at least 10 years,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.203
probably closer to 12 years.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.980
But the one thing they do is they do not

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.660
make periods lighter, if anything,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.453
they make periods a little heavier.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.930
Not in everyone, but at least
in some patients who use them.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.540
The levonorgestrel IUD
we've already talked about.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.970
That would be a reasonable choice,

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.880
as well as a contraceptive implant,

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.730
which is a single rod
that goes under the skin

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.420
of the upper arm, and it works

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.660
for three years, although
there may be some

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.150
unpredictable breakthrough bleeding

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.720
which is associated with it.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.840
It is the single most effective
reversible contraceptive

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.140
that we have.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.860
In addition, we've
already discussed the DMPA

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.880
or Depo-Provera.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.410
She could use the contraceptive patch.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.550
I did not include the
contraceptive vaginal ring

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.500
because it might be a
little difficult for her

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.420
to put in the ring and take it out.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.700
Not always, but that's a possibility.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.000
She could use extended oral contraceptives

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.913
or she could use progestin-only pills,

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.250
which might be preferred
because of the fact

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.620
that they lack estrogen.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.310
But what I wanna finish
up with is this discussion

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.090
about the interaction
of anti-epileptic drugs

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.270
or anti-seizure drugs and
hormonal contraceptives.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.740
Because I know many of your patients

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.840
are not only using those
medications for seizures,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.690
but they might be using them
for a variety of other things.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.490
Oftentimes, psychiatrists think of them

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.010
as mood stabilizers, and so they're used

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.000
with other medications as well.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.830
So when we have to make
decisions about contraception

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.840
in women who have seizure disorders,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.340
our goals are, number one, to make sure

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.240
that we're working with
the primary care provider

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.560
or the neurologist to make sure

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.470
that the seizures are under control.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.890
Number two, we want to make sure

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.870
that she's using highly
effective contraception,

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.850
because if she has an
unintended pregnancy,

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.780
in utero exposure to some of

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.800
those anti-seizure drugs is problematic

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.140
because some of them are
actually teratogenic.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.650
Mildly so, but they're
nonetheless teratogenic.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.520
And then we wanna
minimize this interaction

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.800
between anti-epileptic
drugs and contraceptives,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.020
and they do that, by the way,
by the anti-epileptic drug,

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.950
inducing cytochrome P450 in the liver.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.330
When that happens, estrogen is chewed up

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.530
much more quickly, the
estrogen levels drop by half,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.530
and the method doesn't work as well

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.040
because of the lower blood levels

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.340
of both estrogen and progestin.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.070
So here is a listing of the
various anti-epileptic drugs

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.500
that are a problem with enzyme induction

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.000
that may make hormonal
contraceptives less effective.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.090
I won't read them to you,
but I've indicated in red

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.570
the ones that are sort of the worst actors

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.733
in terms of making
contraceptives less effective.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.190
On the other hand, there
are an equal number

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.920
of anti-seizure medications that

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.840
do not induce hepatic enzymes,

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.770
and none of these are problematic.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.700
That's why it's a thumbs
up, 'cause none of these

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.600
will have any interaction at all

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.623
with hormonal contraceptives.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:34.120
Okay, so how do we
manage that circumstance?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.270
Elizabeth wants to use
birth control pills.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.020
She may be a very very
good candidate for that,

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.500
I'm not so worried about the fact

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.100
that she needs a wheelchair,
I'm more concerned

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.730
about the issue of the interaction
with the carbamazepine.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.300
So her ideal contraceptives
would either be

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.170
either of the IUDs.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.690
DMPA is an excellent choice for women

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.970
who have seizure disorders because

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.440
it not only works really
well and you don't have to

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.580
be reinjected every 12
weeks, it actually has

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.970
a calming effect on the CNS, and it raises

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.280
the seizure threshold.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.270
So women who have seizures,
a seizure problem,

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.130
are actually less likely
to experience them

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.333
if they use DMPA as their
method of contraception.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.430
Elizabeth can use birth control pills,

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.370
we just need to use a higher dose.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.990
So we would use at least a 35 microgram

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.530
estrogen birth control pill,
and instead of 21 days on,

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.520
seven days off, we would choose

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.330
either continuous birth control pills

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.060
or what's called 24/4, which is 24 days on

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.570
and four days off, which
allows a menstrual period

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.450
if Elizabeth wants to do that.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.470
And then, if you're on any
of those enzyme-inducing

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.920
anti-seizure drugs, we try to stay away

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.410
from the contraceptive patch
or progestin-only pills

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.090
because of the fact that the effect

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.670
of the anti-seizure
medication on progestins

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.040
may drop the blood levels of
progestin to the point where

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.110
they're not gonna be effective any longer.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.120
One last thing, let's
assume that Elizabeth

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.953
changes her mind.

00:44:05.953 --> 00:44:08.710
Now she's interested in
having an IUD inserted,

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.440
as we talked about earlier.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.340
So the kinds of things that we think about

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.130
in women's healthcare, this actually comes

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:18.690
from a slide set from ACOG,
and you all are expert and

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.280
I really don't have to
remind you about this, but

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.050
any women's healthcare practice

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.960
or family planning
clinic has to be prepared

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.803
to be able to help women with transfers.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.910
Ideally, that's gonna happen in a context

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.290
where you have an electric table.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.690
San Francisco General,
probably half of our tables

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.630
are electric in our clinic.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.730
And of course, we insist on using those

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.130
in any case where we're gonna need

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.980
to do a wheelchair transfer.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.590
We try really hard not to
do any kind of physical exam

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.030
in a wheelchair, including a breast exam.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.190
Unless the patient insists,
you know, I can't, I won't,

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:57.570
it's not a good time for me to do this.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.730
And then we'll do our
best to try to examine

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.120
our person in a wheelchair,
that's really tough,

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.230
really suboptimal, it's much safer

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.530
to try to do a transfer, and you'll have

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.530
a much more effective
exam in that circumstance.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.770
Have the patient empty her bladder first,

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.750
and then get away from the stirrups,

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.480
they usually do not help.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.030
The alternative positions
are much more effective.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.130
And so the kinds of things
that I would think about doing

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:29.130
are to put in a speculum in a side lying

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.330
knee-chest position, which
actually will give you

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.990
a very very good view of the cervix

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.820
without having to put a woman in stirrups,

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.430
you literally put the
speculum upside down.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.420
And it's not particularly uncomfortable,

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.220
but it gives you an equally good view,

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.380
particularly if you have a person

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.560
who's in a lateral decubitus position,

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.810
what can really help is to have

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.140
a medical assistant hold
one leg up, or sometimes

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.660
the patient can hold her
own leg up with her arms.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.380
If she can't do that,
then assistant, of course,

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.740
has to help with being able to do that.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.640
Another thing that we
do in some circumstances

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.920
is to move the patient all the way down

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.000
to the end of the table
and do what's called

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.060
the diamond position,
and as long as her bottom

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.610
is off the edge of the table, it allows

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.460
a speculum examination
without the discomfort

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.310
of having to use stirrups
in that circumstance.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.810
And Elizabeth might do perfectly
well with her IUD insertion

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:28.010
with one of these
alternative positionings.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.190
So with that, I'll go ahead and stop.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.630
This is the sleeve of our jersey.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:36.310
And the little uterus and the
few drops of menstrual blood

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.651
coming out, but thanks very
much for your attention.

00:46:39.651 --> 00:46:40.484
(applause)

00:46:40.484 --> 00:46:43.734
- [Female Speaker] Thank you very much.
