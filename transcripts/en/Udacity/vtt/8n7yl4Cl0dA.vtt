00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is what happens when we set the step size to 2 days,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which look pretty reasonable with the original curves.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is what we get--the numbers explode to 1.4 * 10⁷⁹--that doesn't look too good.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In case you're wondering about the conservation of the total number,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
some of these variables get huge in a positive direction

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and some of these get huge at the negative direction.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Actually, the total number stays pretty much constant

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
at the price of some of these becoming negative.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
With a step size of 1.9 days, which is the solution, we don't see an explosion, the number stays limited

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but the behavior is, of course, highly implausible.

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now, we look into what's going wrong here.
