00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.670
CHAD: Hi everyone.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.870
Thank you and welcome.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.060
It's a big pleasure to introduce
Chef Ming Tsai today

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.990
here at Google.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.970
And hopefully we got you
fed before you're

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.280
all ready to start.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.290
How was everything?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.550
MING TSAI: Yeah, delicious.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.100
Very good.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.010
CHAD: Great, well,
welcome aboard.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.340
Thank you.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.760
MING TSAI: And the price
was awesome.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.010
CHAD: Can't beat a free lunch.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.880
MING TSAI: Chad, thank you.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.670
No, but seriously, the
food was awesome.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.870
We ate at Root--

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.440
Root, right?

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.560
And had great--

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.480
it must have been king salmon,
tasted like, with squash.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810
And then we went by the Japanese
place, had the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.360
do-your-own ramen, had a piece
of hand roll, smoked salmon,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.190
yogurt, shiso raspberry
and lemon verbena.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.850
And then I had one
other thing.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.460
Oh yeah, [? Cha Xiu Bao ?],
the Chinese place--

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.160
the first original.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.670
I can't remember what it was
called, but really good bun.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.480
So I've eaten three lunches.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150
So thank you.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.250
I love this place.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.680
MING TSAI: Yeah, exactly.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.580
So thank you for being here.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.420
Very excited.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.690
I am here to talk about me,
which is something I can do,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.030
but more importantly
talk about--

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.560
I don't even have a copy--

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.980
my new book, which
looks like--

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.640
Can I borrow your book?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.690
I can afford one, I promise.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.470
Which I'm really
excited about.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.890
And for a cookbook, we've been
calling it "high tech." Now, I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380
understand high tech
and high tech.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.440
This is nothing unusual
for you guys.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.590
But what we've done--

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.940
and if you have followed
me in my career, I've

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.730
been cooking 25 years.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.420
I started on East Meets West
back in the day with Emeril

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.330
and Bobby and those guys.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.120
I've now been-- we're just
celebrating our 10th

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.420
anniversary of "Simply Ming"
on public television, which

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940
I'm proud and honored.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.720
I just need to do 35
more years and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.995
I'll match Julia Child.

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.660
Which I will never.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.530
And my shows and my books--
my fifth book--

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.840
has been for one thing, to
teach people how to cook.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.680
And to hopefully get people to
cook with Asian ingredients

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.440
and learn some techniques,
because once you actually

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.840
learn a foundation and
techniques, you can actually

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.610
start cooking yourself.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.910
And I say this, and most chefs
will say the same thing, a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.795
cookbook is never gospel.

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:19.160
A cookbook should be a
foundation for inspiration,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.175
that you see recipes and say,
oh, that looks pretty cool.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.540
But I'm Mexican and I love
jalapenos so I'm going to add

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.140
jalapeno to this.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.890
And I love lime juice
instead of vinegar.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.700
Once you start doing that,
you're actually cooking.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.800
And that's the point
of the book.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.270
So this is not gospel, but
hopefully this will inspire

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.570
you to create a foundation.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.740
So then when you do go to a
farmer's market or a Whole

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.270
Foods, wherever you shop--

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.850
and the whole idea of the last
two seasons of "Simply Ming,"

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.440
it's called "Simply Ming on
the Fly," which is you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.730
actually-- and I combine-- we
were talking about "Next Iron

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.201
Chef," that stupid show--

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.550
it was an awesome show until
the last episode.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.360
But there's secret ingredients
and then,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.520
boom, we create a dish.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.210
But you, the viewer, have
no idea why we created

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.760
that dish that way.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.260
So the whole idea of the last
few years of "Simply Ming"--

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.375
Jacques Pepin is a
great example.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.740
He was my first guest
for this new series.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.930
We reveal the secretive
protein, which we

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.990
truly have not seen.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.160
So I wanted to keep that
instantaneous of "Iron Chef."

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.930
There was turkey breast
and shrimp.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.610
And I say, Jacques,
you get to choose.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.720
I'm the host, you're
the guest.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.110
So he chose turkey.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.150
And then we shopped--

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.840
we opened the reach-in cooler.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.850
We saw the herbs, we
saw the spices.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.510
And he would articulate why he's
choosing the tarragon,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.750
because back in south of
France with chicken--

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.830
and would explain how
a chef thinks.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.450
And that's, really, I think a
great tool for you, because

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.320
once you understand how we
create dishes, then you can

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.650
start creating yourself.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.210
So to that note-- and
I love doing TV--

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.200
we've added two kind of cool
features to this book.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.640
One, every recipe you'll
see a QR code.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.960
All right?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.520
So using your smartphone--

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.560
which I don't think is an iPhone
in this territory, but

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.130
one of those smartphones--

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.820
you scan it.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.900
You have to sign up the
first time through

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.380
something called ZipList.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.690
If you've been watching my show
the last two seasons,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.450
like "American Idol," there's
digits you can text to.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.060
So if you're actually currently
watching a show, you

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.500
can text those digits.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.520
The shopping list is downloaded
to your phone.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.550
So the same idea.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.870
So now, if you want your
girlfriend, boyfriend,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.750
whatever, wife, to shop, you can
scan it and they can then

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.709
shop for you.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.649
So that's, again, to
make it easy and

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.899
simple for you to cook.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.040
The second thing that we've
done-- because I do my own

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040
food styling.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.170
I actually think some cookbooks
it's a disservice

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.090
that it's so beautiful,
the food.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.770
You make it, then you're like,
what did I do wrong?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.100
You did nothing wrong.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.180
But that's because you didn't
have a food stylist to take

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.430
Q-tips and glass and
gels and spray it.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.050
I serve it just like
the food comes.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.650
So this I would serve like that
in the pot, family style.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.040
And some things are
served in woks.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.420
Some things are served
appetizer sized.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.600
So by doing my own food,
I decided to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.920
shoot it with a camera.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.650
So now there's 80 full-length
videos, one for each recipe.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.446
And as we'll show you
momentarily--

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:59.590
yeah, let's play this little
intro thing here.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.730
Two of each chapter are free.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.520
OK, I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.200
So for example, this is
the first chapter,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.790
which is party platters.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.090
So you can tell, this is live
online at ming.com,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.210
M-I-N-G.com, not M-E-N-G.
Don't confuse it with

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.490
superstar over here.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.570
So the first [INAUDIBLE]--

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.830
we don't have to watch a whole
one, but if you click on it--

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.730
they're short, 10 to 12 minute
videos-- again, done

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.510
just like you saw.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.680
But it walks you through
start to finish

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.080
how to make the dish.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.540
And the joy of this is then--

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.860
go ahead-- you can stop and
start it as much as you want

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.280
off of your tablet or off of
your laptop, but you have to

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.560
buy the book for the recipe.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.710
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.720
OK, he's boring.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.130
So the idea is you have
it start to finish.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.920
And I've always said this--

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.660
and thank you, Cliff,
by the way--

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.900
a picture's worth a
thousand words.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.390
A video's worth a
million words.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.150
Because I don't care how smart
you are-- even all you guys--

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.250
to articulate in words how to
roll sushi is impossible.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.970
It's really hard.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.440
The nori comes inside and the
thumb goes out-- it's

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.910
impossible.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.730
But obviously, with a video,
you're like, oh, that's easy.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.730
It's actually really
not that hard.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.430
But as I was saying, anyone can
go on ming.com right now

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.290
and get 16 videos for free.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.440
They can then also purchase any

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.910
additional video for $0.99.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.170
I personally think I'm worth
$0.99, but that's

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.390
going to be up to you.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.470
You can buy them all for $25,
the balance of the 64 videos.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.550
And you can do all this without
buying the book.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.150
But when I do the video, I just
say add garlic, add soy

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.720
sauce, add ginger.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.020
I don't say how much.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.940
So obviously, because I'm
not a moron, I want

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.240
you to buy the book.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.630
So ideally you buy the book with
the quantities and then

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.220
you use the videos to teach.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.470
Any questions on that?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.970
Ceramic, second-hardest
material in the

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.260
world next to diamond.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.910
Diamond knife, impossible--

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.880
too hard, too brittle,
too expensive.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.630
Ceramic--

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.950
and we're selling three
of them here.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.900
There's white and black.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.300
They're all ceramic.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.410
The black ones, if this means
anything-- and probably for

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.880
you guys, there's
some engineers--

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.580
pressed at 2,000 pounds
so it turns black.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.370
So it's even harder than
the white ones.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.280
Both are incredibly sharp out
of the box, but for a home

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.730
cook, will stay sharp for up to
a year, which is 10 times

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.560
longer than a Wusthof
or Global.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.400
Wusthof and Global and all those
are amazing knives too.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.920
But after two weeks,
they start to dull.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.970
Then, what happens?

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.060
Well, most of you probably don't
go home to a whetstone

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.140
or a wheel to sharpen
your knives.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.030
I would imagine almost none of
you do, because even if you do

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.820
do that, it's hard.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.550
It's a perfect 30 degree
angle and it's a skill.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.300
So you end up using
a dull knife.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.530
And then the dull knife is what
you cut yourself with

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.580
because you slip on a tomato
and your whack yourself.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.380
So the most important thing--
like my kids are 10 and 12.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.370
I give them the sharpest knives
in the house to use,

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.570
because they're going to
actually not cut themselves

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.380
with sharp knives.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.970
They'll cut themselves
with dull knives.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.230
And then they play
tag and stuff.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.480
It's awesome.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.120
One of the challenges used to
be how do you sharpen them.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.565
And you had to send them--
it wasn't bad.

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:23.480
It only took two weeks.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.480
You'd send them to Costa Mesa or
Kyoto, whichever's closer.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.590
Costa Mesa, obviously,
for you all.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.070
And there's a diamond
wheel at Kyocera.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.520
They would sharpen them for
free and send them back.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.730
You paid $8 UPS.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.950
So that's not so bad.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.900
As of last year, we came out
with for $88 or something--

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.020
and Katie's backed there,
you should see her.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.190
I didn't know this, but
it's 50% off online.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.150
kyoceraadvancedceramics.com?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.140
MING TSAI: OK, thank you.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.940
AUDIENCE: He's selling knives.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.840
MING TSAI: Yeah, good.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.650
Anyway, this sharpener is
a diamond sharpener.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.200
It takes two double
A batteries.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.450
It's $80-something
and it's only

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.650
designed for Kyocera knives.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.700
You make three swipes on
each side, you get a

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.640
factory-fresh knife.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.710
So it's awesome.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.720
And the fact that it's double
A battery, you don't need a

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.120
cord, incredibly convenient.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.440
All right, enough of that.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.406
How do you know you have
a sharp knife?

00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:18.026
Take something like
this, an onion.

00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:19.390
Drop it.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.650
The gravity of whatever you
drop-- an apple, an onion, an

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.920
orange-- should stick
like that.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.770
I mean, that actually went
all the way through.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.220
That's a sharp knife.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.460
That's how sharp your knife
should be, always.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.480
It's a great way to motivate
your kids to clean their room.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.360
Clean your room, ha!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.800
So I'm going to start-- because
I'm sure there's one

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.860
person that doesn't know how
to use the knife properly.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.000
So for that one person,
don't raise your hand.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.826
I'm going to show you.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:46.820
The first mistake is people
think you grab

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.890
a knife like this.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.580
Well, go get a martini if
you're like this, OK?

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.930
It's like squash and golf--

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.350
supple in your hand.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.520
And the control is this--

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.060
not even two fingers, one
finger in your thumb.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.620
That's how you grab a
knife, all right?

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.260
Here.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.090
Not this.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.890
This is the rookie move, because
then you slip and you

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.120
cut the side of your finger.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.530
It's this.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.730
Your hand has three other
fingers, so they have to come

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.410
along for the ride.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.800
And they go around the blade.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.150
But it's really this is your
control and power.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.500
But again, really loose
in your hand.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.020
Not so it flops around,
but it's not tight.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.651
So there's two ways
of cutting.

00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:28.640
Let me just cut this in half.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.380
There's two schools
of thought.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.840
When you're cutting, you're
actually using primarily this

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.420
part-- you guys can
see this, right--

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.480
that part of the blade.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.130
Basically, the inch and a half,
two inches closest to

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.980
the handle.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.750
You very seldom use the front
part, because there's so much

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.540
more control, right?

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.160
The fulcrum's so short here,
so there's a control there.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.840
And the idea of cutting is you
either push the blade away or

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.440
you pull the blade
towards you.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.480
Both are equally good.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.780
I'm more of a pusher, because
there's something about

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.300
pulling a blade towards
you I don't like.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.370
So I like to push it.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.200
Now, you'll see the
key, of course, is

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.500
not your right hand.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.080
But it's your left hand.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.280
Because if you're holding your
zucchini like this, you will

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.290
get your nail, then,
of course, skin.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.640
So what you do is you
have fingernails.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.660
And the fingernails--

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.200
that's like an inch away from
the end of my zucchini, right?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.580
And the blade goes up and
down on my knuckles.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.010
And that's why we're using
this part of the knife.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.420
I'm guiding my knife
on my knuckles.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.480
And that's also why I don't lift
the blade all the way up,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.100
because then I can
cut my knuckles.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.660
So by just pushing--

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.790
and when I stop, look how
far I am from it.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.100
There's no way I'm going to cut
off the tip of my finger.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.070
And it's also why I don't
have to look, because I

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.070
know I just move back.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.800
And then eventually you just
keep going like that.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.510
You just move back and
you never-- agh!

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.270
Just kidding.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.190
And you never have to look.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.640
So that's all you have to do.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.340
And it's actually easy, but
you have to practice.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.790
It's not something you're
just going to pick up.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.880
You can't play golf and
squash in one day.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.103
You have to actually practice.

00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:05.770
And you see people use knives--
whoa my god, amazing.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.010
I've been cooking
for 25 years.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.460
I've been sharpening cleavers
with my grandfather for 38

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.430
years, since I was 10.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.720
So I'm 48 now.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.410
So I've been around knives.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.450
But once you learn this
technique, you'll realize,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.165
wow, I could have a cooking
show too, right?

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.690
It's not that hard.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.690
Any questions on that?

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.680
Does everyone kind of do that?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.480
Did anyone have their
finger on the top?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.690
Be honest, come on, I'm not
going to-- this isn't

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.280
videotaped.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.820
You're all professional chefs?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.320
Yes, question?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.410
Well, I mean, in the finale of
"Next Iron Chef," which I was

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.370
in, and I lost.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.170
I got third place, lost to the
two Italian New York chefs,

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.280
which has a history.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.650
And this stays amongst us, OK,
because when I told my agent--

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.110
They asked me three years
in a row to do it.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.280
I'm like, no, no, no, pass.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.340
My agents like, pass.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.580
What do you do-- you've won an
Emmy, you've been on TV.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.820
Why are you going to go up
against, in theory, no-name

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.580
chefs, because a lot of those
chefs, no one knew of yet.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.820
And he goes, why do it?

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.210
So finally, you know--

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:06.980
Sandy's my agent--

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.640
I said, I want to do it for me,
to show that I still have

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.470
game against these 20-year-old
guys with two

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.500
tattoos and four piercings.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.400
And I'm incredibly
competitive.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.190
I mean, I race my kids up
staircases and I win.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.046
I'm like, doon!

00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:21.860
And they're like, Dad!

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.320
And I'm like, what?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.190
Dude, suck a--

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.170
you know.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.160
And I do it because I
won't always win.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.510
One day-- they're 12 and 10.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.810
And within five years, they're
going to beat me.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.510
My wife's like, you've
got to give up.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.420
I said, I'm not going
to give up.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.360
They're going to need
to beat me.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.350
So anyway.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.090
Scrabble--

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.830
and sometimes I let them win,
because you don't want to be

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.410
so, so mean.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.370
Although, I'd rather not.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.510
But my agent said look, you're
not going to win.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.350
I'm like, thanks, Sandy.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.560
And he'd be like, no, no, no.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.400
You're a good chef.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.710
It's that the winner's replacing
Mario Batali, a New

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.610
York Italian chef.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.990
And you are Chinese.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm like, OK, good point.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.530
I'm like, I don't think
it's going to matter.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.130
It's the best chef wins.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.770
All I'm saying is, in the
finals, it was Marco Canora

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.210
and Marc Forgione, two New
York Italian chefs.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.265
I'm not saying it was rigged.

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:09.230
I'm just saying that's
what it was.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.850
When someone--

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.680
so Marco Canora in the finale
was cutting bread with a

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.780
serrated knife.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.570
Not a Kyocera, because
it actually slipped.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.270
Case in point, it slipped on the
crust and it freaking got

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.520
him, like, [KNIFE SOUND].

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.460
I mean, it was--

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.200
you've seen the movie,
right, "Mary"--

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.230
"A bleeder!" It was
a bleeder, man.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.560
It was frigging everywhere.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.970
And so they had to stop tape.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.720
And they first used a little--

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.930
not liquid nitrogen, but
something really cold.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.540
And they wrapped the crap out
of it and then just kept

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.990
going, because blood was getting
in the stuffing.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.200
And so it was like, hey, try
my turkey, you know?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.530
So in those instances
they had to stop.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.790
But in all honesty, I
did enjoy doing it.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.530
It was six weeks,
which I don't--

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.680
You asked why I don't
do it again.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.240
I don't have six more weeks.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.280
It's just a long time
commitment.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.080
And to be honest, been
there, done that.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.060
It was fun to do.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.420
Move on.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.500
I'm going to buy Google
or something.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.105
Actually, you guys
work for me.

00:15:07.105 --> 00:15:10.370
No, I own a few hundred
shares.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.010
So thank you.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.720
[CLAPPING]

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.650
No, no, thank you for--

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.740
and go to $800, please.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.820
It helps me.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.280
Let me help you.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.160
All right, here's a great
tip for bell peppers.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.460
And buy ones that are perfectly
symmetric, because

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.090
they're easy to do.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.010
And I'll show you why when
I break this down.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.490
Sometimes they're all
craggedy and stuff.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.950
A little bit harder
for this trick.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.260
So to break a bell pepper down,
I take both ends off.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.420
And this is still good.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.200
You can still use it.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.140
But watch this.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.330
You take your knife and you put
it on its side to bring--

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.846
can you guys see this?

00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:44.310
Yeah?

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.430
Can you see that here?

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.760
OK.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.540
So you lay it down and then you
roll your bell pepper with

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.920
your knife flat on the board.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.340
That's how you break
down a bell pepper.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.300
And obviously that
would be trash.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.200
But then if you're doing,
let's say, a stir fry or

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.200
something, you can just cut
it in half, julienne.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.760
And bell peppers, I tend to put
this way for the knife.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.545
You could go this way.

00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:15.930
And because these knives are
so sharp, there's no issue.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.770
It is just easier on your
blade to go this way.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.890
And just stack and do
julienne like that.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.140
Easy.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.760
And that's a great little trick
that you'll use forever.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.865
And it's not just a trick,
it actually works.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.180
Mincing an onion--

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.710
hey, these onions are defective,
dude, there's a

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.930
slice in it.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.710
So onion has peel.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.960
Take both ends off.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.390
Now, I find it's easiest to pick
the onion up and just go

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.820
like this across once, because
then you can take your knife

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.720
and you can peel off usually
the first two layers.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.589
When you take the first two
layers, you're going to lose

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.290
one layer of onion, but you'll
see that in that

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.030
one layer of onion--

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.180
like right here, I don't know
if you can see that well.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.589
That's the inner layer.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.690
That one layer's still a little
tough, so that's why

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.862
you only take off that
one inner layer.

00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:23.089
So then you have an onion.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:29.450
Now, onion is nature's easiest
thing to mince, because it's

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.000
in layers, right?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.960
Shrek said it, right?

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.230
What was it, life is like
an onion, you peel back?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.330
You have all these layers.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.410
You don't cut an onion all the
way through, because an

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.570
onion's attached here.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.370
So you guys can see
this, right?

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.930
So I'm going to cut, what is
that, like a quarter inch.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.140
But I'm leaving this little bit
of sliver so this onion

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.000
stays together for me.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.390
And the reason I'm doing that
is if I went all the way

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.980
through, this thing
would fall apart.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.150
And I'm trying to get a
nice, uniform mince.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.720
Now, old school-- and you guys
can see this, right--

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.020
old school in France was then
you take your knife and you

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.960
come straight across,
perpendicular.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.070
The problem with that, and if
you're just learning, and if

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.450
you have a really sharp Kyocera
knife, you go through,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.110
it can slip and you can
actually lose all your

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.150
fingertips.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.550
Ouch, right?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.110
So this is a technique that--

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.360
I don't know if I invented it,
but I use it now because I

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.010
think it's smart.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.180
I've never seen anyone
else do it.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.440
I'm actually going in now at
like a 45 degree angle.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.420
So then if it slips, it goes
into the board, not my finger.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.790
Now, a French chef
would be like,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.910
it's not perfect [FRENCH].

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:35.940
It's not.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.200
It's not a perfect square.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.570
Now, you can imagine the sides
are at 45 degrees.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.680
But is that going to affect the
way the risotto tastes or

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.360
the stir fry tastes?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.850
Of course not.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.990
It actually--

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.350
if I think I remember my
physics, I'm creating more

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.750
surface area now so it's
actually better for flavor.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.040
I'm going to use that.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.370
But I do this because
it's just safer.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.710
So you come across this way.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.620
And then once you get
here, then you

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.580
just go straight down.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.740
And when you do that, you get
perfectly minced onions.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.400
So again, this is not
a technique--

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.760
and people always say, well,
what do you do at the end?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.060
So this is still minced.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.200
This one is still
minced, right?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.520
Now, when I get to
this end, that's

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.810
the end that's attached.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.170
So I usually just do one more
slice and I just turn it on

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.220
its side and then just
go through it.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.760
Again, this is cooking
at home, guys.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.780
No one's going to be like, your
dinner was great, but

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.845
your onions were un-uniform
at the end.

00:19:29.845 --> 00:19:31.190
You can tell them to go--

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.890
you know.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.180
The key is just gentle
control.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.260
That's the key.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.780
And by the way, it does
work if you're

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.400
left-handed, obviously.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.950
There are knives, though,
in Japan--

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.490
the sashimi knives are
one-sided, and you're

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.020
basically--

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.000
you are SOL if you're
left-handed.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.520
Because you can't cut this way
because it's forged that way.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.505
I don't know, what else
can I show you.

00:19:57.505 --> 00:19:58.940
What else do you want to see?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.770
How about a dragon?

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.560
No, I don't do that.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.420
It is year of the dragon, so I
want to tell you about-- so I

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.260
have Blue Ginger.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.120
Has anyone been to
Blue Ginger?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.776
One person?

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.026
They don't let you out?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.870
Thank you.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.210
I hope it was good.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.460
I've had Blue Ginger
14 years by design.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.570
All my chef friends, Mario
Batali and Emeril Lagassi and

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.640
[INAUDIBLE], they all have
15, 20, 30 restaurants.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.670
I've had one for 14 years
for two reasons.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.760
One, for quality of product.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.010
I never want to ever hear that
Blue Ginger used to be a great

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.810
restaurant.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.180
That would actually crush me and
I would consider myself a

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.920
failure if I used to have great
food and then don't.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.120
And two, quality of life.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.720
And like what--

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.250
I love what Google does and
gives you basically

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.000
anything you want.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.730
And I went into your Google
store and I just stuffed my

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.120
backpack and it was all free.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.780
It was awesome.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.390
You guys are fantastic.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.810
Right?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.040
Thank you, Cliff, that was
really nice of you.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.550
He distracted the cashier
and I like--

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.480
we got all these little things
that you stick into the side.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.400
It was awesome.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.530
But I've given in,
so to speak.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.600
But I'm opening up a
new place this--

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.820
before, hopefully,
February 10--

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.420
and I'll tell you why
that's significant--

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.780
called Blue Dragon.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.290
And it's going to be an Asian
gastropub, small--

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.500
80-seat, 2000 square feet-- in
Boston proper, not Wellesley,

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.160
where my current
restaurant is.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.210
And gastropub, you may
not know what it is.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.150
It's very popular, obviously,
in London started.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:27.930
And then Dublin.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.850
And now New York.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.140
It's just really
good pub food.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.410
So we'll have panko-crusted
fish and chips.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.150
We're going to have Asian sloppy
joe sliders for $1

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.030
behind the bar.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.690
We'll have bahn mi for lunch.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.000
We'll have new style sashimis.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.750
We're going to do hacked
Peking duck.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.696
So real Peking duck done the
traditional way-- you blow it

00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:43.920
up and blah blah.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.430
But instead of this fancy carve
the skin then carve the

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.890
meat, which takes a real skill,
for one, but is very

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.190
time consuming, we're just going
to give a whole or 1/2

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.800
duck, hack it Chinese style in
the cleaver so you get bone

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.420
and skin and meat all in one.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.190
So of course we have

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.000
[INAUDIBLE], the moo shu wrappers.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.120
Then we'll have cucumber and
hoisin and all that.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.470
But it'll be a really fun place
place with great draft

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.200
beers, great cocktails.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.330
We're going to have dragon
bowls, like back in the day

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.570
with long straws and you get
completely hammered.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.790
And it'll be fun.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.140
And so that hope-- but that has
to, has to open up before

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.290
February 10, because right now
we're year of the dragon.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.700
I am a dragon.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.220
So I'm either 12,
24, 36, or 48.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.150
Or 60.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.670
I didn't want to even
put that out there.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:33.080
And I do not own an AARP
card, just so you know.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.850
But if you know Chinese
folklore,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.240
there's five elements.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.920
It's year of the water dragon
right now, which happens once

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.350
every 60 years.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.850
So I don't know about you,
I'm not going to live

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.330
another 60, I doubt.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.960
That'd be 108.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.510
That'd be-- really, that's
a lot of soy sauce.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.070
So this is my only time
in my life I'm going

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.180
to see water dragon.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.920
So hence the name Blue Dragon.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.800
So if we open beyond February
10, we have to

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.050
call it Blue Snake.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.850
Better than Blue Rat.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.760
Blue Rat would be a horrible
name, I think, for a

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.160
restaurant.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.870
Let's go to Blue Rat.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.040
Oh, yeah, I hear they have--

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.070
That'd be horrible.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.290
All right, any questions?

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.830
Do I have any plans opening
in California?

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.990
I love San Francisco.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.550
I got married in
San Francisco.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.090
My parents live in Palo Alto.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.480
My dad is a rocket scientist,
literally.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.210
He helps raise money for the
aeronautical school.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.090
He's the foremost designer
of graphite

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.170
material in the world--

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:24.940
composite materials.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.910
The new Airbus 380, Trek
bicycles, golf clubs--

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.950
everything's graphite now.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.570
So the Bay Area would be the
place if I was going to do

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.200
something outside of Boston.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.490
The challenge is then
I have to come here.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.430
Which is no issue, I
love coming here.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.020
But then I'm really not in
the other place at all.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:46.740
My next--

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.105
this other restaurant's four
miles away or 5 miles away.

00:23:50.105 --> 00:23:51.530
I can go back and forth.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.690
But if I build one out here--

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.900
a Blue Ginger concept,
no, because that

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.960
food is fine dining.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:05.030
And either it's awesome or it's
no good, because a lot of

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.080
good cooks and sous
chefs run it.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.640
Blue Dragon the concept, maybe,
because that's going to

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.310
be much simpler food.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.580
And that's something that I
could see maybe coming out.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.900
And if it was, I would
absolutely look around here,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.650
maybe even more than San
Francisco proper.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.220
Because San Francisco proper
is packed with good

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.470
restaurants.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.680
And a lot of great people that
love food live out here.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.230
I mean, some of you might
live in San Fran Cisco.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.990
But I'm sure a majority of
you guys live out here.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.350
And Palo Alto's a fantastic--

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.130
that's like heaven.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.390
I don't think I've ever seen
a cloud in Palo Alto.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.470
Once.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.440
I'm there all the time.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.340
And you have that great Thai
restaurant, which name escapes

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.930
me, in Palo Alto, on
the main street.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.130
It's a woman chef.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.080
Really good Thai food.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.460
But the best Thai food,
for the record--

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.380
you guys travel--

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.330
the best Thai food in North
America, Las Vegas.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.640
A restaurant called
Lotus of Siam.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.270
It is freaking unbelievably
good-- better than any Thai

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.820
food I've had anywhere
else in the country.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.700
Really, I mean it's--
and it's so funny.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.930
10 minutes off the Strip.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.720
And it used to be next
to all these--

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.410
I don't know what it means--

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.890
XXX stores.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.450
It must be a website.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.570
And a wig shop.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.150
So it's in a strip mall.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.550
And the taxi drops you off.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.800
First time I was there, I was
like, are we in the right

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.490
place, dude?

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.510
You know, I'm making
sure I have my

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.830
wallet, looking around.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.750
And you walk in.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.900
It's this little Shangri La.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.070
They have actually
doubled its size.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.760
But it is just delicious
Thai food.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.940
So if in Vegas--

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.930
to be honest, it's the only
reason I go to Vegas.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.610
I'll go there for something or
other reason, to cook or

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.400
something and gamble--

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.910
I'm Chinese so I gamble.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.920
But that's worth the trip.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.810
It's fast for you guys.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.320
You get there in, what
an hour and a half?

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.616
Where are you, San Francisco?

00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:51.910
Yeah, hour and a half, right?

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.090
So anyway.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.850
Any other questions, comments?

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.585
Easy mistake-- yeah, the
common mistakes?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.240
That's a great question,
Cliff.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:07.960
I think people get scared
when they cook scallops

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.285
and fish in a pan.

00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:11.170
They think they have to
use nonstick pans

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.660
so it doesn't stick.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.785
That's not true.

00:26:13.785 --> 00:26:16.350
And again, in one of these
videos, I show you

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.760
how you sear fish.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.230
Get a good pan.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.640
That's key.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.560
Did my voice just break?

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.790
It's that time of the year.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.130
All-Clad is my favorite, because
they're thick and

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.230
they're three-ply.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.620
And they have aluminum.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.280
The expensive ones have copper
inside, but this is aluminum.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.250
I'm talking about the
interior, right?

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.550
And it conducts heat
really well.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.830
So in those pans, not in
nonstick, you make sure you

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:47.440
pre-heat on medium-high heat
for a minute or so.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.110
When you add the oil-- and
I use Canola oil--

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.390
the oil should dance, meaning it
should hit the pan and kind

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.740
of move around.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.120
If it smokes, it's
a little too hot.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.700
Don't panic.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.090
If it actually start smoking
a lot, add a lot of oil.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.070
Seriously.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.750
And that will cool
the pan down.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.150
Then dump that oil into
a stainless steel pan.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.050
It's still good, it just
helped cool it off.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.980
Don't panic and add water
or something stupid.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.340
That would be, ding, not good.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.420
But the oil should dance.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.910
And when you add the oil to a
hot pan, your seasoned piece

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.480
of salmon or scallops, when you
add it to the pan, will

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.230
not stick at all.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.520
It's when you add salmon or
scallops or something to a pan

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.960
that's cold and you add oil to
the cold pan and then heat it

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.610
up, it's not the same thing.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.480
Because the oil changes
its properties when

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.910
it hits a hot pan.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.330
And it's much more viscous.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.120
It does stick--

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.610
and this is the same for all you
guys that like to grill--

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.085
don't do the rookie move
and try to see if

00:27:46.085 --> 00:27:47.120
its stuck or not.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.810
You can tell if its stuck.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.190
Don't try to un-stick it,
because you're just

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.950
going to rip it.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.540
Let it sit there.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.420
Let it cook.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.760
Let it crisp up.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.490
It will un-stick itself, on
the grill or in a pan.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.720
You might have to take
a little bit effort.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.840
But to be honest in a restaurant
when we're cooking

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.110
fish and scallops, it's 70%
cooked on one side.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.930
And you kind of flip it on the
other side and it's gone.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.000
It's not 50-50.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.490
So it's OK that that one side
gets that nice, brown, almost

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.450
crunchy caramelized flavor.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.290
Especially scallops.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.615
I use that as an example because
those will shred.

00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:21.380
If you try to un-stick a
scallop, especially the

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.450
dayboats and the Taylor Bays,
the small ones, if the pan's

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.270
no good, it's going
to just shred up.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.065
Non-sticks are fine, but you
can't get good caramelization

00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:31.120
with a nonstick.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.770
So I like real pans.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.720
Woks, I love too.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.610
One of my favorite tools or
appliances at home is a cast

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.000
iron wok, this big red
one made by Creuset.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.070
And it's thick.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.470
Because we have a Wolf range,
which is a great range.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.350
But the burner's 20,000 BTUs.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.090
My wok burners at Blue Ginger
are 80,000 BTUs apiece.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.150
So that heat is so intense,
nothing is

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.910
ever going to stick.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:59.410
But to generate that heat at
home, if you use an All-Clad

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.000
wok is good.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.100
But Creusets are even
thicker, so they can

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.710
really get super hot.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.010
And the other tip is make sure
your wok doesn't have the wood

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.950
handle or plastic handle.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.630
Make sure it's stainless steel
all the way, because the trick

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.660
you have is you put it into your
oven at 550 degrees for

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.270
10 minutes to preheat the wok.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.410
Then take it out-- obviously
with a towel.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.040
Obviously, leave the towel on
the handle, because someone's

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.870
going to come over
and grab it.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.070
In France, they put flour
on the handle.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.670
And I was in France the
first time like,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.500
Chef, what's that for?

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.450
I burned the crap out--

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.300
It would've been nice if he
told me, but there's a

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.580
learning curve.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:39.820
They have those great suede
kind of slip-on things.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.960
And you put it on the handle.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.860
Those are the best, because
they won't fall off.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.800
But once you pre-heat it at 550,
then you could put it on

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.560
your hot flame.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.850
That flame will keep that
wok screeching hot.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.520
So that "ch" sound you get when
you wok stir, you want to

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.880
always maintain.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.010
Quite often in a lot of recipe
books when you put in the

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.120
whole recipe, [FIZZLING SOUND].

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.430
Then you're braising.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.650
It still will taste good, but
you're not going to get

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.500
everything that wok stirring
is great, which keeps

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.730
vegetables crisp and seals
in the flavor of

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.580
the meat and whatnot.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.920
So you want to keep
that "ch" sound.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.860
And by the way, I kind
of wish I had a pan,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.190
but flipping food--

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.510
easy.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.430
Really easy, but practice,
just like cutting.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.590
You have to actually take dried
rice or dried beans,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.940
frijoles, and put them--

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.990
a cup.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.860
And all you do-- and I don't
have a pan, but all you do--

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.650
and you'll do this.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.340
Go to your back yard, where
no one's watching you.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.960
Don't do it here in front
of your peers, or

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.020
you'll spill it.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.220
Just pull the pan, but at the
very last moment you pull, you

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.650
just flip the front
edge towards you.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.920
Within one minute, you'll
be flipping

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.730
your food in a cascade.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.260
And we do that not
to show off.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.900
We do that because in a real
kitchen, we don't have places

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.020
to put tongs and spoons
and stuff.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.130
And we're using both hands
to quickly mix stuff.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.920
It mixes stuff better and it
also doesn't break stuff up

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.230
like a spoon and tongs would.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.070
So there's a reason we
flip food this way.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.700
But it's a great technique.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.630
And again, I show
it in the book.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.770
It's a great technique.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.170
Again, don't grab the pan like
this, it'll go everywhere.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.200
Is very--

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.250
it's like almost everything.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.200
Do it softly, in a way.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.740
I mean, when you hit a keyboard
hard, you're not

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.001
typing any faster, right?

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.470
Top three restaurants.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.360
That's so hard, but I'll try.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.820
One's closed, which is El Bulli,
which is Ferran Adria's

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.490
restaurant in La Rosas.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.500
So that's not really fair.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.060
I'm not going to tell you how
great my 37, 5 and 1/2 hour

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.920
course meal was because you
can't get there anymore.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.860
But it was.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.500
Thomas Keller, right here
at French Laundry.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.060
He's one of the best in the
world, not just the country.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.790
Much respect for him.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.520
Great friend, amazing chef.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.220
Just so freaking disciplined.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.430
You can walk-- and he does quite
often in his kitchen,

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.210
walks around in white socks.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.260
No shoes.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.790
Because his kitchen floors
are that clean.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.870
Which is a Japanese mentality.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.890
When I worked in Japan, in
Osaka, we had rubber boots on.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.290
And we were hosing down
everything during service.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.620
It wasn't just afterwards.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.875
But I think Keller's
unbelievable.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.800
Best pastry chef in the
world is Pierre Herme.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.310
Pierre Herme, I got to work
with in Paris at Fauchon.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.216
He was the youngest executive
pastry chef

00:32:17.216 --> 00:32:20.020
ever at 28 at Fauchon.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.020
Just a big, jolly guy, although
serious as hell.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.300
And he had-- just to talk
about perfection--

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.840
he had a box, huge box, next to
the "four," the oven, where

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.890
he has five layers like
a gigantic pizza oven.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:37.020
We do all our croissants and
all these [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.790
en pomme, the apple-filled ones,
and pan au chocolat, and

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:40.440
things like that.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.820
They were twice the price at
Fauchon than any other

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.990
boulangerie in Paris.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.550
So there were five francs
apiece rather than 2.50.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.120
We're talking 15,
18 years ago.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.790
And if it had a blemish--

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:57.840
like a micron of croissant
skin off, in the box.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.150
And he had one rule-- eat
as much as anything you

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.010
want, all the time.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.150
So when you first get there,
there's all these amazing

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.580
Belgian chocolates,
croissants.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.230
And you just stuff you
face and after a week

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.530
you don't eat anymore.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.910
It's like when you first get to
Google, you're like, oh my

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.750
god, oh my god, oh my god.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.720
And you eat everything.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.970
And then it's like,
oh, lobster.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.270
Eh, veal.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.253
It's like Alaska-- eagle!

00:33:16.253 --> 00:33:16.596
Eagle!

00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:19.410
And then after three days,
you're like, eagle.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:19.620
Eagle.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.530
Oh, two eagles.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.980
You know.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.640
But PIerre--

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.870
I have a funny story, Pierre.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.965
This was '86.

00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:28.810
And a lot of you--

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.570
I don't know, some of
you weren't alive.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.040
So I got there like 5:30 in
the morning and he was

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.150
sweating and swearing at his
[INAUDIBLE], which is a

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.620
gigantic copper pot,
220 volts.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.730
And he was cooking this really
wet, nasty-looking stuff.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.900
I'm like-- and I speak
fluent French.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.910
I, you know, Pierre,
what are you doing?

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:49.310
[FRENCH]

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.545
And he's just swearing.

00:33:51.545 --> 00:33:54.360
I've never seen him
mad and swearing.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.460
He basically told me this was
fresh pumpkin and he was

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.080
commissioned to make 20 pumpkin
pies at like $80 a

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.280
pop, Fauchon style,
for Thanksgiving.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.840
So either some rich American
client or something wanted 20

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.060
pumpkin pies.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.969
And if you've ever tried to cook
fresh pumpkin, it's just

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.219
a watery mess.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.090
And you can never get
that great puree you

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.770
get out of a can.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.489
So he's swearing and yelling.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.139
I'm like, Chef, I
can help you.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.639
And I was the lowest
out of 20 cooks.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:26.820
Basically, you know, what can
you, lowly cook, do for me?

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.820
And I'm like, I can get you
cans of pumpkin puree.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.280
And he's like, "que?"

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.570
Because my dad, again, he was
chief scientist, but he was at

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.500
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
so civilian, so being a

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.190
SES senior executive, brigadier
general level, he

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.014
had access to the PX,
the US Embassy.

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.730
I'm like, I can get you can.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.889
You want the cans or not?

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:48.130
He goes, yeah, yeah.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.650
So I get to the embassy,
we call the

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:50.610
people, they let me in.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.060
I bring two cases back of
Libby's pumpkin pie mix.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.480
And he opens them up and he's
like, ooh, [FRENCH].

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.800
Because it's actually
really good, right?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.540
I mean, Libby's is the
best, in my opinion.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.340
It's got the little sweetness.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.580
It's got the cinnamon.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.480
And then he's like, [FRENCH]--

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.000
what's the recipe?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.150
I'm like, recipe's right here.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.710
He made that recipe off of
Libby's can-- evaporated milk,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.230
sugar, this, eggs.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.820
Of course, his pastry crust
was awesome, pate sucree--

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.215
delicious.

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:18.730
It was actually the best
pumpkin pie I've

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.450
ever had in my life.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.700
But here's the best pastry chef
in the world reading a

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.080
Libby's can.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.880
[FRENCH]

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.250
So fricking funny.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.380
True story.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.630
True story.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.195
And one of the moments I thought
I was going to be

00:35:32.195 --> 00:35:34.110
actually literally killed
by a chef--

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.930
it never happened-- was also
Pierre Herme, obviously a

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.200
great mentor of mine.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.510
But he also was famous
for blowing sugar.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.800
So I don't know if you know
about blowing sugar, but just

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.290
like blowing glass, you get
sugar so fricking hot--

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.100
I don't care who you are unless
you're Iron Man, it's

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.880
so hard to touch.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.230
But you can make a ball, you
can take straw, whoosh, you

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.870
can blow it and you can make
anything, just like glass.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.940
So he made-- and it took him
like a week and a half, which

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.460
is a long time for him--

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.850
made a Mickey Mouse.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.090
So this was when France was
trying to get Euro Disneyland.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.270
So there was a beaut--

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.450
to the freaking T--

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.390
black buttons, the ears,
the whole nine yards.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.980
Just to give him a photograph,
he can do it.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.370
Gigantic Mickey Mouse, right?

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.620
And he was very proud of it.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.700
[INAUDIBLE] were like, oh, my
god, (WITH FRENCH ACCENT)

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.750
Mickey, Mickey.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.580
That's Mickey in French.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.000
And he put it in the back room
to let it dry two days before

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.160
it goes up into the room.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.370
So this is where all
the freezers were.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.735
Yeah, uh-oh.

00:36:28.735 --> 00:36:31.790
And so I'm back there and
I don't know what--

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.760
you know, sometimes you
just do things and

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.660
you're like, WTF--

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.820
that's "where's the food,"
by the way, just in case.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.570
I said, god, I wanted
to touch his belly.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.456
So I touched his belly.

00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:48.980
And just like in "Animal House,"
right, when John

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.655
Belushi's like, whoa, a--

00:36:50.655 --> 00:36:53.860
my fingerprint of my
thumb ended up

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.280
right on Mickey's belly.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.480
I'm like, holy sh--

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.110
I'm looking around, make
sure no one saw me.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.890
I mean, he would have killed me,
a week and a half of work.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:07.750
And I just scurried away.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.560
And for the next three or four
days, I woke up every night

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.140
screaming and sweating
and crying.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.160
And the dream nightmare was
he's lining us all up.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.990
Let me see your thumb.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.370
And they're like this.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.910
I literally thought, should I
burn my thumbs and then, oh,

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.070
[FRENCH], Chef.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.153
I was like, cut my thumbs off.

00:37:24.153 --> 00:37:25.230
I didn't know what I--

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.470
and then, fortunately it got
into the window and then you

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.650
never saw it again.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.160
And you can't patch it.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.860
The color's in the glass, in
the sugar, so you couldn't

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.830
have painted over it.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.960
I mean, I was just so SOL,
but he never saw it.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.180
So hopefully he doesn't
see this video either.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.460
Thanks, [CHINESE].

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.940
Nice to see you.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.970
All right, sir.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.820
Oh, you know, let me answer--

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.580
continue--

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.020
one Japanese restaurant,
Nobu Matsuhisa.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.450
Matsuhisa, in LA, which
I just was again.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.250
His original, I think,
is phenomenal.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.430
If money is of no object and
Larry's taking you out to

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:06.690
dinner, go to Masa in New York
City, where its $400 a person

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.680
for omikase, before sake.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.270
You'll drop $800, $1,000 each.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.710
So you really need Larry.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.710
Seriously.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.810
But it's pristine
sushi, sashami.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.910
It's uni risotto with white
shaved truffles.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.950
It's foie gras shabu shabu,
which I know you can't have

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.160
here anymore.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.566
And best Chinese is hard.

00:38:28.566 --> 00:38:29.830
It's so hard.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.710
Best dim sum, I think, in San
Francisco, is a small place

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.000
called Ton Kiang, T-O-N
K-I-A-N-G. It's

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.540
Geary and 21st Avenue.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.100
Ton Kiang, fantastic dim sum.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.530
Wu Kong is fantastic.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.860
Yong Sing is fantastic
downtown.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.420
But Ton Kiang in the avenues.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.020
Clement Street's the new
Chinatown, right?

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.520
We lived up in the avenues.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.970
And note this, though.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:58.080
A block more north, on 22nd
between 22nd and 23rd is a

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.700
great place called Tommy's, the
best margarita you'll ever

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.760
have in your life.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.100
I'll be there tonight.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.340
Because actually, if you're in
San Francisco, come to see the

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.260
squash tournament.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.240
There's a huge squash tournament
down there in--

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.410
Embarcadero, is it?

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.550
Something like that.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.570
Outdoor squash, the best squash
players in the world.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.420
Anyway, and I'm a
big squasher.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.320
And again, my brother-in-law's
a coach at Stanford.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.890
So we're all going to
Tommy's tonight.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.790
But the bartenders have arms
like this, because they

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.690
squeeze every lime to order
for every margarita.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.640
So anyway.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.020
I could go on and on and on.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.970
But those are good.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.730
Robichoun, of course,
fantastic in France.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.360
But those are the tops.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.010
Last 20 years, what's
happened to food?

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.360
A lot and nothing, which
is good and bad.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.440
There was this whole molecular
gastronomy the last 15 years--

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.090
exploding this and
all of that.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.860
And liquid nitrogen.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.760
And if you can do it
well, it's genius.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.650
So Ferran Adria, Jose Andres.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:03.520
So Jose Andres at Minibar in
DC, is literally an 8-seat

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.350
kind of sushi bar.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.320
And there you can get
a fantastic meal.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.010
It's impossible to get a
reservation, but you can

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.550
Google it somehow.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:11.370
Closed Saturdays.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.620
No, just kidding.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.840
And there's a guy named Grant
Achatz in Chicago, Alinea.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.490
Genius.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.110
So when you do it right, it's
really the most amazing,

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.090
extraordinary dining
experience ever.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.990
But when you do it wrong,
it's stupid.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.630
Bubble gum taco?

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.360
why?

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.240
Why would you do a
bubble gum taco?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.490
There's no reason to.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.210
And I can't do it.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.550
I mean, I'll do pineapple
caviar, because you can use

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.240
things that-- but that's
for dessert.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.880
But it's not my forte at all.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.620
It takes an army of people.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.910
And then when you do it well,
you charge a fortune because

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:51.980
you have an army of people.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.240
But Alinea right now, is
probably the best of all the

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.130
places that do it
in the world.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:06.090
There is Noma, in Copenhagen,
who's rated

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.900
best chef in the world.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.790
He does.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.120
Rene Redzepi does a
little bit too.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.960
I've never been there.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.210
It's too far.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.290
The whole local movement--

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.330
you being Californians are the
strongest, which is great,

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.560
because you have a 12-month
growing season, so you can

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.800
actually do it.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.640
But sourcing locally, using
all the local, fishing

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.660
sustainably, that's always
been the way in

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.100
Europe, to be honest.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.110
We just went away with it
because we discovered canning

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.690
and preservation.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.520
And freezing.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.420
So when America discovered that
in the mid-1900s, that

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.570
kind of ruined everything.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.740
Because up until 90 years ago,
it used to be all your food

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:54.060
came within 100 miles to
your house, period.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.840
But then once you brought in
frozen TV dinners and canning,

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.820
Campbell's soup and this, then
you could get it from

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.830
everywhere.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.200
So thankfully people
are realizing--

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.030
and we have a four or five
month growing season.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.190
And there's lots of tubers and
stuff in the winter as well.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.710
So even in Boston, we can
do as much as we can.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.610
I'm a huge--

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.640
look, if you get organic
local, that's the best.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.750
But an organic tomato from
California or from Napa

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.630
delivered to Boston versus a
local tomato that I can get in

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.655
Lexington, local is better.

00:42:22.655 --> 00:42:26.250
One, it tastes better, because
you lose so much nutrient

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.300
balance and flavor in
the air coming over.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.210
Two, it's so much better for the
world because you're not

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.870
taking gas.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.590
I mean, I used to serve
Fiji water.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.400
That's stupid.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.990
Water from Fiji?

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.430
The amount of energy and waste
it takes to bring water from

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.260
Fiji when I have water
right here--

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.220
they have these great systems
that you guys have.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.480
Use your tap water
and filter it.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.140
Add bubbles.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.705
So I think that movement is here
to stay because people

00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:54.330
are realizing it's
just smarter.

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.660
And combination because of
recession and times are

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.380
tighter and family structure
is the topic of every

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.060
conversation, regardless of
whether it's the political

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.380
season, but it always is, is
dining family and cooking more

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.885
family style.

00:43:08.885 --> 00:43:13.190
And cooking more simple food,
which is a lot like this book.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.420
I do not try to be a fancy
fine-dining chef at all in the

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.340
cookbook, because who wants
to cook that way?

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.250
It's really more about how can
you entertain, how can you

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.060
make great, tasty
food cheaply?

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.120
Most of these dishes are $20
or less for four people.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.190
Hi.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:30.740
Five minutes left.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.760
Cutting me off, wow.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.660
There's nothing, I think, more
sharing than cooking.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.790
And if you're a father or
mother or a boyfriend,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.960
girlfriend, and you actually
cook for your spouse or your

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.320
family, you're giving
something.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.820
And it's cliche, but you
are giving your love.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.710
You're giving part of
you and offering it.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.300
And it doesn't take that much
skill if you just follow a

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.790
basic recipe.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:07.650
Like, my kids scream and love
Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.690
bok choy, broccoli--

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.760
anything, because what they
smell first is oil and garlic

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.960
or oil and onion.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.390
That smell, like chocolate chip
cookies and baking bread,

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.510
is just smell that is
an aphrodisiac.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.690
They're like, oh my god,
what do we got?

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.510
They're like, Brussels
sprouts, yeah!

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.730
I mean, I don't know how many
kids-- you know, yeah,

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.380
Brussels sprouts, high
five, you know?

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.960
Because they know it's
going to be coated

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.980
in this garlic oil.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.990
And they will eat anything.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.640
And look, they're 10 and 12.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.870
Do they eat chicken fingers
and French fries?

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.200
Yeah.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.050
They're normal kids.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:39.880
And do I sometimes have drive
through, I'm like--

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.450
Oh, you're!

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.445
No, I'm not.

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:41.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.700
No I'm not.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.580
Glasses don't help
for some reason.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.110
Aren't you the--?

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:46.780
No, I'm not.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:46.990
Go.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.240
Give me the fingers.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.030
And that's something I'm
very serious about.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.250
Don't give your kids "kids'
food." What is kids' food?

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.775
Give them the food you're
eating, develop-- especially

00:44:59.775 --> 00:45:02.400
at one and two years old,
once they start--

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.560
give them real food.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.790
Don't give them a tablespoon
of sambal, no.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.240
But give them real food.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:08.910
Let them--

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.880
But my 12-year-old, David, he
will out-eat me in chili now.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.305
And we go to Sichuan
restaurants.

00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:16.070
There's mala soup.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.120
It looks like the Valdez
oil slick of chili oil

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.380
on top of the soup.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.900
And we just kill it.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.110
And he loves it.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.510
But his palate's been developed
for 11 and 1/2

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.590
years, literally since
he was a baby.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.530
So build palate and then kids
will appreciate all foods.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.810
And look, I like chicken fingers
and French fries once

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.290
a month, maybe.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.330
And the other thing--

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:41.256
it's a side note about
food and nutrition.

00:45:41.256 --> 00:45:43.010
Well, two things.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:46.580
Follow me at @chefmingtsai
if you Tweet.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.000
So do that please.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.240
Two, go to TED.com T-E-D--
you know the website.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.750
You guys are on the web a lot.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.620
So TED.com would have actually
a Larry page or a Bill Gates

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.830
or a Bill Clinton or
a Dr. Maya Angelou.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.430
They're the leaders
of any industry

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.140
talking about something.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.290
Search Doctor William Li, L-I.
He has started something

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.930
called the Angiogenesis
Foundation, started by Judah

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.730
Folkman 20 years ago.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.490
Angiogenesis, in a nutshell,
is going to be the next 50

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:16.220
years of how we're going
to keep disease-free.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.200
You are what you eat.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.980
And he has proven that if you
eat the right groups of food--

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.300
some are logical-- green leafy
vegetables, mushrooms, a

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.940
certain type of olive oil,
cooked tomatoes over raw

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.500
tomatoes, dark chicken meat
over white chicken meat--

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.220
which is a great thing from
chefs' point of view, because

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.240
it's cheaper, tastes
better, all that--

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.310
because there's K2 in dark
chicken meat, which helps your

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:35.610
blood better.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.130
Angiogenesis is something
naturally

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.150
occurring in your body.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:42.130
Menstruation, placenta creation,
scab formation is

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:42.430
angiogenesis.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.910
You need it balanced
and you're fine.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.010
When it's imbalanced by a bad
diet, the blood vessels go to

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.750
cells you don't want to get fed,
which are cancer cells

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.480
and fatty cells.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.530
You get a cancer tumor,
you get obesity.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.020
So if you eat the right groups
of stuff, you can actually

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.830
never get sick.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.160
You'll never need a drug.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.520
So that's powerful stuff.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.040
And Dr. Li and I have
partnered together.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.310
And we're trying to
help, actually.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.630
We want to change the
world by food.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.960
Because drugs now, you develop
a drug, it costs $20 million

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.680
to develop the drug.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.010
By the time it's devolved, it's
already half obsolete

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:17.620
because the disease
has changed.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.020
And two, you have this long of
things that happen to you if

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.755
you take the drug, including
death and suicide.

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:24.840
Which are pretty bad side
effects, I think.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.980
I mean, it might have cured
this, but now you're suicidal.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.830
Anyway, I think there's
something to

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.160
be said about that.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:31.920
Any other questions?

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.190
I think my time is up.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.210
So listen, I'm here
to sign books.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.535
You don't have to buy books.

00:47:36.535 --> 00:47:38.540
But if you do, my children
may go to college.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.940
So thank you.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.320
I have Katie back there,
Kyocera, I've known for well

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:42.990
over a decade.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.830
We have three of these knives.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.350
They're incredibly
affordable now.

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.340
Kyocera, when I started with
them they were twice the cost

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.990
of Wusthof and whatnot.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.010
They're the same price.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.940
This is our newest.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.800
This is a micro-serrated.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.920
So for tomatoes or bread,
unbelievably sharp knives.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.410
They're all incredibly sharp.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.770
Christmas is December
25 this year.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.310
Hanukkah's right around
that too.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.380
Get a sharpener.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.580
And I thank you all very much.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.830
Appreciate it.
