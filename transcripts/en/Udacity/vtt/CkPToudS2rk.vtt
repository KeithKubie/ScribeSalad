00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's take a moment to meditate on the fact that this code, like many

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.670
class patterns in Java Script, has two distinct and very different sections.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.840
This will be true of every pseudo classical, prototypal, and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.330
functional shared class that you write.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.920
One section, you will find specifying how all the instances of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.910
a class should be similar.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000
In the case of the pseudo classical pattern,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.700
these similarities are generally stored as properties of the prototype object.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.030
In the other section, you'll be writing code that specifies how

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.780
each instance should be different from all the other instances.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.960
As with most programming languages, this will take place inside the body of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.060
the Constructor Function, and it'll allow us to specify how one instance of

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.370
the class will be different from another instance of the class.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.280
All of the work that gets done to specify that Amy and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.710
Ben have unique locations is done inside that Constructor Function.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.920
For now, this is just an interesting observation about classes, but

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.640
knowing that these two categories of code exist for every class will

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.379
become very important later when we start to discuss subclassing.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.600
Looking back at the functional version of this class for

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.860
a moment, it's also interesting to notice that functional classes without shared

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.060
methods make no such distinction.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.000
In this style, all the code for both categories appears in one place.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.240
The similarities and the differences across instances appear here,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.030
indented two spaces inside the car function.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.060
Depending on your perspective, you could call this an asset or

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.560
a failing of the functional pattern.
