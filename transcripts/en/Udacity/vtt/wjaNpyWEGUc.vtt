00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.870
One of the surprising things about network speed is that a

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.100
lot of what determines the end to end speed of a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.560
network in practice is not the throughput, how fast you can

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.730
push bits through the channel, but the latency, the time it takes

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240
to get a response from the other end. Let's take a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.130
look at where that latency comes from. For each HTTP request, even

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.070
after we've gotten the radio to wake up, we have to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.420
do a DNS lookup to figure out what that domain name server

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.100
actually means in terms of IP number. We have

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.830
to make a socket connection to that site. We

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.920
have to actually send the HTTP request and then

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.120
we actually get our data back. Each one of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.990
these steps takes time. On an LTE network, each

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.480
one of these requests takes between 240 and 500

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.270
milliseconds, depending on whether we already have a connection

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.680
going or not. On 3G, each request will take 600

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.280
milliseconds to 3.5 seconds, that's per every HTTP request.
