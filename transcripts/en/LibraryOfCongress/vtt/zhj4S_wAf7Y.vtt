00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.430
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Abella:
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.730
I hope you can hear me.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.020
Welcome to the National
Book Festival's teen stage.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.220
I'm Jennifer Abella, a copy
editor at the "Washington Post."

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.280
Which is a charter sponsor of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.220
I'm a huge fan of YA books.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.320
So I'm very excited to
announce our next guest.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.390
Before we get started, a word
of thanks to our cochairman

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.600
of the festival,
David Rubenstein,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.050
and the other generous sponsors

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.930
who have made this
fantastic event possible.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.420
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.310
there's information
in your programs.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.400
We'll have some time
after the presentation

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.160
for questions and answers.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.600
There's microphones in
the aisles for that.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.350
If you do come to the mic,
I've been asked to remind you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.230
that you will be included in
a videotape of this event.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.580
So what you say will be
recorded for posterity,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.370
and it may be broadcast
at later date.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.320
It's my pleasure to introduce
our next guest, Robin Benway.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240
Robin made a name for herself

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.190
with her first book
"Audrey, Wait!"

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.600
in 2008. And followed it
up with books such as her

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.900
"Also Known As" series.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.930
And "Emmy and Oliver."

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.360
Her sixth book "Far
From the Tree,"

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.640
which I will admit made me
cry, is about three teenagers

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.940
from different worlds

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.090
who discover they are
biological siblings.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.990
It earned her the 2017
National Book Award

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.120
for young people's literature.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.490
She'll be signing
books, by the way,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.530
at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.110
In all of her books, Robin
explores the lives of teenagers

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.550
with heart and humanity
and humor.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.510
Please welcome to the
stage Robin Benway.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.340
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Okay,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.640
can everyone hear me
okay into the mic?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.940
Thank you.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.240
Thank you so much for having me.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.100
This is my first year at
the National Book Festival.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.380
And it's 30 years since
I was actually in DC.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.550
The last time I was
here, I was 12.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.530
And I was with my dad
and my grandparents.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.220
We drove here from Connecticut
in my grandpa's Honda Civic.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.310
He wouldn't stop for food
because he was old-school.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210
My grandma fed us Tic
Tacs in the back seat.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.110
And I never ever thought

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.750
that the next time I would be
here they would all be gone.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.290
And I would be here at the
Library of Congress and speaking

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.370
at a book festival with
the National Book Awards.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.340
So I'm having a very
beautiful emotional experience

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.640
at your book festival.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.490
So thank you so much.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.200
Yes, I am the author
of six books.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.070
I live in Los Angeles,
California.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.550
My most recent book,
as you heard,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.200
has made many people
cry, as they tell me.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.150
And it is called
"Far From the Tree."

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.030
It is about three siblings
all of whom were placed

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.020
for adoption as babies.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.390
The middle sister, they
don't know about each other.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.980
And the book opens when the
middle sister Grace is 16.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.440
And she herself gets pregnant
and decides that she wants

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.930
to place her daughter
for adoption as well.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.400
And in doing so, realizes

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.320
that she suddenly feels
a very strong connection

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.430
to her birth mother
whom she has never met.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.730
And she goes in search of her.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.220
And instead finds her
younger sister Maya.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.690
And her older brother Joaquin.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.330
Maya was also adopted.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.130
She was adopted into
a family of redheads.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.480
It is very easy to tell
who the adopted child is

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.780
in their family.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.110
And their older brother Joaquin
is actually half Mexican.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.490
And so he was never adopted.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.130
He wound up in foster care.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.280
And at the point that the
book begins, he is 17,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920
about to age out of foster care.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.300
And he is convinced that
he will never be adopted.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.300
And he's doing everything
in his power to make sure

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.890
that his wonderful foster
family does not keep him.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.560
So, like I said,
it's my sixth book.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.590
And I always thought
that it would get easier.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.920
You know, the more you do
something, the easier it gets.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.950
Turns out, like many things in
publishing, that is not true

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.040
in the publishing world.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.890
Each book has been
progressively harder.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.660
Which I was not expecting.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.130
And so usually, when I talk
about "Far From the Tree,"

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.430
I try to tell you a little bit

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.970
about the writing
experience of it.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.050
Because, like I said, it's the
hardest book I've ever written.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.060
And actually I thought it was
the death knell of my career.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.660
That did not happen,
it turns out.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.510
But I thought that
my career was over.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.610
And I try really lift the veil

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.600
on what it's like
to be a writer.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.870
And how many times you have
to start over and over again.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.050
I think in our days of social
media and Instagram filters,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.820
it's very easy to think,
oh, you wrote a book.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.120
And now it's out.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.420
And now you're going
to write another book.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.720
And it's out.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.020
And that's not always the case.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.770
And I know growing up,
I never met a writer.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.150
I didn't know anything
about being a writer.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.120
So I always tried to say
this is what it looks like.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.820
So, like I said, when I was a
kid, I wanted to be a writer.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.700
I wrote my very first
story, it was one page long,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.080
in a spiral notebook when
I was eight years old.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.820
And I reread that story
more than anything else.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.120
Because I couldn't believe

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.920
that I could actually see
the words again and again.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.650
I had a rough time in school.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.770
I don't know if bullied
was the right word.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.170
But I was very sensitive.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.740
And I would come home
at the end of the day

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.720
and rewrite my day
where I was the hero.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.130
And the cute boy liked me.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.650
And I basically say that I
wrote fan fiction about myself

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.230
when I was nine years old.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.210
Which maybe is healthy,
maybe it's not.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.610
I'm not sure.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.910
But I loved writing.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.890
But I didn't meet any writers.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.000
My mom was a real estate agent
and my dad fixed computers.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I never had an author
come to our school.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.330
And I certainly didn't know
about any book festivals

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.800
where I could go
hear authors speak.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.770
So I was the type A kid.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.070
AP classes.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.370
You're going to go to college.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.790
Writing is fun, and you
can do it on the side.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.560
Because you need a 401 K. You
know, you need a real job.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.170
And so I graduated from college.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.910
And I became a book publicist.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.470
I worked for Random House.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.450
And I planned all
the book tours.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.740
And it was the very
first time in my life

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.600
that I was around authors.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.730
And I could see they
were real people.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.600
Like when I was growing
up, I thought Judy Bloom

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.520
and Ann M. Martin, like lived
in a house on top of a hill.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.810
Like they didn't feel like real
living breathing people to me.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.560
And for the first time
I could see authors.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.800
And so I started to realize
that maybe, I mean, not for me,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.850
but certainly someone else
could maybe be a writer being

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.150
in this position.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.450
But I could never
actually publish a book.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.910
I couldn't even finish
a short story.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.250
And, but I loved writing.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.560
And from that job, I worked
at an independent bookstore.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.200
Loved my indie bookstores.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.460
I became a sales rep for a
really big textbook company.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.430
And I was the worst
sales rep they ever had.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.610
And I know this because
they told me.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.670
And they said, you are the
worst sales rep we've ever had.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.970
And they were right.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.410
And I realized that I
was just sort of doing,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.280
I was circling being a writer.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.680
I was doing everything in my
power, but I wasn't quite ready

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.980
to take that step yet.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.710
Because the thing with being a
writer was that it was my dream.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.910
And if I, it was the
thing that got me

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.370
through all those bad jobs.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.290
And all of those
days stuck at a desk

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.590
that I didn't want to be there.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.550
And I would think, well, one
day when I'm a famous writer.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.420
And it was the thing
that kept me going.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.060
And the thing is about
taking that leap,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.890
is that you might
lose that dream.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.030
You know, if you, if
I couldn't achieve it,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.080
what would I have
to look toward?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.070
And so I was really
scared of doing that.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.420
And then I hit a point in
my life where in the course

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.160
of a year my father passed away.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.530
Grandmother passed away.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.020
And I was diagnosed
with gluten intolerance.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.370
Which isn't as funny
as it sounds.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.440
Everyone likes to make fun
of my gluten intolerance.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.820
And type one diabetes.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.760
So I became insulin dependent
all in the course of a year.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.720
And I just had a moment where
I, like, almost like the movies.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.430
Like "The Matrix," where
everything just comes

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.910
into very clear focus.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.160
I was like, I need to do,
I need to take the leap.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.690
I need to quit this
job, sales rep.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.080
They were happy to see me go.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.100
And I was like, I have to,
I'm going to become a writer.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.060
So I applied to MFA programs.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.580
I'd never have a
problem applying

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.880
and getting into things.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.490
Very, you know, again,
type A student.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.740
Got rejected from all my MFA
programs on the same day.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.320
So that was a fun day
at the mailbox for sure.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.120
And I thought, well, I tried.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.640
I tried. I, if I can't
get into an MFA program,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.210
how am I going to write a book?

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.510
And someone said to me, well,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.910
why don't you just
write the book?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.500
And I thought, but don't
you have to go to school?

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.560
Like don't you have
to get a degree?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.580
Don't you have to pay
$50,000 to write a book?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.040
And they were like,
just start writing.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.570
So I quit my job.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.510
I took a young adult
fiction course at UCLA.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.210
And I, the very, assignment

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.610
of that class was
write a first chapter.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.830
And the first chapter that I
wrote is still to this day,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.110
word-for-word, the first
chapter of my first book.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.410
It's called "Audrey, Wait!"

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.150
It's about a girl whose
boyfriend breaks up with her.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.450
She breaks up with
her boyfriend.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.750
He's in a band.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.050
He's a terrible boyfriend.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.350
It was definitely the right
decision to break up with him.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.890
He writes a retaliation song

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.190
about what a bad
girlfriend she is.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.930
And it becomes the number
one song in the country.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.700
And at the time I
wrote it, I thought,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.200
why would anyone ever be
famous just for being famous?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.790
That makes no sense.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:41.710
And 11 years later that book
feels oddly predictive now.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.950
But that was my very first book.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.600
And suddenly the
dream was happening.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.230
And I thought, oh, I did it.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.530
You know, done and dusted.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.000
Wrote a book done.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.300
You know, this is my career.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.520
And then I kept writing, and
it started getting harder.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.940
And the metaphor that I
give is that you're still

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.400
on the tight rope, but you
just keep getting higher off

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.700
the ground.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.000
You feel like you
have expectations,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.300
and you have readers.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.980
Which is the most
beautiful, wonderful thing.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.110
And yet you want to make
sure that everyone is happy.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.410
You want to make sure

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.770
that people are still
enjoying what you're doing.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.010
So I wrote a book about
sisters with super powers.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.310
I wrote a spy series.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.610
If you ever write books,

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.610
I highly recommend
writing a spy series.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.770
Because the research
is so much fun.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.860
And I'm sure I have
an FBI file now too.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.670
But it was all in good fun.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.730
I wrote a book about
parental abduction.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.890
By the time my fifth book
came out, it was 2015.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.720
I had one more book
on my contract,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.490
and I completely stalled out.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.490
I was in a panic.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.130
I was in a blind panic because,
just to give you an idea.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.150
"Far From the Tree" should
have come out June of 2016.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.190
It published October of 2017.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.000
Which, when you're under book
contract with a major publisher,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.570
is not a fun conversation or
several conversations to have.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.500
But I suddenly found
myself unable to come

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.530
up with an idea or a story.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.040
I started an idea, which
I don't talk about.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.720
Because I always worry that
one day it will become a book,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.020
and I don't want
to spoil anything.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.410
So I had an idea.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.210
And I was spinning my wheels.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.450
And so someone said, you need
to get an Excel spreadsheet.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.860
I am a writer because I don't
want to use Excel spreadsheets.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.160
But I thought, okay,
clearly I need a jump.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.580
I need a kick.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.210
So I got an Excel spreadsheet.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.820
And it said, you have to
write this many words per day,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.290
you know, to finish your book.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.590
And I was like, great.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.460
Perfect. Finally someone's
telling me what to do.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.710
And I was writing
1,000 words a day

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.250
so my little spreadsheet
wouldn't get red.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.740
And I kept it in the black.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.420
And they were the worst words
I have probably ever written

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.720
in my career.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.020
It was like when you're
a kid and you have

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.670
to write a 50-word
paragraph or essay.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.430
And you're like, it was
very, very, very, very good.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.280
You know, it was padding.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.440
And I got about 15,000 words
into this book, and I gave it

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.410
to my agent, who I've
known since 2006.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.890
So she's brutally honest,
which is why I love her.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.530
And she said, this
is not your book.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.830
This is not a good book.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.130
You are just circling here.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.330
And that was crushing because I
had never not completed a book.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.140
And I had never not
able to do that.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.570
And meanwhile, my publisher
is expecting a book.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.430
You know, it's 2015.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.550
They should have had
a book by this point.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.920
And so I went back, and
I worked on another idea.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.780
And that one was spinning
the drain as well.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.850
And I started to make
my peace with the fact

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.860
that this might be
the end of my run.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.590
That I got five books,
what a miracle.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.250
I, how lucky am I to
have written five books

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.170
that have been published
around the world?

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.470
No one should be that lucky.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.300
And I thought, okay, like,
maybe I need to make my peace

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.980
with the fact that this
is going to be over now.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.540
And I called my mom one night.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.840
It was 5:00 in the morning.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.210
And because she's my
mom, she answered,

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.510
where most people wouldn't.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.810
And I was sobbing.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.120
And I told her, I
think it's over.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.550
Like I really think this
career of mine is over.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.850
And she listened.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.150
And then she said, no, it's not.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.450
And I was like, mom,
you don't know.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.970
Like, you're not
in publishing, mom.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.840
Like, and she's like,
no, you're not done.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.880
And I said, okay, well, that's
nice to hear, and I'm done.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.790
And I had to send a
letter to my editor.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.810
And a big e-mail,
which was crushing.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.680
And I said, I don't
have a book for you.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.980
I am so sorry.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.470
I wanted to give back my advance

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.960
that they had paid
me for this book.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.260
My agent said, you're not

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.560
because the paperwork
is a nightmare.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.860
And I don't want to
do the paperwork.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.100
So you're not paying
back your advance.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.430
And I, it was, I always say the
worst heartbreak of my life.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.730
It was the worst breakup.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.660
The idea that this thing
I have loved for so long,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.010
I couldn't hang on
to it anymore.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.180
Like why don't we each
other the way we used to?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.480
You know, I couldn't keep it.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.960
And it was going, I
felt like it was going

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.560
to someone else who
deserved it more.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.070
So cut to me in a parking lot in
2015 at Costco with my mother.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.000
Which is still a thing you
do as an adult apparently,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.270
is you're in a Costco
parking lot with your mom.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.410
And I was listening to
a song on the radio.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.890
It was a Florence
and the Machine song,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.190
if you know Florence.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.490
Which, if you don't, I
highly recommend you get

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.790
to know Florence
and the Machine.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.100
It was a lyric from
her song "Cosmic Love."

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.380
And it, the line was,
a falling star fell

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.190
from your heart and
landed in my eye.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.640
And I immediately, and I've
heard that song so many times.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.940
So many times.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.240
And so many times after.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.200
And for some reason
that lyric made me go,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.990
this book is about adoption.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.860
And it made me think of a
birth mother having a child.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.680
Placing that child for adoption.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.220
And hoping that somehow that
child will carry the love

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.300
of the birth mother even though
that child may never know her.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.130
And I owe Florence so much.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.830
I owe her royalties
and residuals.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.630
Because in that parking
lot I grabbed my phone,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.970
and I typed out the whole
e-mail to my editor.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.200
And I said, this book
is about three siblings.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.500
And their names are Joaquin.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.800
Maya. And Grace.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.100
It was like they just arrived.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.990
They took their sweet time,
and they finally arrived.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.990
And I said, I want
to tell this story.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.540
I want to talk about adoption.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.860
And I want to talk
about foster care.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.540
And I want to talk
about siblings.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.480
I think the sibling relationship
is one of the most beautiful

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.110
and maddening and frustrating

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.410
and lengthy experiences
of your life.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.710
And so I wanted to
talk about that.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.190
And I was like, finally,
I have an idea.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.070
Great. I'm going to sit down.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.210
I'm going to write the book.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.900
And it stalled out again.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.140
And I was writing it entirely
from Grace's perspective.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.240
The book opens with her having
her child by, no spoilers.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.650
By page two she's giving birth.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.090
So I didn't ruin
anything for you.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.740
But she started telling
the story.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.190
And she was talking
all about it,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.500
and I could not get
past page 100.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.460
And it was another
heartbreak for me.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.870
I thought, oh, here we go again.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.480
You know, just that
sickening feeling

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.770
of this is almost over again.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.660
And so I went back,
and I read it.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.400
And I thought this is so boring.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.030
And this is the most boring
book I have every written.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.330
And this really, okay.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.960
So now I was just resigned.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.340
I was like, okay, this is over.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.650
Why am I dragging nit out?

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.150
Let me just stop.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.450
So I went to lunch
with a good friend

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.750
of mine to cry and lament.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.200
And she said, you should go
talk to a friend of mine,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.900
that he is a foster parent

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.300
who recently adopted two
boys out of foster care.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.700
You should go meet with them.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.910
So I did. I met with her
friend who is now my friend.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.940
I met with his boys who were
seven and nine, eight and ten.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.560
And we walked them
to karate class.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.860
And the dad sat, and he talked
to me all about the trials

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.890
and tribulations and
beauty and heartbreak

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.960
of adopting these
two wonderful boys.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.620
And on the way back from karate
class, the youngest one said,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.840
do you want a piece of gum?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.670
He meant the one
that he was chewing.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.090
And I said, no, I'm good.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.390
Thank you.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.640
And then right up in front of
my face a little half piece

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.980
of chewed gum came up like that.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.920
And it broke, it was, ironically
it was such a sweet gesture.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.240
And it was so sweet that
he wanted to share this.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.710
And on the way home, I was like,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.530
Grace cannot tell
everyone else's story.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.830
She can't tell her brother
and her sister's story.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.130
They have to tell it.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.290
The way that these boys have
to be able to tell their story

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.700
to me, Joaquin in the book needs
to be able to tell his story.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.220
And I went home, and I saw my
neighbor who was a painter.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.820
And he said, how
is your book going?

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.980
Which is a very brave question
for someone to ask a writer.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.900
Tread lightly when
you ask that question.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.020
And I said, well, I think I need
to rewrite the entire thing.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.490
And he goes, well, that
sounds really hard.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.690
And I was like, yeah,
it does; doesn't it?

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.900
Yeah. And I went home,
and I tore it apart.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.910
And I tore Grace's
chapters apart.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.210
And I flipped it.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.510
And the second I sat
down to write my,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.440
I wrote 3,000 words in an hour.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.990
Which is not how I norm,
just so we're clear,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.580
that is not my normal pace.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.790
And it was like they had been
waiting for me to find them

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.090
in a very strange way.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.770
Sometimes I have found that
characters can be very elusive.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.640
Especially ones who
have secrets.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.190
Grace is very up front about
the fact that she had a baby.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.580
She was the very first person,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.410
character to start
talking to me.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.940
But Maya was very reticent.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.240
And she was very angry.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.310
And I started writing
Maya's pages, and I realized

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.960
that her mom always had a
glass of wine in her hand.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.300
Her mom was always
drinking wine.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.960
And I was like, what's
happening over here?

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.580
Like why are you drinking wine?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.510
And I realized that
that was Maya's secret.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.930
That she is hiding her
mother's alcoholism.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.420
That she is hiding it
to protect her family.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.400
And it's slowly starting
to destroy her

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.560
because she is unable
to fully enter

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.500
into her relationship
with her girlfriend.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.230
Because she has no idea how to
be open and honest with someone.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.950
And I would have never known

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.560
that if Grace had
told her story.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.490
You know, Grace didn't
know that in the beginning.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.750
And then for Joaquin, like I
said, he grew up in foster care.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.710
He has a very, very dark secret
of something that has happened

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.620
to him while he was
in foster care.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.500
And he did not tell me
that secret for months.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.900
I could not figure out what
Joaquin was hiding from me.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.900
I should stop and say like,
when I talk about these things,

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.320
my mom is always like,
but they're in your head.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.930
Like what do you
mean you don't know?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.800
Don't, you have to know.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.220
And it is a very strange
alchemy of being a writer.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.030
You are meeting people

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.480
and watching them reveal
parts of themselves to you.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.830
And I feel like I have been on
this journey with Grace and Maya

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.790
and Joaquin for so long.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.670
Like after the National Book
Awards, my very first thought

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.600
after like, oh my,
what just happened,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.860
was I can't wait to tell them.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.480
And they're not waiting for
me to tell them anything.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.130
But when I was researching
Joaquin, I read an article

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.850
that said, it was
by, with an actor,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.150
an interview with an actor.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.610
And he said, every character
has something they're trying

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.910
to hide.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.930
And something, and the closer
that they get to revealing that,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.750
that's where the
tension comes in.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.240
And I really clung to that as
I was digging around trying

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.030
to go find out Joaquin's secret.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.010
And then I started interviewing
every single person I had

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.310
ever met.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.840
If I heard that you were adopted
or adopted a child in the time

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.140
that I was writing
"Far From the Tree,"

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.810
I interviewed you probably.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.660
I talked to adoption attorneys.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.420
I talked to foster care parents.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.720
I talked to social workers.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.020
Former foster kids.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.670
Adoptees. Talked to people
who had wonderful experiences.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.780
And people who had had
absolutely horrific experiences.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.620
I wanted to talk to
every single person.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.020
Because a big part of what was
going on for me was, is this,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.850
are these my stories to tell?

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.620
We talk a lot about it
in young literature.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.640
Especially whose
story are you telling?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.610
And is this your, should
you be telling this story?

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.030
And for a long time I tried not
to tell the story, as you heard.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.410
I did not want to
write this book.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.440
And the book didn't seem
to want to be written.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.060
But the characters never left.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.510
And instead they got
stronger and stronger.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.470
And I had to start listening
to what they were saying.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.090
And finally I realized that I'm
just going to write a draft.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.430
I'm just going to
see what happens.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.970
And if it's terrible, someone
will tell me, I am sure.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.830
Hopefully before it hits
Goodreads and social media.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.950
And I will know it's bad,
and I'll just scrap it.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.200
And I'll figure out
my next step.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.150
I talked to every single person

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.570
that I had ever met
in my entire life.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.430
And what I started
to realize was

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.550
that I can't tell
everybody's story in a book.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.320
And, actually, if I do try to do
that, the book will not be good.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.300
You know, it will try to be
all things to all people.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.420
And it will not be
what it should be.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.290
I realized I had to
tell three stories.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.590
I had to tell Grace's story.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.060
Maya's story.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.360
And Joaquin's story.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.420
And those were the three
stories that mattered the most.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.040
And so I tried to make them
as specific as possible.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.500
And some people didn't see
themselves in the book.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.900
You know, I've gotten e-mails

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.350
from so many people
around the country.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.850
Some of whom loved
"Far From the Tree."

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.520
I've been taken aback and also
surprised that I'm surprised.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.860
I've gotten a lot of e-mails
from women especially,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:23.760
but men too, in their maybe 50s,
60s, 70s who were forced to,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.620
I don't like to say give
a child up for adoption.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.470
But in those cases they were.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.960
You know, the time and the era
of where we were as a country

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.610
and a community,
there was no ability

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.590
to raise a child out of wedlock.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.850
And so I've got e-mails from
them saying, thank you so much.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.150
I'm looking for my child.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.450
I'm looking for my parent.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.460
I'm trying to find, I
can't find anything.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.760
Your story gives me hope.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.250
And that, it fills me,
I'm very, very pleased

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.570
that they have found that.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.870
But I've also gotten
e-mails from people

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.370
who didn't see themselves
in the book.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.060
And that breaks my heart.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.560
As a writer, you want to
try to give everything

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.460
to every person that
reads your book.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.930
You hope that they get a really
positive experience from it.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.590
And sometimes they don't.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.560
And I had to sacrifice that
for Grace and Maya and Joaquin

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.930
for their stories
to come through.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.190
And I'm just so, I
always kind of feel

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.540
like your characters
find you and pick you.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.010
And I'm grateful
that they found me.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.310
I'm grateful that
they picked me.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.980
I hope I did them justice.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.350
And, yeah, the experience of
writing "Far From the Tree" was,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.660
turns out it didn't
end my career.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.980
I finished, the book's
384 pages.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.160
I wrote the last
two-thirds in about 12 days.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.620
I don't recommend that
if you ever write a book.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.290
A lot goes out the
window when you're writing

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.890
that many pages in 12 days.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.190
And I gave it to my publisher.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.490
And I said, here you go.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.790
And I started applying for jobs.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.000
I updated my resume, and I
started applying for jobs.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.730
Because I thought,
well, this was fun.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.490
I finalized, I finished
my contract.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.300
I did not violate
any legal rules

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.970
where attorneys are
going to come after me.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.270
Here we go.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.570
Time to move on.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.040
And I'm going to
sacrifice being published

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.480
so I can save my
love of writing.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.110
Because at the end of day,
if I can't go home and write

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.940
down 500 words in a Word
document or in a notebook.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.860
Like I did when I was eight.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.490
What's the point
of being published?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.790
I had to hang on to
my love of writing.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.590
And so I was ready
to give it up.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.370
And I sat outside
in early September.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.520
I was at my mom's
house, like always.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.820
And I was sitting outside.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.120
And I thought, fall is coming.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.720
"Far From the Tree" is
going to be out in a month.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.270
I'm ready to let it go.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.570
Godspeed little book.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.870
Notice that beautiful poem

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.170
by Billy Collins,
I forget the title.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.430
But he says, go out and meet
as many people as you can.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.730
He's talking to his book.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.030
And that's how I felt.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.460
Like, go. And the next morning
I was in front of my computer.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.590
And Lisa Lucas, who is
the executive director

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.000
of the National Book Foundation,
she said, hey, the long list is

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.240
out for the National Book Awards
for young people's literature.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.400
And I thought, oh, let
me see if I know anyone.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.700
And I clicked.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.000
And I was the second
name on the list.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.890
And I, to this day,
like I start shaking.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.850
I can't, my mom came running.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.100
Because she clearly thought
something terrible had happened.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.710
And I just, I couldn't talk.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.010
And I couldn't type.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.760
And I remember thinking, oh,
maybe I don't need to send

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.100
that resume this morning.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.430
Like maybe this is
going to change.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.860
And I became a finalist.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.350
And I miraculously won
the National Book Award.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.090
A goal that I hadn't
even set for myself.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.780
My, oh, thank you.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.160
[ Applause ]

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.460
Thank you.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.230
And the only reason
I talk about that,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.080
because I know there's a lot of
younger people in the audience.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.420
And I just want you
to know, like,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.910
when you're doing
something that you love,

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.300
it doesn't mean that it's easy.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.600
And it won't ever be easy.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.160
I'm working on a
new book right now.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.780
And I'm like, what am I doing?

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.580
You know, the award
doesn't change the process.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.000
It's still very, very hard

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.810
to meet characters
and write a book.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.280
But I just, I wish I had
heard that when I was younger.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.020
That it doesn't have
to be perfect.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.320
You just have to do it.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.620
And you can go and fix it.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.710
And you will make it
the best that it can be.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.580
And that is exactly what
"Far From the Tree" was.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.300
It was a labor of love that has
earned me beautiful accolades

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.620
and words and e-mails
and letters from people

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.020
that I'm so grateful for.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.190
And yet at the same time I
have to go write another book.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.490
And I'm thrilled.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.790
I'm happy to do it.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.850
But I've got to figure out
how to do this all over again.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.520
And if my history is any proof,
the seventh book is going

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.390
to be even harder
than the last one.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.690
Which I'm very worried about.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.640
But, yeah, I just, if you
are a writer or anything.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.940
A painter.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.240
An artist.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.540
Whatever it is.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.840
It's a hard process.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.140
And that doesn't mean that
you're on the wrong path.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.260
And if there's anything that
I could ever impart to anyone,

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.980
much less young people,
it's that.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.220
That you, that's
the beauty of it.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.900
That's the absolute beauty
of creating something,

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.660
is that you sometimes,
through all of that muck,

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.650
you find something
that's really perfect.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.430
So I could talk about myself
for another hour and a half.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.990
But are there any
questions at all?

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.910
And I think there's mics
set up on either side,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.340
if you have any questions.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.910
Oh, we have a volunteer.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.210
Hi.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.630
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I loved "Your
Also Known As" series.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.750
What was the inspiration
for that?

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.050
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Oh,
that's a good story.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.380
So my "Also Known As"
series is my spy series.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.910
It is about a 16-year-old
safe cracker and lock picker.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.410
This is a very embarrassing
story,

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.410
but it has netted me two
books, so I will tell it.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.040
I lived in an old apartment

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.880
that had a really terrifying
basement storage area.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.080
It was like something out
of a "Saw" horror movie.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.670
You know, that bulb dangling.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.560
And something skittering
in the corner.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.390
And cobwebs everywhere.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.780
And I was moving
out, and I realized

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.480
as the movers were
arriving that the,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.460
I hadn't gotten all my stuff
out of the storage unit.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.190
Because I hadn't been
down there in years.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.180
And it had a Master
Lock like you would see

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.930
on a school locker on there.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.630
So I ran downstairs,
and I realized, oh,

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.930
I don't know the combination.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.910
I haven't been down here
in this terrifying space

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.210
for over ten years.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.720
So I did what we all do
when we don't know what

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.020
to do, is I Googled it.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.050
I Googled how do you
crack a Master Lock.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.830
And ten minutes later
I was breaking

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.080
into my own storage
unit with a pencil.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.130
Don't use Master Locks
because it can be very tricky

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.430
to break into.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.190
And so I thought, well, I kind
of felt cool after I did that.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:55.080
I was like, look at me breaking
into my own storage space.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.010
And I thought how
fun would that be

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.710
to be a safe cracker
or a lock picker.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.770
And that's where
the idea for the

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.070
"Also Known As" series
came from.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.020
That's why Maggie is a safe
cracker and a lock picker.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.180
And one of the opening, I
think it's the opening line

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.480
of the book.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.780
It's been a while now.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.080
But I think her opening like is,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.380
I cracked my first Master
lock when I was three.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.680
And it took me a few more years,
obviously, to get to that point.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.790
But, yeah, so that's where
the inspiration came from.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.210
Is me not writing down a
combination ten years ago.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.080
This writing life, man.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.530
Yeah, hi.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.660
&gt;&gt; Since you've gone through
a lot of writer's block what,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.450
I know you found it
a way differently.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.420
Like you heard it
like out of the blue.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.720
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Yeah.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.020
&gt;&gt; But do you have
any advice for people

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.320
who are going through that?

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.870
Like a certain thing
you could try to do?

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.170
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Yeah.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.850
I know there's always kind of a
divide in the writing community.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.150
Is writer's block real?

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.000
And I'm very much on
the side of, oh, yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.450
Like, it is very real.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.900
What I find, it's funny.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.520
I have found sometimes
I have two blocks.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.820
Sometimes it's finding an idea.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.830
And sometimes it's
writing that idea.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.720
And so for finding the idea,
you can't chase an idea.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.460
You can't, the idea will
only get further away.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.730
You know if I had been
sitting in that car listening

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.400
to the radio being like,
this next song is going

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.700
to be the inspiration.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.000
I would probably
never thought of that.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.300
It just sort of happened.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.240
So I think a big part of
it is having the faith

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.980
in the creative process that
the ideas will eventually come

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.280
to you.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.780
Having that faith is very hard,
you know, to be steady that way.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.320
When it comes to writing ideas
though, I have found that,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.620
when I am really stuck,

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.700
it's because that I have either
backed myself into a corner.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.000
Like I'm a maze.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.020
Or that I am very scared, and
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.240
And I'm very scared of what
I'm going to write next.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.450
I have a hard problem every
single time I open the

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.750
Word document.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.300
I'm like, this could be it.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.600
Like the words might
not come today.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.180
Or worse, the ones I
wrote yesterday are going

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.980
to be really bad it turns
out when I read them back.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.170
And so I try to break it apart.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.510
I try to take my writer hat off

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.070
and put my problem
solver hat on.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.680
Which sometimes they're
the same hat.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.440
And I try to look at
it and think, okay,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.900
did I write these
characters into a plot point

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.200
that they can't get out of?

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.500
Is this the wrong way to go?

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.540
Do I need to back them up and
send them down a different path?

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.630
Or do I just need to get over
myself and write 1,000 words

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.910
and let them all be terrible and
delete them all out tomorrow?

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.610
But for now I'm just going
to write those words?

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.710
And sometimes it's
kicking myself in the butt.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.010
And sometimes it's looking

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.360
at the characters
and figuring it out.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.030
But, yeah, and sometimes
you just got

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.890
to be really nice
to yourself too.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.420
Like writing is hard, and
it's lonely sometimes.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.170
And you're with imaginary
people all day long

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.250
that sometimes don't
give you what you want.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.750
And so sometimes you have to go
for a walk or listen to music.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.060
Or talk to a friend
or pet your dog.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.730
Or, you know, just sometimes
get out of that writer's space

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.750
and just tell yourself that
maybe today isn't the right day.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.460
But tomorrow could
be the right day.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.450
Yeah, there's a whole bunch
of tools in my bag that I try

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.190
to use to break down
writer's block, yeah.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.400
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Yeah,
you're very welcome.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.700
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.000
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Hi.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.300
&gt;&gt; First off, I just want to
tell you, like, getting through,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.600
like, the writer's
block and, like,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.900
all these obstacles
you had to go through,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.200
especially with going "Far
From the Tree" has been,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.500
like, super inspiring.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.800
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Oh, thank you.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.100
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] question.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.400
How do you know that an idea

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.160
that you have is going
to be a good one?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.970
And it's going to follow
into like a story that is

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.070
like cohesive and real that can
actually be made into a book?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.370
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Usually,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.280
and this is what I found while
writing all the precursors

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.580
to "Far From the Tree."

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.040
Was these, I didn't
know the characters

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.340
in the books that I was writing.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.000
And I was 15, 20,000 words in.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.870
And I was still like,
what is their point?

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.990
Like what are they,
what does she want?

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.290
Why is she doing this?

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.990
And I couldn't meet her.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.820
You know, I just couldn't
figure out who this person was.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.540
And I feel like that was
a very big sign to me.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.290
When I know that
an idea is working,

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.120
it's with the characters
start doing things

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.700
that I was not expecting.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.970
And they sort of take
on a life of their own.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.270
And, again, my mom's like,

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.860
what do you mean you didn't
know what they were going to do?

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.520
And the example of like
Maya's mom drinking.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.850
You know, that was not a
plot point at all in any

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.320
of the initial thoughts
that I had about the book.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.880
And they reveal things in that
way that is so surprising.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.180
It's like they trust you enough

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.310
to let you see a
door into their life.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.990
And it's, that's when I'm like,
okay, this might be working.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.290
This might be working.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.960
And sometimes you don't
know till page 200.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.360
But what else are
you going to do?

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.660
Just keep trying to meet them

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.540
and keep trying to
write them, yeah.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.310
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: You
are very welcome.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.610
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.910
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Hi.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.040
&gt;&gt; Do you find, like, writing
down ideas harder or just, like,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.640
finding the ideas in your
head or, for inspiration?

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.310
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: You mean like
once I, do I find it hard to?

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.630
&gt;&gt; Write ideas down
or to find the ideas.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.260
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: I find it
much harder to find the idea.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.670
I have some friends that have
a notebook full of 12 ideas.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.970
Like, one of my friends
was like, yeah,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.270
I have an idea due
to my publisher.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.580
So I'm going to go
through my notebook.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.040
And I was like, you have
a notebook of ideas?

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.260
Where do you get one of those?

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.200
Like, can I get one?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.160
Yeah, I don't get
very many ideas.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.970
And when they do, it's sort
of like, like I was saying.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.100
Like, how, will this be a book?

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.600
Maybe it's just an
idea of a book.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.910
I just got one a
couple months ago.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.550
And it slowly started
to happen in my head.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.440
But I don't like
to write them down.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.360
Because I feel like once
I write them down, to me,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.990
before I'm ready to
start writing the book,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.640
they lose a little
bit of their magic.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.710
I really love the idea
of having that idea

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.010
and just sitting with it.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.850
And, you know, while you're
driving around or talking

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.150
to someone or walking the dog.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.980
You know, you sort of,
I let those ideas kind

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.650
of just roll around in my head.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.280
And they start to maybe
get a little bit bigger

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.880
and a little bit more complex.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.590
And then I don't
write anything down.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.890
I'm not an outliner.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.940
I write entirely by
the seat of my pants.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.460
And we'll just see
what happens, you know.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.890
Sit down, and it's me
and the characters.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.560
And hopefully we'll
all get along that day.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.860
Yeah, thank you.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.270
&gt;&gt; It seems like many times.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.090
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: It's a low mic.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.200
&gt;&gt; It takes a while for the
characters to come to you.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.500
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Yes.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
&gt;&gt; And then after that you spend
a great deal of time with them.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.330
And you have these
emotions and connections

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.120
that develop over the time.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.230
But how do you know when
it's time to let go?

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.010
And that the book is done,
and you've told their story?

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.310
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: That is
an excellent question.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:08.610
How do you know when
the book is done?

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.960
I think as a writer,
to me it's never done.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.340
You know, I always
want to keep going.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.810
Not only refining, but
I just kind of want

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.110
to follow them sometimes.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.440
And see when are you guys
going to go to college?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.350
Are you going to go to college?

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.690
Like, I feel like I
always know the very,

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.340
very, very end of the book.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.220
For some reason I always
know the very beginning

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.520
and the very end.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.880
And the last three words of "Far

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.730
From the Tree" are very
emotional for people.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.920
And I knew those
last three words

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.480
when I first started
writing the first three words

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.780
of "Far From the Tree."

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.330
So I kind of use that as our
my goal post, sports metaphor.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:44.550
Like I think those, I kind of
try to use those as my buffers.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.440
And think, okay, write
to this end scene.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.470
I feel like once you answer
the character's questions.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.150
You know, once you put their
story on the page, I have found

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.450
that it sort of dries up.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.750
There's nothing more
I could have put

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.050
into "Far From the Tree."

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.840
Like, I felt like everything
that people needed to know

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.910
about those three
characters they knew.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.290
And to add any more
would just be for me.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.100
It would just be
selfish, you know.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.100
Like I can go write fan fiction

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.710
about my characters
on my own time.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.840
But the book didn't
need those facts.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.860
And you find that
through editing sometimes.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.160
You find it through drafting.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.340
You find it because your editor
goes cut these 200 pages.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.640
These are unnecessary.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.400
You know, it's sometimes
a community effort.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.710
But I feel like a lot of writing
is trusting your instinct.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.540
And that would be a
good example of that.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.860
And honing it over time as well.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.160
Yeah.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.340
&gt;&gt; So I was wondering.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.530
You were talking about how you
don't write any ideas down.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.540
Do you ever worry about losing
your idea completely because?

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.840
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: No.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.140
Because they're so
few to round up.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.960
So it's not like trying
to herd cats, you know,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.610
where they're all
over the place.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.350
Oh, the dream to
have that many ideas.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.270
But, no, I don't worry
about losing them.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.700
Because, again, they're
so few and far

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.980
between that they
tend to become books.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.850
And I feel like, if I did lose
an idea, then it wasn't meant

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.280
to be a book in the first place.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.930
You know, if it was supposed
to stick around it would have.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.230
Yeah.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.830
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: You're welcome.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.840
&gt;&gt; Hi. I noticed that
you, when you were talking

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.870
about your characters
going through foster care.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.820
That you didn't necessarily have
that own personal experience.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.120
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: Yeah.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.870
&gt;&gt; So how do you make it okay
for you to tell that story?

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.040
How do you go about deciding
and making that decision?

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.710
&gt;&gt; Robin Benway: I talked
to a lot of foster kids.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.030
I talked to a lot
of foster parents.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.330
I talked to social workers.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.470
I tried to make stories
as specific as possible.

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:35.770
It was hard.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.150
That, and the fact that Joaquin
is half Mexican was incredibly

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.100
scary for me to write.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.220
I think, I gave it
to beta readers.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.520
I gave it to friends.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.080
I gave it to people who knew
what I was trying to do.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.910
And I feel like at the end
of day you just have to hope

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:51.500
that you gave it your best.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.110
Not only with your brain,
but with your heart as well.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.180
And that people will be
able to see themselves.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.450
And not, again, not
everyone will be.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.950
And it, sometimes that leap of
faith, again, of being a writer.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.250
You hope that you
were good enough.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.020
And I think in some cases I was.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.320
Yeah.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
