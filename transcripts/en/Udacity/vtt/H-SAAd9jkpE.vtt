How'd you do? If you got 14 ounces, great work. Let's see how we got that

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:08.675
answer. When we do ratio problems, it's important to put the ratio in words

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:13.195
before we put numbers. So, the ratio I need to write is the amount of chocolate

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.048
chips over the number of cookies. So, the ratio we want to write here is how

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.363
many ounces of chocolate chips we need for how many cookies. We know that

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:23.874
there's 8 ounces of chocolate chips, so we know the amount of chocolate chips.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.386
But we don't know the number of cookies because this tells us we have 2 dozen

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:31.390
cookies. For those of you that don't know, one dozen is equal to 12. For

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:35.855
example, when you buy a dozen eggs, you get 12 eggs. So, if we have 2 dozen

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:40.760
cookies, that's going to be 24 cookies. So we need 8 ounces of chocolate chips

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:45.620
for 24 cookies. The question says, how many ounces of chips we need to make 42

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:50.505
cookies? So, the number of cookies is 42, and we want to know how many ounces of

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:55.220
chocolate chips we need. We know the number of cookies we need to make is 42,

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:59.086
and we have to find out how many ounces of chocolate chips. So, this is what

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:02.952
we're looking for. I'm going to use the variable c in this case. We have two

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:06.849
ratios. When we set them equal to each other, that creates a proportion. To

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.951
solve a proportion, we simply cross-multiply. When we cross-multiply, we get 24

00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:16.755
times c is equal to 8 times 42. So, we get 24 c equals 8 times 42 is 336. To

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:22.870
solve this, all we have to do is divide both sides by 24. 336 divided by 24 is

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:29.148
14. So, we get c equals 14, which means we need 14 answers of chocolate chips to

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.183
make 42 cookies. Are you ready to try another one?
