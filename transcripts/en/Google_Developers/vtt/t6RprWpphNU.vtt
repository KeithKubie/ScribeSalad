[TYPING]

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.210
Hi, my name is Billur Sorguc.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm working as a senior
quality assurance engineer

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.050
at Monitise, Istanbul, Turkey.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.620
Exploratory test is defined as
an unscripted test approach.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.720
Usually we manage
our test process

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320
based on documented
and preplanned steps.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.480
However, in
exploratory testing, we

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.600
do test planning, design, and
execution all at the same time.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.590
In exploratory
testing, the first step

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.650
is gathering different
people from other departments

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.320
who have not been
involved in the project.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.090
For Monitise, this means the
business analysts, developers,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.080
designers, project managers,
marketers, and others.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200
The key point is that we never
provide a specific scenario

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.440
or use case.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.540
They need to create
their own scenarios

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.120
based on what they
would do as an end user

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.050
while using the
app in real time.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.122
Instead, we just
say, this app is for,

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:02.570
for example, doing wire
transfer or something.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.790
We just say what
that app is for,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.065
and we're going to let
them to discover the app

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:12.330
and explore the
flow by themselves.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.850
And next we choose
the right devices.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.130
Doing the exploratory
testing on devices

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.450
with different operating
systems, different screen

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.170
resolutions, densities, screen
sizes, and operating system

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.940
versions provide good coverage
for a two-hour test session.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.300
Afterwards, we give these
test devices, as well as

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.810
the Post-Its, to the
testers we have gathered.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.760
And we want them to categorize
the issues they find and note

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.830
them on the Post-Its with
the corresponding color.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.370
For example, if it's a bug,
they use the red Post-Its.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.210
If it's an enhancement,
they use the green ones.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.850
And if it's a new idea or any
suggestion about the usability,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.640
they use the yellow ones.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.530
During this two-hour
test session,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
our test users explore
the functions, the flow,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.380
and they take notes
on the Post-Its

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.320
about the issues they find.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.460
They understand
the business model

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.710
and give feedbacks
about usability

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.160
or any other experience
that an end user

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.700
can face while using the app.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670
The issues,
suggestions, new ideas,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.270
and feedbacks from this
brainstorming session

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.930
are saved and shared
with the project team.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.910
The project team
prioritizes the list

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.950
and starts working on
those subjects afterwards.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.920
The issues,
suggestions, new ideas,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.520
and feedbacks from this
brainstorming session

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.180
are saved and shared
with the project team.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.160
The project team
prioritizes the list

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.790
and starts working on
those subjects afterwards.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.840
