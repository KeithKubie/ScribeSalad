a hyperactive or ADHD kid ritalin or
 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.269
a hyperactive or ADHD kid ritalin or
Ritalin like medications are going to

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:14.279
Ritalin like medications are going to
 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.300
Ritalin like medications are going to
work on you differently then they will

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
work on you differently then they will
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.300
work on you differently then they will
on the normal population and that's what

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
on the normal population and that's what
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.880
on the normal population and that's what
it is it's a myth it's inaccurate so for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
it is it's a myth it's inaccurate so for
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370
it is it's a myth it's inaccurate so for
all of us whenever we would take one of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
all of us whenever we would take one of
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529
all of us whenever we would take one of
these medicines your dopamine and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
these medicines your dopamine and
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450
these medicines your dopamine and
norepinephrine is clogged are going to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
norepinephrine is clogged are going to
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.800
norepinephrine is clogged are going to
be more readily available in your brain

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
be more readily available in your brain
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.139
be more readily available in your brain
you will be more focused you will be

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
you will be more focused you will be
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120
you will be more focused you will be
more attentive you also might be a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
more attentive you also might be a
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920
more attentive you also might be a
little more uptight and a little more

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
little more uptight and a little more
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.890
little more uptight and a little more
hyper vigilant and when you take any

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900
hyper vigilant and when you take any
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.389
hyper vigilant and when you take any
medicine there's a cost-benefit ratio

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
medicine there's a cost-benefit ratio
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790
medicine there's a cost-benefit ratio
any time you take a medicine there's a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
any time you take a medicine there's a
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.880
any time you take a medicine there's a
potential side effect so if you don't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
potential side effect so if you don't
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920
potential side effect so if you don't
have ADHD and you're going to take this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
have ADHD and you're going to take this
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.889
have ADHD and you're going to take this
medicine any psychostimulant any type of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
medicine any psychostimulant any type of
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.780
medicine any psychostimulant any type of
drug like this is going to increase your

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790
drug like this is going to increase your
 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.610
drug like this is going to increase your
heart rate it may elevate your blood

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
heart rate it may elevate your blood
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.690
heart rate it may elevate your blood
pressure it will decrease your appetite

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700
pressure it will decrease your appetite
 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.069
pressure it will decrease your appetite
those things are side effects that are

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
those things are side effects that are
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.459
those things are side effects that are
unnecessary if your dopamine and

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469
unnecessary if your dopamine and
 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.699
unnecessary if your dopamine and
norepinephrine levels are normal in the

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:07.709
norepinephrine levels are normal in the
 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.289
norepinephrine levels are normal in the
same way that if you take to any aspirin

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
same way that if you take to any aspirin
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719
same way that if you take to any aspirin
it will thin your platelets which might

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
it will thin your platelets which might
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.849
it will thin your platelets which might
be good but might be bad and if you take

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859
be good but might be bad and if you take
 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.010
be good but might be bad and if you take
too much aspirin you can actually get an

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
too much aspirin you can actually get an
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.249
too much aspirin you can actually get an
ulcer so this is something that every

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
ulcer so this is something that every
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230
ulcer so this is something that every
time you get prescribed a medicine a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
time you get prescribed a medicine a
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.999
time you get prescribed a medicine a
doctor's thinking about what the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
doctor's thinking about what the
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.730
doctor's thinking about what the
cost-benefit ratio is the important part

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
cost-benefit ratio is the important part
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.639
cost-benefit ratio is the important part
for us to remember is that when someone

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649
for us to remember is that when someone
 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.429
for us to remember is that when someone
with ADHD gets these medicines they get

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
with ADHD gets these medicines they get
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.879
with ADHD gets these medicines they get
closer to what a normal typical brain

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889
closer to what a normal typical brain
 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.279
closer to what a normal typical brain
response is so that they look less

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289
response is so that they look less
 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.620
response is so that they look less
hyperactive they look more attentive

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
hyperactive they look more attentive
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.809
hyperactive they look more attentive
therefore they're less impulsive they

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819
therefore they're less impulsive they
 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.690
therefore they're less impulsive they
are able to do what they're capable of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
are able to do what they're capable of
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999
are able to do what they're capable of
doing it doesn't increase your IQ points

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
doing it doesn't increase your IQ points
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.519
doing it doesn't increase your IQ points
it doesn't make you smarter it lets you

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.529
it doesn't make you smarter it lets you
 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.859
it doesn't make you smarter it lets you
get to the IQ points that you do have

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
get to the IQ points that you do have
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.980
get to the IQ points that you do have
and therefore while you're never as

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
and therefore while you're never as
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.969
and therefore while you're never as
attentive as a typical or normal

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
attentive as a typical or normal
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.830
attentive as a typical or normal
individual and you never stop moving

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
individual and you never stop moving
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.569
individual and you never stop moving
around

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
around
 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.419
around
and stay as still as a typical normal

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429
and stay as still as a typical normal
 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.180
and stay as still as a typical normal
you are more in the normal range that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
you are more in the normal range that
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.270
you are more in the normal range that
permits you to be more contemplative

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
permits you to be more contemplative
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
permits you to be more contemplative
insightful and therefore get in touch

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
insightful and therefore get in touch
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.170
insightful and therefore get in touch
with or use your intelligence

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.600
well I think there are other side

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
well I think there are other side
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.309
well I think there are other side
effects so for instance particularly if

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
effects so for instance particularly if
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.759
effects so for instance particularly if
you take dexedrine which is a more

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769
you take dexedrine which is a more
 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.009
you take dexedrine which is a more
potent version of Ritalin slightly

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019
potent version of Ritalin slightly
 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.780
potent version of Ritalin slightly
different different chemical structure

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
different different chemical structure
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390
different different chemical structure
there is no doubt that you will also get

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
there is no doubt that you will also get
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880
there is no doubt that you will also get
a slight rise in your mood you will feel

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
a slight rise in your mood you will feel
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.699
a slight rise in your mood you will feel
somewhat more euphoric and you will feel

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
somewhat more euphoric and you will feel
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.819
somewhat more euphoric and you will feel
more expansive and therefore if you

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
more expansive and therefore if you
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.710
more expansive and therefore if you
start taking that medicine on a regular

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
start taking that medicine on a regular
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.039
start taking that medicine on a regular
basis when you don't have it you very

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049
basis when you don't have it you very
 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.140
basis when you don't have it you very
possibly will feel a crash or you will

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
possibly will feel a crash or you will
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.259
possibly will feel a crash or you will
feel down and therefore that's the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
feel down and therefore that's the
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.199
feel down and therefore that's the
potential side effect that could be

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
potential side effect that could be
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.259
potential side effect that could be
quite serious that you become used to it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
quite serious that you become used to it
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.400
quite serious that you become used to it
or become almost addicted to the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
or become almost addicted to the
 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.729
or become almost addicted to the
sensation of feeling good when it's not

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739
sensation of feeling good when it's not
 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.330
sensation of feeling good when it's not
necessary to cause you to focus or you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
necessary to cause you to focus or you
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.040
necessary to cause you to focus or you
don't need it for extended attention
