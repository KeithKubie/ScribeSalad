00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:07.520
MARK STUART DAY: Thanks very
much for the opportunity

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.970
to be here.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.860
I am here to talk
about explaining

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.690
how our digital stuff works.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.530
In particular, I'm here
in support of my new book,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.520
"Bits to Bitcoin--

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.980
How Our Digital Stuff Works."

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.120
And in that context, there
are two different audiences

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.130
that I'm expecting that
I'm addressing today.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.190
One of them is a
potential reader,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.090
for whom the key question
is, is this my kind of book?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.860
Am I interested?

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.470
And then there's also
a potential audience

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.390
of people who might
find themselves

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.610
in somewhat the position
that I found myself

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.300
in of having a certain
amount of technical expertise

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.100
and a modest amount
of inclination

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.940
to do something with it in terms
of sharing it with the world.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.210
And you might be interested in
the question of what it takes

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.550
to get this kind of book done.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.470
So let's go ahead and look
at the potential reader

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.740
side of that.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.620
So that's the story of the book
in terms of what's in the book.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.610
The book is described
in its blurb

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
as an accessible guide to
digital infrastructure.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.780
And "accessible"
is a funny word.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.210
In this context,
what it means is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.330
that I ruled out a couple
of popular strategies

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.130
for how to explain the material.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.860
One of the things
that you can do

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
if you want to explain computing
to people who don't necessarily

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.230
have a lot of
technical background

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.460
is you can kind of go through
the history of the field.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.659
That's been done a lot.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.200
I don't think it
really gets you very

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.630
close to the core
of what's happening,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.230
for the same reason that when
you are, for example, choosing

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.850
to publish a
technical paper, you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.940
don't talk about all the dead
ends that you went through

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.840
along the way.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.850
So I also wanted to
focus on something that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.130
didn't involve programming.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.620
There's a lot of books
that teach you programming.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.120
There are a lot of
books that assume

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.009
that you know programming
or that teach you

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.870
programming along the way.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.820
But it seemed to
me as though one

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.320
of the things that
I could see is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.160
that there were people for whom
programming was either a block,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.712
or at least it was too much
work for them to take it on.

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.170
And so I wanted to
understand if it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.640
was possible to
do something that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.760
didn't depend on programming.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.827
So my approach to
what's in the book--

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:31.660
I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.400
the book is structured.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.030
Then I'm going to show
you some selected topics.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.610
There's a lot of
material in the book,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.820
so I'm not going to come
anywhere close to covering

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.530
all that's in the book.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.080
And even for the
things that I pick,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.600
I'm not particularly trying
to explain any one subject

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.590
thoroughly.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.440
I'm just trying to give you a
sense of the kind of approach

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.470
and the kinds of things
that are in the book.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.590
But then I am going to come back
and look at something that I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.370
would expect it would make
a difference if you had read

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.680
the book, in terms of
whether you understood

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.290
a particular comic
strip from XKCD.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.230
OK.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.860
The book structure--
it starts with the idea

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.950
of a single process,
just what a computation

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
is, what the limits are, what
the power of a single process

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.630
is.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.060
Then it proceeds to
the question of what it

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.150
means when processes interact.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.630
But for both single and
interacting processes,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.260
the assumption is that nothing
in the world is going wrong.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.430
The processes themselves
might have some problems,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.030
but there's nothing about their
environment that's problematic.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.040
In the third part--
unstoppable processes--

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.300
now you have the situation
that something can fail.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.880
And so you want
to figure out how

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.220
to arrange your
resources so that you

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.500
can keep going in spite
of some kind of failure.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.710
In the last part,
there are not just

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.930
these accidental or
natural kinds of failures,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.420
but there are
deliberate failures.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.560
There are attacks.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.870
And the question
then becomes, what

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.960
does one do about
defending a process?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.940
How does one continue
to work, even

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.899
in the presence of
deliberate attacks?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.300
This is the list of chapters.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.980
I'm not going to try
to walk through it.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.520
But I just want to give you
a sense of what's in it.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.430
The breaks between
these numbers correspond

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.380
to those different parts.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.450
And I'm going to
use this so that you

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.180
get a sense of us
marching through the book

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.930
with these examples.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.450
So I'm going to start by talking
about steps and the nature

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.970
of being digital.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.800
So we can look at this
painting from the 19th century.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.900
And we can say that
there was something

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.920
that was quite unusual and
radical about it at the time

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.450
that it was painted.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.310
And that was that it was visibly
composed of discrete parts.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.630
And this style of looking at
things as made up of parts

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.280
is kind of the
essence of what we

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.330
mean by saying that
things are digital,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.250
that they have boundaries
that we can't recognize.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.910
Now one of the questions that
people at this time would ask

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.340
is, why would you
do such a thing?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.290
We can look at that
in a somewhat more

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.450
pragmatic engineering sense.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.740
And I'll do that in a moment.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.970
But the digital world,
for our purposes,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.210
is composed of these
kinds of steps notions,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.610
that the things
that are happening,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.980
happen in discrete steps.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.430
The things that the actions
are happening to are,

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.050
in some sense,
stepped or chunked.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.460
And we can distinguish
between steps and ramps

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.400
as, in some sense, equivalent
ways of getting from point A

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.910
to point B, particularly
if, as in this example,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.950
they have the same slope.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.080
But your experience
of walking on these

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.890
is quite different in the
sense that if you just

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.770
take a small step to
the left or the right--

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.700
a small movement left
or right on the steps--

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.090
you may find yourself
making quite a sharp change

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.160
in the vertical
direction, whereas

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.750
a corresponding small shift to
the left or right on the ramp

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.540
is going to cause you to
only have a small shift

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.080
in your vertical direction.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.770
This is, I'm sure,
obvious to all of you.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.080
But it's not as
commonly recognized

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.910
that this is a way
of understanding what

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.990
analog versus digital is about.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.560
Now these are not
implacably opposed worlds.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.600
These are just different models.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.340
We can take that idea of steps,
and we can make the steps

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.630
as close to the ramp as we like
by making the step smaller.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.020
So that's a handy thing to know.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.820
And then we can
ask the question,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.270
as I suggested the
viewers of that art

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.360
might have asked, why are
we bothering to do this?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.020
It seems sort of odd.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.570
And one of the things
that's worth being aware of

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.860
is that you can take information
and you can transmit it

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.790
in the presence of noise
more effectively if you

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.770
are using a digital encoding.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.870
So here we have a kind
of a wiggly analog signal

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.010
to which we're adding a
small amount of noise.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.660
And that's just
happening because we're

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.670
trying to transmit
it through the world,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.980
and the world is a noisy place.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.840
And what we end up
with as a result

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.130
is this somewhat distorted
version of the original signal.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.010
And the challenge that
we have in this setting

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.160
is that it's hard to tell
which parts of that result

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.440
came from the noise and
which parts were coming

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.900
from the original signal.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.300
We have a somewhat
easier time if we

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.860
start with this chunky digital
signal in which the value is

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.910
bouncing back and forth between
this high and this low level,

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:10.100
because then when we add in
the same kind of low level

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.640
of wiggly noise, we wind
up with this, again,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.120
somewhat distorted result. But
it's straightforward for us

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.430
to recover our signal
that we started with,

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.460
because we know that the
little wiggles in there

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.390
don't mean anything.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.630
OK.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.150
So that was a kind
of a quick excursion

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.799
into how we could talk about
what it means to be digital

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.559
and why you might even care.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.710
Let's talk a little
bit about recursion.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.110
And before I get
to that, I would

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.930
have had to say something
about names and names

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.980
as a basis of computation.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.500
But I'm going to skip past that.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.390
And we're instead
just going to start

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.150
with this notion of
acronyms as a kind

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.320
of a humorous way of bringing
up ideas involving recursion.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.260
Now it's common
to have acronyms.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.350
And people understand them
as substitutions between--

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.170
the short form of the
acronym is just the letters,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.920
and then there's a longer form
that's a phrase or a name.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.900
So for example, when we see
IBM, at least in the old days,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.690
that was International
Business Machines.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.960
FAA is the Federal
Aviation Administration.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.660
NSA is the National
Security Agency.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.790
You probably know lots
of acronyms like this.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.050
So then we get to
this question of TLA.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.670
TLA is an acronym that
means Three-Letter Acronym.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.940
And so there's a
kind of a humor there

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.300
in that TLA is itself
a three-letter acronym.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.390
Now let's consider a
slightly more evolved version

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.560
of that kind of
self-referential quality.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.810
And let's consider
the acronym XINU.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:03.091
XINU turns out to be an acronym
that means XINU Is Not Unix.

00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:03.590
OK.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.990
And that, again, is something
that we, as people, can look at

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.330
and can say that there
is something slightly

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.080
entertaining, something
that tickles our funny bone

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.580
about that.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.520
But we also recognize that
there's a problem here,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.430
in the sense that if
we just blindly went

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.720
on doing this expansion, we
don't get an improvement.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.140
XINU is not Unix, is not
Unix, is not a better version.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.320
Plus, its no closer to being
resolved than the first

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.670
one was.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.150
So we've noticed that
there's both the potential

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.420
to have a name kind of
fold back on itself.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.680
And we also have to be aware
of this potential infinite

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.380
expansion problem.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.490
Let's shift gears a little bit
and talk about a Mother Goose

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.230
story, which you may or may not
remember from your childhood.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.580
It starts with, "This is
the house that Jack built."

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.340
And it goes on to say, "This is
the malt that lay in the house

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.110
that Jack built. This is the
rat that ate the malt that

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.260
lay in the house
that Jack built.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.320
This is the cat that killed the
rat that ate the malt that lay

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.300
in the house that Jack built.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.430
Now this goes on for
a very long time.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.580
It gets to be quite an
extensive set of things

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.080
that are happening to this malt
in the house that Jack built.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.660
But the point, I think, is,
it's teaching children a pattern

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.030
about being able to keep
extending in terms of clauses.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.550
Basically, the lesson
here is, you can always

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.200
stick one more
subordinate clause

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.500
into an English sentence,
following this pattern.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.920
And you can, in fact--

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.060
if you are a computer
science type person--

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.890
you can start saying,
well, it's not enough

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.780
for me just to read
that Mother Goose rhyme.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.180
How about if I write
some rules about it?

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.100
And the rules that
you wind up with

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.030
include this notion of
a compound phrase that

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.210
is defined in terms of itself.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.730
And so you have this
phenomenon that something

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.460
that is quite familiar,
even to children,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.450
turns out to have a mechanism
lurking inside it that's

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.940
this relatively interesting
computer science

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.000
concept of recursion.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.910
And we also have the
observation here that

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.290
in addition to allowing you to
produce a phrase of arbitrary

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.740
size through this recursion,
that we don't have

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.540
to worry about the
infinite expansion

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.670
that we had with
the XINU example,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.730
because this rule
involves two choices.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.950
And in one of those choices,
it's not recursing anymore.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.770
So we have a way out of
the trap, if you like.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.270
OK.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.880
So that was another example.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.290
Let's talk about what
happens when things

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.790
fail in one way or another.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.920
Here's a way that you might
think about disk drive

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.780
reliability.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.120
I've read something
on the internet that

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.970
says that my disk drive has
a mean time before failure

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.150
of a million hours.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.390
A million hours is
more than 100 years.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.700
So I don't need to worry
about disk failure.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.150
And the counterpart to this
is this poor person here,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:31.450
who is drowning in water with
an average depth of six inches.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.420
And so the cautionary
tale here, basically,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.590
is that the mean time between
failure of a disk drive

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.110
is a statistical property.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.230
And it's true of a very large
collection of disk drives.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.990
But that doesn't mean
that it tells you reliably

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.900
how your particular disk
drive is going to behave.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.650
So you need to do backups,
even though they're

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.630
a pain in the neck.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.220
Something that I
wanted to include,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.410
because I know there are
people in Cambridge who

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:06.220
are interested in CDMs or do
that as part of their job--

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.280
in the book, I talk a little
bit about constructing

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.950
a simple version of
how browsing works.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.130
And then I revisit the topic,
in order to talk about some

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.350
of the things you need to do
to make these systems scale.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.130
And one example is
that you can look

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.120
at the idea of having lots
of people all over the world

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.150
getting their content
from a single place.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.320
And you can see that there
are two kinds of problems

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.220
with this.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.230
First is that there
are a lot of arrows all

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.240
converging on this one site.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.120
So that corresponds
to a lot of work

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.670
that site is going to have
to do and a lot of traffic

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.930
that's going to have to go
in and out of that site.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.170
And you can also notice
that some of these lines

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.460
are quite long.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.980
And that corresponds to
people having probably

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.820
poor performance, as it takes
a long time for their requests

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.340
and their response to
get back and forth.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.400
And so we can immediately, just
in kind of an intuitive sense,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.840
see the merit of some kind of
content distribution by saying,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.790
I can take those
exact same clients,

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.480
and if I now have
three different sites

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.780
around the world that they
can get that content from,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.540
there are fewer arrows going
into any one of those sites.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.841
And the arrows collectively
got quite a bit shorter.

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:21.340
OK.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.730
Let's talk a little bit
about some of the things

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.310
that go into the Bitcoin part.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.950
So the flow of the
book is starting

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.410
from very simple
stuff, like, what

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.380
are bits, winding
up to more like,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.230
how does this Bitcoin
thing work anyway?

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.210
And a piece of what
we need toward the end

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.730
is to understand something
about public key systems

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.740
and signatures.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.150
So a public key system
involves this idea

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.770
that keys come in pairs--

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.020
private public pairs.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.170
And that what that
allows you to do

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.270
is that if you're one
of these two defenders

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.180
that's trying to share
information with each other

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.290
without the attacker
getting at it,

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.910
this is a more complex system.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.100
But your job as a
defender is much simpler

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:18.160
than it was if you were trying
to do this with secret keys.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.550
It's simpler because
these private keys that

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:27.340
are shown up at the top, you can
keep them completely private.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.010
You don't need to find some
cunning way of sharing them

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.390
with each other.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.550
And meanwhile, these
public keys are things that

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.560
can be made completely public.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.560
You don't need to worry
about keeping them secret.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.480
So it's completely
fine in this world

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.820
that the attacker has
access to the public keys.

00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:48.160
Why does it make a
difference that you

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.100
have these private
keys and public keys?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.790
Well, one of the things that you
can do with them that's handy

00:16:54.790 --> 00:17:00.520
and that turns out to
matter in moving the Bitcoin

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.960
ideas forward is to be
able to take some data

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.630
and combine it with
your private key

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.290
in order to produce something
that has been signed by you.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.920
It doesn't hide the data.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.119
It just makes it so that there
is an integrity check on it.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.920
And that integrity
check is associated

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.781
with your private key.

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:21.280
OK.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.010
And this complicated
machinery in the middle

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.920
is just sort of there to
establish that this is not

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.750
a trivial thing to
do, but we're also

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.440
not going to explain
it in any great detail.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.090
So then what does
that allow you to do?

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.390
Now you can take
this signed data,

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.390
and you can combine it with
a corresponding public key.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.910
Now there are some
tricky parts here

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.420
about how someone actually knows
which is the right public key.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.090
That's a separate discussion.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.860
But let's just, for
the moment, assume

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.310
that you know which public key
corresponds to the person who

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.080
allegedly signed this.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.060
You can take the
signed data, you

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.830
can take the
corresponding public key,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.040
and you can hand it to
another kind of machinery that

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.000
comes back with an answer
that says either, that's fine,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.260
that corresponds to the
private key that was used,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.140
or it says, no,
there's a problem.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.780
If it says there's a problem,
you don't necessarily

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:21.760
know whether the problem is that
it was signed by someone else,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.590
whether it just wasn't signed
in any kind of meaningful way

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.070
at all, or whether someone
has tampered with the data.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.830
So it's worth being aware
that you don't necessarily

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.720
know what kind of
thing has gone wrong.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.040
But it's powerful to know
that there is something

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.910
that you have as a check here.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.510
OK.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.490
So that was a small number of
topics and different points

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.760
of the book to kind of give
you a flavor of what kind

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.860
of material is being covered.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.520
Now I want to show you an
example of the sort of thing

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.980
that just shows up in the
press, where, if you were not

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.070
a technical person, you
might well not understand

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.410
the point of the joke.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.920
So here's an XKCD cartoon.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.934
If you can't see the
URL, it's number 2030.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:18.000
And the first couple of panels
are just basically setting up

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.209
the idea that other
engineering professions know

00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:21.000
what they're doing.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.640
So I'm not going to read them.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.280
And the third one just
leads us into the question

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.870
of computerized voting.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.510
The core of the discussion is
happening in the bottom two

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.640
panels, where the interviewer
is saying, "Wait, really?"

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.910
And the software
engineers are saying,

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.610
"Don't trust voting software,
and don't listen to anyone

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.290
who tells you it's safe."

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.166
"Why?"

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:46.290
"I don't know how to put
this, but our entire field

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.710
is quite bad at what we do.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.010
And if you rely on us,
everyone will die."

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.150
And then the interviewer
goes on to say,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.180
"They say they fixed it with
something called blockchain,"

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.200
which prompts the software
engineers to scream and say,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.390
"Whatever they sold
you, don't touch it.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.650
Bury it in the desert.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.180
Wear gloves."

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.930
OK.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.640
So one of the
things about this is

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.710
that you might not necessarily
understand why this

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.220
is mocking software engineers.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.940
You might not understand why
a blockchain is causing people

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.910
to scream, why it just seems
like a stupendously bad idea

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.580
to get blockchain and
computerized voting

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.020
and software in general
all mixed up together.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.150
Now, I have to tell you
that this cartoon is great,

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.650
because when I was
pitching this book,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.170
one of the things that
people would ask me

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.610
is, what will people be
able to do after your book

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.770
that they couldn't do before?

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.210
And so they would
say things like,

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.740
will they know how to program?

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.170
And I'd have to say no.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.570
Will they be able to
change their tire?

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.100
No.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.330
Will they understand a
particular computer system

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.170
really well?

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.860
No.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.480
They'll just sort of be better
at a lot of different things.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.840
But you see, now I can point
to this cartoon, and I can say,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.870
if they didn't understand this
cartoon before, I bet they

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.730
really do understand it now.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.700
And here's my argument.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.850
If we go through what
you need to understand

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.330
to get the jokes in the
cartoon, one part of it

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.520
is that software
is often flawed.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.280
So I talk about that
a lot in chapter 6.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.020
We also have to understand that
just because you know something

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.960
about how hardware systems
fail, that doesn't necessarily

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.570
mean you understand anything
about how software fails

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.870
or what to do about it.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.560
So that's in chapter 17.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.500
Security is intrinsically hard
is something that I talk about

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.340
in chapter 21.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.060
Software trust is
especially hard.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.090
I talk about that in chapter
22 in the context of what's

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.490
called the Ken Thompson hack.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.320
Identity in
cryptographic systems

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.780
is not the same as
in ordinary life.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.460
That's the piece
that we just went

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.550
through at the end of
the topics about the fact

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.920
that your private
key is basically how

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.020
you're identifying yourself.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.000
And finally, we have the
fact that blockchain trust

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.070
is unproven.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.360
Blockchain systems work for
some definition of "work."

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.010
But that's not quite
the same as saying

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.740
that people know whether
they can trust them

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.650
in all circumstances.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.730
OK.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:40.170
So that is a flavor of
what is in the book.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.150
Now I would like to
turn to telling you

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.500
a little bit about what
it took to write the book

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.860
and to bring it to this point.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.500
So this is the potential
writer story of the book piece.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.720
And I want to go through
some common questions

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.530
that I get asked.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.050
Why did I write a book?

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.660
I should be clear
that I have found

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.790
it fascinating to
meet people who

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.140
knew from their very early
years that they really

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.550
wanted to be a writer.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.270
I am not one of those people.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.270
But there was a part of
me that sort of thought

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.460
that, at some point
in my life, it would

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.310
be nice to publish a book.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.620
And one of those things--

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.090
I think it would be overstating
it to call it a midlife crisis.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.820
But a midlife swerve
or a midlife shift

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.420
took the form of saying, well,
you know, I'm turning 50,

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.680
and I'd be OK if I tried to
publish a book and failed,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.830
but I would feel kind of
dumb if I never tried.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.110
So if not now, when?

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.680
I had a further
motivation, because my wife

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.220
and I had the good fortune
to rear three smart

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.740
but non-technical children.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.970
The smart part is nice.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.060
The non-technical part is OK.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.490
But it does mean that there
was sort of this quality

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.210
that I had spent all the
years that Chris was referring

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.090
to in which I was doing
distributed system stuff,

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.340
and I was basically
unable to explain

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.660
to my children kind of what
the point of it all was.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.670
And I had already started
teaching at MIT as a transition

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.310
out of doing startup
kinds of things.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.720
So the MIT part was
interesting, because there's

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.050
this class at MIT
called 6.033, which

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.500
is the undergraduate
systems class.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.750
And it covers a combination
of operating systems,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.340
network security, some
other things mixed in there.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.870
It's a very demanding class.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.630
I was just one small part
of the teaching staff.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.520
It's a vast machine.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.290
But I knew that I liked
teaching that material.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.700
And I knew that I
wanted to find a way

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.920
to convey some of
what I thought was

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.810
fun and interesting about
that class to my children.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.250
So was there an opening?

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.900
The textbook for
6.033 is a book that I

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.520
have a great deal of admiration
for by my colleagues, friends,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.650
Kaashoek and Jerry Saltzer.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.270
But it's quite long, and
it's quite technical.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.810
And it was clear that
it wasn't the book

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.540
that they would want to read.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.000
Meanwhile, there were lots
of books that were the sort

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.830
of "Computers for
Dummies"-style thing.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.790
And what I found when I looked
at them was that they tended

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.640
to have a fair bit
of stuff about,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.450
here's what's happening
inside a computer and not much

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.560
after that.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.480
And I was interested
in sort of saying,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.175
yes, now you know what's
inside a computer,

00:25:46.175 --> 00:25:47.800
but now let's talk
about all the things

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.920
that computers can do
once you have them.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.840
And as I mentioned
before, I didn't really

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.550
want to treat computer science
and programming as necessarily

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.920
near equivalence.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.890
So my overall goals
were to cover things

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.890
that I thought were
interesting, or philosophically

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.650
entertaining, or
just entertaining

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.970
with no programming at all and
with my children as the target

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.080
audience and, as you'll
see shortly, my editors.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.270
So how did I write the book?

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.040
So one part of writing
a book is that you

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.150
have to just keep at it.

00:26:25.936 --> 00:26:28.540
There used to be a feature
in the "Financial Times"

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.740
where they would go talk to
authors about what their habits

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.240
and tendencies were.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.790
And I noticed,
reading these items,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.330
that they almost always
had some sort of routine

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.550
that they stuck to.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:46.240
There was almost no commonality
to what their routines were.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.750
But almost all of them said
that they had something

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.700
that they stuck to
very rigidly by way

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.820
of getting their writing done.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.180
It was also helpful to
have manageable goals.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.310
I was mostly focused on
getting this to be something

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.380
that my children liked.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.240
Otherwise, it's really
easy to freak out

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.400
at how hard it could be.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.020
And I had this
reviewing pipeline

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.960
from the most technical to
the least technical child.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.510
So I would write a chapter,
and I would give it

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.500
to my youngest child, who was
16 when we started this process.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.160
And when he got
to the point where

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.100
that was sort of
a working chapter,

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.300
then I would pass it
on to my middle child.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.020
And this process would
repeat until it made it

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.660
past my oldest
child, at which time

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.510
I would be gathering up those
chapters that had made it

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.790
through the pipeline and
sending them in batches off

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.280
to a professional editor.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.400
Because of the fact that
that editor was paid,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.070
I had an incentive to
not do that too often.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:58.450
There was an overhead
associated with the contracting.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:58.970
OK.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.640
How long did it take?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.860
We have two different kinds of
time that are relevant here.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.020
One of them is from when
I started writing anything

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.550
to when the manuscript was
handed over to the publisher.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.100
And when I did the
math, that turned out

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.480
to be a little more
than four years.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.900
That almost certainly
could have been less time.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.820
I was doing a lot of other
things along the way.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.020
But then after I turned
in the manuscript,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.820
that was about another year.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.750
And when you're an author
and you've written this book,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.591
you sort of think, how hard can
it be to get this book done?

00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:41.090
But I don't think
that it's actually

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.890
within your power to do very
much about that amount of time.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.000
I did have an agent.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.920
And so a lot of people
ask me the question,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.110
how did I find an agent?

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.540
And initially, I didn't
think I would need an agent.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.460
I didn't think I
wanted an agent.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:01.130
I did due diligence of going to
my MIT colleagues and saying,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.080
you published books recently.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.350
What would be your advice to me
if I was trying to write a book

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.670
and publish it?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.220
And they pretty
consistently said

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.670
that they would recommend
self-publishing.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.210
And I thought, that's
interesting, good to know.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.000
And I think that their
advice was correct.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.025
But it required some
additional context

00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:24.350
that I didn't
appreciate at the time.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.900
I think that the
right advice is,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.580
self-publishing
is the right thing

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.090
to do if you have
already published a book.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.790
I think that-- it's
very surprising.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.360
But it's hard to really know--

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.040
despite all the
resources out there,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.080
it's hard to know what
it takes to produce

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.520
a book if you're doing it
all for the first time.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.740
I think that I'd be much more--

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.410
I'm not particularly inclined
to self-publish anymore.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.300
But I think it
would be much easier

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.560
for me to do so, having made
it through the process once.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.740
So as I say, I thought I
was going to self-publish.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.810
I just write and
write and write.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.810
I wind up with a
substantial manuscript.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.570
But I'm at the point where
I'm kind of tired of dealing

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.290
with this stuff.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.330
And the things that
I thought I could

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.100
have done in terms of producing
and distributing this book

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.270
are seeming less appealing.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.780
And so it seems like it would
be a good idea to get an agent

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.300
and see whether it's
possible to sell this book.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.800
OK.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.370
So one of the things that
you can do that's quite nice

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.040
is you can purchase
access to an agent.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.740
The usual way that one
gets an agent is one

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.990
just sends letters to the
agents that the agents then

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.750
get in vast volumes and
somehow sift through.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.390
But there are these
charitable settings

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.700
in which it's possible
to basically buy

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:51.710
some of an agent's time and
have them tell you either

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.620
that your book is
kind of appealing

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.260
or that it has no appeal
whatsoever and why.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.970
And I thought this was probably
going to be worthwhile.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.410
And I did get a positive
reaction in this context.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.617
So we started working together.

00:31:04.617 --> 00:31:06.950
But I did want to note, this
is not the conventional way

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.020
that you get an agent.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.450
When I say that I got
a positive reaction,

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.300
this is the report that I got
back at our first meeting.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.680
And there's kinds of nice
things in here about,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.410
does the idea of the
book come through?

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:22.310
Yes.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.050
Is the story
sufficiently described?

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.527
Yes.

00:31:25.527 --> 00:31:27.860
Are the qualifications and
platform of the author clear?

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.540
Yes.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.100
Is the font and
length appropriate?

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.610
Yes.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.410
But then we get on to things--
oh, and there's this verdict,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.410
would you have taken it?

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.300
Absolutely, right up my alley.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.512
Ooh, that's very nice.

00:31:40.512 --> 00:31:41.970
But then we have
these things like,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.450
does first paragraph make
me want to keep reading?

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.180
No.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.180
Does it feel like
this excerpt starts

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.690
in a logical and
compelling place?

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.180
No.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.400
So there was still a
lot of work to do here.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.990
I did want to put in a
word about Grub Street.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.180
It's a writer cooperative
here in Boston.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.330
There are writer cooperatives
like it in other cities.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.160
They were the sponsor
of Manuscript Mart.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.960
They also do lots of
classes and workshops.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.750
They were very
helpful to me in terms

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.540
of getting this book
developed and finished.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.282
And so I do want to
give them credit.

00:32:16.282 --> 00:32:17.990
And I also want to
give credit to my wife

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.499
for sending me there.

00:32:19.499 --> 00:32:21.290
Of course, it also got
me out of the house.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.120
So that was part of it.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.760
How did I find a publisher?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.340
Well, MIT Press
published this book.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.450
And I first had contact
with them in May 2014.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.640
And I just sent them
an email saying,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.560
I noticed that you seem to
be open to people sending you

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.990
books maybe or proposals.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.020
And so we started
having conversations.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.450
They've always been very nice,
even when they were saying no.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.400
So we might ask
the question, given

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.440
that I was talking
to MIT Press before I

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.620
was talking to an agent,
did I really need an agent?

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.840
And probably, the
answer there is no.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.962
If I just wanted to work with
MIT Press to develop the book,

00:33:03.962 --> 00:33:06.170
I probably would have been
fine to just work directly

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:06.920
with them.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.900
Lots of people do that.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.970
Yes, I did need an
agent if my goal

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.850
was to explore all the
options for the book

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.520
and to be confident that
MIT Press was really

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.896
the right choice for
publishing the book, as opposed

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:20.270
to just kind of
being the default

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.560
one that was the first
one that I sent email to.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.770
So writing and publishing--
this is the conventional rules

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.880
about what you do.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.930
You write a proposal.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.250
You get an agent.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.490
You sell a book, at which point
you get half your advance.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.190
You live off of your
advance to write the book.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.720
You deliver the
book, at which point

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.520
you get the other
half of your advance,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.210
and you pay off your debts.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.810
The book is produced.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.360
And then you market it.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.510
You market the book.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.200
OK.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.010
That's not what I did.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.910
I just wanted to note that this
is what you're supposed to do,

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.950
in case anyone is interested
in doing it that way.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:01.140
What I did was to write
the book, get an agent,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.350
write a proposal with
the agent, sell the book,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.449
shorten the book,
deliver the book,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:12.090
and then produce the book, and,
of course, market the book.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:12.630
OK.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.630
So I added a step here.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.030
In addition to doing
things out of sequence,

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.639
I added "shorten book."

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.320
So why am I talking about that?

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.750
Well, this was the book
as I envisioned it when

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.000
I was in self-publishing mode.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.836
This was an old title.

00:34:27.836 --> 00:34:30.210
I don't know if anyone was
paying close enough attention,

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:35.060
but there was yet another
title on the agent's report.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.790
The book has had a number
of different identities.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.639
This book was 170,000 words.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.110
And I'm not very
good at thinking

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.730
in terms of word count.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.460
But it turns out that that's
certainly more than 600 pages.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.460
And so that's a pretty
daunting kind of book

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.330
to think about a
beginner, a person who

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.300
wants to learn something
about this, dealing with.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.880
So that wasn't going to work.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.580
The book as published
is 100,000 words.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.600
And that turns out to
translate into 368 pages.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.700
And I think it's
probably about as big

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.970
as it could be and
still be appealing

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.080
for its intended audience.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.530
So one of the
challenges is, I did

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.560
want it to be something
that was accessible.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.840
I did want it to be a
modest kind of book.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.630
I also wanted it to be an
illustrated book, which it is.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.550
It's tough to do
all those things

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.310
and still keep the
page count down.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.660
Was it worthwhile?

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.160
Yeah.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.930
Overall, it's been great.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.190
And I've sort of declared
myself a success in this space

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.100
ever since 2016, because
my original goal was just

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.170
to write a book
for the children.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.880
And everything since then has
been a bonus and mostly fun.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.020
I also came to realize
recently that it wasn't

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.370
a part of what I set out to do.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.670
But I think that
along the way, I've

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.460
also had a chance to do some
things that I didn't get

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.670
to do in the startup
space in the sense

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.460
that I've never been a
founder, and I've never

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.430
been the key person shipping
some particular product.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.510
But in this case, I am the
founder of this startup.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.130
I am the person who
shipped this product.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:18.030
And so that's a nice experience.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.090
So that's the book.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.740
That's the process.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.490
I'd be very happy to
take your questions.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.420
AUDIENCE: All the stuff
that got left out,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.240
are you going to have a
director's cut or something?

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.849
Can I buy the extended Blu-ray?

00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:37.640
MARK STUART DAY: One
way I think about that

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:44.960
is to say that I have the
material for a sequel,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.220
or I have material
for smaller packages.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.730
Some of the stuff that
wound up getting cut

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.430
probably would work well as
essential knowledge books.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.762
So that's another possibility.

00:36:59.762 --> 00:37:00.680
Yeah?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.970
AUDIENCE: You have a website
listed on one of those pages.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.450
Do you think about putting them
as blog posts on the website?

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.020
MARK STUART DAY: You mean the
things that I had to cut out?

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.324
MARK STUART DAY: Yes.

00:37:13.324 --> 00:37:16.760
No, I think that that is
another likely destination.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.390
I have a lot of
material, not just

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.120
because of what I cut out of
the book, but because I do still

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.500
have this writing routine.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.430
And so pretty much
every day, I'm

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.820
writing whatever things
cross my fool mind that day.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.450
And so some of the
time that's technical.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.160
And some of the time it isn't.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.950
But it does mean that
there is a lot of stuff

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.410
for blog posts and
possibly future books.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.490
So I just want to ask,
throughout the process

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.534
of writing the book and getting
the book published, which part

00:37:49.534 --> 00:37:50.700
do you think is the hardest?

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.610
Like, what's your
biggest challenge?

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.864
And which part is the most
fun or the most enjoyable?

00:37:56.864 --> 00:37:59.030
MARK STUART DAY: The writing
itself, especially when

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.670
the writing is going
well, is a lot of fun,

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.190
and especially when
you're convinced

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.777
that the fact that
you're writing well

00:38:06.777 --> 00:38:08.360
and that it feels
good means that it's

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.800
going to turn effortlessly
into some fabulous book.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.960
I think that the
parts that are hard--

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.150
cutting the stuff that you've
written so as to get down

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.870
to a word count
turns out to be hard,

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.740
if you're going to
get it to be coherent.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.910
Doing the index
was simultaneously

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:37.850
fascinating and excruciating.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.190
It's a fascinating
process because you're

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.550
working with the final
text of your book.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.490
And what you're trying
to do is to collect

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.700
all of the conceptually
related things, wherever

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.010
they are scattered in the book.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.900
And what you
discover is it's kind

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.970
of like an X-ray of your book.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.702
You wind up realizing, oh, I
talked about this thing there,

00:38:58.702 --> 00:39:00.910
and I also talked about it
here, but unfortunately, I

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.000
used different words
in the two places.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.620
And so you learn a lot
about the way you write.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.490
But it's unfortunately too late
for you to do anything about it

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.470
because you're doing it
on the final version.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:16.130
And they're very clear
with you that you do not

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.140
get to rewrite your
book at this phase.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.124
So that also-- my wife will
tell you that the period of time

00:39:24.124 --> 00:39:25.790
when I was doing the
index, I would just

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.860
keep coming down and
saying, oh, I'm almost done,

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.660
I'm almost done.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.290
I would do that for
weeks at a time.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.737
[LAUGHING]

00:39:33.737 --> 00:39:35.945
AUDIENCE: So you have two
interesting ranges in there

00:39:35.945 --> 00:39:37.922
of how long it took
you to write the book.

00:39:37.922 --> 00:39:39.380
But something you
didn't mention is

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.300
how long it took you to
acquire the knowledge

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.100
to write the book.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.100
And that's from
the very beginning

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.070
up until the ending, how
much time you invested

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.236
during the writing to acquire
the knowledge that you

00:39:48.236 --> 00:39:49.910
lacked when you started.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.890
MARK STUART DAY: So
that's a good question.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.830
One way we could
talk about this is

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.310
to say that the things
that I was writing about

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.040
are things that I
have effectively

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.250
learned over 30-plus years.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.070
On the other hand,
there were also

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:11.450
some things where I
needed to go and learn

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:15.950
a specific piece of
technology just for the book.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:20.030
Now, one example of this
was that I didn't really

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.380
understand some details
of how Wi-Fi works.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.910
And I thought, that seems
like it would be a good thing

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:26.600
to include.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.530
Now it turns out that that wound
up on the cutting room floor

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.180
when I had to cut
the book down again.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.810
So it was a case where
I learned something

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.280
in a kind of a tactical mode.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.770
And I produced an explanation
of it that I liked,

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.720
and then I had to
throw it away again.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.700
But most of it, I
think, came down

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:50.060
to I had learned a
lot of this stuff

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.670
across the different
kinds of things I've done

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.860
in industry and in academia.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.200
And really, the main
work of writing it,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.010
other than the
construction of the text,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.070
was to be thinking about
those things and saying,

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:08.600
I know how I would explain
those to a technical person,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.820
but I have to think
about it differently.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.532
I can't just fall back
on those kinds of things.

00:41:13.532 --> 00:41:14.990
I'm going to have
to find some kind

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.290
of a metaphor, some kind of
an example, some kind of way

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.700
of tackling it.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.270
And so I think that was a lot
of the intellectual process

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:27.440
of doing the book, was kind
of finding ways of saying,

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.480
I've got something
interesting technical to say,

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.140
but I can't use the ways that
people typically talk about it.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.180
AUDIENCE: So what did you
leave out, other than Wi-Fi?

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.950
MARK STUART DAY:
Atomic transactions

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.600
I had to leave out pretty--

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.670
there's a mention
of them, but it's

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.530
sort of a hand-wave
that says, they

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.440
solve all kinds of problems.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.710
I had to leave out
synchronizer failure--

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.740
the sort of boundary between the
analog and the digital world,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.150
even though there are
some fascinating things

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.900
that happen there.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.460
I have lots of slightly
dubious musings

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.080
about the nature of time.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.247
And so those all
wound up on the floor.

00:42:11.247 --> 00:42:13.580
I think that atomic transaction
was probably the biggest

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.220
piece that I had to take out.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.040
AUDIENCE: So were you
worried that calling

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:23.780
the book "Bits to Bitcoin"
would lead people to focus more

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.605
on the Bitcoin than the bits?

00:42:25.605 --> 00:42:26.480
MARK STUART DAY: Yes.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.720
Well, that's still an
ongoing challenge for me,

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.210
in terms of the marketing.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.050
On the one hand, it's nice
to have a title that attracts

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.820
attention, because it's timely.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.770
On the other hand,
there is a little bit

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:44.960
of the possibility of either
disappointing the reader

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.960
because they expect it to be all
about Bitcoin or of misleading

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.060
the reader that they--

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.770
so yeah, the title is
sometimes a bit of a challenge.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.470
But as you can see
from those other ones,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.620
like "Unstoppable Time
Traveling Phantoms" or "Machines

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.127
Behind the Curtain,"
it's much improved.

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:10.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:11.520
AUDIENCE: Thank the speaker.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:11.820
MARK STUART DAY: Great.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.420
Thank you all.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.770
[APPLAUSE]
