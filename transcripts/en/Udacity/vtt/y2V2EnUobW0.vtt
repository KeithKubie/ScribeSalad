00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If this is the position, we see that position

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
always increases with time.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There is no way that the derivative can be negative,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that the rate of change can be negative.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Otherwise, the position would have to go down

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if that was the case, so we can rule out the red version.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now let's look at this step, almost a step.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We need to ramp up the velocity

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and ramp down the velocity.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here, we accelerate, and here, we decelerate.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay. And this is an almost precise replica of that one,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so the same shape--it has to be the green one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It cannot be the purple one.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now for this curve,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we accelerate positively

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The velocity grows.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You see that we start with small velocity.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The velocity gets larger as we go

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
up to that point here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So acceleration has to be positive.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The rate of change of velocity has to be positive,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which rules out the green curve.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We are left with deciding whether

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the red curve is the right one or

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the purple curve is the right one.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Look at this part of the curve.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The position is decreasing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If position is decreasing,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
velocity has to be negative.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
See, we start with a velocity of almost 0,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then the velocity becomes very negative.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This is very steep.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The rate of change is very high in a negative direction,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which means that we need acceleration to the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
negative--strong negative acceleration.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It has to be this red part.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It can't be that green part.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And here, acceleration is positive again--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
--high and positive--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to turn that negative velocity

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
into a velocity of 0.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We got a positive peak in the acceleration.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And eventually, the acceleration is 0, the velocity is 0,

00:02:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the rate of change of the position is 0, so it's the red curve.
