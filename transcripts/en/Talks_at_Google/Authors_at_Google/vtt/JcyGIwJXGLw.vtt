00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.110
MALE SPEAKER: Svante Paabo got
his PhD from the University

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.600
of Uppsala Or is it Uppsala?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.060
SVANTE PAABO:
Yeah, it's Uppsala.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.393
MALE SPEAKER: Uppsala in Sweden.

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:13.230
And did four years
post-doc at Berkeley.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.770
So he's been in the
Bay Area before.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.560
He's actually the founder of
the field of ancient DNA, who

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.840
even when he was
a doctoral student

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.880
was working on sequencing
DNA from Egyptian mummies

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.030
without telling his
adviser in his spare time.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.350
But fortunately it
worked out well.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.740
And much later, any time
you read about Neanderthals

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.990
and whether they mated with
humans, where they came from,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.380
chances are it came from his
lab, the Max Planck Institute

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.540
in Leipzig, Germany.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.548
So please welcome Svante Paabo.

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:56.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.545
SVANTE PAABO: OK, so do
that afterwards if you think

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:03.320
it's-- So, yeah, what I wanted
to do though was then talk

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.730
a bit about what we can learn
about the origins of modern

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.520
humans, so the origins of the
type of humans that exist all

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.640
over the planet today,
from studying the genome

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.500
of our closest extinct
relative, the Neanderthals.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.390
And the technology and
the ability to do this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.110
have come about over 30
years of development.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.280
And the history of
how that happened

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.420
is what's described in this
book that just appeared.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.460
It discusses not
only the science,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730
but a bit how this
came about, including

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.500
the conflicts and the mistakes
I made on the way and things

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.570
like that.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.590
But I don't want to recount
here exactly what's in the book.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.830
What I'd rather do is talk a
bit about the insights that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.360
have emerged over the
years about human origins

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.520
from this work.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.420
And in the end,
a bit about where

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.080
we want to go in the future,
in the next five or 10 years

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.530
or so.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.640
But just before we start,
let me then remind you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.680
about what you
all know, I think,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.600
that our genome,
the DNA, is stored

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.590
in almost all
cells in our bodies

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.560
on these chromosomes in
the form of the famous DNA,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.550
this double helix.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.590
As you also know,
the information

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.750
is there in the
sequence, in the form

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.470
of a sequence of
these four bases,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.320
As, Ts, Cs, and whatever.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.020
I forgot [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.760
And it's there twice, so to say,
and in a complementary form.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.880
So whenever there's
an A on one strand,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.120
there's a T on the other.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.850
When there's a G there,
there's a C there.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.250
And that's really important.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.860
Because whenever a cell
divides, particularly then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.045
in the germ line when new
individuals may be formed,

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:46.660
there are enzymes that
unwind those strands,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.195
and two new strands
are synthesized

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:50.200
with the old as a template.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.880
So you get two fairly extract
copies again of the genome.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.250
But nothing is, of
course, perfect in nature.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.480
So sometimes an
error may be made.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.060
And if that ever is not
repaired quickly enough

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.550
before the cell
divides again, that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.850
will appear then as a mutation,
a new version of the DNA

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.650
sequence.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.280
So any baby that's born
as in the order of 100,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.260
200 new mutations that's
there neither in the father

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.350
nor in the mother.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.950
And we can detect the
effects of those mutations

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.990
in the population.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.350
If you compare DNA sequences
of two people in the room,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.410
we will find a difference every
1,200, 1,300 bases between us.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.070
If we add in a chimp, we
will find a difference

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.700
every 100 bases or so.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.040
So if you want to reconstruct
the history of a piece of DNA,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920
what you do is use
our best models

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.420
for how these mutations happen
and reconstruct the history

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.100
and depict it in the
form of a tree like this

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.250
normally where in this
case it's super simple.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.900
The two genome sequences go
back to a common ancestor

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.170
rather recently.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.130
And much further back is
a very common ancestor

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.970
shared with the
chimpanzees also.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.210
And as you also
know, our genome is

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.210
a bit over 3 billion base pairs.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.980
So if we compare two genomes--
either the two genomes

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.930
you carry from your two parents
or two people in the room,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.870
we have an order of
3 million differences

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.570
between two individuals.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.810
So there is quite a
lot of information

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.160
there to reconstruct
the history with.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.030
And if you do this on a global
scale, what you will find

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.440
is that in Africa you have more
variation than outside Africa.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.840
So although there are only 700
million people or something

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.780
like that living in Africa,
and almost 7 billion people

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.880
living outside Africa, we
have more genetic variation

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.930
among those Africans than
among all the non-Africans

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.750
taken as a group.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.340
And not only that,
most of the DNA

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.140
variants we find
outside Africa, we

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.730
find closely related
forms also inside Africa.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.980
But in addition, then,
there is a component

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.100
of the variation in
Africa that's not outside.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.130
So the interpretation
of that is then

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.820
that modern humans
evolved, emerged in Africa,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.690
accumulated variation there,
and a part of that variation

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.090
went out and colonized
the rest of the world.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.360
And by genetic tricks, you can
also figure out approximately

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.390
when this happened by
looking at how big chunks,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.280
over how big distances
are things associated

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.380
on the chromosome
and things like that.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.770
And you find that
that's fairly recently,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.720
in the order of 100,000
years or even a bit less

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.960
do people start
expanding out of Africa.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.100
So this is the origin of
this recent African origin

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.180
model of modern humans.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.330
But there is, of course,
a problem with that.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.160
And that is that we
know from finding bones

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.180
that there were
other forms of humans

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.590
around since a long time, since
2 million years at that time.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.220
So most famously,
there were Neanderthals

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.630
in Europe and Western Asia.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.180
In Eastern Asia,
there were other forms

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.740
of now extinct humans that
are less well described.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.340
So the big question is sort
of what happened with them?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.810
How are we related to them?

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.850
Did they contribute to us?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.060
So but to study
their DNA, you would

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.100
have to go back in
the bones, of course.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.440
And that, of course,
is a bit difficult.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.750
And this then goes back to where
it started in the '80s, where

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.980
I started and studied
Egyptology, actually, and then

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.920
ended up in graduate school
studying molecular genetics.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.340
So I knew there were thousands
and thousands of mummies

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.020
of animals and humans around
that look very well preserved.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.660
I thought perhaps there's
DNA preserved in them

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.350
and started looking in
the microscope at tissues

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.790
and such remains.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.640
And that turned out to
the very frustrating.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.580
So this is a muscle from
a present-day person.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.470
You see the muscle fibers.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.490
You see these black dots, which
are the cell nuclei, where

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.490
the genome is stored.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.209
And this is a muscle from
a 2,000-year-old mummy,

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:10.750
much like the one
we looked at there.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.470
So you barely see there
are muscle fibers there.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.070
You see no cell nuclei.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.690
There's no DNA preserved

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.100
But it's not always
that depressing to look

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.330
at these things.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.850
So as also described
in the book,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.990
I'll have at that time in
the '80s lived in Sweden.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.600
So you had rather
good connections

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.870
to communist countries.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.630
We were able to get
mummies from East Berlin.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.840
And one of the mummies there,
this 2,400-year-old child,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.020
you could in the basal levels
of the skin see some things that

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.562
looked like cell nuclei.

00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:48.940
You could actually stain
it and show DNA is there,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.110
and go on to extract the DNA,
replicate it in bacteria,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.350
and show that some of
it came from human.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.700
So in hindsight, I really
believe this microscopy

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.530
that the cell
nuclei here contain

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.810
DNA that's for sure
DNA from that mummy.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.710
The DNA I replicated
and published

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.710
is for sure a contamination.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.190
It's for sure DNA from
[INAUDIBLE] Berlin

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.870
or something like that.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.800
Because what has
since become clear

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.040
is that there's
generally very little DNA

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.400
preserved in such remains.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.020
It's degraded and
chemically modified.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.555
So whereas, say, from
a gram of tissues,

00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:31.430
you might extract a micro gram
of DNA from a blood sample

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.490
or from a present-day
tissue, for example,

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.080
a 10,000-fold to a million-fold
less in such old remains.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.900
And the vast majority
of the DNA here

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.810
comes from bacteria and things
that have grown in the tissues

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.282
since it died.

00:08:46.282 --> 00:08:49.030
So if you have tiny
amounts of contamination

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.680
from present-day
humans here-- so, say,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.650
skin fragments in a room like
this where people are around,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.820
dust particles or to big
extent, skin fragments that

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.400
do contain a lot of DNA.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.530
So if such comes into
present-day experiment,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.780
it will be swamped
out by the billions

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.100
of copies of the
modern DNA there.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.980
But in these
ancient experiments,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.980
if a dust particle
lands, it can easily

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.690
overwhelm the whole experiment.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.680
So it's also described
there how we over the years

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.300
become more and more
paranoid about this

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.420
until when we today now work
in spacesuit-like things

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.310
in rooms with high
pressure and filtered

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.670
air so dust doesn't get in,
pretty much like a chip factory

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.530
or something like that, to avoid
contaminating the experiments.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.880
Also focused a lot on
not the nuclear genome

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.500
that comes from
the moms and dads,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.130
but the tiny part of the
genome outside the cell

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.195
nuclei that comes
only from the mother,

00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:51.500
the mitochondrial genome
because there are many,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.420
many copies of it
per cell, so a bigger

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.920
chance that a
little bit survives.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.160
And worked ourselves
back in time.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.310
So we started when I
was here at Berkeley.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.970
There There were actually
zoological collections.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.210
At the museum at the university
there, were these kangaroo rats

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.370
from the Mohave Desert,
that had been collected 70,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.360
80 years ago.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.570
So we went out and set
traps with the field maps

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.210
from that time and
collected rats now,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.030
and could follow the populations
then over 70, 80 years.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.290
To a bit older,
extinct animals--

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.160
marsupials wolves, say,
that became extinct

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.600
about 100 years ago from
over-hunting in Australia,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.570
or things that disappeared
in the last glaciation.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.235
So these giant ground
sloths, for example,

00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:42.600
were in the North and
South America, or mammoths

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.040
and mastodons and
things like that.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.590
But our big interest
was, really, Neanderthals

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.700
as our closest relatives.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.770
And so Neanderthals appear
300,000, 400,000 years ago,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.380
and then exist in
Europe and Western Asia

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.600
until they become extinct
something like 30,000 years

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.450
ago in connection with that
present-day humans appear.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.280
So a big question is
then what happened

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.970
when modern humans
encountered these guys?

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.400
And there are two
ideas about this

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.720
that one was fighting about in
paleontology, vicious fights

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.690
that paleontologists can
have over 30 years, where

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.300
one idea is modern humans
come out of Africa,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.130
meet these guys in
Europe and Asia,

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.610
and replace them with
no mixture whatsoever.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.660
That there's no contribution
from Neanderthals to Europeans

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.630
today, for example.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.900
And the other idea is that
when modern humans come

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.970
to these regions, they do
eventually replace this forms,

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.510
but they do mix with them.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.470
So that Neanderthals
would have contributed

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.340
genetically to present-day
Europeans and these other forms

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.680
in Asia, the present-day Asians.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.030
So you can see this as a sliding
scale from total replacement,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.530
0% contribution from
these earlier guys,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.180
to a sliding scale to
more and more of that.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.130
So our first chance to
test this came in '96

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.240
when after a lot of
intrigues we got access

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.970
to this specimen,
which is a Neanderthal,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.755
but it's not just
any Neanderthal.

00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:28.810
It's the Neanderthal that was
found in 1856 in the Neander

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.400
Valley and gave its name
to this group of humans.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.060
And we were really
lucky, I think,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.900
that the first
Neanderthal we studied

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.670
was really the
type specimen that

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.640
gave its name to these guys.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.270
Because whatever
Neanderthal we since

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.980
have studied, that there's
always some paleontologist who

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.960
comes and say, ah, it's
a little too gracile,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.950
a little too robust.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.800
It's not quite typical.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.390
But if this is
not a Neanderthal,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.750
then Neanderthals don't exist.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.710
So with the technology
at the time,

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.975
we retrieved a part of
that mitochondrial genome

00:13:02.975 --> 00:13:06.930
with great effort, short little
pieces, many, many times over,

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.190
looking for the things that
were consistently there,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.910
and then reconstructed
such a phylogenetic tree

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.880
for the mitochondrial DNA then,
this tiny part of the genome.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.700
And what we saw was
what was already known,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.220
that all mitochondrial
DNA of everybody

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.900
living today go back
100,000, 200,000 years,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.370
to a common ancestor of all the
mitochondria that exist today.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.840
But Neanderthal
mitochondrial DNA

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.550
go much further back to
a common ancestor, half

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.176
a million years or so.

00:13:37.176 --> 00:13:40.710
So they look quite different
in their mitochondrial genome.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.290
So in this sliding scale of
things, it's really here.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.595
There are no humans
today that run around

00:13:46.595 --> 00:13:48.870
with a Neanderthal
mitochondrial genome.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.670
It's total replacement,
no contribution.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.270
So that was then the picture
for this mitochondrial genome.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.180
And we couldn't get
to the nuclear genome.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.980
And I think I'm on the
published record eight years ago

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.370
or something like that
of saying we will never

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.470
see the nuclear genome
of Neanderthals.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.310
And you should, of course,
never make negative predictions

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.800
like that because
you're generally

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.050
overtaken by history and
by technology, actually.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.800
And in this case, what
I didn't anticipate

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.980
was really high
throughput DNA sequencing

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.130
that came around in the
early 2000s, the ability

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.750
to sequence millions
of DNA molecules

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.850
really rapidly
and inexpensively.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.970
So instead of trying to find
some little piece you're

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.000
particularly interested
in, you could simply

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.060
extract all the DNA from
such a fossil sequence,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.010
all the molecules
you time in there,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.090
make your little data bank,
and start comparing it

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.610
to the human genome that
had then become sequenced,

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.620
and say what has similarity
to the human genome that

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.260
presumably comes
from the Neanderthal.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.230
So the first place
for this work was

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.580
from a cave site in southern
Europe, in Croatia, this place,

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.920
from this bone that's
38,000 years old,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.730
from this little fragment
of the bone here.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.970
And the first
thing you then find

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.900
is that the fragments
of DNA are really small.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.900
So whereas from present,
from a blood sample from me,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.820
you would extract
things that are 10,000,

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.620
20,000 base pairs
long, here it's

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.740
really 50, 60 base pairs,
tiny little fragments.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.580
And the vast majority
of the DNA doesn't

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.360
come from the
Neanderthal at all,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.420
but from bacteria and fungi
that colonized the bone when

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.310
it was lying there in the
sediments in the cave.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.120
So our very best
Neanderthals have

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.100
sampling like 3%,
3.5% [INAUDIBLE] DNA.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.930
So we then managed to raise
some money to over five years

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.750
work a lot on the technology
from which we can extract

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.900
the DNA from the bone and
manipulate it into a form

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.620
that you can feed into
the sequencing machines.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.930
And we have gotten a lot
more efficient than that,

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.360
something like 500-fold more
efficient over this time.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.900
And the machines have also
gotten better in how much

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.470
they can sequence.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.450
We looked through a lot of
different Neanderthal sites

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:24.060
and bones to find the ones
with the most DNA in them.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.060
And it described a
lot of little problems

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.800
in running a group of
different forms of expertise

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.370
to actually get this done.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.920
We identified then three bones
that were particularly good

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.460
that we used for this and
sequenced a bit over a billion

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.970
DNA fragments from these
bones, which at the time

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.240
was quite a lot, vast
majority, of course, not

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.370
from the Neanderthal, as
I said, but from bacteria.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.920
But we could then
match the ones that

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.360
had similarity to
the human genome

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.540
with computer programs we
developed to the human genome,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.995
taking various types of errors
that occur in these sequences

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:04.569
and so on into account.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:09.180
And we ended up with a first
view or the Neanderthal genome

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.730
in 2010, then where we had
seen a little over half

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.630
of the genome at least
once from these fragments.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.109
So we could begin
asking questions.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:24.636
And that then involved a lot
of population-- yes, please?

00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:26.510
AUDIENCE: With fragments
just being 20 bases,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.560
are they unique
enough to figure out

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.390
whether something is
the same gene or--

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.140
SVANTE PAABO: Yes.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.690
AUDIENCE: Or could
the Neanderthals have

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.210
had the genes which
are completely

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.989
different from humans
but which are--

00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:38.780
SVANTE PAABO: Yeah.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.080
So first of all, if
Neanderthals had something

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.300
that at all doesn't exist
in the human genome today,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.000
we would be totally blind to it.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.710
But that is probably very
little such material there.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.890
If you compare to
the apes for example,

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.940
there's hardly any such things.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.630
But a big, big challenge is
this matching of these fragments

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.040
because, yes, we have
a [INAUDIBLE] for 30.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.200
We don't regard
anything below 30.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.320
But also there is
an issue about we

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.490
have a vast majority
of bacterial DNA

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.520
that can have spurious
similarity to places

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.180
in the human genome.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.510
We certainly
mis-map some things.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.280
But, yes, so that this
one of the big things,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.970
is actually an
informatics problem here.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.800
But so we then involved a
lot more population genetics,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.477
modeling people.

00:18:37.477 --> 00:18:39.810
Particular, I should mention
Monty Slatkin and his group

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.430
at UC-Berkeley, and David
Reich and Nick Patterson

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.350
at the Broad
Institute in Boston,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.230
to analyze these genomes.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.660
And one of the first
questions was, of course,

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.325
what happened when modern
humans came out of Africa

00:18:53.325 --> 00:18:54.200
and met Neanderthals?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.540
Did one mix or not?

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.750
And we addressed that
in many different ways.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.260
But one way, the
most intuitive one,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.870
is to say, well, if there was a
contribution from Neanderthals

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.450
to present-day people in
Europe, we would, of course,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.740
expect Europeans today to
share more genetic variance

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.600
with Neanderthals
than people in Africa,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.350
where there have never
been Neanderthals.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.680
So they couldn't have
contributed there.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.700
So this is this
idea, again, saying

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.310
if there's no
mixture whatsoever,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.540
then the Neanderthal is just
as far from people in Africa

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.990
as people in Europe.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.975
If there is a contribution,
on average Neanderthals

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:38.960
were more similar to Europeans
that to people in Africa.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.820
So we then had the
Neanderthal genome.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.050
And we needed to compare
to present-day genomes

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.460
and look for small signals.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.690
We were, of course,
very scared of errors

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.110
in the sequencing or
differences in ever profiles

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.720
in different genomes.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.060
So we went out to sequence
five genomes total

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.280
in parallel from
present-day people

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.520
ourselves to know we
had the same error

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.320
profiles in them all.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.570
So wanted one European
person to ask.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.220
Of course, the archetypal
European person

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.490
is someone from France.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.890
We sequenced a French person.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.930
We sequenced two people
from Africa, one for China,

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.180
and one from Papua New Guinea.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.110
And then we did a
very simple analysis.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.830
So we had to test
this first, say

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.600
we compare the two present-day
people to Africans,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.420
then find all the places where
they differ in their genome.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.170
And then we [INAUDIBLE]
for the Neanderthal.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.040
How often does it match one
African and the other African?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.920
Since Neanderthals had
never been in Africa,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.970
there is no reason
for Neanderthal

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.660
to be more close to one
African than another African.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.960
It should be equally distant.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.220
And indeed,
statistically speaking,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.970
it's 50/50 of 99,000 or
100,000 matches there.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.310
When we do this with
the European person

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:59.670
and African person, then we
found, to my surprise actually,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.270
statistically significantly
more matching to the European

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.610
than the African individual.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.770
Even more surprising was that
in China relative to Africa,

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.920
we again find it.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.960
And in Papua New Guinea, again.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.490
So this really surprised me.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.880
I was biased after the
mitochondrial genome was saying

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.380
that there had been
no contribution.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.350
But if there was one,
I would, of course,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.350
expect it where Neanderthals
had existed in Europe.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.400
But we found it in China, where
most people agree Neanderthals

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.810
had never been, and in Papua
New Guinea where everyone

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.690
agrees Neanderthals
had never been.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.000
So the model we then ended
up suggesting that's since

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.270
been borne out by other
work is to suggest

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.460
that when modern humans
came out of Africa,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.550
they presumably passed
by the Middle East.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.560
And we know that in the Middle
East, there were Neanderthals.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.790
So if these early modern
humans mixed with Neanderthals

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.150
and then became the ancestors
of everybody outside Africa,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.330
they can sort of carry with
them out into the world

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.280
this Neanderthal
contribution also to regions

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.300
where Neanderthals never existed
to the extent that 1% to 2%

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.320
of the genome of
the DNA of people

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.020
in this part of the world
come from Neanderthals today.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.300
Why didn't we find any
mitochondrial contribution

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.990
when we now see it in
the nuclear genome?

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.820
I think the simplest,
boring answer

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.630
is that it can be
simply by chance.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.270
The mitochondrial genome
is inherited as one unit.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.870
And it can just be
lost [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.430
But it is, of course, also true
that the mitochondria genome

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.400
is maternal inherited.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.710
So we get it from our mothers
and not from the fathers.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.110
So if it was particularly
Neanderthal men who contributed

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.630
to the modern
human gene pool, it

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.020
would also bias against
mitochondrial DNA.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.290
And, of course, you can say
even by normal consideration,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.910
saying if you have hybrids,
you would, of course, expect

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.787
the babies to stay
with their mothers.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.010
And we know that these
individuals contributed

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.975
stayed in the modern human
population because they in turn

00:23:11.975 --> 00:23:15.590
had kids and contributed
to people today.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.610
So maybe we're
particularly picking up

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.870
the cases where the
mother was modern human

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.210
and the father
was a Neanderthal.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.120
But both are possible.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.290
So we're blind to contribution
in the other direction,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.580
into Neanderthals, simply
because we would then

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.270
have to find a
Neanderthal that lived

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.950
at the right place and
late enough in time

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.190
that its ancestors had
met the modern humans.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.010
So in reality, we
have only something

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.940
like 300 Neanderthal
individuals or so

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.600
distributed over hundreds of
thousands of years of history.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.270
So we would be extremely lucky
to find someone like that,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.770
I think.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.790
So we haven't done that
and perhaps we will never.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.900
Maybe in the Middle East
or something like that.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.270
Can we differentiate
against a scenario

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.790
where, yes, modern
humans and Neanderthals

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.555
have a more recent common
ancestor than we think?

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.440
We see this difference
between Africa and non-Africa.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.860
We see that overall in the
genome we're closely related,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.870
including all people
in Africa, of course.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.420
But people outside Africa
have this extra component

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.590
in their genome, a tiny little
part that is deeper diverged,

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.560
yet very similar to
the Neanderthal genome.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.240
So that's really the only
reasonable explanation

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.840
for that is [INAUDIBLE]
from Neanderthals.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.980
So the question is, all
three must have been fertile,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.490
and can we estimate
how fertile they were?

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.100
So the only thing we can say
about that-- that's very recent

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.297
work now-- where two groups, one
project where we were involved

00:24:56.297 --> 00:24:58.755
together with people at Broad
and another group in Seattle,

00:24:58.755 --> 00:25:03.280
have independently now designed
a pretty efficient algorithm

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.990
to go over present-day
human genomes

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.810
and say which parts actually
come from Neanderthals.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.930
And if you do that in
thousands of genomes

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.710
of present-day people, you
will find regions nowadays

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.240
where we see no Neanderthal
contribution although we would

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.620
expect it from the distribution
across the whole genome.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.600
But then there are
what we call deserts,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.250
where there suddenly is no
Neanderthal contribution.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.850
So that's interesting
because you

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.910
could imagine there are hiding
something that really defines

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.880
us as modern humans
that selected

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.470
against an account
from Neanderthals.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.700
And you could then look at
what genes are in such regions

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.366
and where are they
expressed in our body.

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:48.170
The only significant
over-expression of the genes

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.900
are in the male urine
line, in testicles.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.180
So it really suggests
that there may

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.030
have been some problem in the
hybrids with male fertility.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.860
And that's actually
a rather common thing

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.060
when closely related
species or groups mix,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.940
that the male hybrids have
problems with fertility.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.850
So horses and donkeys
and mules, the males

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.690
are infertile but the
females are fertile.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.750
So it seems to have gone
on something like that.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.000
It may have been
that the boys didn't

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.210
do well in
reproduction at least.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.216
But that's really the only
thing we can at the moment

00:26:29.216 --> 00:26:29.840
say about that.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.620
But there seems some to have
been some incompatibility there

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.070
biologically, really.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:38.530
So I can never stop myself
from also pointing out

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.740
that there has been a lot
of scientific interest

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.180
in this, lots of
follow-up things.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.040
But the public is
also very interested.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.005
And lots of people write to us.

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:50.100
And a lot of people write and
self-identify as Neanderthals

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.470
or volunteer to give us
blood samples or things.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.380
And after a while,
reading this mail,

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.030
I started seeing a pattern.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.850
And that was that it's
mainly men who write to us

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.730
and self-identify and very few
women who write and say they

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.740
are Neanderthals.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.530
And so I presented this as
my research to my group,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.660
in counting emails.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.760
And they said, ah, it's
just ascertainment.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.720
It's just because men
are more interested

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.040
in molecular genetics that
they would write to you.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.060
Women would not write to you.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.046
But that's not true.

00:27:23.046 --> 00:27:25.170
Because I went back and
looked at the emails again.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.544
And there are
plenty of women who

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:28.920
write and say they are married
to Neanderthals actually.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.260
Whereas so far not a
single man has claimed

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.020
he's married to a
Neanderthal woman.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.950
We're very interested in
other forms of humans, also.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.000
So there are lots of other
forms of Neanderthals

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.250
one finds that one
can hope to study now.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.590
And we work together
with Russian colleagues

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.890
that excavate in
Siberia and particularly

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.340
then in this cave, Denisova
Cave, in southern Russia

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.850
on the border to
China and Mongolia.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.770
And it's a very beautiful area
in this cave where they in 2008

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.800
found a tiny little bone that
they were actually extremely

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.080
skilled in realizing that
it might a human bone.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.520
So it's a fragment
of the last phalanx

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.820
of a pinkie from a little girl.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.640
So we got this bone, and
we extracted DNA from it.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.250
And we were surprised to find
it was very much endogenous DNA.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:27.530
It was like 70%, very different
from the Neanderthal samples,

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.208
the best Neanderthal samples.

00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:30.060
AUDIENCE: Meaning?

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.230
SVANTE PAABO: Meaning really
coming from this individual.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.180
And we don't know why
it's so well preserved.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.500
It's not permafrost here.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.080
It's not frozen.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.420
But we were able to sequence
the genome from this girl, too,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.310
and were quite surprised
to see that it was not

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.490
the Neanderthal and
not the modern human.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:54.110
It has a common origin with
Neanderthals, but far back,

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.740
200,000, 250,000 years back.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.170
And since then,
Neanderthals have

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.230
a long, long
independent history.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.730
So this is the first
time, actually,

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.340
that only based on the
genome sequence we define

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.830
a new group of extinct
humans that we then

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.304
called the Denisovans, after
this Denisova Cave where

00:29:14.304 --> 00:29:14.970
they were found.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.490
Just like Neanderthals
were named

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.790
after the first place
where they were found.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.470
And since then, we have
worked on new techniques

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.600
to be even more efficient in
extracting tiny amounts of DNA.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.290
So we now have a very
good genome from both.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.110
From this girl,
we have sequenced

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.330
every position many, many
times over in the genome.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.470
It's actually better
quality than most genomes

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.077
sequenced from people today.

00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:42.410
So we can begin to see, when
you have some good genomes,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.409
you can see cool things.

00:29:43.409 --> 00:29:46.430
We can, for example, see
missing mutations here.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.700
This person lived tens of
thousands of years ago.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.430
So compared to us
today, they have

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.200
experienced fewer mutations.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.290
And we can actually
measure that.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.970
So relative back to the common
ancestor with the chimp,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.050
there's a little over
1% of the mutations

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.330
that are missing here.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.850
So if we now say that's
6.5 million years ago,

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.113
we can actually date the
bone to approximately 60,000

00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:12.370
to 80,000 years ago.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.850
So it's fascinating to me.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.650
That's from a bone that's too
small to do a carbon date.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.460
When we can sequence
the genome, we

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.090
can actually now begin to
date it from the genome.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.900
There are still
caveats about this,

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.820
particularly error rates
in the present-day genomes

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.460
confuse this number.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.990
But it's certainly something
that will come in the future.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.750
We can ask, as for
the Neanderthals,

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.440
did they contribute [INAUDIBLE]
to present-day people?

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.490
And yes, they did in
Oceania, not in Siberia.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.250
So this then suggests
that they were

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.620
more widespread in
the past, I think,

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.820
that they've been also here
meeting ancestors in that area.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.730
I think it's sort of
an indication of what

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:56.840
will come in the future.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.860
This is a copy of this tiny
little bone, where we can then

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.300
get a whole genome sequence.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.245
We can date it.

00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:05.460
We can re-construct a lot about
the history of this group.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.610
But we don't know how
their skeletons looked.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.920
We don't know what
stone tools they made.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.740
And I think it's
something we'll see

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.120
a lot more in the
archaeology in the future.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.460
So we shouldn't be too long
where from this cave also

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.450
then found a little
toe bone that

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.290
turned out to be Neanderthal.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.300
So we now have a very
good Neanderthal genome

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.180
also that we'll
sequence many times over

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.930
to very high quality.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.900
One of the cool
things we find, then,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.110
is that you can, of course,
then invoke over chromosomes

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.290
and find where there are
differences between the two

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.360
genomes that this
person inherits

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.090
from their mother
and their father.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.270
And what we then find
in this Neanderthal is

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.350
that we find huge segments--
this is 19 million bases here--

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.980
where the two chromosomes
are identical.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.780
And we found much
less of those in this

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.160
than this of our
present-day people.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.910
And this, of course, means that
the patterns of this individual

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.540
were very closely related.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.480
So we can reconstruct
the relationships

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.430
that must have been.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.550
One of these four
relationships must

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.690
been for this
Neanderthal individual.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.750
The parents must have been half
sibs, or, say, grandfather,

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.070
granddaughter.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.140
Don't even ask me what
double first cousins are.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.820
I can never reconstruct it.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.770
But they were clearly
closely related.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.460
So it would be very
interesting to see

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.830
if that's a general pattern
in Neanderthals when

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.610
we get more genomes
in the future.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.900
So we have now a bit
more things there.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.890
We can actually see
how these things

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.290
are mixed with each other.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.160
Then Neanderthals
to modern humans,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.740
Denisovans to modern humans.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.310
We can see on mainland Asia
also a bit of a contribution

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.060
from Denisovans.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.510
And we can see quite
interesting a contribution

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.220
from something else,
a deeper divergence

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.890
into Denisovans, not into
Neanderthals-- probably

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:08.210
homo erectus or so in Asia.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.360
So let me accelerate
a little bit.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.700
I'll not do this.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:17.390
I want to just encounter
where we go now.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.850
So just to wrap that up.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.950
We have excluded this absolute,
no-contribution, total

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.170
replacement.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.010
But we see a bit of replacement
from these earlier forms

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.870
to present-day humans.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.590
But the big picture
is, of course,

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.230
still replacement
coming out of Africa.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.700
So just a term for this, I
suggest Leaky replacement.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.760
So the big picture
is replacement.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.190
There's a bit of contribution
from these earlier forms.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.845
And what can we now
do with these genomes?

00:33:48.845 --> 00:33:52.660
I think when we now have
high-quality from our closest

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.960
relatives, the
really cool thing is

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.950
we can focus on
these [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.650
changes here, things that we
all have in common on the planet

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:04.170
today but where the
Neanderthals and Denisovans

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.230
look like the apes.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.210
So things that appeared
in modern humans

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.179
and spread to everybody
in the last little segment

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.815
of our history.

00:34:14.815 --> 00:34:17.050
And why is that
particularly interesting?

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.270
Well, I think there
are a number of things

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.610
that changed in modern humans.

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.310
A big thing is
technology, of course.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.570
Neanderthals appeared
350,000 years ago,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.010
disappeared 30,0000 years ago.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.810
The stone tools they make in
the beginning of their history

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.280
and the end of their history
are pretty much identical.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.920
Modern humans appear,
say, 100,000 years ago.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.380
And I think we agree,
particularly at this place,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.540
for example, I think,
that technology today is

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.070
different from
100,000 years ago.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.090
So technology started changing
rapidly with modern humans

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.409
and could become
regionalized, for example.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.489
Neanderthals made
the same stone tools

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.650
wherever they were, from
Central Asia to Western Europe.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.141
With modern humans,
it changes so rapidly.

00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:01.890
So when you don't have
much communication,

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.440
technology really becomes being
different in different regions.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.040
Art that really depicts things
comes only with modern humans.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.790
And modern humans,
of course, start

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.370
spreading across
the whole globe.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.360
These other forms of humans
have lived in Africa and Eurasia

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.590
for 2 million years.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.410
They never made it to Americas,
never to Australia, never

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.230
to Madagascar in
2 million years.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.090
Modern humans
started spreading out

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.160
of the Middle East
60,000 years ago,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.230
and in those 60,000 years
come to every speck of land,

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.963
not only the big continent,
but every little island out

00:35:38.963 --> 00:35:40.570
in the Pacific.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.720
So there's actually no
evidence that Neanderthals

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.010
or the other early humans
ever spread across water

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:50.770
where you don't see
land on the other side.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.980
So they were not mad.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.340
But modern humans,
how many people

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.915
must not sail out on the Pacific
before you found Easter Island

00:35:58.915 --> 00:36:00.690
and just perished?

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.960
And we can never stop.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.060
Now we go to the moon,
and we go to Mars.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.740
So there is some craziness
there also, not only technology,

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.120
I think.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.420
So we can look in the genome
now for all of the things

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.930
that we have in
common that is not

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.380
shared with the Neanderthals.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.140
So if we take the
strict approach

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.430
and say thanks to the
best our knowledge,

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.140
100% percent of
humans have today,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.560
but Neanderthals and
apes don't have it,

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.850
then that's not a
long list of things.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.460
It's surprisingly short.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.460
It's something like 30,000
changes in the genome.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.080
So whereas I differ from
an individual in this room

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.310
by 3 million differences or so.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.880
If we say things
that we all have

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.200
in common and the
Neanderthals are difference,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.750
it's just 30,000.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.950
So you can scroll
through them in two hours

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.020
and look at them
actually in the computer.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.250
So for example,
it's just 96 changes

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.850
in proteins of amino acids.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.390
So this is a list
of all the genes

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.860
that have such differences.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.140
The dirty little
secret of genomics

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.820
is, of course, that
we're incredibly

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.000
bad at predicting what
such changes would

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.991
have for consequences.

00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:15.490
But we were, of
course, particularly

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.860
interested in things
expressed in the brain.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:22.160
And we and many others will
now start to look at that.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.430
So just to give you a
feel for this, if we just

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.220
look in different
layers of the brain

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.970
during development in
the fetus, the one area

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.680
within the red
[INAUDIBLE], we see

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.120
a significant
over-representation

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.840
of those proteins
that had differences

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.855
to the Neanderthals, is
in the proliferative zone,

00:37:41.855 --> 00:37:44.570
where the neuronal
precursor cells divide

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.972
to make neurons for our brain.

00:37:47.972 --> 00:37:51.390
And actually three
of those 87 proteins

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.360
are expressed in the spindle
and the parts of the cell that

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.630
pull the chromosomes
apart in cell division.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.130
And it's known that the plane,
how these cleavages take place

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.190
here, determine
what type of neurons

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.960
will be formed during
brain development.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.680
So these three
genes, for example,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.480
are particularly
interesting to study.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.750
And I think we and many others
will now start doing that.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.020
So just to end, then,
what we then want to study

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.330
is human-specific changes.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.570
So how will we do that?

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.630
Because it's, of
course, a problem.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.830
And no animal model, really.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.190
So there are people like
George Church at Harvard

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.680
who have suggested we
should clone Neanderthals.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:39.120
We should engineer these changes
into the modern human stem cell

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.450
and have babies born that
are essentially Neanderthals.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.630
And I think there
are many reasons

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.540
to say it's actually
both technically not

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.790
feasible in my mind.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.750
But leaving that apart,
it's ethically, of course,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.880
totally unthinkable.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.150
But what can we do?

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:59.900
I think something that will come
is, of course, the genome is

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.480
a small place, after all.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.950
3 billion bases.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.580
I already told
you that there are

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.280
200 new mutations in
each baby that is born.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.350
Just 7 billion people.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.390
So every position
in the genome that

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:16.240
can change and is
compatible with human life

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.190
exists out there
in the population.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.590
But [INAUDIBLE] low frequency.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.080
But in a future where we will
all have our genome sequenced

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.350
when we just walk into
the doctor's office, who

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.960
will have millions and
millions of DNA sequences,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.880
we'll be able to start finding
people who have back mutations

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.840
to an ancestral
state and study them.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.372
So that will become possible.

00:39:37.372 --> 00:39:40.630
You can, of course, also
engineer in these changes,

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.960
into stem cells,
and differentiate

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.110
tissues, nerve cells,
liver cells, in test tube,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:47.660
in the lab.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.330
And we and others are
starting to do that.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.580
And you can start putting
these things into mice

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.020
and start humanizing part
of the mouse brains, say,

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.020
or something like that.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.610
So just to end up, think
that I have convinced you

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.760
that if you're interested
in what makes humans unique,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.880
particularly this last
part of human history

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.510
that set us on this very
unique trajectory of spreading

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.830
across the whole globe,
coming to dominate even

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.680
parts of the
biosphere today, then

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.730
it's very useful to now
have the genomes of our very

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.250
close relative,
the Neanderthals,

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.210
but to now go on to
understand those changes.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.385
It will not be enough to
just stare at the genomes.

00:40:28.385 --> 00:40:30.960
We have to do functional work.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.360
I think one of the
most realistic ones

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.020
is actually this thing
to humanize mice.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.100
So that was it.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.980
I would be glad to
answer more questions.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.330
AUDIENCE: How much of
a sample do you use up?

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:00.760
And how much do you leave
for future technology?

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.230
SVANTE PAABO: Yeah,
so, to just test

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.885
if there is DNA preserved
that one could study,

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:11.820
we use like 50, 100 milligrams,
so very, very little, actually.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.930
But then, if there is DNA
there and one wants to go on,

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.450
then it really depends on
the preservation state.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.210
If there is very little
DNA, we would need more.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.061
But we never work with more
than half a gram or maybe up

00:41:24.061 --> 00:41:26.280
to a gram of bone material.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.010
So it's not that we use
up enormous amounts.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.340
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.840
How many individual Neanderthal
genomes do we have sequenced?

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.620
SVANTE PAABO: So we have only
one really good quality one.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.330
We have then this
low-quality one from Croatia

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.600
and one from the Caucasus
that I didn't talk about.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.710
So we have three
genome sequences.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.930
We have some exome
sequences, too.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:53.940
We just have the protein coding
parts on two more individuals.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.000
AUDIENCE: Could you use
this to create technology

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.120
for archaeologists, like
fish stains or something

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.611
to help them find
more Neanderthal DNA?

00:42:02.611 --> 00:42:03.360
SVANTE PAABO: Yes.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:09.260
So what we can do is
to take small samples

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.730
and determine the
species of bone

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.530
where don't know what it is.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.510
And we begin to do
that, the vast majority,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.790
of course, animals.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:23.281
But now and again we then
find new Neanderthal bones.

00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:24.780
And then you're in
a good situation.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.340
Because then you
can really argue,

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.645
if you didn't even know
what species it is,

00:42:28.645 --> 00:42:31.100
it can't be very valuable
to you, this bone.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.210
You should give it to me.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.700
AUDIENCE: Yes, have there
been any specific interesting

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.973
insights about the
X or Y chromosomes

00:42:39.973 --> 00:42:42.790
of Neanderthals
compared to ours?

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.350
SVANTE PAABO: Very curiously,
these are female individuals

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:57.640
so far, we have happened to
hit in those three individuals.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.650
So in the X chromosome, we
see very little contribution

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.790
from Neanderthals.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:07.420
It's probably again
to present-day people.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.810
So it's almost like a
desert, the whole chromosome,

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.670
which is probably also
compatible with that the men

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.280
had particular problems.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:22.050
Of course, there are
extra, many genes on the X

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.380
that has to do
with reproduction.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.105
And males are, of course,
slaves to their X chromosome,

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:27.960
if you like.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.230
Men have only one X chromosome.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.420
So if they get bad alleles,
they are in trouble.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.820
Whereas females have two
chances also on the X.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.430
So it's probably again
a reflection of that

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.640
the men may have had a
problem in the hybrids.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.344
That's the only thing at the
moment we can say about that,

00:43:45.344 --> 00:43:46.630
I think.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.840
AUDIENCE: The contaminant DNA
that you found in the samples,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.960
was that contemporaneous with
the death of the individual?

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.340
SVANTE PAABO: The bacteria
that are there, we don't really

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.970
know.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:07.330
There are typical chemical
modifications of the old DNA.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:11.060
And in some specimens, most of
the bacteria have such things.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.040
So they are at least
thousands of years old.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.750
But we don't know
how much of that

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:20.735
goes back to really 60,000
years ago and how much can be--

00:44:20.735 --> 00:44:22.110
AUDIENCE: Presumably
you couldn't

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.300
look at the gut micro
biota because that

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.470
would have been completely
eroded away, not

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:29.470
in the skeleton?

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.140
SVANTE PAABO: I
would think so, yes.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.120
But yes, it's an
interesting question.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.320
And we've talked about studying
the bacteria from the soil you

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.010
just outside the bone and inside
the bone, and comparing that

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.880
and see if one can
fish out something

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.410
AUDIENCE: So since the
DNA or the bone fragments

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.750
were found in Europe,
how do you know

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:54.844
that the contamination is
not from European humans?

00:44:54.844 --> 00:44:56.010
How do you control for that?

00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:00.692
SVANTE PAABO: That add
mixture signal, yes.

00:45:00.692 --> 00:45:04.330
So I mean, there are
a lot more analysis

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:09.880
than what I present here
that really indicate that.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.460
For example, if you look
in the present-day humans,

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.000
in the fragments
that are particularly

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.836
close to the Neanderthal,
say, in an individual, in me,

00:45:22.836 --> 00:45:25.230
those fragments are
also particularly

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.040
different from everyone
else in Europe.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.840
So if you just
plot, say, fragments

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.790
where I'm closer and closer
to Neanderthal, most of that

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.740
is simply due to that
these are regions

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.560
of the genome that
change slowly.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.211
But then I also get closer
and closer to other Europeans

00:45:41.211 --> 00:45:41.710
today.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.580
These are assay regions
that change slowly.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.260
But when I get really close
to the Neanderthal, then

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.010
suddenly I'm more different
from everyone else.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.290
So that's another
line of evidence

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:56.104
to say that these are really
things from the Neanderthal.

00:45:56.104 --> 00:45:58.020
MALE SPEAKER: Let's thank
him for coming here.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:05.124
[APPLAUSE]
