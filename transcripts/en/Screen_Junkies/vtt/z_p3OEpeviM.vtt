00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.560
From Marvel and James Gunn,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.980
the director and studio who surprised everyone
with Guardians of The Galaxy.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.380
Comes a cool looking, super fun,
laugh out loud.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.940
But ultimately kind of forgettable sequel.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.900
What? It's still better than
all the other Marvel part twos.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.600
Except for Winter Soldier.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.880
"Is that better?"

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.420
Blast off again with Marvel's Space Avengers. A team of misfits
who learned how to work together in their first movie.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.660
Then turn back an A-hole
so they can learn it all over again.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.980
"You're like a professional
assh*le or what?"

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.860
In this playful action comedy
where the heroes never really get hurt.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.760
"(Drax grunting)"

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.080
The Danger never really feels
that imminent.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.720
"Huh?" 
"(beeping)"

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.400
And the jokes definitely don't fall flat, but let's be honest,
They aren't as funny as the characters think they are.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.100
(laughing)

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.940
Heh, Okay, guys

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.300
(laughing continues)

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320
Yes, it's funny I know.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.760
(more laughing)

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
Scale it back a little.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.340
(More laughing? Ugh.)

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.020
Hey, let me decide when
to laugh. All right?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.340
(laughter again? Ugh.)

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.840
Ugh. Just shut up.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.040
Catch up with all your favorite heroes like...

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.440
Star-Lord, who discovers he's
the son of a God and a moron.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.520
"Well I don't know what you're talking about
but I like the way you say it."

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.520
Gamora, who teaches
the strong silent badass trope

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.160
to become a strong silent badass
with the more interesting sister.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.960
An ad for Baby Groot toys.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.840
(Chanting "Mascot!)

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.460
Rocket, whose eyes don't work...
Apparently.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.520
"Damn it.
I'm using my left eye?"

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.980
"I'm using my wrong eye again
aren't I?"

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.380
"Yeah that's how eyesight works
you stupid raccoon."

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.860
Did I miss something?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.500
Newcomer Mantis, with the power of
getting roasted by everyone.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.800
"You are horrifying to look at."

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.280
"I never thought she'd be able to do it
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be."

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.980
"(Drax gagging)"

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.560
"I'm imagining being with you physically."

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800
Including herself.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.780
"I'm certainly grateful to be ugly."

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.040
"(Mantis yelps)"

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.220
And Drax, the once tragic warrior,
who's become an aggressively dumb sex freak?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.380
"Did you make a penis?"

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.300
"I like a woman with some meat
on her bones."

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.940
"My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother."

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.060
"I have sensitive nipples."

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.480
"It would make my nether regions engorged."

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.080
"Oh god."

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.620
Look, you have a good thing going with Drax.
Don't take it too far and urkel your best character.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620
"Ow! My nipples!"

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.580
Prepare for an episode of
"My Two Dads"... in space!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.320
In a film that's so high on friends being your real family,
you'll swear you're watching a "Fast And Furious" movie.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.080
"I finally found my family!"

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.160
"I thought you already had."

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.380
"You are not friends."

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.160
"You're right. We're family."

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
"I don't have friends."

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.540
"I got family."

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.040
Space Dad One is
Ego, The Living Planet of exposition.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.160
"I call it: The Expansion"

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.900
"It is my purpose."

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.540
"Now, it is yours."

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.420
As he proves everything's better
with Kurt Russell.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.340
Making Ego the Living Planet
grounded and relatable.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.960
Until he goes full Marvel Villain and becomes a blue alien
made of sky beams who wants to rule the universe.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.240
While Space Dad Two proves that everything is better
with Michael Rooker...

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.440
As Yondu is retconned into a good guy
who just wanted to be a good pappy...

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.280
All to create maximum emotional impact when he's killed off
in the most tragic Marvel Death since...

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.060
Uhhhhhmmmm......

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.320
Nnnno?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.700
Eh. She was in her 90s so.
He came back...

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.940
He came back...

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.140
He came back...

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.360
He came back... Twice.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.860
He came back on TV.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.120
Quicksilver? Eh...

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.460
Wow. I guess it's Yondu by default.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.540
"I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!"

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.200
So get ready for a great time at the theater
as they bring back everything you loved about the first movie.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.280
The music, the slow-mo walks,
and the insane visuals.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.260
To the things you didn't think could come back,
like the laughing at the dumb name bit.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.060
"Star-Lord."

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.080
"Who?"

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.100
"Your name is... It's Taserface?!"

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.380
Rocket having someone steal
a fake body part for him.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.440
"I was just kidding about the leg.
What? No I... (chuckles) I thought it would be funny. Was it funny?"

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.120
"He's not gonna know! (laughs)
Where his eyes is! (laughs again)"

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.500
And undercutting most of the serious dramatic moments
with jokes even the emotional climax of the film.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.760
"I tried so hard!"

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.440
"To find the form that best suited you."

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.480
It's okay Marvel. We've been following these movies
for 10 years now.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.880
You can let us go without a chuckle
for 10 minutes.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.580
"Finally I get to be the father
I've always wanted to be."

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.380
"Excuse me. Gotta take a whiz."

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.960
Maybe not.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.120
"It's called a Zune. It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays."

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600
Uh oh. The Zune is from
the early 2000s.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440
I don't think Star-Lords is gonna be happy
when he finds out what happened to Rock &amp; Roll

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.100
