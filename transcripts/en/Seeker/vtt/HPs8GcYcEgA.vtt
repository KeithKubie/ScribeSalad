00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.240
If I say,"I've got this bottle of stuff that
I think you'll like, it's bacteria juice."

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240
Would you drink it?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.240
Of course not.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.980
But if I said "drink this kombucha, mother
made it…"

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.940
Yeeeahhhhhh, buddy!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.000
Healing each other is in our DNA, it seems.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.300
As far back as we have historical record,
we have mixed up elixirs and potions for every

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.300
ailment.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.700
In the Odyssey, Helen is given nepenthes pharmakon
-- which was probably opium -- to heal her

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.700
mind.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.470
Coca-cola was marketed as a cure for a hangover,
of course it had cocaine in it… so… it

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.470
probably worked.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.050
The modern version of this attempt to provide
healing might be word of mouth cure-alls,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.050
like kombucha.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.810
Kombucha tea has been popular with holistic
health proponents for decades; likely branching

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.150
from centuries-old Asian (do we know what
region in particular?) medicine.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.380
If you've never seen it before, modern kombucha
"tea" comes from a strange looking container

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.680
of brownish liquid with a blob floating in
it.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.490
It looks like something H.R. Geiger would
invent for a kids movie.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.860
And if you're thinking "dear god what IS that
thing?"

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.600
It's a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast,
or SCOBY, floating in a brew of regular old

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.610
tea and sugar.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990
The yeast eat the sugars, just like they do
in beer-making, and create alcohol and CO2,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.020
then ethanol is eaten by the bacteria and
turned into acetic acid.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.119
The final result is a vinegary, acidic, slightly
alcoholic, vaguely effervescent brew.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.271
In fact, if you leave it in there long enough,
it will become alcohol and even longer and

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:27.100
it becomes vinegar -- which if drunk like
a beverage can erode tooth enamel and cause

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.710
digestive problems and ulcers.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.710
// Science!

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.479
A 90s Newsweek piece said it allegedly "turns
grey hair black, clears up bad skin, boosts

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.439
T-cell count, and induces spiritual well-being…
and [clears up] cellulite."

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.841
Manufacturers claim it can improve "liver,
gall bladder and digestive function… and

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.770
enhance the body's normal toxin elimination
process" The thing is, there's no actual medical

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.790
evidence whatsoever that kombucha does these
things.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.640
And believe you me, science is looking.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.009
One of the major manufacturers was sued for
claiming health benefits and concealing health

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.009
risks.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.939
I found dozens of studies looking at what
is growing in that strange jar; and they found…

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.870
yeast and bacteria, depending on the source
and geographic location, the species of the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.700
microbes would vary -- not a surprise; and
that depending on the brew, the pH level -- or

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.230
acidity, could vary too.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.380
A compilation study in the Journal of Environmental
Health for the FDA laid out all the current

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.380
knowledge and found kombucha isn't harmful,
as long as you're already healthy; but that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.290
you should never drink more than 4 ounces
per day, according to the CDC.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.950
The real problem is the tendency for kombucha
drinkers to make it themselves.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.680
Similar to home brewing of any fermented beverage,
this can expose the drinkers to dangerous

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.060
levels of mold, bacteria and fungi, which
naturally live in our environment, but can

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.750
be dangerous when allowed to culture for days
at a time -- which is how kombucha works.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.820
There are NO proven scientific benefits to
drinking kombucha at all, even after decades

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.820
of searching.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.900
It doesn't seem like it would hurt you if
you bought it at a store, but it's not going

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.250
to help you much either...

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.269
Home brewing, on the other hand, IS risky.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.099
If ceramic pots are used, lead poisoning could
result, if non-sterile conditions are used,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:22.140
contamination could cause severe illness.
